method was used to estimate the model parameters, recommended by
the authors of the mgcv library (Ingrosso et al., 2023). Automatic
elimination of variables with little impact on the modeled explanatory
variable was chosen. The parameter ‘select = T’ indicated that the
smoothing parameter estimation, part of model fitting, could completely
remove the influence of a specific variable in the model. Due to the
skewed distribution of the modeled variable VWC a gamma distribution
with natural logarithm as the linking function was used for modeling.
The accuracy assessment of the developed model was performed
using the ‘yardstick’ package for R, specifically the ‘metrics’ function.
Three selected model parameters were calculated: RMSE (eq. 1), MAE
(eq. 2), and R2. MAE measures the average magnitude of errors in pre-
dictions without considering their direction. RMSE is more sensitive to
outliers as it squares residuals. R2 represents the proportion of vari-

process.

Therefore, it seems reasonable to test in the future more advanced
methods of data analysis for estimating soil moisture at the spoil heap. It
would be worthwhile in this context to test various methods of machine
learning or deep neural networks, which would perhaps allow to in-
crease the accuracy of prediction.

5. Conclusion

The study explored development spatial modeling for estimating
VWC on reclaimed spoil heap. This model is an integration of remote
sensing data (PlanetScope satellite imagery) and topographic indices.
The key findings include:

The developed predictive model was characterized by the following
values of model accuracy evaluation parameters: MAE – 4.1%; RMSE –
5.6%; R2–0.49. The value of Mean absolute error is (MAE) shows that
prediction model deviates 4.1% from actual VWC. RMSE 5.6% is slightly
higher than MAE because it squares the errors before averaging, giving
more weight to larger errors. It provides a similar interpretation to MAE
but emphasizes larger prediction errors. R2 value 0.49 shows that the
model explains 49% of the variance in the observed VWC values. This
model indicates the moderate ability of the model to capture the relation
between the explanatory variable and VWC.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no information available regarding the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. The given text does not provide any details about the use of deep learning models or their respective hyperparameters. Instead, it focuses on the methodology used to develop a predictive model using remote sensing data and topographic indices. The model was built using the'mgcv' library in R, employing automatic elimination of variables with minimal impact on the explained variable. Additionally, a gamma distribution with a natural logarithm as the linking function was utilized due to the skewed distribution of the modeled variable, Volumetric Water Content (VWC). Model accuracy was assessed using the 'yardstick' package for R, calculating three metrics: Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R^2). Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot determine the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
