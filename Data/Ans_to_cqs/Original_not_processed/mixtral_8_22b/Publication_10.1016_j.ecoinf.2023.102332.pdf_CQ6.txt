demonstrated  to  generate  high-quality  performance  with  dense  word 
vectors  and  to  produce  the  best  results  regarding  semantic  similarity 
tasks (Baroni et al., 2014). This space was created using the CBOW al-
gorithm and contains vectors for 300,000 different words, covering a 
broad variety of different topics. It was trained from a 2.8-billion-word 
corpus, a concatenation of the ukWaC corpus (web pages material from . 
uk  domain;  Baroni  et  al.,  2009),  Wikipedia,  and  the  British  National 
Corpus (BNC Consortium, 2007).

the perceptions mentioned by hikers during their outdoor experience, 
we extracted the most frequent single words (unigrams) from Wikiloc 
posts.  The  extraction  of  unigrams  consisted  of  three  steps:  text  trans-
lation, data pre-processing, and  word frequency  counting. First,  since 
the text description included five different languages (French, English, 
Dutch,  Italian,  and  Spanish),  we  translated  all  text  descriptions  into 
English  using  DeepL  (https://www.deepl.com).  Second,  data  pre- 
processing  consists  of  using  natural  language  processing  (NLP) 
methods  to  perform  automated  text  mining  in  R,  primarily  using  the 
packages  tidytext  (Silge  and  Robinson,  2017)  and  tm  (Feinerer  and 
Hornik, 2018) for tokenization, lemmatization and English stop words 
removal based on a predefined list of common English words (e.g., and, 
the). An additional set of words such as the name of the country, towns,

Word2vec  is  a  widely  known  word  embedding  technique  (e.g., 
Mikolov et al., 2013; Naili et al., 2017), and has been a successful tool for 
investigating CES from social media data (e.g., Gugulica and Burghardt, 
2023).  Word2vec  can  be  carried  out  in  two  ways:  by  creating  and 
training your own word2vec space based on two different architectures, 
namely, Skip-gram, which predicts the target word based on a nearby 
word, and Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW), which learns to predict a 
target word according to its context (Mikolov et al., 2013), or by using 
pre-trained  models (e.g.,  Baroni et al., 2014). Training a new  custom 
word2vec model requires a very large dataset, increases the computa-
tional effort, and could be biased by the geographic origin of the data. 
Therefore,  we  performed  the  semantic  analysis  using  the  pre-trained 
baroni  word2vec  model  provided  at  http://www.lingexp.uni-tuebin

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention specific preprocessing steps for training a deep learning model like normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does describe some preprocessing steps used for extracting unigrams from Wikiloc posts. These steps include translation, tokenization, lemmatization, and removal of English stop words. While these steps may not directly apply to every deep learning task, they do provide examples of how raw data might be transformed prior to being fed into a machine learning algorithm.

Translation involves converting text from one language to another, which is necessary when dealing with multilingual datasets. Tokenization breaks down sentences into individual words or tokens, while lemmatization reduces inflected forms of a word to its base form. Stop word removal eliminates commonly occurring words that do not carry significant meaning, such as 'and', 'the', etc.

These preprocessing techniques help prepare the data for further analysis but are not exhaustive. Depending on the nature of the problem and the type of data, other preprocessing steps might also be required. For instance, missing value imputation, outlier detection, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables are common practices in many machine learning tasks.
