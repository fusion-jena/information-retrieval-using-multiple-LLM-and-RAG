grass rush pasture in GMEP. However, if contextual datasets were pro-
vided, these classes could be absorbed in appropriate wetland classes in
the mapping, thus reducing discrepancies with GMEP data.

The LWHabmod was clipped with the harmonised GMEPmod squares.
Given the marginal coverage of calcareous grassland and raised bog in
GMEP, these classes were omitted leaving 15 classes to compare.
Stratified random sampling points were generated using QGIS’ ACa-
TAMa plug-in (Llano, 2023). The number of points per class was
increased by 5-fold (to 1500) based on the minimum deemed necessary
in guidelines given by (Olofsson et al., 2014; see Eq. 3) to account for
bias associated with restricted inclusion probabilities that result from
the pre-defined distribution of GMEP squares. The initial validation
label for every point was sourced from GMEPmod and every point

using EO-data in Wales (Lucas et al., 2011) also show lower accuracies
for detailed classes such as neutral grasslands and scrub.

a) Step-1: Comparing LWHabmod and GMEPmod (actual accuracies)
b) Step-2: Applying decision rules based on the peat depth, particularly
those affecting wetland/bog classes, to modify GMEPmod data labels.
c) Step-3: Applying decision rules (in addition to Step-2) based on the
Phase-1 Habitat map, and particularly those impacting on the clas-
sification of grassland, heathland, and scrub classes, to modify the
GMEPmod data labels.

These exercises were repeated for the broad habitat classes by

modifying the GMEPBHmod labels through Step-2 and Step-3.

Helpful Answer:
To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. One common technique is stratified splitting, which involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same proportion of each class or category within both sets. This ensures that the model is trained and tested on representative samples of all categories, preventing any one category from being overrepresented or underrepresented. Another technique is oversampling, where examples from minority classes are duplicated to balance out the dataset. Conversely, undersampling involves removing examples from majority classes to achieve a more balanced dataset. Additionally, diverse data collection methods can help mitigate data bias by ensuring that the dataset includes a wide range of examples representing different demographics, geographic locations, and other relevant factors. In this case study, stratified random sampling points were generated using QGIS’ ACatama plugin, and the number of points per class was increased by five-fold to account for bias associated with restricted inclusion probabilities that resulted from the pre-defined distribution of GMEP squares.
