of fire risk maps that exhibit enhanced efficacy in fire-sensitive forest 
ecosystems  can  be  achieved  by  utilizing  diverse  remote  sensing  data 
characterized by high spatial resolution, particularly Unmanned Aerial 
Vehicle (UAV) images incorporating multispectral bands. Additionally, 
employing  various  modeling  techniques  such  as  artificial  neural  net-
works, deep learning, and logistic regression can further contribute to 
refining these maps.

Nguyen et al. (2018) employed three distinct machine learning al-
gorithms,  namely  Support  Vector  Machine,  Multilayer  Perceptron 
Neural Network, and Random Forests, to evaluate fire risk in tropical

forests  using  564  fire  ignition  points  and  ten  different  variables.  The 
Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (AUC = 0.894) demonstrated the 
best performance, and NDVI was among the variables analyzed. Corre-
lation analysis of forest fire ignition points and variables showed that the 
NDVI (r = 0.51) index was the most reliable predictor of fire occurrence. 
In contrast, Iban  and  Sekertekin (2022) developed  a fire  risk map 
using  seven  machine  learning  techniques,  RS  data,  and  GIS.  Thirteen 
different variables affecting forest fire risk were employed in this study. 
The accuracy of the maps obtained using seven machine-learning tech-
niques ranged from 0.817 to 0.879, as measured by AUC values. NDVI 
was  among  the  variables  used  in  this  study.  The  correlation  analysis 
showed that the elevation variable (r = 0.626) had the highest corre-
lation with fire risk, while NDVI (r = 0.256) exhibited a low correlation.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it cannot be determined what specific type of deep learning model was used in the pipeline. While the text mentions that various modeling techniques such as artificial neural networks and deep learning were employed, it does not provide details about the exact architecture or type of deep learning models utilized. Therefore, without additional context or information, we cannot determine whether a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Transformer, or another type of deep learning model was used in the pipeline.
