The training procedure of the detection model ran for 150 epochs. 
The model was fed with batches of 16 tiles at a time which was moti-
vated by the available GPU memory and training efficiency. Stochastic 
Gradient Descent (SGD) was used as the model’s optimizer with a mo-
mentum of 0.9. The default data augmentation techniques of YOLOv5 
were applied during training to improve the model robustness. Predicted 
bounding boxes with intersection-over-union (IoU) ≥ 0.6 were consid-
ered  positive  while  bounding  boxes  with  IoU<0.6  were  considered 
negative (Zhang et al., 2020).

Helpful Answer:
The paper uses the YOLOv5 model for insect detection and counting. The training procedure ran for 150 epochs, and the model was fed with batches of 16 tiles at a time. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) was used as the model’s optimizer with a momentum of 0.9. However, the exact learning rate is not mentioned in the given context. The default data augmentation techniques of YOLOv5 were applied during training to improve the model robustness. For prediction, bounding boxes with intersection-over-union (IoU) ≥ 0.6 were considered positive, while those with IoU < 0.6 were considered negative.
