System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses (SAGA) software (version 9.4.0) (Conrad, 

2015) was employed to perform classification utilising the RF technique, based on Red 

Gren Blue (RGB) images acquired in March, April, and May.In this study, the maximum 

shaft number value was tested from 1 to 100 and the minimum sample number from 1 

to 50. Finally, the most accurate results for RF were obtained when the maximum tree 

depth was set to 10 and the minimum number of samples was set to 2. The regression

1. Introduction  

Grasslands  are  among  the  leading  terrestrial  ecosystems  (Zhang  et  al.,  2022), 

occupying more than 40% of the world’s terrestrial area, a third of the agricultural area 

in  Europe,  and  storing  about  a  third  of  the  world’s  terrestrial  biomass  stock  (O‘Mara, 

2012; Stumpf et al., 2020 Bar-On et al., 2018; Erb et al., 2017).  

Moreover, grassland agroecosystems are of significant importance in the production of

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific details regarding the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, generally speaking, these preprocessing steps can be crucial for improving the performance of machine learning models including deep learning models. Normalization involves rescaling the input features so they have a mean of zero and standard deviation of one, while scaling refers to transforming the range of independent variables or predictors to a certain scale without distorting their differences or distances. Cleaning data may involve handling missing values, removing outliers, and correcting inconsistent data entries. These preprocessing steps help improve the accuracy and efficiency of the model during training.
