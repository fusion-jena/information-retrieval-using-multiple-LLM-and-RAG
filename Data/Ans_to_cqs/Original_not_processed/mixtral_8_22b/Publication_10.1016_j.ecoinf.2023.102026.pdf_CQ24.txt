Among  machine  learning  techniques,  random  forest  (RF;  Breiman 
(2001)) is the most commonly used algorithm (Stupariu et al., 2021). RF 
are  Classification  and  Regression  Tree  (CART)  based  ensemble  ap-
proaches,  which  overcome  limitations  of  CARTs  such  as  model  over- 
fitting.  Additionally,  RF  can  handle  large  numbers  of  predictor  vari-
ables  without  being  affected  by  multicollinearity,  and  can  readily 
accommodate nonlinear relationships between predictor and response 
variables  (Breiman,  2001;  Evans  and  Cushman,  2009;  Kumar  et  al., 
2021). Furthermore, by permutation of variables, RF provides accessible 
measures of variable importance (Cutler et al., 2007; Evans and Cush-
man, 2009).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The article does not provide information on handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or managing random seed values. However, common strategies include setting a fixed random seed value before training the model to ensure reproducibility, using cross-validation to evaluate model performance across different subsets of data, and employing ensemble methods like bagging or boosting to reduce variance and improve generalization.
