combined with labeled data in a semi-supervised framework (sensu [14]), which may improve deep
learning on limited training data by providing neural networks the opportunity to learn generalized
features on a wider array of training examples, followed by retraining on a smaller number of high
quality annotations [16]. It is unknown whether moderate to low quality annotations can be used
to generate trees for initial model training, given the imperfect nature of existing unsupervised tree
delimitation approaches.

of thousands of noisy labels will yield improved performance, even though these labeled data are
imperfect due to the limitations of the generative algorithm [17].

Ranging (LIDAR)-based unsupervised detection generates initial training data for a self-supervised
(red, green, blue (RGB) deep learning model. The model is then retrained based on a small number of
hand-annotated trees to create the full model.

2.1. Study Site and Field Data

We used data from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) site at the San Joaquin
Experimental Range in California to assess our proposed approach (Figure 2). The site contains an open
woodland of live oak (Quercus agrifolia), blue oak (Quercus douglasii), and foothill pine (Pinus sabiniana)
forest. The majority of the site is a single-story canopy with mixed understory of herbaceous vegetation.

The challenge for applying deep learning to natural systems is the need for large training datasets.
A lack of training data is a pervasive problem in remote sensing due to the cost of data collection
and annotation [13]. In addition, the spatial extent of training data often prohibits the ﬁeld-based
veriﬁcation of annotated objects. For tree detection, the high variation in tree crown appearance, due
to taxonomy, health status, and human management, increases the risk of overﬁtting when using small
amounts of training data [10]. One approach to addressing the data limitation in deep learning is
“self-supervised learning” (sensus [14]), which uses unsupervised methods to generate training data
that is used to train supervised models [15]. This approach has recently been applied to remote sensing
for hyperspectral image classiﬁcation [9]. Self-supervision, which only relies on unlabeled data, can be

Helpful Answer:
Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily utilizes image data. Specifically, the study employs Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data and red, green, blue (RGB) images. LiDAR is a remote sensing method that measures distance to a target by illuminating the target with pulsed laser light and measuring the reflected pulses with a sensor. These measurements are typically visualized as point clouds or raster images. On the other hand, RGB images are standard digital images composed of three color channels - red, green, and blue. Therefore, both LiDAR and RGB images fall under the category of image data. However, there is no mention of any other data format such as audio, video, or CSV being used in this particular deep learning pipeline.
