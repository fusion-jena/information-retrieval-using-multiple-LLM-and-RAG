In addition, the expert readers had the advantage of using auxiliary 
information, including catch date, body length, back calculated smolt 
size, weight, sex and river location. Typically, growth conditions differ 
significantly  from  south  to  north  and  smolt  size  differs  accordingly 
(Aronsen et al., 2019). Further, classification of a scale as farmed/wild, 
for instance, might guide the age reading because of differences in ex-
pected  growth  patterns.  No  such  information  was  given  to  the  CNNs 
during training but it is reasonable to expect that the CNNs performance 
would increase if some extra input information were provided during 
training  and  prediction  e.g.  CNNs  predictions  of  wild/farmed  or 
spawned/not  spawned  were  fed  into  the  regression  CNNs.  It  is

Helpful Answer:
Based on the provided context, there isn't explicit mention of any specific techniques used to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, we can infer that the researchers took certain steps towards achieving this goal.

Firstly, the use of a large number of images in the dataset for each task suggests that the researchers aimed to create a diverse dataset. For example, the set sizes for predicting River Age, Sea Age, and Spawning were 6238, 8286, and 9056 respectively. A larger dataset often leads to better generalization since it provides more examples for the model to learn from.

Secondly, while not explicitly mentioned, the table presenting the CNN performance metrics seems to indicate that the researchers may have employed some form of validation technique. The presence of test loss values implies that the models were evaluated on unseen data, which is a common practice when validating machine learning models.

Lastly, although not directly related to ensuring generalizability, the acknowledgement section mentions receiving valuable advice on the CNN architecture from Hyeongji Kim. This collaboration with experts in the field likely contributed to improving the overall quality and robustness of the deep learning model.

However, without further details about the exact methods used for creating the dataset, training the model, and evaluating its performance, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer regarding the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
