3.2.3. Complex network measures 

After the network is constructed, a plethora of quantitative network 
measures become available (Newman, 2018). We investigate the utility 
of the network’s Average Shortest Path  length (ASPL) for the studied 
networks. ASPL can be defined as (Barab´asi, 2013): 

ASPL =

d(s, t)
n(n (cid:0) 1)

∑

s, t ∈ V
s ∕= t

the 97.5 and 2.5 quantiles of the ASPL values were calculated.

2. Data 

2.1. Audio data 

For our work, we use data from the SALVE study. Briefly, 50 3-min 
audio files have been recorded daily at 84 locations in Bochum since 
2019.  Meanwhile,  data  is  available  over  a  period  of  more  than  three 
years. Here, we use a subset from 23 different locations from May 2019 
to  the  end  of  February  2020  (defined  in  Haselhoff  et  al.  (2022c)  as 
AAP24).  The  choice  of  the  endpoint  is  motivated  by  excluding  the 
changes  to  the  AE  caused  by  the  corona  pandemic  (Hornberg  et  al., 
2021). Recordings were made using Wildlife Acoustics SM4 recorders with 
a  SMMA2  microphone  (Wildlife  Acoustics,  2020).  The  devices  were 
mounted  at  a  height  of  approx.  1.65  m  (DIN  ISO  12913-1:2018-02, 
2023) and programmed to record 3-min recordings every 26 min at a 
sampling frequency of 44.1 kHz and 16 bit depth.
