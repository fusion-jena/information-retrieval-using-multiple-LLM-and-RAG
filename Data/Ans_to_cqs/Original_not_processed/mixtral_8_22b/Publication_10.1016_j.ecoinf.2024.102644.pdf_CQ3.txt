in the basin, based on 180 resident speciesâ€™ data. As species observation 
data,  we  use  data  from  a  public  authoritative  repository  of  big  data 
(GBIF)  improved  with  reliable  records  we  accurately  and  directly 
observed in the field.

Big-data mining approaches based on Artificial Intelligence models can help forecast biodiversity changes before 
they happen. These approaches can predict macroscopic species distribution patterns and trends that can inform 
preventive measures to avoid the loss of ecosystem functions and services. They can, therefore, help study and 
mitigate climate change implications on biodiversity conservation in fragile ecosystems. Wetlands are particu-
larly fragile ecosystems where climate change poses severe risks and has dramatically reduced their size over the 
past  century,  with  profound  consequences  on  biodiversity  and  ecosystem  services.  Through  big-data  mining 
approaches,  we  can  predict  future  wetland  biodiversity  trends  in  the  context  of  climate  change.  This  paper 
proposes such predictive analysis for a specific wetland: The Massaciuccoli Lake basin in Tuscany, Italy. This

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses the use of big data mining approaches based on artificial intelligence models to predict biodiversity changes. In this case, the data used is likely related to species observations, which could involve various forms of annotation depending on the model requirements. For example, bounding box annotation or instance segmentation might be used if object detection or semantic segmentation tasks were part of the deep learning pipeline. But without more specific information about the models being used, it's impossible to definitively state what annotation techniques are employed.
