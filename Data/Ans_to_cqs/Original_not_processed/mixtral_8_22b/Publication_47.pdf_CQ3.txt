Evaluación Automatizada de la Conservación de la Familia Orchidaceae mediante Aprendizaje Profundo

We implemented a deep neural network algorithm
(Goodfellow et al. 2016)—IUC-NN—as an R package
(IUCNN, available at https://github.com/azizka/IUCNN)
based on the Python (version 3.7) TensorFlow (https://
www.tensorflow.org) library to predict the conservation
status of unevaluated orchid species. We based the pre-
dictions on 4 groups of features, derivable from digitally
available occurrence records: geographic (mean latitude
and longitude, longitudinal and latitudinal range, extent
of occurrence [EOO], area of occupancy [AOO], number
of locations [sensu IUCN], and occurrence records); cli-
matic (mean of 19 bioclim variables [Karger et al. 2017]);
biome (presence in 14 biomes [Olson et al. 2001]); and

anthropogenic (mean Human Footprint Index [Wildlife
Conservation Society & International Earth Science In-
formation Network 2005]).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The paper does not provide explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in their deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that they utilized various types of feature extraction methods based on digitally available occurrence records. These features include geographical (mean latitude and longitude, longitudinal and latitudinal range, extent of occurrence [EOO], area of occupancy [AOO], number of locations [sensu IUCN], and occurrence records), climatic (mean of 19 bioclim variables [Karger et al. 2017]), biome (presence in 14 biomes [Olson et al. 2001]), and anthropogenic (mean Human Footprint Index [Wildlife Conservation Society & International Earth Science Information Network 2005]) features. It appears that these features were extracted from existing datasets rather than being manually annotated using techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.
