both training and testing. A critical point to highlight is that models are 
retrained  for  each  fold,  preventing  previous  fold’s  information  from 
being transferred. We utilized the pretrained ResNet-34 (Which consists 
of  a  34-layer  convolutional  neural  network)  architecture  which  is  a 
variant of the ResNet (Residual Network) family, widely used for deep 
learning tasks, particularly in computer vision (He et al., 2016). ResNet- 
34 was used inside the fast.ai framework (Howard and Gugger, 2020) to 
leverage  existing  knowledge,  this  is  particularly  useful  in  our  dataset 
since its small size. Transfer learning generally consists in using a model 
pre-trained  on  broad  datasets,  like  ImageNet  (Deng  et  al.,  2009),  to 
specialized tasks with more limited data. As part of the cross-validation 
of the Leave-One-Group-Out approach, the test directory containing the 
multitemporal transect was temporarily moved to test, and DataLoaders

one-group-out  (LOGO)  cross-validation  approach,  where  each  multi-
temporal  transect  was  used  once  as  a  test  set  while  the  remaining 
transects were used for training. The models are retrained for each fold, 
ensuring  that  there  is  no  information  transfer  or  contamination  from 
previous folds. We trained the autoencoder with 15 epochs and used 15 
components in the PLSR to make predictions every iteration.

2.5.1. Classification problem (Q1): Deep learning applied to 2D LiDAR 
images for Forest classification 

We  employed  the  fast.ai  platform  (Howard  and  Gugger,  2020)  to 
train and validate models for the classification of 2D point cloud images, 
utilizing  a  LOGO  (Leave-One-Group-Out)  cross-validation.  In  this 
approach, our target classes were "Plateau", "White-sand", and "Ripar-
ian",  designated  as  "p",  "w",  and  "r"  respectively.  In  each  iteration,  a 
complete 450 m multitemporal transect was omitted from the training 
process  (the  grouping  factor  giving  the  lack  of  independence  in  the 
multi-temporal data) and subsequently tested. This approach ensured an 
assessment  of  the  model’s  performance,  accounting  for  our  data  con-
straints and guaranteeing that every multitemporal transect undergoes

We  have  also  adopted  a  broader  and  more  conservative  testing 
strategy as in the classification problem (Q1) involving excluding three 
transects (~17% of the data) for testing in each iteration, specifically 
one  from  each  target  class  -  "Plateau"  (p),  "White-sand"  (w),  and  "Ri-
parian" (r), cross-validation is the same as before with the classification 
problem  (see  2.5.1).  In  order  to  measure  the  model’s  performance 
across all transects, a cumulative evaluation was also performed. Instead 
of analyzing each iteration separately, we assess the model using coef-
ficient  of  determination  (R2)  between  true  vs  predicted  for  all  648 
multitemporal transects predictions.

Helpful Answer:
The data was split using a Leave-One-Group-Out (LOGO) cross-validation approach. Each complete 450m multitemporal transect was considered as a single group. For each iteration, one entire group was left out for testing while the rest of the groups were used for training. This process was repeated until each group had been used as a test set exactly once. Additionally, a broader and more conservative testing strategy was adopted by excluding three transects (~17% of the data) for testing in each iteration, specifically one from each target class - "Plateau" (p), "White-sand" (w), and "Riparian" (r). To evaluate the model's performance across all transects, a cumulative evaluation was performed using coefficient of determination (R^2) between true vs predicted values for all 648 multitemporal transect predictions.
