straightforward methodology, and it is developed within a much more 
limited scenario, which is the standard for most research teams which 
are becoming familiar with deep learning approaches.

number  of  classes  to  be identified)  and  the  second term  refers  to  the

limitation  in  the  dataset  size,  we  exploit  existing  deep  learning  tech-
niques in combination with statistical fundamentals.

the growing computing capability of machines and availability of big 
data, making it possible to extract high levels of representation of image 
content  (Hassaballah  and  Hosny,  2019).  This  field  falls  into  artificial 
intelligence  and,  in  particular,  deep  learning,  which  has  recently 
received  large  attention  from  ecologists  (Christin  et  al.,  2019).  Deep 
learning  is  a  sub-field  of  artificial  intelligence  which  focuses  on  a 
learning method based on logical structures that closely resemble the 
architectural  characteristics  of  the  brain  (the  so-called  deep  artificial 
neural networks). It consists of processing units within the global system 
that  specialize  in  detecting certain  hidden  characteristics  in the  data.

Query: "Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot determine whether it is hosted on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
