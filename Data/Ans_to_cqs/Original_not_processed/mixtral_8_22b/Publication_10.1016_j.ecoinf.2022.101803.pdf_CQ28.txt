models.

Here,  we  have  built  on  the  suggestions  of  Boyce  and  McDonald 
(1999) and the early implementation of the GFR by Matthiopoulos et al. 
(2011).  Our  work  addressed  the  lack  of  flexibility  and  control  in  the

5.2.2. Wolf dataset 

The  dataset  on  telemetry  of  habitat  use  by  wolves  was  used  in 
Mathiopoulos et al. (2011) to fit the original GFR model. The analysis 
employed  a  use-availability  approach  representing  response  data  as 
either 0 or 1. These data cover 11 wolves, that were members of five 
different packs. The dataset comprised three continuous variables, dis-
tance  to  high  human  use,  distance  to  edge,  and  slope,  and  represented 
landcover  as  a  factor  with  levels  for  burnt,  alpine,  shrub,  rock,  and 
herbaceous.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there is no mention of any specific platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform being used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, it cannot be determined which platform was used based solely on this information.
