To evaluate how well the models performed, we used three standard
metrics: MSE, mean average error (MAE), and the coefficient of deter-
mination (r2). For the grid search, we focused on minimizing the MSE to
identify the optimal set of hyperparameters. Prior to conducting the grid
search, we divided our data into a training set (80% of the data) and a
test set (20% of the data). This split ensures that the models are trained
on one portion of the data and tested on a separate, previously unseen
portion, allowing us to assess their ability to generalize to new, unseen
data accurately.

2.3.3. SHAP values

After training the MLP models, we computed SHAP values using the
model-agnostic Kernel SHAP method to understand which features are
most important in predicting the start and (height of the) peak of the
greening season. We used the implementation in the Python SHAP
package for this analysis Lundberg et al. (2017).

Unfortunately, MLPs are black-box models. This means that, while
they can approximate any function, it is nearly impossible to determine
the structure of the approximated function. This led to a whole new field
within ML, explainable artificial intelligence (xAI), which tries to create
methods that allow human users to understand the predictions made by
an ML model (Vilone and Longo, 2021). Some popular examples include
sensitivity analysis (Zeiler and Fergus, 2014), Local Interpretable Model-
Agnostic Explanations (LIME) (Ribeiro et al., 2016), and SHapley Ad-
ditive exPlanations (SHAP) values (Lundberg et al., 2017). This study
uses the last method, as it is gaining in popularity and is now often used
in ecology. For example, Masago and Lian (2022) use SHAP values to
investigate how inter-annual variation in the daily average temperature
affected the first flowering date or the full blossom date of the Yoshino

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the data was divided into a training set (80% of the data) and a test set (20% of the data). This split allows the models to be trained on one portion of the data and tested on a separate, previously unseen portion. This approach helps to assess the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data accurately. Additionally, during the grid search process, the focus was on minimizing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) to identify the optimal set of hyperparameters. This step further contributes to improving the model's performance and its ability to generalize. However, there is no explicit mention of other techniques such as cross-validation, stratified splitting, or ensuring diversity in the dataset.
