over five decays (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1) and sizes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). We fitted 
RFs using the RANDOMFOREST R package (Liaw and Wiener, 2002) with 500 
trees, five as the minimum size of terminal nodes, and by sampling all 
descriptors for splitting at each node; these RFs were thus equivalent to 
bagged decision trees. Finally, we fitted GBMs via the  GBM  R package 
(Greenwell et al., 2020) by ensembling a maximum of 10,000 trees, with 
shrinkage and interaction parameters equal to 0.01 and 1, respectively; 
each  tree  was  thus  equivalent  to  a  decision  stump.  After  model  cali-
bration, we identified the most relevant physiographic descriptors for 
each algorithm and each month. For GAMs, we evaluated the predictors’ 
relative importance by considering their F statistics. We assessed vari-
able importance in ANNs by employing the Olden method (Olden et al., 
2004)  implemented  in  the  NEURALNETTOOLS  R  package  (Beck,  2018).

in Appendices). Like KGE scores, MAE and RMSE increased for all the 
algorithms during the hot season, although both metrics showed limited 
variability  (0.4–1.3 
C;  Fig.  A.10c  and  Fig.  A.10d  in  Appendices). 
Percent biases were always remarkably close to zero, with little differ-
ences between algorithms (Fig. A.10b in Appendices). Altitude was the 
most relevant physiographic descriptor; however, in all algorithms but 
ANN, its relative importance decreased during the hot season. In these 
same  months,  the  relative  importance  of  the  remaining  descriptors 
generally increased (Fig. A.11 in Appendices).

This study compared interpolation and downscaling techniques by 
predicting monthly average temperatures. However, minima and max-
ima are equally, if not more, relevant in shaping the niche of many or-
ganisms;  weather  and  climate  extremes  also  contribute  to  setting  the 
bounds  of  organisms’  range 
limits  (Germain  and  Lutz,  2020; 
Ummenhofer  and  Meehl,  2017).  Understanding  which  techniques  to 
downscale  these  additional  climates  with  would  further  boost  our 
modeling capabilities. Due to their complex fine-scale topographic ef-
fects, this is especially true for topographically heterogeneous mountain 
landscapes (Barry and Blanken, 2016).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide explicit information on the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it cannot be determined from the given context whether techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) were employed.
