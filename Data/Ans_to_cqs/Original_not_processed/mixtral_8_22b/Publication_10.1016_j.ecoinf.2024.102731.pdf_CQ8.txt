Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not contain any reference or link to a specific code repository for a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it is impossible to determine where the code repository might be located based on this context alone. It could potentially be hosted on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket, but without further details, we cannot provide a definitive answer.
