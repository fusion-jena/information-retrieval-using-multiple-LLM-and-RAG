construct regression equations. We used multiple linear regression, Enet,
SVM, RF, XGboost and LightGBM to predict canopy cover from planet
data. In general, all the mentioned models are used in machine learning
as they use algorithms to automatically learn patterns and relationships
from data to make predictions or decisions. However, we categorised

linear as a simple statistical model and the rest of the advanced machine
learning models as machine learning. The regression analyses were
conducted using Python 3.12.2, distributed by Anaconda Inc. The Scikit-
learn library (Pedregosa et al., 2011) was employed for all models except
those utilising XGboost and LightGBM. For XGboost and LightGBM
models, the respective Python libraries “xgboost” (Chen and Guestrin,
2016) and “lightgbm” (Ke et al., 2017) were utilised. Additionally, a 5-
fold cross-validation grid search strategy was implemented to tune
hyperparameters within the training dataset for all machine learning
models, leveraging functionalities inherent in their respective Python
packages. The information on hyperparameters and their optimised
value for all machine learning models are presented in Table 4. More-

and time overhead (Ke et al., 2017). LightGBM sets itself apart from
other tree-based methods through its leaf-wise splitting approach, which
generates more intricate trees. These trees are adept at minimising loss,
leading to enhanced accuracy. The splitting process is guided by a
unique sampling method called Gradient-Based One Side Sampling
(GBOSS) (Ke et al., 2017). This method excludes data with small gra-
dients while utilising the remainder for estimating information gain and
facilitating tree growth. A collection of hyperparameters, such as lear-
ning_rate, max_depth, bagging_fraction, bagging_freq, and n_estimators,
controls the algorithm. These parameters are crucial in shaping how the
leaves are structured within the trees. The model's complexity gradually
rises as the tree grows, guided by these parameters. Simultaneously, loss
decreases, and the algorithm becomes more adept at learning from the
data, thereby improving its efficiency. Moreover, this model is suscep-

Helpful Answer:

The given context does not provide any details about a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. Instead, it discusses various machine learning models like Multiple Linear Regression, Elastic Net (Enet), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and LightGBM. Each of these models has specific hyperparameters that need to be tuned for optimal performance.

For instance, Enet uses alpha (α) and l1\_ratio as hyperparameters. SVM employs Cost (C), gamma, Kernel, and epsilon. RF uses n\_estimators, max\_features, max\_depth, min\_samples\_split, and min\_samples\_leaf. XGBoost and LightGBM have similar hyperparameters like n\_estimators, max\_depth, colsample\_bytree, min\_child\_weight, subsample, learning\_rate, num\_leaves, feature\_fraction, bagging\_fraction, and bagging\_freq.

These hyperparameters control different aspects of each model, such as regularization strength, kernel type, number of trees, maximum depth of trees, etc. They play a significant role in determining the overall performance and accuracy of the models.

However, since no deep learning model is discussed in the provided context, I cannot provide the required information regarding the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model.
