The quantity of training data derived from ground data collection in 2018 was limited.
A U-Net implemented with Keras produced a low training and testing accuracy with
segmentation results on testing data differing between repetitions. Implementing a U-Net
model within the arcgis.learn module of the ArcGIS API for Python [39] removed the
requirement for a quantitatively massive dataset. Additionally, the U-Net implemented
through argis.learn is pretrained on ImageNet to further improve classiﬁcation accuracies.
This reduces the time and resources spent on ground truth data collection. Hyperparameter
tuning was done to select the best U-Net model [31,34,40]. Based on hyperparameter
optimization, it was found that the best model uses an input patch size of 64 × 64 pixels
and a ResNet-50 backbone [31,34,40].

worldwide should consider the needs of the local human population. As such, future conservation efforts by the MFG include improving human health and recognizing the importance of people-oriented strategies in order to provide cash crops and a sustainable food source for the locals. Machine/deep learning has been far advanced in some application domains; how-ever, challenges exist for remote sensing applications especially for tropical forest moni-toring due to in part the lack of sufficient training data representing various biomes and forest types globally that must be manually created and in part the challenges of manag-ing and analyzing big satellite data at the global scale. We presented a fully automated deep learning model in this paper which can be applied to any part of the world. Taking Remote Sens. 2021, 13, 3495

the U-Net model is the labeling of each pixel in the training data. Abundant data are needed
for training deep neural networks of at least 1000 image samples. In such cases, a pretrained
network can reduce the amount of training data needed [47]. The U-Net implemented
within arcgis.learn had a ResNet-50 backbone that was pretrained on ImageNet.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given information, there is no explicit mention or reference to where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It could potentially be hosted on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket, but without specific details, we cannot determine its exact location.
