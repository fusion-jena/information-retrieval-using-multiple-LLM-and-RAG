The extraction of crop-growing areas is a prerequisite for estimating 
the  crop  chlorophyll  content  in  the  field  scale.  Zhang  et  al.  (2020) 
pointed out that the end of July in Northeast China is the peak growth 
period of different crops, during which the physiological parameters of 
crops are at their peak (e.g., greenness and water content), which is the 
best  time  window  for  crop  classification.  In  addition,  classification 
methods, this study verifies the optimality of random forest classifica-
tion  by  comparing  multiple  mainstream  machine  learning  methods 
(including random forest classification, support vector machine classi-
fication, decision tree classification) (You et al., 2021). Therefore, for 
the Sentinel-2 images from 21 July 2022, we selected the random forest 
classification  method  to  extract  the  rice-growing  area  of  Qian  Gorlos 
County with a classification accuracy of over 90% (Fig. 1). Because rice

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be applied to improve its performance. These may include data normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Data normalization involves transforming the input features into a similar range or distribution, often between 0 and 1, using techniques such as min-max scaling or z-score normalization. Scaling adjusts the values of numeric variables so they have approximately equal ranges, preventing any single feature from dominating the others due to differences in magnitudes. Cleaning refers to handling missing values, removing noise, and correcting inconsistent data entries. Other common preprocessing steps might involve encoding categorical variables, dimensionality reduction, and augmenting datasets with additional samples generated from existing ones.
