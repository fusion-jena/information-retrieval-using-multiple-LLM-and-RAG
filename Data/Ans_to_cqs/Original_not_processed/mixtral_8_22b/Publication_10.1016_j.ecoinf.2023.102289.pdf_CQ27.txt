Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

A.1.2. Loading the pre-trained module 

By default, LaDeco employs the deeplabv3 þ resnet269 model. The deeplabv3 part is a semantic segmentation algorithm developed by Google 
(Chen et al., 2018), and Resnet269 is a 269-layer Resnet neural network (Zhang et al., 2020). Users can switch to other pre-trained models as needed 
(Please refer to https://cv.gluon.ai/api/model_zoo.html#). 

A.1.3. Setting the threshold 

The primary function of LaDeco is to calculate the pixel percentage of each landscape element in the image. Users can set a threshold to filter out 

negligible values; for example, values below 1% can be rounded to zero. This threshold is customizable. 

A.1.4. Output format

An  AI  platform  operates  on  a  Central  Processing  Unit  (CPU)  or 
Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). It uses MXNet to provide the essential 
modules and functions required for the program operation. 

The  programming  platform  encompasses  four  primary  computa-

tional functions:  

(1)  Analysis  Module:  Responsible  for  conducting  core  analytical 

tasks.  

(2)  Data Filtering Module: Filters irrelevant data.  

(1)  The computer initially read the images and forwarded them to the 

SS model.  

(2)  The SS model produced a pixel count for 150 objects.  
(3)  Any data that fell below a certain threshold were assigned a value 

of zero.  

(4)  Finally,  the  percentages  of  each  element  and  category  were 
calculated based on a visual landscape classification framework. 
The  results  were  then  exported  in  Comma-Separated  Values 
(CSV) format.

2.3. MXNet and GluonCV 

MXNet  is  an  open-source  AI  platform  that  offers  a  comprehensive 
suite of neural network models and functionalities for AI development 
(Chen et al., 2015). MXNet serves as the central computational module; 
when combined with GluonCV, GluonNLP, and GluonTS, it constitutes a 
robust development system. In this study, we used GluonCV to develop 
LaDeco. 

GluonCV offers a set of 25 segmentation models, ten of which have 
been trained on the ADE20K dataset and are therefore well-suited for 
landscape applications (Ho and Ho, 2022). The ADE20K dataset devel-
oped by the MIT Torralba team contributes significantly to the SS field. 
This dataset focused on the recognition of 150 indoor and outdoor ob-
jects  (Zhou  et  al.,  2018a,  2018b).  In  this  study,  55  outdoor  visual 
landscape elements from the ADE20K dataset were used.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To deploy the trained deep learning model, the following process was followed:

Firstly, the deeplabv3+resnet269 model was employed as the default pre-trained model. However, users had the option to switch to other pre-trained models if necessary. These models could be found at <https://cv.gluon.ai/api/model_zoo.html#>.

Secondly, the threshold was set to filter out negligible values. For instance, any values below 1% were rounded off to zero. This threshold was customizable according to user requirements.

Thirdly, the output format was determined. The AI platform operated on either a CPU or GPU and utilized MXNet to provide the necessary modules and functions for the program operation. The platform consisted of four main computational functions: the analysis module responsible for carrying out core analytical tasks, the data filtering module for filtering irrelevant data, and two additional unnamed functions.

Lastly, the deployment process involved reading the images and sending them to the Semantic Segmentation (SS) model. The SS model generated a pixel count for 150 objects. Any data falling below a specific threshold was assigned a value of zero. Ultimately, the percentages of each element and category were calculated based on a visual landscape classification framework. The final results were exported in CSV format.

It should also be noted that MXNet, an open-source AI platform, served as the central computational module. When combined with GluonCV, GluonNLP, and GluonTS, it formed a robust development system. Specifically, GluonCV offered a set of 25 segmentation models, ten of which were trained on the ADE20K dataset, making them suitable for landscape applications. In this study, 55 outdoor visual landscape elements from the ADE20K dataset were used.
