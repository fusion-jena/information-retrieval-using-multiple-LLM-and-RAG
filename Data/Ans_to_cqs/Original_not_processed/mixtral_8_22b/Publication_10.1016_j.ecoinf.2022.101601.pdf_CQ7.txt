Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it does not explicitly state the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, common practices in machine learning include splitting the dataset randomly, stratified sampling based on class labels, or using a time-based split for temporal datasets. The typical ratios used for splitting are 60-20-20%, 70-15-15%, or 80-10-10% for training, testing, and validation respectively. It is also important to ensure that the splits maintain the same distribution as the original dataset to avoid any biases during model evaluation.
