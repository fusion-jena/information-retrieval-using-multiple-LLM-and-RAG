A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep learning-based model for
processing multidimensional data that follows a grid pattern [60]. The model is developed
in such a way that the algorithm learns and adapts to the spatial hierarchies of features by
itself from the lower to the higher levels of the pattern. Mathematically, it is composed of
three layers or building blocks: convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers. Feature
extraction is conducted using the ﬁrst two layers and mapping the extracted features to the
output is conducted by the third layer.

A pooling layer offers downsampling functionality that decreases the dimensionality
of the feature maps to achieve translation invariance to the alterations and the biases
incorporated and thus helps in reducing the number of learnable parameters. There are
two types of pooling operations, namely Max Pooling and Global Average Pooling [64].
The ﬁrst one extracts speckles from the input feature maps and offers maximum values
in each of the speckles and leaves the remaining values unattended. The second one
downsamples a feature map with a size equaling product of height and width into an array
of a one cross one by averaging the elements of each feature map by retaining the depth of
the feature map. The advantage of Global Average Pooling lies in reducing the number of
learnable parameters along with offering the CNN with variable sized input.

Convolution is used for feature extraction, in which a kernel is applied to an input
tensor. A feature map is thus obtained through the product of kernel elements and tensor
input. The procedure is then repeated on multiple kernels to obtain random feature maps
that represent different feature extractors. The hyperparameters involved in convolution
operations are the size and number of kernels. The size could be anything from 3 × 3 to
5 × 5 to 7 × 7, and the kernel could be chosen randomly.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, these are common preprocessing techniques often employed when preparing data for use in machine learning models. Normalization can help scale numerical inputs to a similar range, while cleaning may involve removing outliers or handling missing data. Scaling might also be necessary depending on the nature of the dataset. It would be best to refer to additional resources or consult the authors of the paper for more information regarding their specific preprocessing methods.
