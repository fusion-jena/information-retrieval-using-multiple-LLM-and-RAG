6.2.1. Data 

The GBIF database10 contains over 2300 videos of animals, although 
many of these are not suitable for our purpose. We have curated a subset 
of  330  videos  that  are  shot  with  static  cameras.  These  videos  are 
therefore good representations of the style of input this pipeline is ex-
pected  to  receive.  Every  frame  from  each  of  these  videos  has  been 
manually annotated, indicating whether or not it contains an animal. We 
have provided the training (30) and validation (300) split as used to tune 
parameters and evaluate the system, respectively. It is important to note 
that  camera-related  parameters  have  not  been  annotated  or  used  in 
testing  the  DynAIkonTrap. For these  tests we have  assumed the  focal 
length for all cameras to be the same as that of the RPi camera module –

The official, MS-COCO pre-trained, version of this architecture has 
then  been  further  trained,  a  technique  known  as  transfer-learning, 
using the WCS dataset and its recommended data split, giving a cred-
ible mean average precision mAP50 score of 0.75. The mAP metric, used 
to  evaluate  the  PASCAL  VOC  challenge  dataset  (Everingham  et  al., 
2010),  takes  the  mean  over  all  considered  species  of  their  respective, 
species-specific  average  precision  as  defined  below.  The  subscript  50 
refers  to  the  requirement  that  the  area  of  the  intersection  of  ground 
truth  bounding  box  and  predicted  bounding  box  needs  to  be  at  least 
50%  of  the  area  of  the  union  of  both  for  an  otherwise  true  species 
identification to be considered correct. The network does not output a 
binary  value  for  species  identification  but  instead  a  belief  b  ∈ [0, 1] 
that  a  particular  species  has  been  identified.  Thresholding  these

Helpful Answer:
After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the project. Here are some common postprocessing techniques:

1. Model evaluation metrics: Calculating various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curves, etc., helps assess the effectiveness of the trained model.

2. Confusion matrices: Creating confusion matrices provides insights into the types of errors made by the model during classification tasks. This visual representation shows the number of correctly classified instances versus misclassified ones.

3. Saliency maps: Generating saliency maps highlights the regions within an image that contribute most significantly to the model's decision-making process. This technique can help improve interpretability and understanding of deep learning models.

4. Hyperparameter tuning: Adjusting hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, regularization strength, etc., based on the results of initial training runs can lead to improved model performance.

5. Ensemble methods: Combining multiple models using ensemble methods like bagging, boosting, stacking, etc., can often result in better overall performance compared to individual models.

In the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of postprocessing steps taken after model training. However, it mentions that the official, MS-COCO pre-trained version of the architecture was further trained using the WCS dataset and achieved a credible mean average precision (mAP50) score of 0.75. This indicates that the authors evaluated the model's performance using the mAP50 metric, which is one of the possible postprocessing steps mentioned above.
