During the training of the MLP, Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba,
2015) is used, as well as the scheduler which adjusts the learning rate
when the network reaches a plateau. For the training, various parameter
values and different regularization techniques were explored, with the
option of using either Cross-Entropy or Focal Loss (Lin et al., 2017). In
detail, the learning rate was set to 0.00001 and 0.0001, batch sizes of 8,
16, 32, and 64 were tested, and weight decay was varied between
0.0001 and 0.001 with a dropout of 0.1. Additionally, Focal Loss (Lin
et al., 2017) introduce additional parameters to investigate: α and γ. The
former serves as a balancing factor, either as a fixed value for all classes
or as the inverse of each class frequency. The latter regulates the impact
of the scaling factor; specifically, when set to zero, Focal Loss is equiv-
alent to Cross-Entropy Loss. We experimented with α set as the inverse of

Once the latent representations were extracted from the Autoencoder
model, an MLP was trained for the classification of fish events.
Throughout the training of MLP, Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba,
2015) with the learning rate modified by a scheduler when the network
reaches a plateau was used. The MLP was trained for several epochs with
various parameter configurations and regularization techniques,
including both Cross-Entropy and Focal Loss, in line with the proposed
method. As regularization techniques, weight decay, batch normaliza-
tion (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015), and dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014)
were explored. In particular, batch normalization (Ioffe and Szegedy,
2015) was tested on each layer of the network separately and on all
layers simultaneously, with the best results achieved when applied to
the third layer. Dropout has been applied to the input layer, the hidden
layers, and all layers, yielding various results in combination with other

This suggests that features learned from raw trajectories (especially
through unsupervised pre-training) can be preferable to hand-crafted
features.

The MLP employed consists of four fully connected layers with the
size of 256, 128, 64, and 12, each comprising a linear layer followed by
PRelu as non-linearity. Only the third layer differs, as it is provided with
Batch Normalization (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015). During optimization,
Batch Normalization was also applied to other layers as well, but the
network performance was not as good. The network gets the input of size
512 consisting of learned features extracted from the diffusion model
and the last layer has 12 neurons. The maximum neuron value from this
layer is then used for predicting the event class, as each neuron corre-
sponds to one of the events. The values of the 12 neurons are then
compared to the real event ground truth through a loss, which serves to
update the model parameters and perform the training.

Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to determine what specific dataset(s) were used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context. However, we do have some details about the models and methods used in the pipeline.

In summary, the pipeline involves extracting latent representations from an autoencoder model and then feeding these into an MLP for classification tasks. The MLP uses the Adam optimizer along with a learning rate scheduler that modifies the learning rate when the network hits a plateau during training. Various parameter configurations and regularization techniques such as weight decay, batch normalization, and dropout were explored throughout the training process. Both cross-entropy and focal loss functions were utilized for training the MLP.

Additionally, the MLP architecture comprises four fully connected layers with sizes 256, 128, 64, and 12, respectively. Each layer includes a linear layer followed by PRelu activation except for the third layer, which incorporates Batch Normalization. The input size for the MLP is 512, representing the learned features extracted from the diffusion model. The final layer contains 12 neurons corresponding to the number of distinct events being classified.

However, without explicit mention of any specific dataset(s) used in the pipeline, I cannot provide further details regarding the datasets involved.
