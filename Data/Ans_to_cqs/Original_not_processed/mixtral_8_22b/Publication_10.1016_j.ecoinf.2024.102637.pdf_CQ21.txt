• We  use  structural  re-parameterization  techniques  to  decouple  the 
training  structure  from  the  inference  structure.  This  enables  inde-
pendent optimisation of the training and reasoning stages. Moreover, 
it enables the training phase to capture more feature information, 
while  the  inference  phase  simplifies  the  model  structure,  thereby 
reducing computational costs and deployment difficulties.

with convolutional layers and simplifying the model under structural

multiplies the output of the previous layer by a weight matrix. It per-

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit details about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it mentions some aspects related to model optimization and performance improvement. Based on common practices in machine learning, here are some possible postprocessing steps that could be involved after model training:

1. Model Evaluation: After training the model, evaluating its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, or area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) is essential. These metrics help assess how well the model has learned to classify or predict outcomes.
2. Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix is often used to visualize the performance of a classification model. It provides insights into the types of errors made by the model, such as false positives and false negatives.
3. Saliency Maps: In computer vision tasks, saliency maps can be generated to highlight the regions of input images that contribute most significantly to the model's predictions. This helps understand what features the model focuses on when making decisions.
4. Hyperparameter Tuning: Adjusting hyperparameters like learning rate, regularization strength, or batch size can further improve the model's performance. Techniques such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization can be employed for hyperparameter tuning.
5. Model Ensembling: Combining multiple models to create an ensemble can lead to improved performance compared to individual models. Common ensembling methods include bagging, boosting, and stacking.
