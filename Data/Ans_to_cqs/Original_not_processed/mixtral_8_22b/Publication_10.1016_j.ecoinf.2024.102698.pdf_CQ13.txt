Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Classical and deep learning methods are increasingly being used to 
generate synthetic data as they can perform better at emulating complex 
patterns and relationships in the original datasets, and do not require 
knowledge  of  prior  or  posterior  distributions  for  dataset  variables. 
Classical  machine  learning  methods  include  regression,  K-nearest 
neighbours,  and  support  vector  machines,  and  can  perform  better  on 
smaller data sets and take less time to train than deep learning methods. 
Deep  learning  methods  are  based  on  neural  networks,  including

Description

5.4. Connectivity data 

The  synthetic  connectivity  data  was  generated  using  a  Generative 
Adversarial Network (GAN) model based on the y-data-synthetic Python 
package (YData, 2023), as this model was able to replicate the sparse-
ness  of  the  original  connectivity  matrices  best  and  performed  best  in 
terms of the utility metrics. GAN models feature a generator component, 
which learns the latent features of the data to generate a data sample, 
and  a  discriminator,  which  is  a  classification  model  which  learns  to 
classify real and synthetic data. Backpropagation from the discriminator 
updates the model parameters in the generator with the magnitude of 
the update depending on the success of the discriminator in classifying

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model such as the learning rate or optimizer. The text only mentions that a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model was used for generating synthetic connectivity data, but it does not go into detail regarding the configuration of the model. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to this query based on the available context.
