parameter values were selected based on the RMSEcv values (De San-
tana  et  al.,  2021).  SVM  was  performed  in  MATLAB  R2016a,  and  the 
training model was established by using the libsvm package in MATLAB.

2.5. Evaluating model performance 

The accuracy of calibrated and validated models is assessed by four 
parameters,  namely,  coefficient  of  determination  (R2),  root-mean- 
square  error  (RMSE),  ratio  of  performance  to  deviation  (RPD),  and 
ratio of performance to interquartile range (RPIQ) (Zizala et al., 2019). 
The model is considered accurate when the bias is close to zero. RPD 
corresponds to the ratio of standard deviation (SD) to RMSE, which is 
widely used to evaluate VNIR spectral models. RPIQ considers predic-
tion  errors  and  variations  in  observations  simultaneously,  thereby 
providing  a  more  objective  and  easily  comparable  measure  of  model 
validity in model validation studies and has no assumptions about the 
distribution of observations (Guo et al., 2019).

SVMR is a kernel-based machine learning algorithm that originated 
in  statistical  theory  and  can  be  used  for  regression  and  classification 
(Cortes and Vapnik, 1995). The algorithm maps each covariate in the 
training set (sensitive bands filtered by the CARS algorithm) to a high- 
dimensional feature space by using a kernel function. Epsilon refers to 
an insensitive loss function that maps the maximum epsilon deviation of 
the independent data and the associated training data. Errors within the 
epsilon are ignored, whereas errors larger than the epsilon are penal-
ized. The epsilon-SVR model and Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) 
are  used  to  construct  the  calibration  model.  Epsilon-SVR  optimal  pa-
rameters (e.g., cost C, epsilon p, and gamma g) are used to make the 
model  achieve  the  best  accuracy,  where  parameters  C  and  p  help  us 
avoid overfitting of SVMR. For each parameter combination, the best

Helpful Answer:

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves evaluating the model's accuracy using several parameters such as the coefficient of determination (R^2), root-mean-square error (RMSE), ratio of performance to deviation (RPD), and ratio of performance to interquartile range (RPIQ). These metrics allow researchers to determine how well their models perform and whether they need further adjustments or improvements.

In this case, the Support Vector Machine Regression (SVMR) model was trained using the libsvm package in MATLAB. Parameter values were chosen based on the Root Mean Square Error Cross Validation (RMSEcv) values. During the training process, the epsilon-SVR model and Gaussian Radial Basis Function (RBF) were employed to build the calibration model. Optimal parameters like cost C, epsilon p, and gamma g were utilized to ensure the highest possible accuracy without overfitting the SVMR model.

To summarize, the strategy to monitor the model performance during training includes selecting appropriate evaluation metrics, choosing suitable algorithms and packages for training, setting optimal parameter values, and avoiding overfitting. This approach enables researchers to create reliable and robust predictive models.
