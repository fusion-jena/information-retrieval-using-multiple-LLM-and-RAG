a figure, but is also stored as a .csv file when running the R-code, hence, 
the number of errors at each frequency can be studied in detail.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information about where the data repository for the deep learning pipeline is available. It mentions that the outcome is presented in a figure and stored as a.csv file when running the R-code, but it does not specify where these files are located or if they have been made publicly accessible. Therefore, I do not know where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
