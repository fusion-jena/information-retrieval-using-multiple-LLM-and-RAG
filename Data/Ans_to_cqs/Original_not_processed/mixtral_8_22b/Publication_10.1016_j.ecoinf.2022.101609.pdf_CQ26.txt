within the training data. 

Three  key  data  pre-processors:  categorify,  fillMissing  and  normalize 
from fastai were adopted for additional data pre-processing. These pre- 
processors map categorical columns to distinct categories, replaces null 
values with column median values and normalises continuous columns

3. A proposed deep learning framework for highway AQ 
monitoring and prediction 

The proposed framework is a four-layered architecture composed of 
the hardware layer, data storage layer, integration layer and analytics 
layer as depicted in Fig. 2. This section introduces these layers and their 
functionalities.

an evaluation using the validation dataset. It should be pointed out that the model's predictions are not too far off the actual readings. (For interpretation of the

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it does not provide explicit information about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, there are several common techniques used to handle data bias such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes within each set. Oversampling increases the number of minority class samples by duplicating them, whereas undersampling reduces the majority class samples to balance the dataset. Diverse data collection aims to gather more representative data from different sources to reduce bias.

Without further context, I cannot determine which technique was specifically applied in this case. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, I do not know what techniques were used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
