The developed predictive model was characterized by the following
values of model accuracy evaluation parameters: MAE – 4.1%; RMSE –
5.6%; R2–0.49. The value of Mean absolute error is (MAE) shows that
prediction model deviates 4.1% from actual VWC. RMSE 5.6% is slightly
higher than MAE because it squares the errors before averaging, giving
more weight to larger errors. It provides a similar interpretation to MAE
but emphasizes larger prediction errors. R2 value 0.49 shows that the
model explains 49% of the variance in the observed VWC values. This
model indicates the moderate ability of the model to capture the relation
between the explanatory variable and VWC.

Therefore, it seems reasonable to test in the future more advanced
methods of data analysis for estimating soil moisture at the spoil heap. It
would be worthwhile in this context to test various methods of machine
learning or deep neural networks, which would perhaps allow to in-
crease the accuracy of prediction.

5. Conclusion

The study explored development spatial modeling for estimating
VWC on reclaimed spoil heap. This model is an integration of remote
sensing data (PlanetScope satellite imagery) and topographic indices.

The values of predictors were finally extracted for the whole study
area in a regular 10 × 10 m square grid and used for wall-to-wall pre-
diction of VWC using the developed GAM model. Figures showing the
spatial distribution of predicted VWC, and its standard error were
created.

3. Results

Fig. 6 shows predicted VWC values range from 10% to 40%, with a
standard error of 2.5% to 7.5%. It shows the distribution of predicted
values obtained with the developed predictive model with false color
compostion of selected PlanetScope satellite imagery. The obtained
values of soil water content in individual areas of the heap can be related
to land cover categories. At the grassland site, the model indicates
significantly higher VWC values (Fig. 5), which is confirmed by the
analysis of measured data obtained in different land cover classes.

Helpful Answer:
Answer: The text does not explicitly mention the use of deep learning models; however, it discusses the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of a predictive model. The mentioned metrics are Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and R2 score. These metrics are commonly used to evaluate regression tasks rather than classification tasks where accuracy, precision, and recall might be used. In summary, the discussed model uses MAE, RMSE, and R2 score as evaluation metrics instead of accuracy, precision, or recall.
