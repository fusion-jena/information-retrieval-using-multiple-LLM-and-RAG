2.6.3. Training process 

To fit into the network, the training set must have its data normalized 
and standardized. For the training network, the batch size was set to 32. 
The purposes for selecting 32 were to not exceed the memory limit and 
to make full use of computer resources. The optimizer used Adam pro-
cessing, and the learning ratio varied with group based on the cosine 
function’s law, often in the range between 0.0 and 1.0. The 100 epochs 
are used with an early stopping function to halt the learning process if 
there is no improvement in accuracy after 20 epochs. The loss function 
used is the cross-entropy loss function (Abd-Ellah et al., 2024).

redundancy compared to the original bands, leading to overfitting of the 
training model. However, the suggested MU-NET model can maximize 
the information from the original bands as a more effective data mining 
method, yielding outcomes that are similar to the salinity indices.

American  satellite  (Landsat  8).  The  MU-NET  model  was  chosen  over 
other neural networks because it allows for the integration of a variety of 
contextual  information  extraction  techniques,  including  multilevel 
feature fusions, encoder-decoder frameworks, residual connections, U- 
shaped networks, and multiscale feature extractions, into the network 
design process. Moreover, the MU-NET has the ability to extract char-
acteristics at multiple scales. Furthermore, this approach considerably 
avoids  the  increase  in  memory  and  processing  costs  as  the  network 
deepens. Many salinity indicators have been developed in soil salinity 
research, especially to assess the relationship between soil salinity and 
surface reflectance. Unlike comparable studies in the literature, the 5- 
band RapidEye multispectral image used in this study has more bands 
overall due to the addition of the various salinity indices. Furthermore,

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, there isn't explicit mention of specific measures such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, some aspects related to the training process might contribute to improving the model's performance and potentially enhance its generalization capabilities.

Firstly, the normalization and standardization of the training set help prevent any single feature from dominating the others during the learning process, which could lead to better generalization. Secondly, using a batch size of 32 ensures efficient utilization of computational resources without exceeding memory limits, allowing the model to learn from different subsets of the data. Lastly, employing an early stopping mechanism halts the learning process when there is no further improvement in accuracy after 20 epochs, preventing overfitting and promoting better generalization.

Although these practices may indirectly improve the model's generalizability, they do not directly address the query regarding specific methods like diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, we cannot definitively state what measures were explicitly taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model concerning those particular methods.
