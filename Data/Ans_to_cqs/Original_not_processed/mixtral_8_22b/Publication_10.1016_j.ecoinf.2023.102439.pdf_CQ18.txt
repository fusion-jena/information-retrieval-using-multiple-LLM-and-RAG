Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

The model’s training was conducted using data from 2005 to 2015, 
encompassing 264 data points. Subsequently, data from 2016 to 2018, 
comprising  72  data  points,  were  reserved  for  testing  and  validation 
purposes.  This  data  partitioning  resulted  in  a  distribution  of  60%  for 
training and 40% for validation and testing. 

To evaluate the performance of the model, several statistical metrics 
were  employed,  including  the  Mean  Absolute  Percent  Error  (MAPE), 
Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and cor-
relation coefficient (R). These metrics provide insights into the accuracy 
and predictive capability of the model by measuring the deviation be-
tween the predicted EVI values and the actual observed values.

By employing the W-ANN model, the training values reached 96% 
for Iznik and 91% for Alanya, while the estimated percentages for all 
data increased to 95% for Iznik and 88% for Alanya, respectively. The 
developed hybrid model improved learning success, with an increase of 
18.7%  in  Iznik  and  7.3%  in  Alanya,  as  determined  by  the  network’s 
performance.  These  findings  highlight  the  hybrid  model’s  enhanced 
predictive capabilities and effectiveness in both study areas.

3. Results 

As indicated before, the ANN model utilised in this study comprises 
an  input,  hidden,  and  output  layer.  The  input  layer  comprises  three 
processing elements (neurons) corresponding to the LST, temperature, 
and precipitation parameters. The EVI data was used as the output layer. 
The number of neurons in the hidden layer is a crucial factor influencing 
the learning capability of the network. Insufficient neurons may hinder 
successful learning, while excessive neurons may lead to over fitting and 
compromise the network’s performance (Çakır, 2018). In this study, the 
number of neurons in the hidden layer was incrementally to determine 
the optimal configuration that yields the best results.

Helpful Answer:
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves utilizing various statistical metrics such as Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE), Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and correlation coefficient (R). These metrics help measure the deviation between the predicted Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) values and the actual observed values, providing insights into the accuracy and predictive capability of the model. Additionally, the study employs a hybrid model called W-ANN, which improves learning success and enhances predictive capabilities. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model used in this study consists of an input, hidden, and output layer. The input layer includes three processing elements or neurons corresponding to Land Surface Temperature (LST), temperature, and precipitation parameters. The EVI data serves as the output layer. To optimize the network's performance, the number of neurons in the hidden layer is gradually increased until the best results are achieved. Tables 3 and 4 present the comparison of the MSE and R values of the number of neurons in the ANN system and the ANN Model performance for Iznik and Alanya, respectively.
