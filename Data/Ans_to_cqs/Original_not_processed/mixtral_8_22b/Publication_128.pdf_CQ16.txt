Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

2.5. Model training 

  To ensure the accuracy of the experimental results and obtain the best classification, the exact 
parameters  and  functions  as  well  as  classifier  built-in  the  six  neural  network  models  are 
designed as follows: 

  The resolution of input data is 224×224 with Red Green Blue (RGB) format, and the inputs 

are batch normalized before training; 

  Batch size is applied which is set to 30 when training, but images are tested one by one; 
  An  optimized  rectified  linear  activation,  Leaky  ReLU,  was  introduced  into  models  after 

convolution or concatenate layer; 

In MobileNet, width multiplier is 1.2, resolution multiplier is 1; 

  Learning rate and dropout rate adopt same value 0.001, bias value is 0;  
 
  For the neural networks with lower depth, the higher training epochs are, the higher probability 
of over fitting is. Therefor models in which less than 100 layers adhibit raw data 60 epochs, 
otherwise executed 80 epochs;

metrics. The highest score indicates the highest rank in a array which single sample inferred to n given 
classes, and prediction label is the index of the highest score.  

Model  loss  is  computed  by  compound  loss  which  is  added  by  softmax  cross-entropy  and 
regularization  loss,  which  expresses  the  distance  between  two  distributions.  Lower  cross  entropy  is, 
mutual  closer  are.  Regularization  loss  is  inserted  to  reduce  overfitting,  which  balances  model 
performance and model complexity. On purpose of normalizing losses, softmax is introduced to map 
true loss value to between zero to one. 

2.5. Model training

  A fully connected layer with softmax activation has 28 nodes, which is regarded as classifier 

while training but removed when inference. 

2.6. Computational resources and environment 
In this study, the operation system is CentOS Linux release 7.7.1908 (Core) with 32 CPUs and each 
CPU has 64 processors. The develop environment built-up is Python(version 3.6.2) packaged by Conda-
forge which compiled with GCC (version4.8.2,20140120). Tool packages used in virtual environment 
are the TensorFlow (version 1.12.0) and the Numpy (version 1.19.2).

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention any specific criteria for determining when training is complete. However, it can be inferred from the information provided that the number of training epochs is used as a criterion for stopping the training process. Specifically, the text mentions that models with fewer than 100 layers use 60 epochs, while those with more than 100 layers use 80 epochs. This suggests that the authors have determined empirically that these numbers of epochs are sufficient for achieving good performance on their task without overfitting. Additionally, the fact that regularization loss is included in the computation of model loss implies that the authors are taking steps to prevent overfitting during training. Overall, while there may be other factors considered when deciding when to stop training, such as monitoring the validation loss or accuracy, the text does not provide explicit details about these considerations.
