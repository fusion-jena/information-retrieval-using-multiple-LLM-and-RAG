Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

In this study, the structure of the CNN model includes an image input 
layer, a convolutional layer with a kernel size of 2 × 2 × 25, a maximum 
pooling layer with a kernel size of 2 × 2, two fully connected layers, and 
a regression output layer (Fig. 2c). The number of nodes in the first fully 
connected layer is 10, and in the second fully connected layer is 1. The 
structure of the LSTM model includes a sequence input layer, an LSTM 
layer with 60 nodes, two fully connected layers, and a regression output 
layer (Fig. 2c). The number of nodes in the first fully connected layer is 
10, and in the second fully connected layer is 1.

The  forecast  performance  of  deep  learning  models  varies  across 
different Chl concentration regions. In the high Chl concentration region 
(point A), the R2  values are the lowest, while in the low Chl concen-
tration region (point C), the R2 values are the highest (Fig. 6). Among the 
models,  the  hybrid  CNN-LSTM  consistently  achieves  the  highest  R2 
values  across  all  regions,  whereas  the  CNN  model  has  the  lowest  R2 
values (Fig. 6).

indicate that the hybrid CNN-LSTM model outperforms both standalone 
CNN  and  LSTM  model  (Fig.  4–7).  The  hybrid  model  combines  the 
strengths of CNN and LSTM networks, offers significant advantages over 
using either network alone.

Helpful Answer:

Three types of deep learning models were used in the pipeline: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and a hybrid CNN-LSTM model.

The CNN model consists of an image input layer, a convolutional layer with a kernel size of 2 × 2 × 25, a max pooling layer with a kernel size of 2 × 2, and two fully connected layers followed by a regression output layer.

The LSTM model comprises a sequence input layer, an LSTM layer with 60 nodes, two fully connected layers, and a regression output layer. Both the CNN and LSTM models have the same number of nodes in their respective fully connected layers, i.e., 10 and 1.

Lastly, the hybrid CNN-LSTM model combines the strengths of both CNN and LSTM networks. This model was found to consistently achieve the highest R2 values across all regions compared to the standalone CNN and LSTM models.
