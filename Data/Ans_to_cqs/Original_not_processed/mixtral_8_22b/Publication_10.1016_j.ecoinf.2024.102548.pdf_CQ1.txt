3. Deep learning techniques 

In the Deep Learning section, we delve into the technical aspects of 
our  model.  We  utilize  RNNs  to  effectively  capture  sequential  de-
pendencies in the data. RNNs, such as LSTM and GRUs, allow our model 
to retain and propagate information from previous steps, enhancing its 
understanding of sequential patterns. Additionally, we employ transfer 
learning  techniques,  initializing  our  model  with  pre-trained  weights 
from  large-scale  datasets  like  ImageNet.  This  transfer  of  knowledge 
enhances  the  model’s  performance  by  leveraging  learned  representa-
tions  from  related  tasks.  Detailed  explanations  and  implementation 
specifics of RNNs and transfer learning are provided in the subsequent 
subsections.

3.2.4. ResNet-50 

ResNet-50 is a widely used deep residual neural network architecture 
that addresses the challenges of training very deep networks. It employs 
residual blocks with skip connections to enable the flow of gradients and 
facilitate the training of deeper models. ResNet-50 has been pre-trained 
on  large-scale  datasets,  allowing  it  to  capture  complex  patterns  and 
achieve strong performance.

InceptionV3 

InceptionV3 is an advanced CNN architecture that incorporates the 
concept of inception modules. These modules utilize parallel convolu-
tions  of  different  kernel  sizes  to  capture  multi-scale  features.  Incep-
tionV3  has  been  pre-trained  on 
large-scale  datasets  and  has 
demonstrated  excellent  performance  in  various  image  classification 
tasks.

InceptionResNetV2 

InceptionResNetV2  is  a  fusion  of  the  Inception  and  ResNet  archi-
tectures,  combining  the  benefits  of  both  networks.  It  incorporates  re-
sidual  connections  and  parallel  convolutions  to  capture  fine-grained 
details and high-level features simultaneously. InceptionResNetV2 has 
been  pre-trained  on  extensive  datasets,  enabling  it  to  learn  compre-
hensive feature representations and achieve high performance.

sition process, augmentation techniques employed, parameter settings, 
and the proposed model. The system-level design of our model is illus-
trated  in  Fig.  1.  The  methodology  incorporates  a  range  of  transfer 
learning  models,  including  MobileNet,  EfficientNet,  InceptionV3,

5.1.4. Total model parameters 

Total  parameters  in  a  neural  network encompass  the  aggregate of 
trainable weights and biases, serving as a direct measure of the model’s 
architectural complexity. This parameter count is pivotal in defining the 
model’s capacity for feature extraction and pattern recognition. High- 
parameter  models  are  adept  at  discerning  intricate  data  patterns  but 
are  susceptible  to  overfitting,  particularly  in  scenarios  with  limited 
training samples. Furthermore, such models escalate computational and 
memory  requirements,  potentially  impeding  deployment  in  resource- 
constrained environments.
