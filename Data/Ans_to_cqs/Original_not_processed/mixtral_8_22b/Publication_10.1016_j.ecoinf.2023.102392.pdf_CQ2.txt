3.2. Classification of forest types by XGBoost 

To  classify  LULC,  various  methodologies  have  been  employed  in 
previous  studies  (Zhang  and  Foody,  1998;  Nahuelhual  et  al.,  2012; 
Zhang  et  al.,  2013;  Do  et  al.,  2022b;  Do  and  Tran,  2022).  In  this 
particular investigation, the XGBoost image classification approach was 
utilized to evaluate changes in the surface water of Dak Nong province 

from 2005 to 2022 because it reveals a capacity to identify features in 
large image datasets (Hamedianfar et al., 2022). Over the years in the 
present study, the total accuracy of the XGBoost classification approach, 
which  combines  UAV  data  with  SPOT  satellite  images  of  Dak  Nong 
Province,  has exceeded 86%  (Table 7),  which is  similar to  that using 
random forest method in Do et al. (2022b). Furthermore, the classifi-
cation accuracy determined from the precision, recall, F1, and Kappa

have  demonstrated  that  deep  learning  models  perform  well  in  object 
recognition and categorization (Shetty, 2019; Talukdar et al., 2020). In 
particular, the eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model has gained 
popularity  due  to  its  ability  to  identify  features  and  patterns  in  large 
image datasets (Friedman, 2001; Hamedianfar et al., 2022). Neverthe-
less, the application of deep learning models to detect and categorize 
forest  types  utilizing  high  spatial  and  ultra-high  resolution  remote 
sensing data is still uncommon (Georganos et al., 2018). Moreover, the 
risk of forest fire is also affected by the features of the forest condition 
(Reich et al., 2001). During dry weather, the forest states with numerous 
oil trees, vines, dry branches, and fallen leaves will burn more quickly 
than in other forest conditions (Doran et al., 2004; Ebright et al., 2023; 
Hardison,  1976).  As  a  result,  reliable  forest-type  categorization  is

required urgently to enhance the performance of the fire risk prediction 
model (Alkhatib et al., 2023). This study aims to enhance further the use 
of  deep  learning  models  in  overlay  categorization  utilizing  images 
collected  by  unmanned  aerial  vehicles  (UAVs)  and  SPOT  satellite 
equipment with flexibility.

2.2. Unmanned aerial vehicle data processing 

Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data is processed using CATALYST 
PROFESSIONAL image processing software. The UAV data processing 
process is divided into six significant steps.  

i)  Camera parameter correction: this stage aids in identifying and 
correcting  image  distortions  caused  by  lens  curvature,  focal 
length, and perspective effects;  

ii)  Set up  connection points: A linked point is  a  spot that may  be 
visually recognized on overlapping areas between two or more 
images;  

iii)  Point fine-tuning: in this stage, the constraint points established 
in the previous step are improved to eliminate those with high 
error values (values more than 0.5) that were deleted from the 
computational model;  

iv)  Edit ground control points: Establish ground control points to edit 
the  dataset’s  georeferenced  to  the  WGS84/UTM  coordinate 
system;

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline for forest type classification. However, based on the information given, we can infer that the primary data format used is likely image data. Specifically, the study employs the XGBoost image classification approach, which suggests that the input data consists of images. Additionally, the text mentions combining UAV data with SPOT satellite images, indicating that both sources provide imagery data. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning pipeline primarily uses image data for forest type classification.
