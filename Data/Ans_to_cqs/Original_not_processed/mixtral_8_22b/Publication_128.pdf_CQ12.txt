2.5. Model training 

  To ensure the accuracy of the experimental results and obtain the best classification, the exact 
parameters  and  functions  as  well  as  classifier  built-in  the  six  neural  network  models  are 
designed as follows: 

  The resolution of input data is 224×224 with Red Green Blue (RGB) format, and the inputs 

are batch normalized before training; 

  Batch size is applied which is set to 30 when training, but images are tested one by one; 
  An  optimized  rectified  linear  activation,  Leaky  ReLU,  was  introduced  into  models  after 

convolution or concatenate layer; 

In MobileNet, width multiplier is 1.2, resolution multiplier is 1; 

  Learning rate and dropout rate adopt same value 0.001, bias value is 0;  
 
  For the neural networks with lower depth, the higher training epochs are, the higher probability 
of over fitting is. Therefor models in which less than 100 layers adhibit raw data 60 epochs, 
otherwise executed 80 epochs;

AlexNet: In 2012, Krizhevsky et al.[28] constructed a model with more convolutional layers than 
LeNet for better high-dimensional feature extraction, and then three fully connected layers are used after 
flatten layer to pool channel information. This model employed rectified linear activation (ReLU) as 
activation  function  to  speed  up  training  process,  which  partially  solved  the  vanishing  gradient  and 
exploding problem. Features of each layer in AlexNet were depicted in Figure 2. Feature visualization 
of  AlexNet  layer  by  layer.  The  annotations  above  are  defined  as  Name𝑑@k×k,  and  the  annotations 
below  are  denominated  in  form  of  Operation𝑑@r×r.  Where d , k and r is  feature  depth,  convolution 
kernel and image resolution, respectively..

InceptionNet: In 2014, Szegedy et al.[29] proposed a new architecture with poly depth pathway, 
which enhances computational resources usage efficiency. The InceptionNet includes four sub-paths for 
convolution and each pathway has different convolutional kernel and operation layers: 1) convolution 
path with kernel size 1×1; 2) max-pooling with step 3×3 followed by convolution with kernel 1×1; 3) 
two convolutions with 1×1 and 3×3, respectively; 4) two convolutions with kernel size 1×1 and 5×5. 
The network is constructed over 27 layers with ReLU, which speeds up training time significantly and 
has better batch-normalization.

  A fully connected layer with softmax activation has 28 nodes, which is regarded as classifier 

while training but removed when inference. 

2.6. Computational resources and environment

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it can be determined that the deep learning models used in the pipeline are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Specifically, the paper mentions the use of AlexNet and InceptionNet, both of which are popular types of CNN architectures. AlexNet was developed by Krizhevsky et al. in 2012 and consists of multiple convolutional layers for improved high-dimensional feature extraction, followed by three fully connected layers for pooling channel information. On the other hand, InceptionNet was proposed by Szegedy et al. in 2014 and features a unique architecture with poly depth pathways, allowing for enhanced computational resource usage efficiency. It also employs ReLU activations and has better batch normalization capabilities. Therefore, based on these descriptions, we can conclude that the deep learning models used in the pipeline are indeed CNNs.
