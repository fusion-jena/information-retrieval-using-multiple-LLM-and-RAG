SVR is a machine learning method known for its superior accuracy 
compared  with  other  machine  learning  methods  and  its  ability  to 
simplify parameters, achieve global optimization, and handle nonlinear 
problems  (Chen  et  al., 2017;  Ji et  al.,  2021). In  this  study, the  expo-
(cid:0) 8–21,  σ  =
nential  parameters  were  set  as  follows:  C  = 20–210,  ε  = 2
(cid:0) 8–21 (Yang et al., 2022). Table 2 presents the training results for the 
2
hyperparameter-optimized  SVR  model.  Parameter  C  controls  error 
tolerance during training and determines the maximum deviation that 
the model permits for any individual training example. A higher C value 
allows for a larger error, which makes the model more likely to fit the 
training  data  but  also  increases  the  risk  of  overfitting.  Conversely,  a 
smaller  C  value  imposes  stricter  constraints  on  the  model,  thereby 
increasing  the  difficultly  of  fitting  the  training  data  but  potentially

3.4.1. SLSTM method 

An LSTM network is a recurrent neural network (RNN) that can learn 
long-term dependencies in sequential data, and an SLSTM model is an 
extension of an LSTM model that can forecast seasonal time-series data 
(Ma  et  al.,  2015),(Graves  and  Graves,  2012).  Compared  with  LSTM 
models, SLSTM models include an additional input layer for processing 
seasonal time series, which is fed through a seasonal convolutional layer 
to  extract  relevant  seasonal  features.  An  SLSTM  unit  involves  the 
following steps:  

(1)  Seasonal decomposition is performed using Eq. (7), in which sx t 
represents the data after seasonal decomposition, χt  denotes the

4.3. Analysis of forecasting results 

In this study, an SGRU-based deep learning approach was adopted to 
develop  a  model  for  accurately  predicting  (over  36  months)  the

Deep  learning  methods  are  being  widely  applied to  create  models 
directly from large volumes of complex data (Seng et al., 2021). Deep 
learning methods have superior performance for time-series prediction 
than  do  many  other  models  (Li  et  al.,  2019b).  SLSTM  has  been  suc-
cessfully used to predict agricultural product sales (Yoo and Oh, 2020). 
To mitigate the high price volatility of agricultural products, sales vol-
ume can be forecasted before production for reducing production risks 
and  facilitating  agricultural  planning,  ultimately  minimizing  post-
production  price  fluctuations.  In  a  case  study,  an  SLSTM  model  was 
found  to  exhibit  lower  errors  and  considerably  higher  performance 
compared with the ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM models. In another case 
study, an SGRU model was used for successfully predicting the Pacific 
decadal  oscillation  index  at  multiple  time  scales  and  achieved  mean

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to use a random stratified sampling technique or a temporal split when dealing with time-series data. The typical ratios used for splitting the dataset are 60-20-20 (train-test-validation) or 80-10-10, depending on the size of the dataset and the specific requirements of the project. It is essential to ensure that the splits maintain the same distribution as the original dataset to avoid introducing bias into the model.
