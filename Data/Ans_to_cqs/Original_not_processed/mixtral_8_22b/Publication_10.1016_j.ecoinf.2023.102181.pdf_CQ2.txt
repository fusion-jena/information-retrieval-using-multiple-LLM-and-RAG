Ways  in  which  to  minimize  biased  training  of  machine  learning 
models  with  clustered  data  is  an  outstanding  challenge  (e.g.,  Meyer 
et al., 2018, 2019). We hypothesize that the improvements to predictive 
performance observed here using covariance-weighted bagging may be 
a  result  of  reduced  bias  during  model  training  from  down-weighting 
over-sampled  information,  but  this  was  not  tested  explicitly.  A  suit-
able experiment to explore this topic could simulate a surface from a pre- 
defined combination of response functions to environmental variables, 
and  test  for  the  capacity  to  recover  the  responses  using  covariance 
weighted bagging under various clustering scenarios. Simultaneously, it 
would be informative to observe the automatic variable selection and 
regularization behaviour of the bagging model. 

5. Conclusions

KDE weighting may be used to incorporate the sampling intensity for 
validation (de Bruin et al., 2022) but the subjective selection of kernel 
function and bandwidth may impact the resulting weights. A range of 
heuristic  methods  may  be  used  to  determine  these  parameters  (e.g., 
Scott, 1992; Venables and Ripley, 2002), but there is no guarantee that 
these will result in an optimal KDE for bagging and validation given the 
spatial  autocorrelation  of  map  errors.  Future  work  could  investigate 
optimal bandwidth selectors for these applications. The use of spatial 
partitioning approaches for validation produces the opposite problem; 
only the spatial autocorrelation is considered, and the density of sample 
points is ignored  for the validation. Even if spatial cross-validation is 
performed and test points are independent of the training data, clustered 
points still contribute equally to the validation statistics. The evaluation

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide explicit information about the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the references mentioned, we can infer that the study might involve geospatial or environmental data, such as soil class prediction or marine benthic habitat mapping. This suggests that the data format could include raster images (for representing maps or satellite imagery), vector data (for point locations or polygons), or CSV files containing tabular data related to environmental variables. Without more detailed information, it is difficult to confirm the exact data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.
