* The number of neurons in successive dense layers is separated by a comma, with the dropout rate in parentheses if a dropout layer existed after a dense layer. 

lagged variables were added this improvement only took place for the 
test set. Therefore, in order to reach a balance between the train and test 
fractions, the optimal model to classify the days as presenting thermal 
stratification or not was the model with up to 4 days-lagged variables. 
This model presents a testing accuracy of 96.0% and AUC of 0.99.

Table 2 contains the best set of hyperparameters found for each set of 
variables,  together  with  the  results  from  the  training  on  the  whole 
training data set and test on unseen data. During the cross-validation 
process,  there  were  no  discrepancies  among  the  three  metrics  used. 
Generally, the best model for each set of variables was optimal regarding 
the three metrics or the differences were <1%. In case of these small 
discrepancies, the model with the highest AUC was chosen. The first row 
in Table 2, represented as t in the column of variables, contains the re-
sults of the model with only variables that are contemporaneous with 
the target. The row represented as + t-1 contains the variables in t and 
the 1-day lagged variables, and so on in the following rows. The number 
of epochs was adjusted to the minimum number of epochs that guar-
anteed the stabilization of the loss curve in the four folds of the cross- 
validation.

Opposite to other families of ML models that have a narrow range of 
hyperparameters  to  adjust,  ANN  are  defined  by  different  types  of 
hyperparameters,  which  together  with  the  computational  cost  of 
training deep ANN, restricts the options to optimize. On the one hand, 
we have the hyperparameters that define the architecture of the ANN 
(number of layers and number of neurons), while on the other hand we 
have the hyperparameters that control de training process (mainly the 
learning rate, the optimizer, the batch size and the number of epochs 
that the training lasts). In order to avoid an exhaustive search that could 
consume a lot of time, a small dimensional space was initially defined 
and  explored  with  the  original variables.  The initial  hyperparameters 
that composed this space are shown in Table 1. The number of epochs 
was maintained in 500 as it proved to guarantee the stabilization of the

The result of this process was added to the dataset as a new cate-
gorical binary variable that stored the existence of stratification or not 
(took the value of 0 when the reservoir was not stratified and 1 when it 
was stratified).

Helpful Answer:
During the cross-validation process, three metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. These metrics include testing accuracy, MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and AUC (Area Under Curve). The best model for each set of variables was selected based on its performance across these three metrics. In cases where there were small discrepancies among the metrics, the model with the highest AUC was chosen.
