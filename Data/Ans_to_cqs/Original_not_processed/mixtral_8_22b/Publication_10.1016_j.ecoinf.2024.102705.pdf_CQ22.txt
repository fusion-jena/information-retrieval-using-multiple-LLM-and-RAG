The term “deep learning” refers to the utilization of neural networks, 
a statistical model for data representation in solving complex problems 
(LeCun  et  al.,  2015;  Christopher  and  Hugh,  2024).  These  neural  net-
works are constructed through training, involving a large set of inputs 
and  labeled outputs. Comprising layered nonlinear transformations, a 
neural  network  contains  numerous  adjustable  parameters.  Training  a 
neural network requires multiple iterations, during which the network 
may produce incorrect results. The discrepancy between the current and 
expected outputs is calculated as loss values. Optimization algorithms 
such as Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) (Herbert and Sutton, 1951), 
Adaptive Gradient (AdaGrad) (Duchi et al., 2011), Root Mean Square 
Prop (RMSProp) (Tieleman and Hinton, 2012), and Adam (Kingma and 
Ba, 2014) are then employed to assess each parameter’s contribution to

feature representations, which are crucial for predicting the threshold of 
image  processing  algorithms  (Wang  et  al.,  2018).  In  this  study,  we 
propose a compact network incorporating a non-local layer capable of 
extracting  long-distance  features  to  predict  parameters  for  the  image 
processing module. Additionally, we introduce a joint training approach 
for image adaptive enhancement modules and deep learning models to 
ensure  that  the  image  processing  results  contribute  to  improved  per-
formance  of  the  deep  learning  model.  The  proposed  method  demon-
strates superior performance across a diverse range of environments. it 
enables  expedited  transitions  from  field  surveys  to  reporting,  even  in 
challenging circumstances, thereby facilitating efficient data collection 
and analysis on a larger scale.

our method exhibits improved accuracy by 1.35% and 0.08% in com-
parison to IA-YOLO on both datasets, respectively. This serves as evi-
dence  that the  non-local layers  incorporated into  the  CNN  effectively 
extract  long-distance  features  that  facilitate  parameter  prediction.  In 
additional  baseline  experiments,  the  model  with  added  AIP  module 
improved  by  1.47%  and  2.27%  compared  to  the  YOLOv8s  baseline 
model on both datasets, respectively. This proves that our proposed AIP 
module can be flexibly applied to different baseline models and improve 
its performance in low-quality images.

• The proposed method can be seamlessly integrated into pre-existing 
deep learning models, enhancing their resilience and performance in 
low-quality environments.

Helpful Answer:

In the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall being used to measure the performance of the deep learning model. However, based on common practices in evaluating deep learning models, these metrics could potentially have been used.

For instance, when comparing the proposed method to IA-YOLO and YOLOv8s baselines, improvements in terms of percentage points are mentioned. While not explicitly stated, these improvements might refer to increases in accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, or other similar metrics commonly used in object detection tasks.

Additionally, the text mentions that the proposed method demonstrates superior performance across various environments, enabling faster transitions from field surveys to reporting, especially in challenging conditions. This suggests that the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the deep learning model were considered while evaluating its performance.

However, without more detailed information about the exact evaluation process and criteria, it is impossible to definitively state which specific metrics were used to gauge the performance of the deep learning model.
