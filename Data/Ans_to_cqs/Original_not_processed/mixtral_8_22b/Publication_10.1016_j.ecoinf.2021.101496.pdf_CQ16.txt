value gained by SPAD-502Plus (Fig. 6). Furthermore, modelling of the 
SPAD  value  was  performed  by  a)  a  simple  linear  model  (LM),  b)  a 
generalized linear model with a gamma distribution (GLM), and c) an 
artificial neural network (ANN). The dataset contained 89 valid records 
(outliers were removed according to the empirical rule), while one re-
cord represented the mean value of the total 10 spot measurements on 
one  leaf.  For  the  purpose  of  SPAD  value  modelling,  the  dataset  was 
divided  into  a  “training  dataset”  containing  60  randomly  selected  re-
cords and a “testing dataset” that contained the remaining 29 records. 
All three models were then fitted using the “training dataset” and further 
validated using the “testing dataset”.

“chlorophyll index” that has been shown to be related to relative chlo-
rophyll  content,  and  the  relationship  is  described  using  a  calibration 
equation  (Richardson  et  al.,  2002).  Despite  a  variety  of  available 
portable instruments, SPAD-502 is the standard method of nondestruc-
tive LCC estimation. The SPAD-502 has been used in over 200 studies 
related  to  agricultural  research  purposes  (Uddling  et  al.,  2007).  In 
practice, information about the actual plant status is often crucial for 
decision-making  and  scheduling  agricultural  operations,  including 
fertilization, irrigation, or pest control. Properly interpreted results then 
enable  a)  increased  primary  productivity,  b)  allocation  of  sources 
reasonably, and c) adaptation of agricultural management to assure the 
highest crop yields (Wang et al., 2013; Zhai et al., 2020). In such prac-
tical  cases,  however,  the  affordability  of  the  abovementioned  in-

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit details regarding the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, it mentions that the dataset was divided into a "training dataset" containing 60 randomly selected records and a "testing dataset" containing the remaining 29 records. This suggests that the training process might have involved some form of cross-validation, where the performance of the model on the testing dataset could serve as an indicator of its generalization ability.

In machine learning, common criteria used to determine when training should stop include observing a plateau in the validation loss, reaching a predefined number of epochs, or meeting a certain threshold for the desired metric (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.) on the validation set. Without more specific information from the given context, it can only be inferred that similar principles may apply here.
