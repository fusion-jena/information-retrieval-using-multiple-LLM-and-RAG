For machine learning methods such as RF models, the quality of the 
training samples can seriously affect their prediction results. Although 
this study utilised the pixel quality control metrics of MODIS products to 
eliminate  cloud-contaminated  and  poor-quality  pixels  and  to  remove 
outliers  from  the  training  samples,  the  surface  of  the  study  area  was 
highly heterogeneous compared to that of Zhai et al. (2020). To ensure 
that a sufficient number of LAI training samples could be selected, the 
main  algorithm  saturated  the  pixels  during  the  selection  of  the  LAI 
training  samples,  but  this  increased  the  high-value  LAI  uncertainty 
(Kang  et  al.,  2021).  Jamali  et  al.  (2023)  used  a  variety  of  machine 
learning  algorithms  to  estimate  various  leaf  parameters  for  wheat 
leaves, concluding that deep neural networks were the most capable of 
improving the prediction accuracy of leaf parameters. Therefore, field

period  of  lush  vegetation.  Therefore,  the  selected  training  samples 
lacked low-value LAI samples, resulting in a lack of training in this part 
of the RF model, which could not predict low-value LAI accurately.

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide information on specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that deep neural networks have been found to improve prediction accuracy for estimating various leaf parameters. Regularization techniques commonly used in deep learning pipelines include dropout and L2 regularization. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored or "dropped out" during training, which helps prevent overfitting by making the network more robust. L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, discouraging large weights and promoting simpler models, thus reducing overfitting. Other regularization methods include early stopping, weight decay, and batch normalization. These techniques help prevent overfitting by introducing constraints on the complexity of the model, allowing it to generalize better to unseen data.
