Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Among the five MLMs evaluated, the AUC analysis revealed that RF 
and SVM performed remarkably well with training AUC values of 0.868 
± 0.002 and 0.857 ± 0.001, respectively. MARS followed this, and BRT 
gained  training  AUC  scores  of  0.829  ± 0.001  and  0.809  ± 0.002, 
respectively,  while  CART  exhibited  poor  performance  with  a  low 
training AUC of 0.781 ± 0.001. Similar trends were observed for TSS, 
where  RF,  SVM,  MARS,  BRT  outperform  CART  (Table  3).  All  models 
exhibited  robust  agreement  with  the  predicted  results  in  terms  of  ac-
curacy.  Additionally,  when  considering  the  kappa  and  phi  for  recog-
nizing  accurate  forest  fire  pixels,  all  models,  RF,  SVM,  MARS,  BRT 
outperformed CART (Table 3). The Δ  AUC was lowest for CART with 
0.002, followed by MARS and BRT with both values of 0.003. The Δ AUC 
was  highest  for  RF  and  SVM  with  the  values  of  0.022  and  0.021,

Question: %INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the provided pieces of context to answer the query in less than 400 words. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

%Query
Query: "Which hardware resources are used for training the deep learning model (e.g., GPUs, TPUs)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The paper does not provide information on the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether GPUs, TPUs, or other types of hardware were utilized.
