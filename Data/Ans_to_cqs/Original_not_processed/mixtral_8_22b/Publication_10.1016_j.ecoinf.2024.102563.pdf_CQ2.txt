Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the references mentioned in the text that the research involves the use of remote sensing data, which typically includes satellite or airborne images. The table presented in the context also suggests that the researchers have utilized spectral data along with other parameters such as mean and entropy extracted using different window sizes. Therefore, it can be concluded that the data format used in this particular deep learning pipeline is primarily image data.
