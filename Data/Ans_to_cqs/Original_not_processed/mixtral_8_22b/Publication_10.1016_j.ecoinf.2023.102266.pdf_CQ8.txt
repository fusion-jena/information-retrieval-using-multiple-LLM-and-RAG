Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Moreover, the computational cost grows exponentially with the in-
crease  in  the  number  of  variables  in  the  model  and  the  grid  size  for 
analysis. Despite the potential for parallelization to improve efficiency, 
obtaining accurate results under such circumstances can be challenging 
due to computational demands. 

A  critical  consideration  involves  the  estimator  used  in  the  Monte 
Carlo method, which relies on the average of test results Eq. 6. However, 
it is noteworthy that this estimator may not always minimize variance. 
This observation presents an opportunity for future research to explore 
techniques for variance reduction, see Section 6.

5.1. Limitations of the model as a classification model 

Our classification model is built upon the Monte Carlo method. While 
Monte Carlo codes have achieved significant sophistication, simulations 

suffer  from  the  drawback  of  demanding  extensive  computational  re-
sources  to  attain  an  adequate  level  of  result  confidence.  Hence,  it  is 
crucial to acknowledge the associated limitations. 

Specifically, a substantial number of tests may be required. Insuffi-
cient  testing  could  lead  to  a  heightened  sampling  error,  resulting  in 
overly broad confidence intervals. Ensuring an ample number of trials is 
crucial to obtain more precise and reliable estimates.

makes our model a powerful tool for predicting real-world phenomena 
such as wildfire spreads or pest plants propagation, since we take into 
account the most important variables in the representation.

Therefore, while our classification model harnesses the power of the 
Monte Carlo method, its practical application requires careful consid-
eration  of  the  computational  challenges  and  the  need  for  a  sufficient 
number of trials to ensure reliable results. Exploring innovative variance 
reduction  techniques  (Kleijnen  et  al.,  2010;  Botev  and  Ridder,  2017) 
would help to improve the model’s accuracy and broaden its applica-
bility in future research and real-world applications. 

5.2. Application to a real wildfire 

Since our model can be used as a Monte Carlo method, we apply it to 
a  real  case.  We  consider  the  wildfire  in  Vall  de  Gallinera  (Valencian 
Community, Spain) in August 2020, see Fig. 10. This is part of a database 
of  wildfires  in  our  community,  which  we  are  setting  up,  see  Supple-
mentary Data. 

Then, the estimate that our model would make is given by Fig. 12, 

assuming Fig. 11 as our climate conditions for θ and ρ.
