the desiccation of the lake between 1996 and 2016. The drying of the 
lake can create a salty zone (with an area covering approximately 6000 
km2) that has the potential to generate dust and salt storms, polluting 
the air in the basin and its vicinity. The increase in water body since 
2015  showed  that  the  restoration  of  the  lake  is  possible.  Since  2015, 
agricultural activities have been reduced, which can be due to the lack of 
water for irrigation, the increase in soil salinity in the basin, and the 
policies adopted by the government to rehabilitate the lake.

1. Introduction

The river runoff variation given in Fig. 8(a) shows a decrease in the 
volume of incoming water from 3520 Mm3  to 700 Mm3, which means 
that the volume of incoming water has decreased to almost one fifth. 
Many factors are involved in the occurrence of such conditions, which 
can generally be divided into two categories. First, the factors that are 
related  to  human  activities,  which  include  excessive  use  of  water  re-
sources, excessive development of agriculture around the lake, and the 
structures built in the basin. One of the human activities is changing the 
cultivation  pattern  and  creating  unconventional  deep  wells  in  the  re-
gion, especially between 1985 and 2014. At this time, the cultivation of 
water-based  agricultural  products  increased  from  350,000  ha  to 
500,000 ha. The construction of dams caused a sharp decrease in the 
catchment  water  of  the  lake,  which,  with  these  unplanned  dams  and

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved to ensure that the input data is suitable for the model. These steps may vary depending on the specific application and dataset but often include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing or correcting any inconsistencies, errors, or missing values in the dataset. It also includes handling outliers and dealing with categorical variables if necessary.

2. Feature Scaling/Normalization: Deep learning models work best when all features are on a similar scale. Therefore, it is common practice to standardize or normalize the feature values so they fall within a certain range (usually between 0 and 1). Common methods used for this purpose include Min-Max Normalization, Z-score Normalization, and Log Transformation.

3. Encoding Categorical Variables: If the dataset contains categorical variables, they need to be converted into numerical form using techniques like label encoding or one-hot encoding.

4. Data Augmentation: To improve the performance of the model and prevent overfitting, additional synthetic data can be generated through various transformations applied to the existing data. Examples include rotation, flipping, zooming, cropping, etc.

5. Splitting Dataset: Before training the model, the dataset should be split into three subsets - training set, validation set, and test set. Typically, 60-80% of the data is allocated for training, while the remaining is equally distributed between validation and testing.

6. Handling Class Imbalance: If the target variable is imbalanced (i.e., there are significantly more instances of one class compared to others), techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or SMOTE can be employed to balance the classes.
