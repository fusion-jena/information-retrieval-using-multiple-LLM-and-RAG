Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Sustainable natural resources management relies on effective and timely assessment of conservation and land 
management practices. Using satellite imagery for Earth observation has become essential for monitoring land 
cover/land use (LCLU) changes and identifying critical areas for conserving biodiversity. Remote Sensing (RS) 
datasets  are  often  quite  large  and require  tremendous  computing power  to  process.  The  emergence  of  cloud- 
based  computing  techniques  presents  a  powerful  avenue  to  overcome  computing  limitations  by  allowing 
machine-learning algorithms to process and analyze large RS datasets on the cloud. Our study aimed to classify 
LCLU for the Talassemtane National Park (TNP) using a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model incorporating five 
spectral indices to differentiate six land use classes using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Optimization of the DNN

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not include details about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that the study aimed to classify Land Cover/Land Use (LCLU) for the Talassemtane National Park (TNP) using a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model with Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. To find out where the code repository is located, further research or additional information would be required.
