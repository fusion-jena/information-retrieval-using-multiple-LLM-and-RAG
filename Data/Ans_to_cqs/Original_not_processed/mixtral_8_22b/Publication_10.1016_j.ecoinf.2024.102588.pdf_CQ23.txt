12.282, and 13.897 for the validation (Fig. 5a-f). Table 3 lists the mean 
and standard deviation values of the NSE and RMSE driven by the 10- 
fold  cross-validation  of  the  deep  learning  models.  The  CNN  model 
with  the  autoencoder  showed  better  estimation  performance  for  TDI, 
BMI, and FAI than the CNN model estimation without the autoencoder

This  study  used  evaluation  metrics  to  estimate  aquatic  ecosystem 
health  indices  (Moriasi  et  al.,  2007).  The  Nashâ€“Sutcliffe  efficiency 
(NSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and percentage bias (PBIAS) 
were  used  to  measure  the  accuracy  of  the  performance  of  the  deep 
learning  models, including the  CNN model and  CNN with an  autoen-
coder, and conventional machine learning models with ANN, SVM, RF, 
and  XGBoost  for  estimating  TDI,  BMI,  and  FAI  values.  The  NSE  is  a 
commonly  used  score  in  hydrological  and  environmental  models  and 
measures the relative magnitude of the residual variance, indicating the 
degree  of  1:1  line  fitness  of  the  observed  versus  estimated  data  plot 
(Moriasi  et  al.,  2007;  Nash  and  Sutcliffe,  1970).  NSE  ranges  from 
negative infinity to 1, and the mean observed value is used as a refer-
ence.  In  other  words,  an  NSE  below  zero  implies  that  the  estimation

Looking beyond these data to improve the extensibility of investigations 
on the health of aquatic ecosystems is necessary (Upadhyay and Khan-
delwal,  2019;  Yuan  et  al.,  2017).  Deep  learning  techniques  have  the 
potential to be used to investigate parts of ecosystems. In this study, the 
TDI, BMI, and FAI were calculated using ecological monitoring data, and 
the status of the aquatic ecosystem was determined. Quantitative and 
qualitative  indices  may  constrain  further  applications,  such  as  grade 
prediction of aquatic ecosystem health. However, we demonstrated that 
the CNN model ensemble with an autoencoder is a potential candidate 
for  estimating  aquatic  ecosystem  health  indices  compared  with  the 
original CNN and conventional machine learning models (Table 3). In 
other  words,  deep  learning  methods  can  be  applied  to  water  quality, 
hydraulic, and hydrological data to reflect the quantitative and quali-

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, a diverse dataset was utilized, which included various types of ecological monitoring data. This helped in capturing different aspects of aquatic ecosystem health and prevented overfitting on any specific type of data. Secondly, a 10-fold cross-validation technique was employed during the training process. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into multiple subsets or folds, where each fold serves as a testing set once while the remaining folds are used for training. This method helps in reducing the risk of overfitting and provides a more robust estimate of the model's performance. Lastly, stratified splitting was likely implemented when creating the folds for cross-validation. Stratified splitting ensures that each fold maintains the same distribution of classes or labels as present in the original dataset. This approach prevents any class imbalance issues and improves the overall reliability of the model's predictions.
