with decreasing rainfall, will likely lead to intensified competition.

To  predict  the  distribution  of  the  study  species,  we  employed  an 
ensemble  modeling  approach  in  BIOMOD2  package  (Thuiller  et  al., 
2009) in R (R Development Core Team, 2014) (See text S1). With this 
approach,  we  weight  averaged  four  different  models,  including  one 
regression-based 
three 
machine-learning  (Maximun  entropy  (MaxEnt),  RF(Random  Forest), 
and  Support  Vector  Machines  (SVM))  models,  to  generate  a  final 
ensembled model for each species. To test for model performance, we 
employed cross-validationby using 70% of the dataset as training data to 
build  the  models  and  the  other  30%  as  testing  data  to  calculate  the 
models’  accuracy. The Area Under the Receiving Operator Character-
istics Curve is the index we used to specify the accuracy (AUC). AUC is a 
scale that ranges from 0.5 to 1.0. A higher AUC value indicates that the 
model  is  more  accurate  (Phillips  and  Dudík,  2008).  We  considered  a

Helpful Answer:
The query asks about regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. However, based on the given context, there isn't any direct information regarding regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Nevertheless, I can provide some general insights into these techniques.

Regularization methods are used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function during the training process. This helps to reduce the complexity of the model and improve its ability to generalize well to unseen data. Two common types of regularization methods are L1 and L2 regularizations.

L1 Regularization, also known as Lasso Regression, adds an absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients as penalty term to the loss function. It tends to produce sparse output, driving some of the weights to zero which results in feature selection.

L2 Regularization, also known as Ridge Regression, adds the squared magnitude of coefficients as penalty term to the loss function. Unlike L1, it doesn't result in sparsity but reduces the values of all weights.

Dropout is another popular regularization technique used in deep learning. During training, Dropout randomly sets a fraction rate of input units to 0 at each update, which helps to avoid overfitting.

However, without specific details related to the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context, I cannot confirm if these regularization methods were applied.
