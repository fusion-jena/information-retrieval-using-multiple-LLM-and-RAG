2.2. Transformer-like model 

Transformer  was  proposed  by  Vaswani  et  al.  (2017)  and  initially 
designed for Seq2Seq tasks, replacing long short-term memory (LSTM) 
with a full-attention structure. It was primarily applied in NLP, and both 
the  transformer  and  its  subsequent  iterations  demonstrated  excellent 
performance in a wide range of downstream tasks. With the success of 
the transformer in NLP, researchers have begun to explore its applica-
tion in CV. 

The core structure of the transformer-like visual model is an encoder 
module, which comprises several stacked blocks. Each block consists of 
two  components:  a  token  mixer  module  (Yu  et  al.,  2022)  for  fusing 
spatial information and an MLP module for fusing channel information. 
The main distinction among the different transformer-like visual models 
lies in the variations in the token mixer module. For example, the token 
mixer in a ViT (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) is a self-attention module.

Yuan et al. (2022) claimed that the superior performance of a ViT can 
primarily be attributed to extensive pre-training data. If a ViT is trained 
from  scratch  on  a  medium-sized  dataset,  its  performance  lags  behind 
that of a CNN model with comparable parameter sizes. To address this 
limitation, they proposed Volo with the novel Outlook Attention as the 
token mixer module, which enabled fine-grained token representation 
and the aggregation of global information. 

2.3. MLP-like model

The basic models were trained using a deep transfer-learning strat-
egy based on fine-tuning. The model parameters were initialized using a 
pre-trained model. The final classification layer was then replaced by a 
fully connected layer, aligning its output dimension with the number of 
classes  in  the  target  dataset.  Subsequently,  all  parameters  across  the 
layers were fine-tuned on the target dataset. The basic models in all the 

The  performances  of  the  four  basic  models  and  two  proposed 
ensemble  methods  on  the  IP102  dataset  are  lised  in  Table  2.  The 
parameter  sizes  of  the  four  basic  models  were  comparable,  with 
approximately 24 M parameters for each model. However, there was a 
significant variation in the performances of the basic models, as shown 
in Table 2. ViP-Small/7 exhibited the lowest performance, whereas the 
two  transformer-like  models  demonstrated  better  performance,  with 
Volo-d1 achieving the highest performance.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the text does not provide specific details about the deployment process of the trained deep learning models. Therefore, I cannot provide a precise answer regarding the exact steps taken for model deployment, such as model serialization or platform selection. However, typically, after training a deep learning model, the next step involves saving or serializing the model weights and architecture into a file format like.h5,.onnx, or.pb. This serialized model can later be loaded and used for prediction or further analysis. As for platform selection, depending on the use case, these models could be deployed on various platforms, including cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure, or edge devices like Raspberry Pi or NVIDIA Jetson. But without explicit information from the provided context, I cannot confirm the specific methodology employed in this scenario.
