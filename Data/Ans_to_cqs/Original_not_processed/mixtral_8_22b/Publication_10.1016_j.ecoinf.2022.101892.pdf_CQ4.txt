different VGG nets, such as VGG-11, VGG-16, and VGG-19. VGG-16 has 
been applied in many researches and it is often used to extract features in 
the age estimation tasks Pan et al. (2018). In this study, we replaced the 
last three Fully-Connected (FC) layers of the original VGG model with 
one FC layer to reduce parameters. And we adopt Batch Normalization 
(BN) (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015) to accelerate the training of networks. 
For this study, we selected VGG-11-BN and VGG-16-BN to extract the 
features from panda facial images.

colorjitter,  rotation,  and  erasing.  We  applied  a  Stochastic  Gradient 
Descent  (SGD)  optimizer  with  an  initial  learning  rate  of  0.001,  and 
reduced the learning rate by multiplying 0.1 for every 10 epochs. We set 
our batch size to 64, and set epoch to 60.

We  used  Pytorch  to  build  our  deep  neural  network,  which  was 
trained on Nvidia V100 GPU. In order to accelerate the convergence of 
the model, our model was pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset (Deng 
et  al., 2009) and then independently  fine-tuned on our  PAD Full and 
PAD Lite datasets. However, some individuals cross multiple age groups. 
Thus, to eliminate the influence of individuals, we applied a five-fold 
subject-exclusive  (SE)  (Han  et  al.,  2014;  Pan  et  al.,  2018)  which 
ensured the same subject did not appear in the training set and testing 
set at the same time. We downscaled the resolution of all images to 224 
× 224 pixels before feeding them to seven models. To avoid overfitting 
and imbalanced problem, we applied aggressive data augmentation. Our 
original images were captured under different illumination and angles. 
Thus, we augmented all training sets randomly via horizontal flipping,

Helpful Answer:
The study uses several data augmentation techniques to enhance its deep learning pipeline. These include horizontal flipping, color jitter, rotation, and erasing. Horizontal flipping involves creating new samples by flipping the existing ones horizontally. This technique helps improve the model's ability to generalize better by providing more varied input. Color jitter modifies the brightness, contrast, saturation, or hue of an image to create new variations. Rotation involves rotating the image by a certain degree to generate new samples. Erasing is another technique where parts of the image are removed or obscured to force the model to focus on other features. All these techniques help prevent overfitting and improve the robustness of the model.
