compressed,  reducing  to  only  a  few  pixels  in  deeper  CNN  layers.  For 
instance, an object with dimensions of 15 × 15 pixels in a UAV thermal 
image might be represented by just 1 pixel in the feature map from Layer 
4 of ResNet152 (refer to Fig. 4). The limited spatial resolution can lead to 
loss of fine details, making it difficult for the model to distinguish small 
objects from the background. Through FPN, different feature maps from 
different layers can complement each other, and deeper feature map can 
receive some spatial information from shallower layers. However, still 
certain  spatial  features  might  have  been  lost  during  the  process  of 
convolution operations. Consequently, the models of FRC_ResNet18FPN 
and FRC_ResNet34FPN can obtain higher AP for medium and large ob-
jects than the remaining models because they have less CNN layers than 
others.  Notably,  the  FRC_ResNet152FPN  obtains  the  best  detection

layers mean that more abstractly semantic information can be extracted. 
Therefore, FRC_ResNet152FPN has more advantages than others in this 
sense.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The pipeline uses a type of deep learning model called Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This is evident from several references made throughout the text. For instance, the mention of "feature maps" and "convolution operations" directly points towards the use of CNNs. Furthermore, specific architectures such as ResNet18, ResNet34, and ResNet152 are mentioned, which are all variants of CNNs. Additionally, the paper cites sources related to CNNs, including one titled "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): A Review," further supporting the conclusion that CNNs are the primary deep learning model used in the pipeline.
