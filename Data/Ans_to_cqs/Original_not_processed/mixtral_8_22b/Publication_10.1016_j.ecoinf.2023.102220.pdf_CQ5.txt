the output layer we used the sigmoid activation function. We used the 
LSTM method by adding a long short term memory block on the DNNâ€™s 
architecture  previously  described.  The  implementation  of  the  classifi-
cation methods was carried out in Python using the libraries TensorFlow 
and Scikit-learn (Van Rossum and Drake Jr, 1995). Finally, we obtained 
the accuracy, true positive rate and false positive rate using the afore-
mentioned training-test splits of the time series.

in most comparisons while providing interpretability rather than being a black-box method. It is an improvement 
over current state-of-the-art machine learning tools, especially by non-specialists, such as ecologists aiming to use 
a quantitative approach for pest monitoring. We provide the implemented PBP method in Python through the 
pypbp package.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not explicitly mention any specific dataset used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, we can infer that the authors have employed various machine learning techniques including Deep Neural Networks (DNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and other methods like Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, etc. They have mentioned using the ReLU activation function for hidden layers and sigmoid activation function for the output layer in their DNN architecture. Additionally, they have utilized LSTM by incorporating a long short term memory block into their DNN structure.

Although the context doesn't specify which datasets were used, common datasets often employed in deep learning pipelines include MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet. These datasets consist of images and corresponding labels, making them suitable for tasks involving image classification or object recognition. Nevertheless, without explicit details about the datasets used in this particular study, one cannot definitively determine if these commonly used datasets were part of their deep learning pipeline.
