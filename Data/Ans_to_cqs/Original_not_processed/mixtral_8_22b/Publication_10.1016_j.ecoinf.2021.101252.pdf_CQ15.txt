hyperparameters  (i.e.,  ‘AutoML’;  He  et  al.,  2021).  This  represents  an 
important  advantage  for  non-experts  in  deep  learning,  as  it  does  not 
require  the  manual  assembly  of  the  models  and  definition  of  their 
hyperparameters. The AutoML procedure starts by generating a set of 
candidate models with architectures and hyperparameters (e.g. number 
of layers; learning rate) selected at random from a prespecified range of 
values (see Fig. 2). Each candidate model is trained using a small subset 
of the data (data partition At; Fig. 2) during a small number of epochs. 
After  training,  the  performance  of  the  candidate  models  is  compared 
using a left-out validation data set (Av; Fig. 2). The selected candidate 
model (usually the best performing among candidates) is then trained on 
the full training data (Bt; Fig. 2). In this step it is required to identify an 
optimal number of training epochs, to avoid under- or overfitting of the

Type of architecture and accuracy of candidate models and predictive performance of selected models (bold). The accuracy of candidate models was measured using 
the proportion of correctly classified cases. The accuracy of selected models was measured using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).

2.4. Residual networks 

Residual networks (ResNet) are recently proposed in the context of 
image recognition (He et al., 2016). Basically, these networks introduce 
a  new  type  of  component,  the  ‘Residual  Block’,  to  CNN-type  models 
(Fig.  1d).  The  aim  of  these  blocks  is  to  allow  the  training  of  deeper 
models  (i.e.,  having  more  hidden  layers).  In  theory,  deeper  models 
should improve classification performances, as they allow higher levels 
of  data  abstraction.  However,  in  practice  the  performances  may  not 
improve,  among  other  things,  due  to  the  vanishing  gradient  problem 
(see  above).  The  use  of  residual  blocks  aims  to  address  this  by  for-
warding the output of layers directly into layers that are several levels 
deeper (e.g. 2–3 layers ahead; Fig. 1d). Recently, this architecture has 
been  applied  for  time  series  classification  (Wang  et  al.,  2017),  often 
performing very well (Fawaz et al., 2019).

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that each candidate model is trained using a small subset of the data during a small number of epochs. After training, the performance of the candidate models is compared using a left-out validation dataset. The selected candidate model is then trained on the full training data. It is also mentioned that it is required to identify an optimal number of training epochs to avoid under- or overfitting. These steps suggest that some form of optimization technique is being employed, but without further details, we cannot specify which one (e.g., Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam)).
