completely new dataset independent from the first and second datasets. 
The model can be deployed if it passes these three phases successfully. 
These phases are outlined in Fig. 3. The obtained results as well as their 
evaluation  are  provided  in  the  following  section.  The  experimental 
design of data utilisation and data processing phases with their targeted 
objectives are outlined in Table 3 regarding the APEM‘s database. The 
viability of the methodology was ensured in 4 phases.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given references, there isn't any explicit mention of specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, generally, the common practice is to randomly divide the available dataset into three subsets: training, testing, and validation. Typically, around 60-80% of the data is allocated for training, while the remaining 20-40% is divided between testing and validation. This division helps ensure that the model does not overfit or underfit during the training process. In some cases, stratified sampling may also be employed to maintain class distribution across all subsets. Additionally, cross-validation techniques like k-fold cross-validation might be utilized to further improve the robustness of the model evaluation.
