scenarios. The study showed the suitability of the SVR algorithm for
making predictions with restricted datasets, a finding that aligns with
previous research investigations (Kaveh et al., 2023; Mehmood et al.,
2024a; Zhang et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2022). An important conclusion
is derived from Fig. 6. It highlights that MLR heavily depends on pre-
dictor variables, demonstrating a more pronounced reliance on these
elements than machine learning methods. Furthermore, it is worth
noting that relying solely on spectral bands to predict AGB is unlikely to
produce favorable outcomes. Integrating these spectral bands with other
variable sets, including those produced from the Shuttle Radar Topog-
raphy Mission Digital Elevation Model (SRTM DEM) and vegetation-
derived indices, will lead to more favorable outcomes.

parameter combination, enhancing the model’s performance. Important
indices to measure variable importance in XGBoost include “Gain” and
“Frequency” (Gertz et al., 2020; Li et al., 2023; Luo et al., 2024; Meh-
mood et al., 2024a; Ryu et al., 2020). SVR tuning involves selecting the
appropriate kernel function and optimizing the “C” parameter, which
balances margin width and misclassification tolerance. The versatility of
SVR allows it

2.8. Optimizing model parameters

RF parameters include “ntree,” which controls the number of trees,
and “mtry,” which determines the number of variables sampled at each
split. Optimal values for these parameters were identified using grid
search. Variable importance was assessed using “percent IncMSE” and
“IncNodePurity” indices (Freeman et al., 2016b; Luo et al., 2024; Probst
et al., 2019). Key parameters for tuning XGBoost include “nrounds”
(boosting iterations), “max depth,” “min child weight,” “gamma,” and
“subsample.” A grid search methodology was employed to find the best

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information about optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, there are mentions of various optimization techniques used for different machine learning algorithms like Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost).

For RF, the mentioned optimization technique is Grid Search, which is used to identify optimal values for parameters like 'ntree' and'mtry'. Similarly, for SVR, the optimization process involves selecting the appropriate kernel function and optimizing the 'C' parameter. Lastly, for XGBoost, key parameters like 'nrounds','max depth','min child weight', 'gamma', and'subsample' are tuned using a Grid Search methodology.

These optimization techniques help improve the performance of the respective machine learning models by fine-tuning their parameters. However, they do not directly relate to optimization techniques typically used in deep learning pipelines like SGD or Adam.
