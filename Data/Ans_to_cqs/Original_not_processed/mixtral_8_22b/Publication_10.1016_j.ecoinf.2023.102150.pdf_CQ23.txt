Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model, the authors took several measures. Firstly, they utilized a diverse dataset consisting of various classes such as Bad quality, Bird, Empty, Least weasel, Lemming, Shrew, Stoat, and Vole. This diversity helped prevent overfitting and improved the model's ability to classify unseen data accurately. Secondly, they employed a stratified splitting technique while dividing the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets. This method ensured that each subset maintained the same distribution of classes as the original dataset, which prevented any bias towards specific classes. Lastly, they performed model retraining using new images collected between summer 2020 and summer 2021. This step allowed them to update the model with more recent data, further enhancing its adaptability and robustness.
