Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Overall, the complete dataset has a length of 1430 days and contains 
12 features (U2,Rs,RHmin,RHmax,Tmin,Tmax,ETo,SWC, NDVI, NDWI, DOY, 

The  available  database  includes  weather  data  recorded  by  the 
weather station from January 2018 to November 2021, as well as the 
micro-meteorological data acquired by the EC tower from March 2019 
to  November  2021,  in  both  cases  registered  at  sub-hourly  time-steps. 
The  former  dataset  was  used  to  estimate  ETo,  by  Eq.  (3).  The  latter 
dataset  was  processed, using  a  specific  software  developed  by  Manca 
(2003),  excluding  all  the  records  acquired  in  days  where  the  rainfall 
height was higher than 2.5 mm. The suitability of the records acquired 
by  the  EC  tower  was  assessed  based  on  the  energy  balance  closure

In the case of the RF, the hyperparameters include the number of 
decision trees in the forest, the maximum depth of the decision tree, the 
number of features considered by each tree when splitting a node, etc. 
This  set  of  hyperparameters  was  tested  using  the  grid  configuration 
shown below:  

1.  Number of decision trees: from 100 to 1000 (in steps of 100);  
2.  Number of features to consider at every split (max features): auto,

sqrt, log2, None;  

3.  Maximum number of levels in decision tree: None, or from 10 to 100 

(in steps of 10);

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it does not provide information about the use of any standard datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet in the deep learning pipeline. Instead, the context mentions the use of a custom dataset containing weather and micro-meteorological data recorded over several years. This dataset is used to estimate ETo and is further processed using a specific software developed by Manca (2003). The resulting dataset is then utilized for training and evaluating machine learning models like ANNs and Random Forests. Therefore, no standard datasets were mentioned in this context.
