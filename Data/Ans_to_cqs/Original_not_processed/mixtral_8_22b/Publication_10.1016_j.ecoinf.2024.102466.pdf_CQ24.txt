Ortmann and Johnson, 2021). Secondly, dataset noise is another factor 
that  affects  the  algorithm’s  performance  in  identifying  specific  bird 
species.  This  noise  can  arise  for  a  number  of  reasons,  for  example, 
vandalism, animal damage, loss of power or extreme weather. According 
to Foster (2008), we believe that it is common and may be difficult to 
avoid. In complex environments, environmental clutter and ambiguities 
may affect the bird detection dataset, resulting in a noisy dataset. These 
conditions  make  it  difficult  for  the  algorithm  to  accurately  learn  the 
features of a particular bird species during training, thus affecting its 
detection and recognition capabilities.

Camera traps provide a wealth of visual data for wildlife conserva-
tion (Borowiec et al., 2022; Ferreira et al., 2020; Norouzzadeh et al., 
2021;  W¨aldchen  and  M¨ader,  2018).  However,  accurately  identifying 
birds from camera traps datasets is a significant challenge due to their 
small size, protective coloration, and tendency to inhabit complex forest 
backgrounds. This study constructed a wild bird dataset consisting of 15 
species and 9717 images to explore the potential value of deep learning 
methods in automating bird identification. The study also investigated 
the accuracy of 8 mainstream deep learning methods for bird identifi-
cation, analyzing the impact of species, target size, and model frame-
works on model accuracy. This research provides a novel approach for 
assisting  ecology  and  conservation  researchers  in  bird  identification.

The  results  indicate  that  the  Cascade  RCNN  outperformed  other 
models at each training stage, while the FCOS model and Sparse CNN 
model consistently had lower mAP scores than others. This is consistent 
with  the  findings  of  Section  3.1.  Although  12  epochs  were  a  typical 
number of training times, almost all models reached the maximum mAP 
when the number of epochs reached 10. Therefore, for bird recognition, 
not  all  models  are  better  with  more  training  times,  and  choosing 

appropriate  training  times  for  different  models  is  beneficial  to  save 
computing resources. Specifically, the Cascade RCNN model had almost 
no  increase  in  the  mAP  at  9  epochs,  and  the  Faster  CNN  model  also 
showed a similar trend. However, the ATSS and RepPoint growth curves 
continued to 12 epochs, suggesting they require more training data or a 
longer training schedule to perform better.

Helpful Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not directly address the query about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, based on general knowledge about deep learning practices, there are several strategies often used to manage randomness:

1. **Fixed Random Seeds**: One common strategy is setting fixed random seeds for various parts of the pipeline, including data preprocessing, model initialization, and even data loading. By fixing these seeds, one can ensure reproducibility across multiple runs of the same experiment.

2. **Deterministic Algorithms**: Another way to reduce randomness is using deterministic algorithms wherever possible. For instance, some operations like sorting can have both stochastic and deterministic implementations. Choosing the latter ensures consistency between runs.

3. **Cross-Validation**: To account for variability introduced by random splits of train/test sets, cross-validation techniques can be employed. K-fold cross-validation involves splitting the dataset into k subsets, then iteratively holding out each subset as a test set while training on the remaining data. This helps average out any effects caused by a particularly favorable or unfavorable split.

4. **Ensemble Methods**: Ensembling combines predictions from multiple models trained independently. Since each model sees slightly different data due to shuffling or augmentation, ensembles can help smooth over variations caused by randomness.
