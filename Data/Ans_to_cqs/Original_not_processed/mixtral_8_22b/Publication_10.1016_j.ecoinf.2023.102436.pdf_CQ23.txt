reduction reaching as low as (cid:0) 0.632 compared to the baseline. The most 
prominent disparity is observed in the boundary region, particularly in 
proximity  to  nearby  buildings.  The  Iteration  II  (Fig.  7c)  focuses  on 
increasing the density of trees to improve the restorative potential. Since 
the western and southern parts of the park already have sufficient tree 
cover, our primary focus is to intensify tree plantation in the northern, 
eastern,  and central  areas while aligning  with the  size  and  species of 
existing trees. The change resulted in slight improvements (Fig. 7h) in 
the restorative potential, particularly in the central areas. Iteration III 
(Fig. 7d) replaces some vegetation with water in the central area due to 
the park’s lack of water landscape. The results (Fig. 7i) also indicate a 
negligible impact, with the maximum difference from the baseline being 
just 0.05.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit information about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of any deep learning models used in this study. However, it can be inferred that the authors might have employed various techniques such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, stratified splitting, etc., to enhance the robustness and reliability of their models. These methods help prevent overfitting and increase the applicability of the models across different scenarios. Nevertheless, without further details regarding the methodology section, we cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
