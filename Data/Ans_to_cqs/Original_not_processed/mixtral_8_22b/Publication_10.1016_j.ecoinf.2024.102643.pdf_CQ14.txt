100 km2) (Table 1). The frequency of occurrence of conflict types also 
differed  between  the  Euro-Siberian  and  Irano-Turanian  regions,  as 
damages to livestock and beehives and road accidents were significantly 
higher in the Euro-Siberian region (Table 1).

To  determine  risk  probabilities  across  Türkiye  and  to  reduce  the 
uncertainty among models, we constructed a final ensemble conflict risk 
model by weight averaging the ten different algorithms as implemented 
in the biomod2 package (Thuiller, 2014). By combining predictions from 
several  different  modeling  approaches,  ensemble  models  have  been 
shown  to  produce  more  robust  results  when  compared  to  individual 
models  (Buonincontri  et  al.,  2023;  Erickson  and  Smith,  2023).  We 
averaged  predictions  across  three  replicated  runs  for  each  model and 
selected model runs with a TSS > 0.5 for generating the ensemble model. 
We classified the predicted risk probabilities generated by the ensemble 
model  into  5  classes:  no-risk  areas  (< 0.2),  low-risk  areas  (0.2–0.4), 
moderate-risk areas (0.4–0.6), high-risk areas (0.6–0.8) and extreme risk 
areas (> 0.8).

Among the ten algorithms examined, SRE, CTA, and ANN exhibited 
the  lowest AUC and  TSS  values. The best-supported  models based  on 
both  AUC  and  TSS  were  GBM,  Maxent,  and  GLM  (Fig.  S5).  When 
considering the ensemble model, which aggregated predictions from all 
ten models, the weighted average AUC and TSS scores were 0.87 and 
0.62,  respectively,  underscoring  the  model’s  overall  good  discrimina-
tory power (Fig. S5). In terms of the factors contributing to conflict risk, 
the  ensemble model highlighted four primary  influencers: distance to 

villages (37%), distance to protected areas (18%), distance to farmland 
(16%), and human footprint (13%) (Fig. 3). Response curves of the top 
four predictors showed that conflict risk decreased with increasing dis-
tance to villages and protected areas, but showed a bell curve relation-
ship with distance to farmland and human footprint (Fig. 4) Fig. 5.)

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this query based solely on the given context. However, common methods used for hyperparameter optimization include grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and gradient-based optimization. Without further details about the specific study or methodology employed, I cannot confirm which technique was utilized in this case.
