3.1. Main results 

Table 2 shows the test results. The largest performance gap between 
the learnable and traditional frontends stems from using PCEN instead 
of log compression. When combined with PCEN, the (mel-)spectrogram 
is on par with the learnable frontends. Noticeably, a proper normaliza-
tion on top of the log compression produced similar results to the PCEN 
version of the models. It is hard to eyeball some of these effects, espe-
cially for the data augmentation. Therefore, a performance summary for 
the 48 models is depicted in Fig. 3 to comprehend the importance of 
each component. Fig. 4 shows the confusion matrices of the base and the 
best configuration for each frontend.

Fig. 3. A summary from Table 2 shows that PCEN, normalization, and data augmentation are beneficial overall. For compression, 24 models used PCEN, and 24 used 
log. There are 16 models for each normalization scheme. Also, 24 models used data augmentation and 24 did not. The box covers the first to third quartile of the data. 
The whiskers extend up to 1.5 times this interquartile range. Circles are data points beyond the whiskers.

to their initial state after the training. It explains the proximity of the 
results  in  Table  2  since  all  frontends  extracted  similar  features,  as 
depicted in Fig. 6.

Furthermore, proposed models and their specific hyper-parameters do 
not  always  behave  as  nicely  as  reported  outside  their  benchmark 
datasets.

Helpful Answer:

From the given context, it appears that several measures have been taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning models. These include:

1. Data Augmentation: As mentioned in Figure 3, half of the models (24 out of 48) used data augmentation techniques. This helps improve the model's ability to generalize by providing more varied examples during training.

2. Normalization Schemes: Two different normalization schemes - Standardization and Min-Max Normalization - were applied to the models. Each scheme was used for 16 models, ensuring diversity in preprocessing methods.

3. Different Compression Techniques: Half of the models used Per-Channel Energy Normalization (PCEN) while the other half used Log compression. This variety allows the evaluation of the model's performance under different feature extraction conditions.

4. Multiple Frontends: Four types of frontends - Mel, STFT, Sinc, and Leaf - were employed in the experiments. Using multiple frontends can help assess the robustness and adaptability of the models across various input representations.

However, there is no explicit mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting in the provided context. Cross-validation is a technique used to evaluate machine learning models on limited data samples, while stratified sampling ensures that the distribution of classes remains consistent among folds. Although these techniques might have been implemented but not explicitly stated, based solely on the given information, we cannot confirm if they were part of the methodology.
