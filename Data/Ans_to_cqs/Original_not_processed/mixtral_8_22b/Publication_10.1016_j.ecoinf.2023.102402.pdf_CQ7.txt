details  on  sightingh  sites  such  as  habitat  features  and  number  of 
encountered  specimens,  and  percentages  on  the  total  number  of  re-
sponses were computed for each of these values.

goodness-of-fit and complexity. The model with the lowest AICc value (i. 
e. ΔAICc = 0) is considered the best model out of the current suite of 
models;  all  models  with  ΔAICc  <2  are  generally  considered  to  have 
substantial  support  (Muscarella  et  al.,  2014).  The  model  parameter 
settings with the lowest AICc values (ΔAICc = 0) for both H. guttulatus 
and H. hippocampus were chosen to establish the final Maxent models 
(ENMeval outputs in supplementary materials, Appendix 2).

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, or validation sets. However, it does provide some information about the use of a modeling approach called Maxent, which was used to create species distribution models for two seahorse species, Hippocampus guttulatus and Hippocampus hippocampus.

In this study, the authors used the Akaike Information Criterion corrected for small sample sizes (AICc) to select the best model among several candidate models. They chose the model parameters with the lowest AICc values (ΔAICc = 0) for both seahorse species to establish the final Maxent models. This suggests that they may have used cross-validation techniques to evaluate the performance of their models and choose the best one based on its predictive accuracy.

While the context does not directly address the query regarding the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, it provides some insight into the methodology used to develop and validate the species distribution models. It is possible that the authors used standard practices for splitting data into training, testing, and validation sets when developing their models, but without further information, we cannot confirm this.
