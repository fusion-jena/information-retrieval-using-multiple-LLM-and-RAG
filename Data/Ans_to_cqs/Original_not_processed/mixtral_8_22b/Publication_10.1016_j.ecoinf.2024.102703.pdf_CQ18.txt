Build a three-layer back propagation (BP) artificial neural network 
using MATLAB R2014b (Lin et al., 2021). The first layer (i.e. the input 
layer) corresponded to the aCDOM(254) and Fn(355) respectively. The 
intermediate layer (i.e. hidden layers) and the last layer (i.e. the output 
layer)  comprised  a  single  neuron,  that  corresponded  to  the  predictor 
(TSI). Set the maximum training times to 10,000 and the training error 
to 0.001. 64 water samples were utilized for model calibration, with the 
remaining  used  for  validation.  Validation  accuracy  was  assessed  by 
calculating the coefficient of determination (R2) and root-mean-square 
error (RMSE) between the measured and predicted TSI. The RMSE was 
determined using Eq. (6).

The  Organization  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development 
proposed  an  alternative  classification  system  in  1982,  utilizing 
chlorophyll-a  (Chl-a),  Secchi  disk  depth  (SDD),  and  total  phosphorus 
(TP) concentration (Caspers, 1984). To improve the sensitivity of con-
ventional  classifications,  Carlson  (1977)  proposed an  altered  method. 
However,  because  these  systems  were  dependent  on  laboratory  in-
dicators and were susceptible to outside influences, trophic state eval-
uations  were  susceptible  to  manipulation.  Additionally,  traditional 
methodologies did not take watercolor’s effect on eutrophication into 
account. When the concentration of humic substances in the lake is high, 
causing  browning,  it  will  affect  underwater  light  intensity,  thereby 
influencing the growth of phytoplankton. As a result, a novel approach 
to nutritional status prediction is required, one with higher spatiotem-

Based on the Trophic State Index, which ranges from 31 to 67, all 

Fn(355) values ranged from 1.16 to 2.97, with the average increasing

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To monitor the model performance during training, two strategies have been employed. Firstly, the maximum number of training iterations has been set to 10,000. This means that the model will stop training once it reaches this limit, regardless of its performance. Secondly, a training error threshold of 0.001 has been established. If the model achieves this level of accuracy before reaching the maximum number of iterations, the training process will terminate early. These strategies ensure that the model does not overfit or underfit the data, while also preventing unnecessary computational resources from being wasted.
