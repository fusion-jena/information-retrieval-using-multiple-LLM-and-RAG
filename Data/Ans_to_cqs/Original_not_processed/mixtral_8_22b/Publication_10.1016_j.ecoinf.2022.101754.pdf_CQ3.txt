2.6. Training and validation set 

The  study  utilized  a  training-and-test  approach  with  stratification 
splitting. For each setting, 100 different splits to the training-and-test set 
were given. Tuning of the hyperparameter on the training set was done 
for  each  set.  This  was  followed  by  model  training  using  an  optimal 
setting of the hyperparameter. 

2.7. Regression models 

Four methods were used to model forest AGB in the study: AdaBoost, 
random  decision  forest  (RF),  multilayer  neural  network  (NET),  and 
Bayesian ridge regression (Bayes).

2.2. Field data 

Field data were collected during vegetation season in July 2019 on 
109  sample  plots.  The  field  survey  data,  including  tree  positions  and 
positions  of  the  center  of  the  plots,  were  collected  using  Field-Map 
technology  (www.fieldmap.cz)  on  statistical  forest  inventory  plots 
placed  within  the  study  area  in  pairs  with  distance  of  50  m  between 
paired plot centers.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the provided context, there is no information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. These techniques help to label or tag datasets so they can be used to train machine learning algorithms. Without more specific details about the dataset or the deep learning pipeline used in this case, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
