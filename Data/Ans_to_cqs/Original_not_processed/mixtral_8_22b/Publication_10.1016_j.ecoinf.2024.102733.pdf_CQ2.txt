This suggests that features learned from raw trajectories (especially
through unsupervised pre-training) can be preferable to hand-crafted
features.

While earlier works on various computer vision tasks employed
Restricted Boltzmann Machines and their variants for unsupervised pre-
training (Beyan et al., 2017; Katsageorgiou et al., 2017; Phan et al.,
2016), as well as several types of autoencoders that have been gaining
popularity (Erhan et al., 2010; Ge et al., 2023; Suryawati et al., 2021),
recent advancements have highlighted the superior performance of
diffusion models over autoencoders (Cao et al., 2024; Paoletti et al.,
2021a; Paoletti et al., 2022b; Xiang et al., 2023). Therefore, it is now
imperative to investigate the efficacy of diffusion models also for un-
supervised feature learning, particularly for addressing ecological
problems. In line with this, our study utilizes diffusion models, where
the acquired features after unsupervised pre-training are subsequently
employed to enhance the training of a classifier, facilitating effective fish
event classification.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the references cited, we can infer that the data formats used could include images, signals, or time series data such as those found in computer vision tasks, bioacoustic signal classification, and fish event classification. The use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Autoencoders further supports this assumption since these architectures are commonly applied to image and signal data. Additionally, the reference to Restricted Boltzmann Machines and their variants for unsupervised pre-training indicates that binary or real-valued input data might have been utilized. Nonetheless, without explicit information about the dataset, it remains uncertain which exact data format was used in the deep learning pipeline.
