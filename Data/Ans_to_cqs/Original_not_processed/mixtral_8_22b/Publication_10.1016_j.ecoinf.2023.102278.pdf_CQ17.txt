Appendix C. The training of the models 

The best model with transfer learning was chosen based on the minimum total loss after nine epochs, as seen in Fig. C.5. Note that we observe 
overfitting after nine epochs, where the validation loss starts to increase, although the bias is still very low. The increase is indicated by a higher 
difference between training and validation loss and bias is the loss evaluated on the training dataset. 

Note that the largest variation is 0.6%, which is very similar to the variation of 0.8% when training with different values of α in Fig. B.4. This 

indicates a minimal impact on the change of accuracy for different choices of α.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The authors use dropout regularization in the forward pass during training to prevent overfitting. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to reduce interdependent learning amongst them. Additionally, they also mention using weight decay, which is another term for L2 regularization. Weight decay adds a penalty equivalent to the square of the magnitude of coefficients to the loss function, discouraging large weights and thus preventing overfitting. They do not explicitly state whether other forms of regularization were employed or considered.
