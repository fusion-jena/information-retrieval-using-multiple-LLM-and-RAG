in the realm of face recognition, these techniques have become capable 
of  precisely  capturing  the  facial  features  of  diverse  individuals  and 
conducting  accurate  comparisons  and  classifications  after  rigorous 
optimization with extensive training data. These advancements have led 
to  high-precision  and  real-time  face  recognition.  Consequently,  it’s 
plausible  to  assume  that  applying  such  cutting-edge  methods  to  fish

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, including managing random seed values. However, some general approaches can be considered when dealing with randomness in deep learning models.

Random seeds are used to initialize various components within a deep learning pipeline, such as weight initialization, shuffling input data, or generating random numbers during dropout regularization. To manage randomness related to random seeds, one common strategy is setting a fixed seed value before running experiments. This ensures consistency across different runs and makes results more reproducible.

Additionally, another way to address randomness is through ensemble methods. Ensemble methods combine multiple models trained independently with varying initial conditions (such as different random seeds), resulting in a final prediction that leverages the strengths of each individual model. By aggregating predictions from several models, ensemble methods help reduce variance caused by randomness and improve overall performance.

Lastly, conducting thorough hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation can also mitigate the impact of randomness. Hyperparameters control aspects like learning rate, batch size, or network architecture, while cross-validation involves splitting datasets into subsets for training and validation purposes. Both techniques allow researchers to evaluate their models' performance under different configurations and identify optimal settings that minimize the effects of randomness.
