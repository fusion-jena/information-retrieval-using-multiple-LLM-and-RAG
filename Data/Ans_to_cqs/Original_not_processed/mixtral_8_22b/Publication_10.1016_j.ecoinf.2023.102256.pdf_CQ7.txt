Over  the  past  few  years,  deep  learning  has  revolutionized  several 
research  fields  such  as  bioinformatics  (Li  et  al.,  2020)  and  medicine 
(Piccialli et al., 2021) by enabling automated processing of large and 
complex  datasets.  Considered  a  branch  of  machine  learning,  deep 
learning refers to algorithms, commonly called deep neural networks, 
able  to  automatically  detect  very  complex  and  highly  discriminating 
patterns  in  data  (Chollet,  2018).  The  succession  of  processing  layers 
performing  linear  and  non-linear  transformations  allows  the  neural 
networks  to  learn  representations  of  data  with  multiple  levels  of 
abstraction  (LeCun  et  al.,  2015).  This  ability  makes  deep  learning 
particularly  relevant  for  solving  complex  problems  such  as  speech 
recognition, object detection, computer vision, and many other domains 
(Taigman et al., 2014; Hinton et al., 2012). Naturally, these practices

To train and evaluate the efficiency of each method, the bird song 
dataset was split into a training, validation and testing dataset. For each 
species and country, we randomly selected 70% of the downloaded re-
cordings for the training dataset and kept the remaining 30% for testing. 
Data  augmentation  was  only  applied  to  the  training  dataset,  and  the 
segments obtained were randomly distributed between the training and 
validation sets with a ratio 0.8/0.2. In each case, the model was trained 
for 40 epochs with a batch size of 8 segments and a learning rate of 0.001 
using the Adam optimizer. The training process was performed ten times 
to account for the effect of random weight initialization in neural net-
works. In each execution, we applied the model to the testing dataset 
and recorded the confusion matrix, number of True Positives (TP), False 
Positives (FP), True Negatives (TN) and False Negatives (FN). From that

Helpful Answer:
The bird song dataset was split into three parts: training, validation, and testing datasets. To achieve this, for each species and country, 70% of the downloaded recordings were randomly selected for the training dataset, while the remaining 30% were reserved for testing. Data augmentation was then applied exclusively to the training dataset, and the resulting segments were randomly allocated between the training and validation sets using a ratio of 0.8/0.2. Each model was subsequently trained for 40 epochs with a batch size of 8 segments and a learning rate of 0.001 utilizing the Adam optimizer. The training procedure was repeated ten times to accommodate the impact of random weight initialization in neural networks. During each iteration, the model was implemented on the testing dataset, and the confusion matrix, along with the count of True Positives (TP), False Positives (FP), True Negatives (TN), and False Negatives (FN), were documented.
