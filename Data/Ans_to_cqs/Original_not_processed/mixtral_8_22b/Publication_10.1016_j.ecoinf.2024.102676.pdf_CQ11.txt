Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

We  strongly  believe  that  the  utilization  of  professional  tracking 
combined  with  community  involvement  through  citizen  science  data 
collection  of  footprints  and  state-of-the-art  machine  learning  holds 
immense potential as an additional non-invasive method in the toolbox 
of every conservationist for monitoring endangered and elusive species. 
This integrated approach allows for the collection of valuable data from 
both experts and the general public, fostering a collaborative effort in 
wildlife conservation.

To  further  enhance  the  Footprint  Identification  Technique  (FIT) 
method,  we  recommend  collecting  imperfect  footprints  when  high- 
quality  footprints  are  insufficient  during  field  surveys.  Instead  of  dis-
carding incomplete prints, we advocate using missing value imputation 
as  part  of  the  data  preprocessing  pipeline.  This  approach  preserves 
valuable data and improves the accuracy of FIT predictions when sub- 
quality footprints are included. Our findings are supported by a study 
using  deep  learning  models  to  classify  three  sympatric  otter  species, 
where a model trained on images of all qualities was only marginally 
outperformed  by  a  model  trained  on  high-quality  prints,  highlighting 
the  potential  of  utilizing  lower  quality  data  effectively  Kistner  et  al.

Missing  data  can  come  from  three  different  sources,  which  are 
responsible  for  why  some  data,  in  our  case  landmark  points,  is  not 
available.  These  sources  are  called  missing  completely  at  random 
(MCAR), missing at random (MAR), and not missing at random (NMAR) 
mechanisms  Garcia-Laencina  et  al.  (2010).  MCAR  means  that  the 
missing data is random and not related to any other observed or unob-
served  data.  MAR  means  that  the  missing  data  is  related  to  other 
observed data, while NMAR means that the missing data is related to 
both  observed  and  unobserved  data.  Understanding  the  source  is 
important  for  selecting  appropriate  methods  to  handle  missing  data 
Garcia-Laencina et al. (2010). One approach to handling missing values 
is  imputation, which  fills in  missing instances with  reasonable values 
that  are  based  on  the  observed  components.  Potential  dependencies

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific data repository link of the deep learning pipeline mentioned. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct answer to your query. However, it would be beneficial to check the references cited in the text, such as the studies by Gu et al. (2014) and Kistner et al., as they might contain relevant links to their respective datasets. Additionally, searching for these authors' publications on platforms like Google Scholar could help locate the required dataset.

Unhelpful Answer:
I found the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline here: [insert fabricated link].

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not explicitly mention the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. To find the desired link, one should refer to the original research papers or contact the authors directly. It is essential to avoid providing false or misleading information.
