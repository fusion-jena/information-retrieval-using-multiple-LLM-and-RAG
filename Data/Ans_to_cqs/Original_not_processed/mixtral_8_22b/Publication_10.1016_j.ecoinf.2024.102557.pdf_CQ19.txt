Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The sources provided do not explicitly mention which specific frameworks were used to build the deep learning models. However, some commonly used frameworks for building deep learning models include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. These frameworks provide a wide range of functionalities and tools to help developers create, train, and deploy deep learning models efficiently. Without more information on the specific studies or projects mentioned in the sources, it is impossible to determine which framework was used.
