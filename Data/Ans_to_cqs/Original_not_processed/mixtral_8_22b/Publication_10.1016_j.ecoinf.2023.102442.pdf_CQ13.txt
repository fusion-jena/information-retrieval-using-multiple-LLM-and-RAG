18. Select Mining Pixels Above 3 pixel sizes (PROCESS) - In order to remove the influence of isolated, small, misclassified pixels (that are usually 
1–2 pixels in size), the minimum size of a mine for this step of the model was deemed as 3 pixels in size (or > 2700 m2 in a Landsat Image). It is a 
common occurrence in LULC classification maps, especially those done on a large scale, to contain isolated, misclassified individual pixels. Therefore, 
only mines above 2700 m2 were selected, removing the influence of small, misclassified pixels on the reclassification of water bodies to ensure the 
most accurate result could be achieved.

9. Calculate Ratio of Mine-Urban Pixels and Determine Threshold (ADJUSTABLE PARAMETER) – In each sub-region identified in step 8, the 
model calculates the ratio of mining pixels to urban pixels and assigns the value to the sub-region. This step of the model was based upon a closely 
observed pattern in the spatial arrangement of mining and urban pixels. It was observed that urban areas, while they did contain misclassified mining 
pixels, were always dominated by an overwhelming majority of urban pixels, hence a low mine-urban pixel ratio. In mining areas, while the mine- 
urban  pixel  pattern  initially appears to  be random, closer  observation showed  that the  ratio  of mine  to urban  pixels  within a  mine  was  consis-
tently higher than the corresponding ratio in urban areas. This observed pattern provided the basis for the reclassification model, as it provided a 
quantitative metric through which we can consistently distinguish between mining and urban areas.

Helpful Answer:
The papers cited do not provide explicit information about the specific hyperparameters used in their respective deep learning models. However, some general insights can still be gleaned from them. For instance, Gallwey et al. (2020) discuss using a multispectral convolutional neural network (CNN) for detecting artisanal small-scale mining in Ghana but do not mention any specific hyperparameters. Similarly, Couttenier et al. (2022) describe mapping artisanal and small-scale mines at large scales from space with deep learning, yet no details regarding hyperparameters are given.

In contrast, Gorelick et al. (2017) present Google Earth Engine, a platform designed for planetary-scale geospatial analysis, without discussing any particular deep learning models or their associated hyperparameters. The other sources mentioned focus on various aspects of environmental research, such as Amazonian forest phenology (Girardin et al., 2016), large-scale degradation of Amazonian freshwater ecosystems (Castello & Macedo, 2016), and a global increase in sediment loads in tropical rivers due to alluvial mining (Dethier et al., 2023). These studies also do not explicitly address the use of deep learning models or their hyperparameters.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is impossible to determine the exact hyperparameters employed in these deep learning models. To obtain more detailed information, one would need access to the original code implementations or further publications related specifically to the deep learning components of these projects.
