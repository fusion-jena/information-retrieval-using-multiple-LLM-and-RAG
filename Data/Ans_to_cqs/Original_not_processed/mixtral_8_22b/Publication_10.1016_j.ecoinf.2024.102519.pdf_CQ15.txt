research  on  artificial  intelligence  (AI).  Traditional  linear  program-
ming, nonlinear programming, dynamic programming, modern genetic 
algorithms  (GA),  particle  swarm  optimization  algorithms,  and  deep 
learning have achieved great success in both theoretical and practical 
applications. Mohammadi (2023) modeled various drought timescales 
by  combining  artificial  neural  networks  with  firefly  algorithms. 
Emamgholizadeh  et  al.  (2023)  used  enhanced  machine  learning 
methods to predict soil cation exchange capacity in the southern region 
of China. Ghezelbash et al. (2023a) combined the GA and firefly opti-
mization  algorithm  with  the  K-means  clustering  method  for  copper- 
related geochemical footprints of porphyry and skarn in the Baft area 
of Kerman, Iran, and achieved good research results. Ghezelbash et al. 
(2023b) added GA to K-means and SVM to construct GIS-based mineral 
prospecting maps, and the results showed that the SVM model based on

The process of identifying an ESA is a multicondition optimization 
problem. We first divided the source into multiple candidate lists, each 
with specific location coordinates and areas, to determine the optimal 
source.  Next,  three  key  factors  were  considered:  the  source  area,  dis-
tance from the center of the area, and the importance value of the ESA. 
Basic quantification conditions were set for these three key factors, and 
the  specific  quantification  standards  are  listed  in  Table  5.  Genetic 
optimization  algorithms  were  used  to  adjust  the  hyperparameters  to 
determine the algorithm parameters for this study referring to the use of 
artificial neural networks, SVM, and random forests for landslide sus-
ceptibility prediction (Daviran et al., 2023). Finally, the fitness function 
was determined based on the specific conditions of this study. The entire 
optimization process was implemented by programming in Python, and 
the main steps were as follows:

optimization (Benabbou et al., 2020), and production scheduling (Guo 
et al., 2020b). GA is one of the means to solve the optimization problem. 
Therefore,  applying  GA  can  objectively  and  accurately  identify  ESA, 
reduce  subjective  empirical  judgments  on  ESA,  and  make  the  results 
more consistent with regional reality. Second, this algorithm can flexibly 
change the corresponding parameters according to the characteristics of 
different research fields and has strong universality and practicality. The 
GA was used to select the optimal ESA for constructing the EC, which 
can improve the accuracy, connectivity, and clarity of the corridors and 
provide new research ideas for the construction and optimization of ESP. 
The  EC  is  the  communication  channel  of  ecological  information

GA, as a type of swarm intelligence algorithm, imitates the evolu-
tionary  laws  of  “natural  selection  and  survival  of  the  fittest”  in  the 
biological  world  and  utilizes  three  basic  operators,  namely  selection, 
crossover, and mutation, to make the next generation of the population 
more adapted to the environment than the previous generation (Holland 
et al., 1975). The final iteration produces the last-generation population, 
which is the optimal individual decodes as an approximate optimal so-
lution  to  the  target  problem.  This  method  has  the  characteristics  of 
excellent  convergence  and  robustness  and  has  obvious  advantages  in 
solving global optimization problems (Zhang and Gao, 2022). In recent 
years,  the  application  of  GA  has  gradually  penetrated  various  fields, 
including the identification and optimization of ecological nodes (Zhao 
et al., 2020), function optimization (Song et al., 2019), combinatorial

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the focus is primarily on genetic algorithms (GAs) rather than traditional optimization techniques commonly used in deep learning pipelines such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or adaptive moment estimation (Adam). However, there is mention of using artificial neural networks alongside other methods like support vector machines (SVM) and random forests for landslide susceptibility prediction.

In the context provided, GA is described as a type of swarm intelligence algorithm that mimics evolutionary principles found in nature. It uses three basic operators - selection, crossover, and mutation - to iteratively generate populations that are better suited to their environments. The final iteration yields the most optimized solution to the target problem.

While not explicitly mentioned in relation to deep learning, GA has been widely applied across numerous fields due to its excellent convergence properties and robustness. Its applications include solving complex multi-condition optimization problems, function optimization, and combinatorial optimization.

However, without more specific details about the deep learning pipeline discussed here, I cannot definitively state whether traditional optimization techniques like SGD or Adam are being employed. Based solely on the available context, it seems that GA plays a significant role in the optimization processes involved.
