2.3.3. Pest damage identification model 

In the current study, a machine learning algorithm, a CNN, was used 
to construct a pest hazard class classification model. The specific results 
are shown in Fig. 4. The above results are the experimental results of the 
author's  team,  specifically  referring  to  the  study  of  Ma,  L.  (Lei  et  al., 
2022). These sensitive spectral vegetation indices perform well in the 
1D-CNN model, with an overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient of 
89.50% and 0.8666, respectively. Figs. 4-a, 4-b, and 4-c show the results 
of  identifying  the  degree  of  damage  to  forest  trees  by  EJD  in  June, 
August, and September in the study area obtained based on the 1D-CNN 
algorithm, and its distribution was basically consistent with the distri-
bution of the actual affected forest trees.

Helpful Answer:
The papers mentioned do not provide information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, some common regularization methods used to prevent overfitting include dropout, L1 regularization, and L2 regularization. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to reduce interdependent learning amongst neurons. L1 regularization adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients, while L2 regularization adds a penalty equal to the square of the magnitude of coefficients. Both L1 and L2 regularizations help to shrink the weights of the network towards zero, reducing complexity and preventing overfitting. Other methods such as early stopping, data augmentation, and batch normalization can also be used to prevent overfitting.
