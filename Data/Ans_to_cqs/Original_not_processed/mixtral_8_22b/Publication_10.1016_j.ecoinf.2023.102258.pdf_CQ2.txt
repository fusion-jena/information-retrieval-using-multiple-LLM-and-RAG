Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Many machine learning systems have pragmatic design constraints 
that  limit  the  range  of  durations  they  can  consider.  Our  template- 
matching method uses ranges directly inherited from the 5 annotated 
events, although there remain practical limits on very large templates, 
such as computer memory. In deep learning, long audio files are usually 
divided into shorter chunks (with fixed durations of e.g. 3 or 10 s), so 
that a whole batch can fit inside the limited memory of GPUs. To detect 
long  events,  detections  that  span  these  chunks  are  joined  together  in 
post-processing. This as well as other considerations meant that post- 
processing  of  outputs  was  an  important  aspect  of  all  strongly- 
performing systems.

Such fragmentation hinders the practical usability of deep learning 
in bioacoustics, and thus in the life sciences at large. Indeed to date, the 
success of deep neural networks in the supervised regime depends on the 
availability of a massive corpus of audio examples for the sound events 
of interest, paired with human annotations. Yet, temporally-precise and 
fine-grained annotation of audio demands expertise, and is thus costly 
and time-consuming. In many cases, the obstacle is not only to acquire 
annotations, but also the audio examples themselves: e.g. for rare spe-
cies,  remote  locations,  or  costly  equipment.  Furthermore,  these 
numerous small-data scenarios remain outside the scope of digital bio-
acoustic archives, such as Xeno-Canto and the Macaulay Library.

Inspecting  the  characteristics  of  the  methods  performing  most 
strongly in the challenge, broadly across all editions, we observe some 
general tendencies (Table 3). Firstly, there is relatively little variation in 
the  acoustic  features  extracted,  and  the  neural  network  architecture: 
most systems use Mel spectrograms with PCEN, and standard CNNs. The 
main innovation in this aspect comes from You et al. (2023), where the 
CNN is replaced by the audio spectrogram transformer (AST). However, 
there is considerable variation in the method of training the network, 
and performing inference. There is a roughly equal balance of the two 
main paradigms: meta-learning with prototypical networks, versus fine- 
tuning or otherwise adapting a network trained using cross-entropy.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly state what data format is used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions several times that the data being processed is audio. For example, it talks about "audio examples" and "audio files." It also discusses the use of Mel spectrograms, which are a type of visual representation of audio signals. Therefore, based on this information, one could infer that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is likely audio.
