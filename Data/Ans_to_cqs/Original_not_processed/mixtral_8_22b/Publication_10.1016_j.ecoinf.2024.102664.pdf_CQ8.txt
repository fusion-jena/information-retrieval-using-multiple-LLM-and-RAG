In  Chl  dynamic  forecasting,  Long Short-term  Memory  (LSTM) and 
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) are commonly used deep learning 
models (Baek et al., 2021; Lee and Lee, 2018; Yussof et al., 2021). Re-
searchers have successfully applied CNN and LSTM models to analyze 
Chl  concentration  distribution  in  different  regions  (Jin  et  al.,  2021; 
Yussof et al., 2021). Combining diverse deep learning networks to create 
hybrid models, such as the hybrid CNN-LSTM model, has proven effec-
tive in addressing complex nonlinear challenges (Anderson et al., 2016; 
Wang et al., 2020). This integration offers enhanced forecasting efficacy 
compared to individual network (Barzegar et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2017). 
Advancements  in  ocean  satellite  monitoring  technology  have 
significantly  improved  the  precision  of  satellite  data  (Amani  et  al., 
2022a,  2022b),  making  it  a  crucial  information  source  for  machine

The  forecast  performance  of  deep  learning  models  varies  across 
different Chl concentration regions. In the high Chl concentration region 
(point A), the R2  values are the lowest, while in the low Chl concen-
tration region (point C), the R2 values are the highest (Fig. 6). Among the 
models,  the  hybrid  CNN-LSTM  consistently  achieves  the  highest  R2 
values  across  all  regions,  whereas  the  CNN  model  has  the  lowest  R2 
values (Fig. 6).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no mention or indication of where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The context only provides details about the use of various deep learning models like CNN, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM for Chl dynamic forecasting, along with their respective performances. It also discusses advancements in ocean satellite monitoring technology and how these technologies improve the precision of satellite data. However, there is no reference to any specific code repositories containing the implementation of these deep learning models or pipelines. Therefore, without additional context or information, it is not possible to determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
