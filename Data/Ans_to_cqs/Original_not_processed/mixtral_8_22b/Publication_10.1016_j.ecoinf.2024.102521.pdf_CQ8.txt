Insects  are  highly  abundant  and  diverse,  and  play  major  roles  in  ecosystem  functions.  Monitoring  of  insect 
populations is key to their sustainable management. However, the labor and expertise needed to identify insects, 
and the challenges of archiving the wealth of data collected in monitoring programs, often limit these efforts. We 
describe a pipeline to reduce the barriers associated with curating and mining big data of insect biodiversity. The 
pipeline, STARdbi, includes capturing flying insects with sticky traps, scanning the traps, storing the trap-images 
in a public database with a web-based interface, and applying machine learning models to extract information 
from the images. To illustrate the insights that can be gained from STARdbi, we describe two case studies. One of 
them involves monitoring of circadian activity patterns of grain pests and of their natural enemies, and the other

%Query
Query: "Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct answer based solely on the given information. It would be best to refer to the original sources or contact the authors directly for this specific detail.
