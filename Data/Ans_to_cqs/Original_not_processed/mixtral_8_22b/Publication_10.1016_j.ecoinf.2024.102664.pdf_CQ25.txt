In this study, the structure of the CNN model includes an image input 
layer, a convolutional layer with a kernel size of 2 × 2 × 25, a maximum 
pooling layer with a kernel size of 2 × 2, two fully connected layers, and 
a regression output layer (Fig. 2c). The number of nodes in the first fully 
connected layer is 10, and in the second fully connected layer is 1. The 
structure of the LSTM model includes a sequence input layer, an LSTM 
layer with 60 nodes, two fully connected layers, and a regression output 
layer (Fig. 2c). The number of nodes in the first fully connected layer is 
10, and in the second fully connected layer is 1.

2.3. Deep learning model development 

CNN possesses robust capabilities for image feature extraction and is 
recognized as an effective tool for addressing image recognition chal-
lenges (Ilesanmi and Ilesanmi, 2021; Lei et al., 2019). It has also found 
applicability in the domain of time series signal processing (Gautam and 
Singh, 2020; Li et al., 2021). The CNN network architecture comprises 
convolutional  and  pooling  layer,  which  are  the  two  principal  hidden 
layers responsible for realizing the core functions of CNN.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred based on its application and components. Given that the study focuses on forecasting algal blooms using satellite data, it is likely that the deep learning models serve a predictive or regression function. This is further supported by the presence of a regression output layer in both the CNN and LSTM models described. Therefore, the primary purpose of these deep learning models appears to be making predictions about future algal blooms based on historical satellite data.
