Halgamuge et al. (2020) focused on utilizing deep learning to esti-
mate the best optimizer selection methods for wildfire event predictions 
in Australia. They developed an algorithm to collect the data automat-
ically and analyzed six different optimizer models using deep learning 
technology. They concluded that this approach could predict a natural 
disaster, including wildfire events, by investigating historical environ-
mental  conditions  before  and  after  wildfires  occurred  using  the  deep 
learning methodology. Dowdy (2020) focused on demonstrating a sea-
sonal prediction system for wildfire event prediction in Australia. This 
measured  spatio-temporal  variations  and  seasonality  across  several 
datasets  and  utilized  this  methodology  to  predict  wildfire  events, 
focusing on the seasonal predictions using the 2019â€“2020 wildfire sea-
son  as  an  example  and  measuring  long-term  predictions.  Coen  et  al.

2.1.2. Measurement and extraction of NDVI data 

A spectral index, NDVI from GEE datasets is a measure of the level of 
greenness  of  the  land  in  the  form  of  an  index  ranging  from  (cid:0) 1  to  1, 
which  helps  understand  the  density  of  forests  and  relative  health  of 
vegetation involved. NDVI differentiates vegetation from other types of 
land cover using Eq. (1) (Earth Observing System, 2019): 

NDVI =

NIR(cid:0) R
NIR+R
