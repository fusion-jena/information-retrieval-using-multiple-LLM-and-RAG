On the other hand, since the powerful feature extraction 
capabilities, the deep learning methods have succeed in many 
fields,  such  as  computer  vision  and  natural  language 
processing. In recently, the deep learning based methods have 
also  been  used  to  solve  the  HSI  classification  task  and 
achieved remarkable achievements. Among the deep learning 
methods,  the  Convolutional  Neural  Networks  (CNNs)  are 
most widely explored to solve the HSI classification task. Hu 
et  al.  [4]  designed  a  one-dimensional  convolutional  neural 
network(1-D-CNN) for classification according to the spectral 
feature  of  HSI.  Due  to  the  insufficient  training  data,  the 
designed  1-D-CNN  just  includes  a  convolution  operation,  a 
pooling operation and a fully connected operation. Although 
the structure of  designed 1-D-CNN is simple, it achieved a 
satisfactory  classification  performance.  The  classification

architecture,  the  multiscale  CNN  is  utilized  to  extract 
multiscale spatial features, and the LSTM is used to extract

residual  network 
including residual blocks  of spectral and spatial based on the 
3-D convolutional kernel have also been proposed to solve the
HSI classification task and achieved the highest classification
accuracy on three data sets [8]. Roy et al. [9] designed a novel
CNN architecture for HSI classification, which firstly use the
3-D convolutional to extract the joint spatial–spectral features
and  then  use  the  2-D  convolutional  to  learn  more  abstract-
level spatial representation.

The pooling layer is mainly applied to compress the input 
data,  which  often  follows  convolutional  layer.  The  max-
pooling strategy is used in SSPCNN.

accuracies on three data sets are 90.16% , 92.60% ,and 92.56% 
respectively.  Zhang  et  al.  [5]  proposed  a  DCNN  including 
spectral  and  spatial  two  channels.  The    spectral  and  spatial 
features  of  HSI  are  extracted  by  the  one-dimensional 
convolutional 
convolutional 
respectively  in  DCNN.  The  DCNN  achieved  the  best 
classification  performances  on two  data  sets  compared  with 
other methods. Y. Chen et al. [6] designed a new CNN model 
with  regularization  based  on  the  3-D  convolutional  to  solve 
the HSI classification task and made a success on three data 
sets. Xu et al. [7] proposed a new architecture that integrating
