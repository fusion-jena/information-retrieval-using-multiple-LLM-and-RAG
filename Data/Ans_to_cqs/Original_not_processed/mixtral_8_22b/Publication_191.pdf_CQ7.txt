pre-train each network using its corresponding leaf data. During 
the validation phase, we combine both softmax outputs and com- 
pute the ﬁnal class scores using fusion methods: average (ave) or 
max voting (mav).

deeper, its optimization capability can be further improved. How- 
ever, deep CNN networks require very large amounts of training 
data. Table 6 shows examples of existing well-known datasets and 
their size as quantity of images. The biggest plant database that 
we  have  found  is  the  PlantClef2015  dataset  [6]  which  has  only 
around 113,205 number of images. This is still far from matching 
the scale and variety of existing general major datasets for images 
[51,52,55] , videos [53] or languages [54] . In addition, we can see 
that the PlantClef2015 dataset [6] has one of the largest number 
of object categories but the least number of images. For example, 
compared to the ILSVRC 2010 dataset [55] , it has less than 10% of 
their total images but the same number of categories. Hence, to

We  train  our  model  using  Caffe  [35]  framework.  For  the  pa- 
rameter  setting  in  training,  we  employ  step  learning  policy.  The 
learning rate was initially set to 10 −3  for all layers to accept the 
newly deﬁned last fully connected layer set to 10 −2 . It is higher 
than other layers due to the weights being trained starting from 
random. The learning rate was then decreased by a factor of 10 ev- 
ery 20K iteration and was stopped after 100K iterations. The units 
of the third fully connected layer (fc8) were changed according to 
the number of classes of training data. We set the batch size to 50 
and momentum to 0.9. We applied L 
2 weight decay with penalty 
multiplier set to 5 × 10 −4 and dropout ratio set to 0.5, respectively.

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide explicit information on how the data was split for deep learning model training into sets such as train, test, and validation. However, based on common practices in machine learning and deep learning, there are several ways to split the data. One popular method is random splitting, where the entire dataset is shuffled randomly, and then divided into three subsets: training set, validation set, and testing set. Typically, the split ratios are 60-80% for training, 10-20% for validation, and 10-20% for testing. Another approach is stratified sampling, where the splits maintain the original distribution of labels in the dataset. Additionally, time series data may use forward chaining or backward chaining techniques for splitting. Without specific details about the dataset and task, it is difficult to determine the exact criteria used for splitting the data in this case.
