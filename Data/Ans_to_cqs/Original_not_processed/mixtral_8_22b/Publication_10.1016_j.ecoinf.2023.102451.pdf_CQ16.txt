capable of learning weights for a generalized trained model on the un-
seen test set of EMDS-6. In model optimization learning rate was set to 
0.002 and the batch size was set to 32. The proposed model is trained for 
100 epochs with optimizer AdamW and the activation function GELU 
which  are  chosen  very  carefully  due  to  their  effectiveness  with  the 
proposed  model  for  the  considered  dataset.  Finally,  the  default  loss 
function  cross-entropy  is  used  to  calculate  the  loss  of  the  proposed 
network. By considering all the results of this section taken into account 
it was found that the proposed model EMViT-Net may be considered as 
fast and more reliable due to its low computational cost and efficiency. 
The loss and accuracy curves of the reported network are given in 
Fig.  5.  which  represents  training  and  validation  accuracy  with  their 
corresponding loss for the proposed model EMViT-Net with a specific

3.4. Performance evaluation 

The classification performance of the proposed model EMViT-Net is 
assessed by calculating the precision, recall, f1-score and accuracy of the 
model as these are the most popular performance evaluation indicators. 
The precision defines the ratio of true positive to all positive predicted 
samples.  The  sensitivity  is  also  known  as  recall  which  defines  the 
number of positive samples predicted correctly to all positive samples 
and the f1-score is a general indicator of precision and recall. The ac-
curacy  of  a  model  can  be  measured  by  calculating  the  ratio  of  true 
positive and true negative to the overall collected samples. Here true

Helpful Answer:

Based on the provided context, it appears that the proposed model, EMViT-Net, is trained for 100 epochs using the optimizer AdamW and the activation function GELU. However, there is no explicit mention of the criteria used to determine when training is complete. Typically, common criteria used to determine when training is complete include reaching a certain number of epochs, achieving a desired level of performance on a validation set, or observing a plateau in the validation loss. In this case, since the model is trained for a fixed number of epochs (100), it seems likely that this criterion was used to determine when training was complete. Additionally, the use of a validation set during training suggests that performance on this set could have been monitored to inform decisions about when to stop training. However, without further information, it is not possible to definitively say what criteria were used to determine when training was complete for this particular model.
