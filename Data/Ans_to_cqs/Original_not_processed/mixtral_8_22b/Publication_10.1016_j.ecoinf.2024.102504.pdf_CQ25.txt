Helpful Answer:
The paper titled "Predicting air quality with deep learning LSTM: Towards comprehensive models" by Navares and Aznarte (2020) uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, which is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN). This deep learning model is used for time series analysis and prediction tasks. Specifically, it aims to predict air quality parameters such as CO, NO2, O3, SO2, and PM10 concentrations. Therefore, the purpose of this deep learning model is prediction or regression, rather than classification, segmentation, or detection.
