and left-right mirroring data augmentation techniques, which reduced

The  snow  leopard  training  pipeline  described  here  may  be  repur-
posed rather quickly to train new models if more users utilize the system 
and  additional  data  is  submitted.  The  existing  model  may  also  help 
bootstrap that data-curation process. There is a considerable possibility 
for  regional  and  global  research  collaborations  with  snow  leopard 
research  institutions  to  curate  and  independently  identify  data  that 
would advance these existing models toward greater sophistication and 
improved performance. Deep learning systems have the ability to sur-
pass humans in the re-identification of animals, even in the absence of 
obvious patterns and markings, if sufficient datasets and collaboration

cation  studies,  a  lack  of  data  is  the  greatest  challenge  and  limitation 
researchers encounter (Schneider et al., 2019). With the data collection 
compiled  in  this  work,  we  contribute  the  largest  fully  labeled  snow 
leopard dataset for deep learning research. In addition, we anticipate 
that our novel deep learning methods will encourage other academics to 
contribute  more  datasets  to  Whiskerbook.org  for  the  purpose  of 
continuously curating and enhancing the data used to improve the deep 
learning pipeline. Comparing these results to those of an earlier study by 
Johansson et al. (2020) that depended on human manual classification, 
without  AI  or  software,  determined  that  observers  significantly  over-
estimate  the  true  abundance.  AI-based  individual  ID  within  Whiske 
rbook.org  has  demonstrated  the  potential  to  enhance  the  precision 
and  efficiency  of  manual  observers,  approaching  more  accurate  esti-

referred  to  as  “mirroring  or  flip  augmentation”,  and  they  have  been 
found to considerably increase the performance of deep learning algo-
rithms (Chatfield et al., 2014). The left/right mirroring method helped 
us to expand the dataset. We anticipate that mirroring could double the 
backdrop texture pool used for background matching. This mirroring is a 
configuration setting that can be enabled on or off during PIE training. It 
has previously been used on complicated matching problems to achieve 
maximum  image-level  consistency:  PIE  can  typically  match  multiple 
perspectives but standardizing them can improve accuracy even more.

Image classification 

To assess the efficacy of the various techniques, we compute the top- 
k accuracy on a test set, where k = 1, 5, and 10 represents the position of 
the correct match (i.e., an annotation of the same individual represented 
by a query annotation) within a list of proposed matches. Consequently, 
a top-1 rank is an accurate result supplied by the algorithm as the most 
probable match for a candidate annotation. A top-5 rating indicates that 
the correct answer might be any of the top-5 values among the returned 
options, and so on.

Helpful Answer:
One of the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline is left-right mirroring, also known as flip augmentation. This technique was found to significantly increase the performance of deep learning algorithms. By using the left/right mirroring method, the researchers were able to expand their dataset. They anticipated that mirroring could double the backdrop texture pool used for background matching. Mirroring is a configuration setting that can be enabled or disabled during PIE training. It has previously been used on complex matching problems to achieve maximum image-level consistency.

Additional Context:
The authors do not explicitly mention other specific data augmentation techniques such as rotation or scaling in the given text. However, it is common practice in deep learning pipelines to use various data augmentation techniques like rotation, scaling, cropping, etc., to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization capabilities of the model. Therefore, while not mentioned specifically, it is possible that other data augmentation techniques beyond left-right mirroring were employed in the deep learning pipeline.
