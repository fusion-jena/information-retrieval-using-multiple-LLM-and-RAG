Beyond obtaining satellite images with high-quality geometric and 
radiometric  information,  many  biogeophysical  parameters  have  been 
obtained from the processing of these images (Sowmya et al., 2017; Vos 
et  al.,  2019;  Yang  et  al.,  2013).  For  instance,  from  the  spatial  and 
spectral ranges provided by the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging 
Spectroradiometer)  sensor,  44  different  standard  data  products  have 
been developed and are classified into Atmosphere, Land, Cryosphere

crawling  tool,  alongside  the  SensingTools  application,  forms  a  robust 
framework  for  environmental  monitoring  and  decision-making.  How-
ever,  it  is  crucial  to  acknowledge  the  limitations  inherent  in  the  SRS 
crawling tool. The crawler is sensitive to alterations in the architecture 
of  the  targeted  websites,  necessitating  regular  updates  to  maintain 
algorithmic accuracy. This sensitivity underscores the tool’s reliance on 
the continuous availability and accessibility of the websites it queries, a 
limitation that is intrinsic to web-based data collection methodologies. 
By disclosing these constraints, we endeavor to ensure a transparent and 
comprehensive understanding of the tool’s operational parameters. The 
repository  housing the  SRS crawling tool  and the  SensingTools appli-
cation, available at (SMARTLAGOON, 2022), contains essential files that 
support the crawling process, manage API requests, file downloads, and

Query: "How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific details about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, common methods used for hyperparameter optimization include Grid Search, Random Search, Bayesian Optimization, and Gradient-Based Optimization. Without further information, it cannot be determined which method was used for this particular case.
