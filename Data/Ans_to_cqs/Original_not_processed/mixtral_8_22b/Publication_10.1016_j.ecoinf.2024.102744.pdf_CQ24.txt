overfitting. Additionally, the Global Average Pooling layer summarizes features, generating input 

for the fully connected layer. This layer also facilitates the visualization of regions relied upon by 

the network for predictions. The subsequent three fully connected layers generate the predicted 

class for the original image

Experimental  results  demonstrate  that  the  classification  method  outperforms  other  networks, 

yielding a mean accuracy of 98.4%. 

To gauge the efficacy of the proposed network, we compare its classification results with 

those  of  other  pertinent  studies  on  the  PollenDataset.  The  classification  accuracy  results  are 

outlined  in  Table  3.  Accordingly,  our  proposed  model  has  2%  higher  accuracy  than  the 

second-ranked methods in terms of accuracy. Additionally, to elucidate the regions contributing to 

the networkâ€™s decision-making process, several GradCAM images are provided in Fig. 13. These 

images are represented as heatmaps, wherein areas of greater interest to the model are denoted by 

red,  whereas  those  of  lesser  interest  are  denoted  by  blue.  As  depicted  in  the  figure,  the  model 

predominantly focuses on the pollen-laden areas of the bee to differentiate between pollen-bearing

4.2. Our proposed methods 

When applying two baseline models for pollen-bearing bee detection, the small size of the pollen 

sac presents a challenge, as the external appearance of pollen-bearing and non-pollen-bearing bees 

is  similar.  Consequently,  deep  learning  networks  may  encounter  difficulty  in  distinguishing 

between these two objects. Furthermore, upon observing the image data collected from bee hives, 

it becomes apparent that there is an imbalance in the number of pollen-bearing bees compared to

non-pollen-bearing bees. In light of these challenges, this study introduces three improvements to 

the  two  baseline  models,  namely  YOLOv5  and  Faster  RCNN.  Our  first  improvement  involves 

initially detecting bees from images, wherein the bee class encompasses both pollen-bearing and

VnPollenBee dataset. The best metrics values are shown in bold font.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it mentions using dropout layers to prevent overfitting, which can introduce randomness into the training process. Dropout randomly sets a fraction of input units to 0 during each update, helping to avoid co-adaptation among neurons. While this doesn't directly address the issue of controlling randomness due to factors like random seed values, it demonstrates one way to manage variability within the deep learning pipeline.
