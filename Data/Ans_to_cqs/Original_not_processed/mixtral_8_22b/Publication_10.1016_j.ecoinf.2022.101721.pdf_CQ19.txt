Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

in  predicting  means,  SDs  and  finally  population  sizes  based  on  the 
observed data (e.g. Bhattacharya, 1967), thus reducing manual labour to 
a minimum.

identification  of  species.  To  try  to  overcome  this  problem,  species 
identification  based  on  machine  learning  was  introduced  (Jennings

full  sample  (N  = 10,000)  using  both  uninformative  and  informative 
priors through the R-code (supplement S1). The outcome is presented in 
a figure, but is also stored as a .csv file when running the R-code, hence, 
the number of errors at each frequency can be studied in detail.

%Query
Query: "Which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about which specific frameworks were used to build the deep learning models for species identification. However, it mentions that the process involves machine learning and uses R-code for analysis. Therefore, we cannot definitively state whether popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch were utilized.
