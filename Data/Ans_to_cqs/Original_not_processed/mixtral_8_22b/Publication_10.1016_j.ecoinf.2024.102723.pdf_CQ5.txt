The Neural Networks were built from scratch, implemented using
TensorFlow (tf) (Abadi et al., 2015) and Keras (Chollet et al., 2015).
Coupled with TensorFlow, an open-source framework developed by
Google, Keras serves as a high-level Neural Networks API, offering a
seamless and user-friendly approach to building, training, and deploying
deep learning models. The MCD layers consist of a modification of the
Keras Dropout class, while the layers based on the VBI method derive
from the TensorFlow Probability (tfp) module (in particular, we used the
DenseVariational type of layers). These two architectures have the same
input and output layers, they differ for the structure of the hidden layers.
The size of the input layer depends on the problem we are facing: it has
two nodes, one for DOY and the other for GDD. As our focus will be on
dealing with regression problems, the output layer is actually a combi-
nation of a fully-connected layer (or Dense layer) with two nodes and a

siderations made earlier, a Bayesian Deep Learning model, if properly
configured and trained, can return satisfactory results even with limited
datasets, which is the scenario studied in the present work.

5. Conclusions

The ongoing need for advances in Deep Learning techniques applied
to agriculture is driving research towards the development of cost-
effective models, robust to noise and variability, facilitating real-time
decision-making (Attri et al., 2023). Current frameworks are hindered
by their reliance on large datasets, limited interpretability, and chal-
lenges in generalization; they are deployed on personal computers,
which are inefficient and energy-intensive for practical applications.
Therefore, it is essential for emerging smart farming–oT initiatives in
agriculture to be supported by a new perspective in artificial intelligence
research (Abdar et al., 2021; Attri et al., 2023; Gupta et al., 2022).

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the study focuses on dealing with regression problems and uses Bayesian Deep Learning models. It also states that these models can return satisfactory results even with limited datasets, suggesting that the dataset used might not be extensive. Additionally, the context discusses the application of deep learning techniques in agriculture, indicating that the dataset could potentially involve agricultural data such as crop growth patterns, weather conditions, soil quality, etc. But without explicit mention of the dataset names, it cannot be confirmed.
