3.1.3. Predicted intensity maps 

Figs.  3  to  6  show  the  predicted  intensity  maps  with  80%  hidden 
observations for the different combinations of lasso regularization and 
bias correction. The results for 20% and 50% hidden observations are 
shown in Appendix A.1.2. The following intensity prediction maps do 
not  display  all  methods  tested  previously.  We  focus  on  the  best  per-
forming methods across the performance measures (knn, LoopT) as well

• sp.scale: the spatial resolution for the quadrature grid in km—as defined in the ppmlasso package;  
• cov.bias: The column number of the variable chosen as a proxy for the observer bias in quadsenv. The default value is set to NULL;  
• kVal: the value to factor out of the observer bias proxy cov.bias. The default value is set to NULL;  
• n.fits: the number of models to fit through the regularization path—as defined in the ppmlasso package. The default value is set to 50. 

To run the ppmlassoMixEngine, we can use the following lines:

Helpful Answer:
After the model training, there are several postprocessing steps that can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the task or application. Some common postprocessing steps include:

* Saliency Maps: These visualize which parts of the input image were most important for the model's decision making process. They help identify areas where the model may have focused too much attention or overlooked relevant features.
* Metrics Calculation: This involves calculating various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score etc. to evaluate the performance of the model. It helps determine how well the model has learned from the training data and its ability to generalize to new unseen data.
* Confusion Matrix: This is a table layout used to describe the performance of a classification algorithm. Each row represents the instances in an actual class while each column represents the instances in a predicted class. It provides insights into the types of errors made by the model and their frequency.

These postprocessing steps provide valuable feedback about the strengths and weaknesses of the trained model and guide further improvements. However, it should be noted that these steps are not mandatory and can vary based on the specific needs of the project.
