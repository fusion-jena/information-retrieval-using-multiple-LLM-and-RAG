provide crystal-clear images for further examination. The added image 
enhancement  technique  enabled  the  proposed  systems  to  reach  high 
accuracy values. 

This  dataset  is  used  after  these  pre-processing  steps  with  the  sug-
gested models. Table 3 presents a comparison between different trained 
deep learning models proposed in this paper. The table shows the five 
different  deep  learning  models  chosen  for  this  application  and  their 
reported  accuracy  and  F1-score.  The  table  also  shows  ten  different

Accuracy

3.7. Performance metrics 

In this work, we measure the accuracy of the deep-learning models 

by using the following metrics:  

• Accuracy 

accuracy which is a simple metric for deep-learning classification 
models. This metric measures the overall percentage of correct pre-
dictions. However, accuracy does not take into account the different 
types  of  errors.  That  is  the  reason  we  employ  other  metrics  for 
measuring the efficiency of deep learning models. 

Accuracy =

TP + TN
TP + TN + FP + FN

• Precision 

(1)    

Precision  is  a  metric  that  measures  the  number  of  positive  pre-
dictions  that  are  actually  correct  viz.  a  viz.  correct  and  incorrect 
positive predictions. 

recall is a metric that measures the number of positive predictions 
that are actually correct viz. a viz. correct positive predictions and 
incorrect negative predictions. Recall measures how many positive 
predictions were correctly spotted by the model. 

Recall = TP

TP + FN

3. Methodology 

The  approach  proposed  in  this  work  can  be  explained  as  follows. 
First, the dataset is balanced using the class-weighted technique. This 
step is important as the deep learning models have a bias towards classes 
with  a  large  number  of  images.  This  needs  to  be  solved  using  a  data 
balancing technique. Also, the data imbalanced in the proposed dataset 
is small hence a simple algorithm like class-weighted is proposed. Then a 
novel image pre-processing technique is proposed. A number of different 
models from the state-of-the-art deep learning models are tested. The 
results  of  the  five  best  models  are  reported.  Also,  different  ensemble 
models are tested and compared. The results show that ensemble models 
can increase the accuracy of the classification hence introducing more 
stable models.

Different  deep  learning  models  are  tested  to  find  the  model  with  the 
highest accuracy. The results show that EfficientNet achieves the highest 
accuracy.  A  data  augmentation  technique  is  added  to  increase  the 
number  of  images  from 55,448  to  61,486  images.  Results  of  the  pro-
posed deep learning models on the dataset with and without augmen-
tation  are  reported. This  work  augments  the  dataset using a  complex 
data augmentation technique to produce a new dataset. However, in our 
proposed work we use an augmented version of PlanVillage that can be 
used by different researchers for comparison. Also, we propose using a

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily uses image data. The text mentions the use of a dataset containing images, and there are references to techniques such as image enhancement and image pre-processing. Additionally, the performance metrics mentioned, including accuracy, precision, and recall, are commonly used in evaluating image classification tasks. Therefore, it can be concluded that the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is images.
