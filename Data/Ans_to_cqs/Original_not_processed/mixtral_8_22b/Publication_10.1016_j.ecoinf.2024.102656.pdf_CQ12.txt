3.2. Model performance 

The five  component  models (GLM,  MaxEnt,  RF, GBM,  and  MARS) 
demonstrated variable  performance (Table 2).  Notably, the  RF model 
and the GLM model demonstrated the best and worst performance for all 
studied species, respectively (Table 2). 

3.3. Variable contributions to habitat suitability 

In the ensemble habitat suitability model, distance to mining roads, 
distance  to  roads,  distance  to  CAs,  and  distance  to  water  resources 
played  important  roles  in  predicting  habitat  suitability  for  the  three 
species (Table  3). Response curves  detailing the  relationship between 
habitat suitability and environmental variables in the best-performing 
model  (the  RF  model),  are  presented  in  Supplementary  Materials

available in Supplementary text S1). This methodology enhances pre-
dictive  accuracy  by  combining  forecasts  from  multiple  statistical 
models, mitigating the uncertainties and biases inherent in relying on a 
single modelling method (Araújo and New, 2007; Hysen et al., 2022). 
Five  statistical  models  were  used  in  this  ensemble  framework, 
including  generalized  linear  models  (GLM),  maximum  entropy  (Max-
Ent),  random  forest  (RF),  generalized  boosting  model  (GBM),  and 
multivariate  adaptive  regression  lines  (MARS).  To  facilitate  model 
training, we employed a 3:1 train-test split for the occurrence points. 
Additionally, following Barbet-Massin et al. (2012), we generated 1000 
random  pseudo-absence  points  (five  times  the  number  of  occurrence 
points per species) across the study area. These pseudo-absence points 
are crucial for model execution and provide a reference for areas that are 
unlikely to be inhabited by the target species.

Connectivity  prediction  was  implemented  in  UNICOR  over  the 
resistance  map  for  the  species  to  find  the  single-source  shortest  path 
between  start  and  end  occurrence  records  (Landguth  et  al.,  2012; 
Cushman et al., 2013). Furthermore, the continuous factorial least-cost 
path map was converted to a categorical map based on the same method 
used  for  core  habitats.  To  measure  the  coverage  of  core  habitats  and 
corridors by CAs, the proportion of these areas within CAs was measured 
(Almasieh and Mohammadi, 2023).

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it appears that no specific deep learning model such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers has been mentioned in the context. Instead, the paper discusses using various statistical models like Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt), Random Forest (RF), Generalized Boosting Model (GBM), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Lines (MARS) in an ensemble framework to improve predictive accuracy. Therefore, there isn't enough information to determine if any deep learning models have been utilized in the pipeline.
