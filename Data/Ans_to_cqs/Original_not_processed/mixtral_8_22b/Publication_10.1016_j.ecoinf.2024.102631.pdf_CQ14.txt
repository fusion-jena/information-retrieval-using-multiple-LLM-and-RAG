A quantitative analysis of this dataset is given in Table 5, confirming 
our  model's  effectiveness.  Our  method  has  achieved  a  UIQM  score  of 
3.26 and an NIQE score of 5.39, followed by the Funie-GAN in terms of 
UIQM with a score of 3.21 and Fusion in terms of NIQE with a score of 
5.40. While measuring the UCIQE score, IBLA achieved a score of 0.626, 
although their resultant images are just color deviations from the orig-
inal images. However, since UCIQE measures a linear combination of 
chroma, saturation, and contrast, a higher value can be expected just by 
having a change in colors (even if they are not desirable).

method's performance. Higher PSNR and SSIM scores indicate a closer 
resemblance of the result to the reference image.

lationships among features. Unlike channel attention, which emphasizes 
‘what’ is meaningful within an input, spatial attention is concerned with 
‘where’ the informative regions are located, offering a complementary 
perspective. To create the spatial attention map, the SA branch begins by 
separately applying global average pooling and max pooling operations 
along the channel dimensions of the feature map F as give by eq.2 and 
eq.3. The global average pooling is expressed as:

Query: "How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The paper does not provide information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether grid search or random search was used for optimization.
