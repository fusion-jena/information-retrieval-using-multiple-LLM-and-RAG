all  based  on  the  lower  level  representations  learned  in  previous

in a supervised fashion, such that the learning algorithm (usually 
stochastic  gradient  decent),  is  told  what  the  desired  output  is  for 
each input data sample.

envisioned  for  further  enhancing  analysts'  ability  to  explore  and 
search large volumes of sensor data, including providing a richer 
set  of  elemental  signal  attributes,  a  more  natural-language 
interface, and also the ability to search by exemplars.

classification  model  output.  We  run  existing  DL  models  against 
our  survey  data  to  automatically  classify  and  detect  species  or 
events  of  interest  for  each  project.  These  models  output  the 
relative  probability  that  an  event  is  from  a  specific  data  class 
(usually  corresponding  to  a  species  or  event),  and  analysts  can 
sort the data accordingly. Analysts are then presented with ranked

development  is  shifting  from  programs  hand-written  by  domain 
experts, to training machines by examples – often millions of data 
points  in  the  case  of  difficult  problems  such  as  unconstrained 
image recognition [32]. The major enablers for the success of DL 
have  been  the  availability  of  large  amounts  of  data,  and  the 
corresponding  computational  infrastructure  required  by  the

performance of a DL algorithm scales very well with the number 
of  training  examples  and  the  amount  of  compute  cycles  can  be

The biodiversity monitoring application that we have outlined is a 
prime candidate for application of DL, due to availability of large 
amounts  of  labeled  data  produced  by  the  analysts  using  our  UI.

Helpful Answer:

In the given context, there isn't explicit information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention that stochastic gradient descent is typically used as the learning algorithm, which is common in deep learning models.

Generally, in machine learning and deep learning, several criteria can be used to decide when training should stop. One commonly used criterion is the validation loss plateau. This means that if the validation loss stops decreasing significantly after a certain point during training, it might indicate that the model has reached its optimal performance and any further training may lead to overfitting.

Another criterion could be early stopping, where training is stopped once the validation error starts increasing again. Additionally, one could use a predefined maximum number of epochs or iterations as a simple stopping rule.

However, without additional context, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete in this particular scenario.
