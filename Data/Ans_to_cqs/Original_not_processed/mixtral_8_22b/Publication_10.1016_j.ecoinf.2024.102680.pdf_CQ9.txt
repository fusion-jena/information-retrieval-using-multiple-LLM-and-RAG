Owing to the insufficient clarity of underwater optical images, gen-
eral deep learning networks have difficulty capturing accurate feature 
information and cannot detect objects correctly. The original YOLOv8 
network  uses  the  C2f  module  for  feature  extraction.  However,  this 
module employs an split  operation on features after convolution. This 
operation divides the input data into two non-overlapping parts, making 
it  difficult  to  obtain  comprehensive  and  rich  feature  information 
through half of the channel’s features. Specifically, the shape of features 
F obtained after convolution is ℝN×H×W×C, where N represents the batch 
size, C represents the channel number, and H and W denote the height 
and width, respectively. The split  operation evenly divides F  into two 
parts on the channel dimension with shapes of ℝN×H×W×0.5C, and these 
two parts do not overlap. The original YOLOv8 convolves only half of

comprehensively  extract  shallow  and  deep  feature  maps  from  under-
water optical images, and the LKSP module was used for an extensive 
multi-scale analysis of deep feature maps. These results indicate that our 
network  can  accurately  detect  underwater  objects  in  complex  under-
water environments.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The paper does not provide specific information about the availability or location of the deep learning pipeline's data repository. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the data repository is available on platforms such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. To find out more about the data repository, one would need to contact the authors directly or refer to any supplementary materials associated with the study.
