E.  Evaluation Metrics 

Since one of the datasets used was imbalanced, measuring 
the performance of the proposed method using accuracy alone 
would  not  be  a  sufficient  metric.  Therefore,  other  metrics 
including recall, precision, specificity, and F1-score were also 
used in the evaluation. These metrics are based on a number 
of true positive (TP) or true negative (TN) where the predicted 
species matches the ground truth class and false positive (FP) 
or false negative (FN) where  the predicted  species does not 
match  with  the  ground  truth  class.  In  summary,  these 
evaluation metrics are represented in Equations 1 – 5.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Answer: Training completion is determined by several criteria, depending on the model and optimization algorithm being used. One common criterion is reaching a validation loss plateau, where further training no longer significantly improves the model's performance on the validation set. This can indicate that the model has learned as much as it can from the data without overfitting. Another criterion could be setting a maximum number of epochs, such as the mentioned 10 epochs in this case, after which training will stop regardless of whether the validation loss has plateaued or not. Additionally, early stopping can be employed, where training stops if the validation loss starts increasing instead of decreasing, indicating potential overfitting. However, the exact criteria may vary between different applications and models.
