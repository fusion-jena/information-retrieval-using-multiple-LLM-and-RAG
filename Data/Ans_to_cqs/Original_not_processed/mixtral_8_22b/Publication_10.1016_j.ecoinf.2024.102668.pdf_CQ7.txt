bility—differences between recording devices. By reducing device bias, 
we enhance the applicability of these indices for broader comparative 
analyses, potentially extending their use to fields like machine learning 
and deep learning, which require consistent feature spaces across studies 
regardless of the recording device used (Purwins et al., 2019).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide explicit information on the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, common practices in machine learning and deep learning include splitting the dataset randomly or using stratified sampling based on class labels. The typical ratios used are 60-80% for training, 10-20% for testing, and 10-20% for validation. Cross-validation techniques such as K-fold cross-validation can also be employed to ensure robustness and generalization of the trained models.
