2.2. Data and platforms 

The initial LULC classification was done using Google Earth Engine 
(GEE),  a  cloud  processing  platform  which  provides  a  public  catalog 
containing  petabytes  of  satellite  imagery  and  geospatial  datasets, 
allowing for high performance and rapid planetary scale processing and 
analysis  of  images.  The  platform  allows  for  access,  selection,  and

classification  algorithm  (ee.Clusterer.wekaKMeans  in  GEE),  which 
segmented each image into 10 classes (based on RGB, near infrared and 
shortwave infrared bands). This number allowed for an initial  assess-
ment of the study area and the identification of sub-class spectral pat-
terns that existed within each of the five final classes. The cluster images 
were  used  for  a  more  informed  decision  about  suitable  locations  for 
training sites for the supervised classification.

2.3.2. Creation of cloud masks 

Based on the image quality bands, cloud masks were created for each 
of the 12 images. These images were used to support the decision on 
suitable locations for training sites for the supervised classification. They 
were also used to mask the clouds in the LULC maps.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information regarding the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the context that the authors use satellite imagery for their research. Therefore, the most likely data format used in this case is image data. Specifically, they mention using Google Earth Engine (GEE), a cloud processing platform with a vast collection of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets. Furthermore, they discuss classifying these images using an unsupervised clustering algorithm (ee.Clusterer.wekaKMeans) and segmenting them into different classes based on various bands such as RGB, near infrared, and shortwave infrared. All these details suggest that the researchers primarily work with image data in their deep learning pipeline.
