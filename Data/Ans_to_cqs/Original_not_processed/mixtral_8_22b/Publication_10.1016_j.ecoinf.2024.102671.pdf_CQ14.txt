%Query
Query: "How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific details about how the hyperparameters of any particular model were optimized. However, common methods used for hyperparameter optimization include Grid Search, Random Search, Bayesian Optimization, Gradient-Based Optimization, Evolutionary Algorithms, and Hyperband. These techniques help find the best combination of hyperparameters for a machine learning algorithm to improve its performance. Without more specific information about the model or methodology used in this research, it is impossible to determine which hyperparameter optimization technique was employed.
