varies from 7 s to 16 s, depending on the image size and the number of 
objects in the image and their sizes, which is a very fast processing time 
for  high-pixels-per-image  (HPP)  images  up  to  50  MB  based  on  the 
camera system that is explained in Section 3. The overall computational 
complexity of the developed algorithms is O(n log n). It is important to 
point out that the supervised DL and ML approaches, designed by us in 
our previous work in (Kuru et al., 2023), that runs on similar images in 
the same surveys, can detect specific marine small natural objects (e.g., 
birds) in a few seconds (i.e., between 2 and 4 s). In this sense, we can 
conclude that DL and ML techniques slightly outperform the proposed 
non-supervised technique developed in this study considering the pro-
cessing time.

There  are  numerous  studies  in  the  literature  to  detect  underwater 
man-made  objects  (MMOs)  within  a  limited  region  of  interest  (RoI) 
using  underwater  imagery,  robots  or  sonography.  For  instance,  Abu 
et  al.  (Abu  and  Diamant,  2022)  proposes  a  contour-based  features 
analysis method to discern underwater MMOs from natural environment 
considering that contours of MMOs' are supposed to be smoother than 
natural objects. There are a limited number of studies in the literature to 
detect specific types of surface marine MMOs using supervised Machine 
Learning  (ML)  and  Deep  Learning  (DL)  approaches  that  require  prior 
training in the marine ecosystem. For instance, Han et al. (Han et al., 
2022) proposed a DL technique titled LCSE-ResNet to detect, classify and 
locate  vessels  and  oil  platforms  based  on  remote  optical  imagery,  by 
which all other MMOs are excluded. There are no studies in the litera-

%Query
Query: "Which hardware resources are used for training the deep learning model (e.g., GPUs, TPUs)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given references do not provide information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether GPUs, TPUs, or any other hardware resources were used for training the deep learning model.
