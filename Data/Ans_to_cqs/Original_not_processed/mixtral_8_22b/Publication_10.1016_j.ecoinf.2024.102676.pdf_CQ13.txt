Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

These parameters are the number of selected variables in the model, 
the size of the confidence ellipsoid (counter probability), and the cut-off 
threshold value of the distances between the geometrical mean of the 
trails  (Wards-cut-off  distance).  No  hyperparameter  tuning  has  been 
conducted  and  in  order  to  assure  uniformity,  all  models  of  the  same 
species  were  executed  with  the  default  FIT  parameters  on  the  full 
dataset. 

For  the  second experiment, we applied  the same  approach to real 

missing data points. 

In summary, we analyzed 37 FIT runs per species and compared 185 
model outputs in the first experiment and a total of 13 FIT runs for the 
second experiment.

In this paper, the methods used were both intuitive (omitting missing 
values;  mean  imputation)  and  machine-learning-based.  These  proced-
ures and the FIT method are briefly presented below.  

• Control Group 

In the first experiment, the control group consisted of the unmodified 
datasets  of  each  species.  In  the  second  experiment,  we  defined  the 
control  group  as  the  geometric  profile  extracted  by  our  experienced 
operator.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. It only mentions that no hyperparameter tuning was conducted and that all models were executed with the default FIT parameters. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which hyperparameters were used based on the given context.
