abundance, diversity, biomass, 
frequency/rate) 
Description of desired statistical 
comparisons (including sample 
units, replicates, etc.) 
A description / definition of the 
planned spatial extent of the study

captured), including boundaries and 
reasons for constraints (e.g. 
scientific, practical), may connect to 
‘target habitat’ below

A description / definition of the 
planned temporal extent, including 
boundaries, rationale for duration/ 
frequency, and reasons for 
constraints (e.g. scientific, practical)

Query: "What are the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into sets such as train, test, and validation. However, common practices in machine learning include splitting the dataset randomly, stratified sampling based on class labels, or using a time-based split if the data has a temporal component. The specific criteria would depend on the goals of the project and the nature of the data collected.
