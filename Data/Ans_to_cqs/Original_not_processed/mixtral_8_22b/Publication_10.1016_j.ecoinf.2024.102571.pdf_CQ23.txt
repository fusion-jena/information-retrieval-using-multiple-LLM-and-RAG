developed a three-layer feedforward back-propagation neural network 
with a 30–20-10 architecture, and the activation functions were tansig, 
tansig, and purelin, respectively. The input factors were population size 
and GDP, and the predicted output was GHGdwts. 70% of the data were 
used for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for model testing. The

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that some form of cross-validation or stratified splitting might have been used based on the mention of using 70% of the data for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for model testing. This approach is commonly employed to evaluate the performance of machine learning models and prevent overfitting. Additionally, the use of diverse input factors such as population size and GDP could contribute to improving the model's ability to generalize across different scenarios. Nevertheless, without more detailed information regarding the exact methods applied, it cannot be definitively stated which specific techniques were utilized to enhance the model's generalizability.
