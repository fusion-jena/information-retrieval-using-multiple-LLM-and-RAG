This  system  is  most  compatible  with  tensorflow  version 
1.14.0 and keras version 2.2.4 along with python 3.6. This model 
has been implemented on a machine with 1 GPU which uses 1 
Image per GPU and batch size for mrcnn training is  taken as a 
product of GPU and Images per GPU. The system used resnet 
50 and resnet 101 as backbone structures and used anchor boxes 
of ratio 32, 64, 128, 256, 512. The width and height of images 
in  this  research  is  fixed,  therefore  [a,640,640,3]  becomes  the 
image  shape  here  and  [a,640,640,1]  becomes  the  mask  shape 
where  a  is  the  number  of  training  images  and  true  masked 
images. For training on Mask R-CNN, 20 epochs with 500 steps 
each  are  being  used  for  training  images  and  100  steps  for 
validation images while evaluating the model. The learning rate, 
 used for heads layer training  has been  taken as 0.001 while 
during  all  layers  training    decayed  by  10.  For  weight

%Query
Query: "How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, it mentions specific values for certain hyperparameters such as the learning rate, alpha (α), and the number of epochs used during training. It also specifies the versions of TensorFlow, Keras, and Python used, as well as the hardware configuration (1 GPU).

Unfortunately, without more detailed information regarding the optimization process, we cannot definitively state whether techniques like grid search or random search were employed. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, we do not have enough information to determine the method used for hyperparameter optimization.
