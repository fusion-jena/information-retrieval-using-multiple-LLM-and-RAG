be  established  (Xie  et  al.,  2021).  Deep  noise  reduction  methods 
(Defossez et al., 2020) often use a U-net architecture which consists of an 
encoder and decoder section. The encoder produces a compressed latent 
space representation. The decoder then uses this latent space to recon-
struct the denoised waveform. Recently, transformer attention mecha-
nisms have also been applied with great success (Cao et al., 2022; Luo 
and  Mesgarani,  2019;  Luo  and  Mesgarani,  2023;  Zhang  et  al.,  2022; 
Zhao et al., 2022). As most deep-noise reduction methods focus on NLP 
applications, models are optimized for bandwidths ranging from 16 to 
22  kHz.  Bioacoustics  applications  commonly  exceed  this  bandwidth. 
Additionally, the sparsity of vocalisations in this application and many 
other  bioacoustics  applications  makes  the  development  of  large-scale 
datasets  infeasible  (Stowell,  2021).  These  factors  limit  the  success  of

Deep learning-based denoising methods are most commonly applied 
to  natural  language  processing  (NLP)  such  as  a  human  speech 
enhancement. D´efossez et al. (Defossez et al., 2020) demonstrated the 
potential for deep noise reduction techniques to achieve state-of-the-art 
(SOTA) performance and be applied in sub-real time on limited hard-
ware. These methods commonly operate on audio spectrograms but in 
recent  years  SOTA  deep  learning  methods  (Wang  et  al.,  2021)  have 
successfully  used  raw  waveform  data  (Luo and  Mesgarani,  2019; Luo 
and Mesgarani, 2023) for wider applications such as source separation 
and classification. This removes errors introduced when applying a Fast 
Fourier  Transform  (FFT)  to  generate  a  time-frequency  representation 
and reconstruction errors due to the loss of phase information. These 
networks tend to require more data for training as the latent space must

training  deep  noise  reduction  techniques.  There  are  also  challenges 
when generating training data for fine-tuning. Generally, clean data is 
collected, and noise profiles are superimposed to provide both the input 
data  and  a  “denoised”  ground  truth.  Collecting  clean  recordings  is 
infeasible  in  many  cases  or  requires  the  recording  of  captive  animals 
which  may  not  be  representative  of  the  wider  population.  Adjacent 
fields can generate human speech or music as required but this is not an 
option for many bioacoustics applications.

We compare the audio enhancement model Conformer-Based Metric 
Generative Adversarial Network (CMGAN) developed by Abdulatif et al. 
(Cao et al., 2022) to traditional methods. CMGAN is a Conformer-based 
audio enhancement model that has achieved SOTA performance. This 
model  operates  in  the  time-frequency  domain.  A  pre-trained  CMGAN 
model  is  fine-tuned  using  a  maximum  of  1000  five-second  noisy  and 
clean samples. We use the default training parameters of 120 epochs, 
learning rate of 5e-4 and learning rate decay after the first 30 epochs. We 
test the data requirements of this model in the Section 4.1.1 ablation 
study. All data is down sampled to 16 kHz in alignment with the model’s 
input  requirements.  Default  values  were  used  for  all  training 
parameters.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does discuss some aspects related to the training process and data preparation. For instance, the text mentions that a pre-trained CMGAN model was fine-tuned using a maximum of 1000 five-second noisy and clean samples. Additionally, the data was downsampled to 16 kHz to align with the model's input requirements. While these details do not directly address the query about ensuring generalizability, they suggest that the authors considered certain aspects of data preparation and model adaptation during their study.
