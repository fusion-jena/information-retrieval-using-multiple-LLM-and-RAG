In  addition  to  calculating  MAE  values,  we  also  compared  the 
inference-time to determine the most computationally efficient model. 
We set the batch to 400 to achieve 100% GPU utilization of each model 
and to measure the maximum queries per second (QPS) achieved under 
real-world conditions (Ding et al., 2021). All models were tested under 
the same experiment setting and the same GPU to make comparisons 
between them fair. To do so, we first expand the dataset by a factor of 
five (from 8002 to 40,010 images). Then, we fed batches of 50 images 
into the model to warm up the hardware, before recording the inference- 
time of batches of 100 to quantify QPS.

3. Results

We  used  Pytorch  to  build  our  deep  neural  network,  which  was 
trained on Nvidia V100 GPU. In order to accelerate the convergence of 
the model, our model was pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset (Deng 
et  al., 2009) and then independently  fine-tuned on our  PAD Full and 
PAD Lite datasets. However, some individuals cross multiple age groups. 
Thus, to eliminate the influence of individuals, we applied a five-fold 
subject-exclusive  (SE)  (Han  et  al.,  2014;  Pan  et  al.,  2018)  which 
ensured the same subject did not appear in the training set and testing 
set at the same time. We downscaled the resolution of all images to 224 
× 224 pixels before feeding them to seven models. To avoid overfitting 
and imbalanced problem, we applied aggressive data augmentation. Our 
original images were captured under different illumination and angles. 
Thus, we augmented all training sets randomly via horizontal flipping,

2.2.1. VGG 

VGG nets (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2015) achieved huge success in 
image recognition since it was proposed in 2014. VGG nets use small 
(3×3) convolutional filters to increase the depth of the networks, which 
shows  that  scaling  up  networks  by  depth  can  achieve  better  perfor-
mance. By stacking different numbers of convolutional layers can obtain

%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model, such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. Therefore, based on the available information, it is not possible to determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
