During  the  preprocessing  phase,  techniques  like  auto-orientation, 
resizing,  tiling,  and  filtering  were  utilized  to  standardize  and  enrich 
the dataset. These steps ensured that the images were consistently ori-
ented,  had  a  uniform  size  of  640  × 640  pixels,  and  contained  a  sub-
stantial  amount  of  annotated  data,  meeting  the  90%  annotation 

threshold. Augmentation played a crucial role in further diversifying the 
dataset. By introducing random saturation adjustments to each training 
example, the number of outputs per example was increased to two. This

The  training  set,  comprising  the  majority  of  the  data  (82%),  con-
taining 4000 images, is used to train the model and adjust its parame-
ters, allowing it to learn from a diverse range of examples and patterns in 
the data. The validation set (13%), consisting of 607 images, is utilized 
during  training  to  fine-tune  hyperparameters  and  assess  the  model's 
performance on unseen data, helping to prevent overfitting and ensuring 
generalization. Lastly, the testing set (5%), which included 260 images, 
serves  as  an  independent  evaluation  of  the  model's  performance  on 
completely unseen data, providing a reliable measure of its real-world 
effectiveness and ability to generalize. 

2.3. Performance evaluation 

To evaluate the ablated model results, we use five metrics, namely 
Precision (Eq. (1)), Recall (Eq. (2)), mAP0.5 and mAP0.5:0.95, related to 
Eq. (3), Params(M), Flops(G), Inference(ms) and Time(h).

We  also  consider  Params  and  FLOPs  to  evaluate  the  model.  The 
“Params”  metric  in  a  neural  network  model  refers  to  the  number  of 
learned variables used for making predictions. It is an essential metric 
for  evaluating  the  model's  complexity  and  computational  efficiency.

The  YOLOv8  algorithm  offers  a  range  of  network  structures, 
including  YOLOv8n,  YOLOv8s,  YOLOv8m,  YOLOv8l,  and  YOLOv8x. 
While they differ in width and depth, they follow the same principles 
and can be chosen according to specific needs. The deeper the structure, 
the higher the precision, but the slower the training and inference speed. 
YOLOv8n was chosen as the base structure to prioritize speed without 
compromising  accuracy,  with  further  enhancements  to  improve 
performance. 

Adding the P2 feature level to the YOLOv8 architecture makes the 
network  deeper  because  an  additional  layer  is  added  to  the  overall 
network structure. The YOLOv8 architecture already includes a series of 
convolutional  layers  and  a  neck  section  that  combines  features  from

Helpful Answer: During the preprocessing phase of preparing a dataset for training a deep learning model, several techniques are employed to ensure consistency and richness in the data. Auto-orientation ensures that all images have a consistent orientation. Resizing is applied to standardize image sizes; in this case, all images were resized to 640 x 640 pixels. Tiling and filtering may also be used to further process the images. An important aspect of preprocessing involves annotating the data, which provides valuable information about the content of the images. In this scenario, a 90% annotation threshold was maintained. Data augmentation plays a significant role in enhancing the diversity of the dataset. For instance, by applying random saturation adjustments to each training example, the output per example was doubled, thereby increasing the variety within the training dataset.
