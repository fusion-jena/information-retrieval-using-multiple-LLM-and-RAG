%Query
Query: "What is the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to determine the specific data repository link of the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context. The sources cited do not explicitly mention any links to repositories like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, it is impossible to accurately provide the requested information without further details.
