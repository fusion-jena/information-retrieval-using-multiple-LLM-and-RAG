the Pl@ntNet user community (currently 1.8 million user accounts). At the time
of writing, the CNN architecture used is the inception model49 extended with
batch normalization.50 The network is pre-trained on the commonly used Im-
ageNet dataset and ﬁne-tuned on Pl@ntNet data. Pl@ntNet currently covers
30,261 species illustrated by more than 2.9 million images. The taxonomic
coverage of our study is therefore one to three orders of magnitude larger
than previously published studies making use of automated species identiﬁca-
tion for ecological research. The training of Pl@ntNet CNN requires the mobi-
lization of a high-performance computing infrastructure and expertise in deep,
distributed, and large-scale learning. Thus, the resulting classiﬁcation tool is in
itself a major advance in biodiversity data science.

tions of the training data, and the gap between these and the test
data on which the developed algorithms will be evaluated.28

Access to the Pl@ntNet classiﬁcation tool is provided through a dedicated
API available at my.plantnet.org. The main feature of this API is a RESTful
JSON-based web service that can accept one to ﬁve images of a plant and re-
turns a list of likely species. The species are associated with classiﬁcation
scores (the softmax output of the CNN), as well as a list of matching images
retrieved from the database. To facilitate the implementation of future studies
based on the methodology of this paper, we have developed the ‘‘plantnet’’51
R-package allowing users to query the Pl@ntNet API. The package is available
online at https://github.com/BiologicalRecordsCentre/plantnet.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit details about the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it mentions that access to the Pl@ntNet classification tool is provided through a dedicated API available at my.plantnet.org. This suggests that the model was deployed using an Application Programming Interface (API). APIs allow different software applications to communicate with each other and share functionalities or information. In this case, the API enables users to send requests containing one to five images of a plant and receive a list of likely species along with their classification scores and matching images retrieved from the database.

While the exact process of model deployment isn't mentioned, common steps involved in deploying a deep learning model include model serialization, platform selection, and setting up an appropriate environment for serving predictions. Model serialization involves converting the trained model into a format that can be stored and loaded efficiently. Popular formats for storing serialized models include Protocol Buffers (protobuf), ONNX, and TensorFlow's SavedModel format. Once the model has been serialized, it needs to be hosted on a suitable platform capable of handling incoming requests and returning predictions. Common platforms for hosting machine learning models include cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, and self-hosted solutions such as Flask, FastAPI, or Django.

In summary, while the text doesn't explicitly state the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, it implies that the model was made accessible via a dedicated API. Typically, deploying a deep learning model involves model serialization, selecting a suitable platform, and setting up an appropriate environment for serving predictions.
