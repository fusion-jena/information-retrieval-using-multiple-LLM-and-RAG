To extract the input information, the SRC3 block employs a parallel 
analysis  of  the  input  feature  map  using  two  convolution  kernels.  In 
contrast to the C3 block, the SRC3 block incorporates two convolution 
kernels prior to the input of the bottleneck block. One of the kernels is 
responsible  for  halving  the  dimension  of  the  feature  map,  while  the 
other  maintains  the  dimension  unchanged.  This  approach  allows  for 
more  comprehensive  processing  of  the  input  features,  enabling  the 
model  to  capture  both  high-level  semantic  information  and  preserve 
relevant details during the feature extraction process. The convolution 
kernel size utilized is 3 × 3, which leads to a broader receptive field of 
information and richer characteristics compared to the 1 × 1 convolu-
tion kernel. The output semantic information can be augmented by the 
action of two convolution kernels. The information output from the first

4.2. Performance evaluation 

The most important measures of a neural network model's efficacy 
are accuracy, recall, F1 score, PR curve, and average mean accuracy. The 
mean average precision (mAp), which is the average AP of all n cate-
gories, measures the effect of accuracy and recall thoroughly. The mAp 
was chosen as the major model evaluation in the study, comprehensively 
analysing the model detection accuracy, recall, and F1 scores, which are 
derived as follows:

To increase attention to crucial channels, channel attention doubles 
the weights of various channels by themselves. As shown in Fig. 3, the 
input features are passed through the parallel MaxPool layer and Avg-
Pool layer to transform the feature map from C × H × W  to C × 1 × 1 
and then through the shared MLP module, in which the original number 
of channels is compressed to1
r  and then expanded to the original number 
of channels, and two activation results are obtained through the ReLu 
activation function. The two activation results are added together, and 
then the model output is obtained by a sigmoid activation function. The 
mathematical expression is as follows: 

Mc(F) = σ(MLP(AvgPool(F) ) + MLP(MaxPool(F) ) )

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of the specific hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning model. However, Table 2 does present the hyperparameters used for data augmentation, specifying the ranges and probabilities for each augmentation technique. These include rotation range, width shift range, height shift range, shear range, zoom range, horizontal flip, vertical flip, and fill mode. For example, the rotation range is set between -10 and 10 degrees with a probability of 0.5, indicating that half of the images will undergo random rotations within this range. Similarly, other parameters like width shift range, height shift range, etc., have their respective values mentioned in the table. Unfortunately, without additional context, it is not possible to provide further information about the learning rate, optimizer, or any other hyperparameters related to the training of the deep learning model.
