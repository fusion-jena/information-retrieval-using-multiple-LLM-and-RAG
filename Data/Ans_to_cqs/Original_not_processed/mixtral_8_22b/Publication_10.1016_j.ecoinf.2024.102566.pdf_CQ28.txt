field-collected data and machine learning methods on developing AGB 
models.  Moreover,  the  quality  of  training  samples  and  the  layout  of 
sampling  points  are  crucial  for  constructing  accurate  and  reliable 
models for biomass estimation (Morais et al., 2021). In this study, owing 
to  the  insufficiency  of  high-quality  training  samples,  we  employed  a 
method with low data dependency that integrates forest inventory data 
with remote sensing imagery for biomass estimation.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no information available in the given context about which specific platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. The context only mentions the use of field-collected data and machine learning methods for developing Above Ground Biomass (AGB) models, along with the integration of forest inventory data with remote sensing imagery for biomass estimation due to insufficient high-quality training samples. Additionally, several references related to forest biomass, carbon dynamics, and vegetation maps are mentioned, but none provide details regarding the deployment platform for the deep learning model.
