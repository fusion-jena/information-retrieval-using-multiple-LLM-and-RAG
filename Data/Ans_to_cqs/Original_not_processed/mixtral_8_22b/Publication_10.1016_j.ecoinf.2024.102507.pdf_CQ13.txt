1.  Spectral segmentation and band selection

With regards to the difference between the results of the original, 
reduced,  and  augmented  datasets  applied  to  the  deep  learning 
model, we found that the original and augmented datasets are only 
under  a  few  specific  numbers  of  bands  and  data  formats  (e.g., 
VGG19 + 8band_256_8bit, VGG19 + 72band_256_8bit, ResNet50 +
8band_256_8bit, and ResNet50 + 36band_ 256_8bit). The classifica-
tion accuracy rate reached more than 50%, and there was no regu-
larity in the classification accuracy. However, the sampling action of 
reducing the data had a very obvious and consistent impact on the 
classification  accuracy,  especially  in  the  VGG19  model,  which  is 
more  similar  to  the  traditional  CNN  model.  This  representative 
sampling  action  resulted  in  incomplete  and  complete  feature 
extraction,  and  some  key  features  were  ignored.  Given  the  above 
reasons, it is recommended that sampling actions be avoided in the

the 

Dropout(Dropout_Rate),  Dense(256,  activation=’relu’),  Dropout 
(Dropout_Rate),  and  finally,  one  Dense(8,  activation=’softmax’) 
layer. 

For VGG19, ResNet50, or a combination of VGG19 and ResNet50, 
we configured the models with Input(shape = (64, 64, band_num)), 
set weights to None, and specified ‘include top’ as False. To create a 
combination model (VGG19 + ResNet50), we used Concatenate() to 
merge the features from VGG19 and ResNet50. The results (Tables 7, 
8,  and  9)  below  demonstrate  the  effects  of  various  parameter

input  at  once,  but  it  will  substantially  increase  the  load  on  the 
memory and GPU during the operation.

after the above training data preparation is as follows (Fig. 6). One of the 
optimal  simulation  results  (72band_256_16bit_split)  was  achieved 
through the utilization of data augmentation and flattened convolution 
kernels, as illustrated in Fig. 7.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning model such as learning rate and optimizer are not explicitly mentioned. However, it is stated that the models were configured with Input(shape = (64, 64, band_num)) and set weights to None. For 'include top', it was specified as False. Also, Dropout layers with Dropout\_Rate were included in the model along with Dense layers with ReLU and softmax activations. It is important to note that these details do not provide information about the learning rate or optimizer used in the model. Therefore, without additional context, I cannot provide the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
