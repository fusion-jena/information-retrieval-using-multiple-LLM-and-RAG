The Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks compiled 
and published the wildlife harvest summaries of Wildlife Management 
Area (WMAs) from the 1980s to the 2000s in three reports (Mississippi 
Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks, 1990; Mississippi Depart-
ment of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks, 1998; Mississippi Department of 
Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks, 2006). The number of harvested rabbits 
per hunter day (a day hunting trip), a capture per unit effort (CPUE) 
index, was calculated as the total number of reported harvests divided 
by  the  total  number of  hunter days  in  a  WMA for each  year.  Eastern

1. Introduction 

Variability of animal abundances across space and time is a central 
theme of ecology (Koenig and Liebhold, 2016; Krebs, 2001; Lundberg 
et al., 2000). Spatiotemporal variations among the populations of the 
same  species  may  result  from  the  differential  responses  of  animal

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it appears that the query about monitoring the model performance during training cannot be directly answered since the provided context does not discuss any specific models or their respective training strategies. However, common methods used to monitor model performance during training include tracking metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC AUC, etc., depending on the type of problem being solved. Additionally, techniques like cross-validation, early stopping, learning curves, and regularization can also help ensure optimal model performance during training.
