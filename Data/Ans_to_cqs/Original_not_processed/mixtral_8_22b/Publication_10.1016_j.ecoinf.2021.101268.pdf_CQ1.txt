2. Peruvian Amazon forestry dataset

Deep Learning (DL) methods are at the top of the state-of-the-art on 
feature representation for different domains; albeit, DL lacks interpret-
ability. According to Doshi-Velez and Kim (2017), interpretability lets 
human specialists understand what a model is learning, making them 
flexible  real-world  solutions.  Given  such  topics,  this  paper  has  three 
significant contributions:  

1.  The  paper  introduces  the  first  Peruvian  Amazon  Forestry  Dataset, 
including  its  detailed  metadata  and  the  acquisition  protocol 
description. The dataset collects 59,441 samples from ten of the most 
profitable  and  endangered species (Finer  et al., 2014; Pinedo-Vas-
quez et al., 1992). Further-more, we employ six different commercial 
cameras  to  ensure  variability  and  to  develop  any  flexible  solution 
with real-world conditions in the future.

6. Discussion 

Traditionally, ResNet-101, and DenseNet-201 have been considered 
inside the top-models for general feature extraction task, especially the 
ones related with ImageNet Kornblith et al. (2019). Nevertheless, our 
quantitative  and  qualitative  evaluations  evidence  that  AlexNet  and 
VGG-19 are superior for The Peruvian Amazon Forestry Dataset since 
both derive high-quality abstractions. 

AlexNet achieves to extract shape, texture, and venation with some 
noise,  while  VGG-19  focus  strongly  in  shape  and  venation.  Conse-
quently,  VGG-19  has  remarkable  results  in  different  leaf  image  pro-
cessing tasks (Lee et al., 2017; Rizk, 2019; Thanh et al., 2018).

model. These methods plot a point cloud, where the density denotes the 
input space relevance. Thus, a higher density in a region suggests that 
the network ponderates it the most when classifying.

Helpful Answer:
The paper introduces the first Peruvian Amazon Forestry Dataset, which includes its detailed metadata and the acquisition protocol description. However, the specific method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. It only states that the dataset collects 59,441 samples from ten of the most profitable and endangered species using six different commercial cameras. Therefore, based on the information provided, one can infer that the method employed for gathering raw data might involve capturing images or videos of these species using various commercial cameras.
