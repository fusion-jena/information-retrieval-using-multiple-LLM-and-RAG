Development of automated classification routines, if accurate, serves to 
improve the efficiency, reduce the subjectivity, and decrease the cost of 
analyzing large datasets.

BANTER  may  serve  as  an  option  for  automated  machine  learning 
classification.

Advances in computing have led to a dramatic increase in the op-
portunities  to  use  machine  learning  for  bioacoustic  classification 
(Bianco et al., 2019; Mutanu et al., 2022; Stowell, 2022). In particular, 
use of deep neural networks show great promise for large datasets on a 
wide variety of taxa, including marine mammals (Frainer et al., 2023; 
Frasier et al., 2017; Li et al., 2020a; Rom´an Ruiz et  al., 2023; Zhong 
et al., 2020). Neural networks typically require significant sample sizes 
for all classes, although there are increasingly new tools to enhance data 
or combined disparate datasets (Dufourq et al., 2022; Nanni et al., 2020; 
Nolasco et al., 2023; Padovese et al., 2023; Shorten and Khoshgoftaar, 
2019).  There  is  a  significant  learning  curve  to  understand  how  to

Helpful Answer:
The paper by Shorten and Khoshgoftaar (2019) provides a comprehensive review of various data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. The authors discuss several methods such as flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, padding, zooming, shearing, and translation. These techniques help improve model performance and prevent overfitting by increasing the amount of training data available. For instance, flipping involves reflecting images horizontally or vertically, while rotation entails rotating images by a certain degree. Scaling adjusts the size of images, either enlarging or shrinking them. Cropping removes parts of an image, whereas padding adds extra pixels around it. Zooming magnifies or reduces the image content without changing its dimensions. Shearing distorts the image along one axis, and translation shifts the image position within the frame. Other advanced techniques include color space transformations, kernel filters, random erasing, mixing images, and generative adversarial networks (GANs). However, the choice of technique depends on the specific application and dataset characteristics.
