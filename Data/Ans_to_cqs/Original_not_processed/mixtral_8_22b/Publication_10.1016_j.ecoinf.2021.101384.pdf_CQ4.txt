workflow  can  compensate  for  some  of  these  biases  –  through  data 
classification  and  spatio-temporal  aggregation  –  mainly  when  large 
input datasets are used. Generally, it is worth noting that all big data 
processing methods are approximate, but they can discover general and 
valuable knowledge if the approximation is tolerated within the appli-
cation context (Coro, 2020b).

multi-resolution  decision  approach  is  usually  effective  in  these  cases 
(Magliozzi  et  al.,  2019).  Another  aspect  of  our  approach  is  that  the 
statistical analysis has a higher precision when vessel data are abundant, 
and the analysis resolution is suited to the study area. Thus, the user 
should provide statistically significant data and use the most appropriate 
spatial resolution for the analysis. These considerations relate to general 
issues  with FAIR  data and  big data processing: easy access  to a  large 
amount of data comes at the expense of a low guarantee of data quality 
and completeness. The precision of our workflow's output depends on (i) 
the  completeness  of  the  input  vessel  data,  (ii)  the  update  rate  of  the 
GRSF, (iii) the completeness of the OBIS data in the selected time range, 
and (iv) the suitability of the selected spatial resolution for the analysis. 
However, our first and second case studies have demonstrated that our

2.4. Open Science methodology and tools 

Our  workflow  implements  a  FAIR  approach  that  tests  FAIR  data 
principles’  practicability.  It  is  open-source  (Supplementary  material) 
and was integrated with the DataMiner Cloud computing platform of the 
D4Science e-Infrastructure (Coro et al., 2017), which allows accessing 
the mentioned knowledge sources on-the-fly during processing (Candela 
et al., 2016; Coro et al., 2015a). Data FAIRness is facilitated through the 
indexing of these resources in the D4Science catalogue (Assante et al., 
2019b), which can be accessed by all processes via the Catalogue Services 
for the Web (CSW) standard of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC, 
2020). Geospatial data are offered as standarised NetCDF files available 
on  a  distributed  ISO/OGC  compliant  Spatial  Data  Infrastructure

As  further  applications,  our  workflow  can  also  be  used  by  other 
systems  to  (i)  extend  current  vessel  activity  classification  processes 
through a more flexible approach that works in data-limited scenarios, 
(ii) identify bycatch species when catchability and fishing gear data are 
available, (iii) study the effects of fisheries on habitats and populations’ 
growth  when  species  distribution  and  life-history-trait  data  are  avail-
able. FAIR data and Open Science-oriented technology guarantee inte-
grating  new  data  sources  rapidly  and  reusing  the  workflow  in  other 
systems. 

2. Materials and methods 

Our  process  is  an  Open  Science  workflow  that  combines  vessel 
tracking data from satellite and AIS systems with global, high-quality, 
environmental,  biodiversity,  and  fishery  data  (Fig.  1).  The  core  pro-
cess is made up of three macro-steps:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: Unfortunately, there isn't any information about specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, or scaling being applied in this deep learning pipeline. This text focuses on using a multi-resolution decision approach and statistical analysis for handling large input datasets and improving data quality. It mentions the importance of providing statistically significant data and selecting the most appropriate spatial resolution for analysis. However, no explicit mention of data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, or scaling is found in the given context.
