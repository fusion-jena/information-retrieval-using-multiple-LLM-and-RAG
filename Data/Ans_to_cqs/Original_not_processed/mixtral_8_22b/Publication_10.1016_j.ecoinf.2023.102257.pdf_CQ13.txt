Maine, USA (January–September 2022) using three tagging methods (one with ML bounding box assistance and 
two  without  assistance).  We  used  a  generalized  linear  mixed  model  to  examine  the  influence  of  ML  model 
performance  and  tagging  method  on  tagging  efficiency.  We  found  that  ML  bounding  boxes  offer  significant 
improvement in tagging efficiency when labelling data compared to unassisted tagging. Additionally, the time 
taken to label with bounding boxes was not statistically different from an unassisted tagging approach. However, 
we  found  that  gains  in  efficiency  are  contingent  on  the  ML  algorithm’s  performance  and  that  incorrect  ML 
predictions, particularly the 4.2% false positive and 3.6% false negative predictions, can slow the tagging process 
compared to a non-hybrid approach. These findings indicate that although practitioners usually forgo the pro-

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The text only mentions that a machine learning (ML) bounding box model was used for accelerating the data labelling process and that its performance was evaluated based on its effects on tagging efficiency. It also discusses the results of the experiment, which showed that ML bounding boxes offered significant improvement in tagging efficiency compared to unassisted tagging, but that gains were contingent on the ML algorithm's performance. However, no details regarding the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are mentioned in the provided context.
