Note: Ground truth means the actual number of tree species in the ﬁeld survey, and prediction denotes the predicted
number of tree species by our solution.

ﬂoss tree and the camphor tree; their user’s and producer’s accuracies were less than 60.00%. The
reason is probably because the number of training samples of silk ﬂoss tree and camphor tree was
small, and the CNN could not learn the features of the two classes well, as a training model is often
proﬁtable for species with a large amount of samples. Although the classiﬁcation accuracies were not
as good as the results obtained from the hyperspectral images [15], the high-resolution RGB images
showed relatively good results compared with the work using multispectral images [2]. In the research
of Dalponte et al. [15], the average classiﬁcation accuracy was about 80.4% when using hyperspectral
images and LiDAR, while in the research of Ferreira et al. [2], the average classiﬁcation accuracy was
about 70% when they used visible/near-infrared bands.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information regarding the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it can be inferred that some common postprocessing techniques might have been employed given the nature of the study. These may include metrics calculation such as overall classification accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Additionally, confusion matrices might also have been generated to evaluate the performance of the models. Furthermore, saliency maps or heatmaps could potentially have been utilized to visualize which parts of the input data contributed most significantly towards the final predictions made by the deep learning models. Nevertheless, without more detailed information, these remain speculative possibilities rather than definitive answers.
