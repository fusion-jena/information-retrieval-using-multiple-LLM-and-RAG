Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

capacity: they have accumulated around three hundred thousand ﬁnely geolocated
plant species observations just in France during last decade. Citizen programs
in biodiversity sciences are currently developing worldwide. We expect them to
reach similar volumes of observations to the sum of national museums, herbaria
and conservatories in the next few years, while still maintaining a large ﬂow of
observations for the future. With good methods for dealing with sampling bias, those
ﬁne precision and large spatial scale data will make a perfect context for reaching
the full potential of deep learning SDM methods. Thus, NN methods could be a
signiﬁcant tool to explore biodiversity data and extract new ecological knowledge
in the future.

10.3.2 Species Selection

For the genericity of our results and to make sure they are not biased by the choice
of a particular category of species, we have chosen to work with a high number of
randomly chosen species. From the 7626 initial species, we selected species with
more than 300 observations. We selected amongst those a random subset of 1000
species to constitute an ensemble E1000. Then, we randomly selected 200 species
amongst E1000 to constitute E200, and ﬁnally randomly selected 50 in E200 which

gave E50. E50 being the main dataset used to compare our model to the baselines, we
provide in Fig. 10.1 the list of species composing it. The full dataset with species
of E1000 contains 6,134,016 observations in total (see Table 10.1 for the detailed
informations per species).

average pooling which seems intuitively more relevant to evaluate an abundance
(=concentration). The different kinds of operations and their succession in our CNN
model are illustrated in Fig. 10.2c.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information on the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that citizen programs in biodiversity sciences have accumulated around three hundred thousand finely geolocated plant species observations just in France during the last decade. This suggests that one possible method for collecting raw data is through citizen science initiatives where volunteers contribute to gathering data. Additionally, the mention of national museums, herbaria, and conservatories implies that these institutions may also serve as sources of raw data. Therefore, based on this context, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline might include citizen science initiatives and data from established scientific institutions such as museums and herbaria.
