The tools and methods available for event-stream processing are not 
the focus of this paper but they are increasingly many. Most have been 
developed  for  e-commerce,  monitoring  of  financial  markets  and  IT 
system monitoring but could as well be applied in biology. AWS kinesis 
(Amazon, 2011) and Apache Kibana (Elastic, 2016) give access to state 
of the art machine learning methods for event-stream processing at a 
click  and  mature  querying  languages,  such  as  elasticsearch  (Elastic, 
2012) make advanced data mining available to a much broader group of 
users.

In summary, we want to take advantage of the rapid development in 
machine  learning  without  having  to  constrain  the  environment  too 
much.  We  want  to  enable  re-use  of  developed  components  in  other 
experimental  setups  to  improve  standardisation  and  convergence  of 
methods. Further, we want to base the solution on mature well-known 
technologies and off-the-shelf hardware to keep it easy to maintain. 

We  therefore  propose  an  architecture,  based  on  modern  IT  infra-
structure,  that  delivers  on  those  requirements.  In  the  following,  we 
describe the architecture and explain why we think the solution should 
build on IT infrastructure.

Use the provided pieces of context to answer the query in less than 400 words. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of which specific platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. The context mentions various platforms like AWS Kinesis and Apache Kibana, but these are related to event-stream processing rather than deployment of deep learning models. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query based on the information given.
