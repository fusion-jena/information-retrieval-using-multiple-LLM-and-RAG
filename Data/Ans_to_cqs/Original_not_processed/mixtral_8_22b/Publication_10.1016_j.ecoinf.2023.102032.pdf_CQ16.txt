required  no further  user input,  pre-  or  post-processing  steps,  and  can 
therefore be seen as more objective, more comparable, and robust across 
time  steps.  Moving  the  input  period  six  months  forward,  backward, 
extending  it  to  three  instead  of  two  years,  and  testing  the  results  for 
correlation  (which  was  high)  all  supported  the  robustness  of  the 
approach.
