The  last  operation  in  GP  is  Mutation,  which  involves  randomly 
selecting a node from the offspring trees and replacing it with a random 
number, variable, or operator. An illustration of the mutation operation 
can be seen in Fig. 2-c, where the division operator replaces the multi-
plication operator at the top node. These three steps are repeated until 
GP achieves a tree with a predetermined level of accuracy or reaches a

specified number of iterations. For this study, the Eureka Pro software is 
utilized for GP modeling. This software was developed by Cornell Uni-
versity’s Data Science Order and was released in 2009 (Eureqa, 2009). It 
is crucial to emphasize that GP serves multiple roles in this paper. Once 
GP is employed as the forecasting model, we extract the inputs utilized 
in  the  optimal  GP  tree  and  utilize  them  as  the  optimal  inputs  for 
modeling  with  ANN.  The  primary  reason  for  selecting  GP  as  our  IVS 
technique is its ability to simultaneously select appropriate features and 
perform modeling tasks (Althoey et al., 2023; Hu, 2023).

across various fields. For instance, Kushwaha et al. (2023) used Relief 
algorithm to select ground water quality parameters. IVS algorithms can 
be  broadly  classified  into  three  main  categories:  Model-Free,  Model- 
Based, and Dimension Reduction methods. Model-Free IVS approaches 
utilize  statistical  techniques,  such  as  calculating  correlations  between 
inputs  and  outputs,  to  conduct  input  selection  (Ma  et  al.,  2022;  May 
et  al.,  2011a;  Mazarei  Behbahani  and  Mazarei,  2023).  Model-Based 
methods,  on  the  other  hand,  determine  the  best  inputs  through  the 
calibration process of the model (Dariane and Behbahani, 2022; Feng 
et al., 2017; May et al., 2011b; Snieder et al., 2019). Although Model- 
Based methods provide the advantage of simultaneously applying IVS 
and  the  model  with  acceptable  accuracy,  they  often  suffer  from 
computational inefficiency, limiting their practical application. Evolu-

consisted of an output layer and two hidden layers, with three neurons 
assigned to the first hidden layer and five neurons to the second hidden 
layer.  The  FORTRAN  platform  was  chosen  for  its  computational

Helpful Answer:

Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no information about any specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding the postprocessing steps related to the mentioned study. However, generally speaking, some common postprocessing steps include evaluating the performance of the trained models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc.; creating confusion matrices to visualize the performance of classification models; generating saliency maps to understand the importance of different features in making predictions; and performing cross-validation to ensure the robustness of the models.
