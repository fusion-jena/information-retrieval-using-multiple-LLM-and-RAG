acquired while learning the 27 endemic bird species should be
used to solve related tasks pertaining to the 29 endemic bird
species. Otherwise, considerable time would be spent every
time a new dataset of birds is used. Therefore, to implement
the entire process, we adopted a deep-learning-based model
(Inception-ResNet-v2) to train and learn the features of 27
endemic bird species (source domain). Then, the learned fea-
tures were transferred to a second target network to train the
newly added dataset on endemic bird species (target domain).
Thus, the problem was deﬁned as follows: for a given source
domain DS and learning task LT and target domain DT
and learning task TL, the transfer learning technique helps
improve the learning of the target predictive function fT (·)
in DT using the knowledge acquired from DS and LT , where
DS (cid:54)= DT or LT (cid:54)= TL [25], [26]. Transfer learning method
enables to utilize knowledge from previously learned tasks

The following procedures are used in the approach devel-

oped in this study.

the holdout validation dataset. The presented work was imple-
mented using the TensorFlow libraries on a GPU workstation
with an Intel Xeon 8 CPU, 32 GB of memory, and an Nvidia
GeForce 11 GB GRX 2080 Ti graphics card.

V. PROOF OF CONCEPT
In this experiment, 760 images, which were excluded from
the training and validation datasets, were used for testing.

%Query
Query: "Where is the data repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the provided context to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. None of the references mentioned any specific data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. It seems like the authors did not provide details about the availability of their dataset in these sources.
