The ensemble prediction was generated using a weighted-averaging 
approach,  assigning  weights  to  individual  models  based  on  their  pre-
dictive  accuracy  on  the  test  data  (Thuiller,  2014).  Evaluation  and 
comparative analyses were conducted for both individual models and 
the ensemble model via two widely recognized metrics: the area under 
the curve (AUC) and the true skill statistic (TSS). AUC values exceeding 
0.9 were considered as excellent, 0.9–0.8 as good, 0.8–0.7 as moderate, 
and < 0.7 as poor (Eskildsen et al., 2013). Similarly, TSS values were 
categorized as excellent (>0.75), good (0.75 to 0.4), and poor (<0.4) 
(Eskildsen et al., 2013). This comprehensive assessment ensures a robust 
understanding of model performance and aids in reliable predictions of 

species distribution across the central Iranian plateau.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: After the model training phase, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the project or study. Here are some common postprocessing steps:

1. Model evaluation: The first step is usually evaluating the trained model's performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curves, etc. These metrics help assess how well the model has learned to predict the target variable. In this case, the Area Under Curve (AUC) and True Skill Statistic (TSS) have been used to evaluate the model's performance.

2. Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix is often created to visualize the performance of the classification model. It shows the number of correct and incorrect predictions made by the model compared to actual outcomes.

3. Saliency Maps: Saliency maps are heatmaps that highlight important features contributing to the model's decision-making process. They provide insights into which input variables significantly impact the output. However, there is no mention of saliency maps in the given context.

4. Ensemble Prediction: An ensemble approach combines multiple models to improve overall performance. In this case, a weighted averaging method was employed to generate an ensemble prediction, where each model was assigned a weight based on its predictive accuracy on the test data.

5. Data Visualization: Postprocessing may also involve creating plots and charts to better understand the results and communicate them effectively.

In summary, the postprocessing steps mentioned in the given context include model evaluation using AUC and TSS, generating an ensemble prediction through a weighted averaging approach, and possibly other unmentioned techniques like confusion matrices and data visualizations.
