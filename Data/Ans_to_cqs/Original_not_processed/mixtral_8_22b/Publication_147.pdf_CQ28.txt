1. Introduction

Machine learning—a method where a computer discovers rules to execute a data processing
task, given training examples—can generally be divided into two categories: Shallow learning and
deep learning methods [1]. Deep learning uses many successive layered representations of data
(i.e., hundreds of convolutions/ﬁlters), while shallow learning typically uses one or two layered
representations of the data [1]. Deep learning has shown great promise for tackling many tasks such as
image recognition, natural language processing, speech recognition, superhuman Go playing, and
autonomous driving [1–3].

region. The insets zoom in on important wetland landscapes in the Boreal region. Top-left: Zama Lake wetland area; bottom-right: Utikuma Lake; top-right: The Peace Athabasca Delta; and bottom-right: the McClelland Lake fen/wetland complex. 4. Discussion 381 This study produced two large-scale wetland inventory products using a fusion of open-access 382 satellite data, and machine learning methods. The two machine learning approaches that were 383 compared—convolutional neural networks and XGBoost—demonstrate a decent ability to predict 384 wetland classes and upland habitat across a large region. Some wetland classes, such as bog and 385 swamp, proved to be much harder to map. This is made clear in the relative F1-scores of the wetland 386 classes (Figure 3). In the comparisons to the photo-interpretation validation data sets (Table 3), it is 387 clear that the CNN model outperforms the XGB model in terms of overall accuracy, Kappa statistic, 388 and per-class F1-score. As expected,

data sets: Two generated from photo interpretation and one ﬁeld validation data set. These results
will guide future large-scale spatial wetland inventory eﬀorts in Canada. If deep learning techniques
are found to generate better products, new wetland inventories projects should adopt deep learning
workﬂows. If shallow learning methods still produce comparable results, they should continue to
be used in wetland inventory workﬂow; however, deep learning architectures should still remain an
active area of research with regard to methods for wetland mapping.

%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer based solely on this information. However, the text mentions the use of Google Earth Engine, which suggests that the authors may have utilized Google Cloud Platform for their analysis. Nevertheless, without further details, this remains speculative.
