Water contamination presents a significant challenge in aquaculture, impacting the sustainability of ecosystems 
and  the  health  of  aquatic  organisms.  Precisely  assessing  water  contamination  levels  is  crucial  for  effective 
monitoring and safeguarding aquatic life within the aquaculture industry. Traditional methods for evaluating 
water contamination are characterized by their costliness, time-consuming nature, and susceptibility to errors. 
Integrating  computer  technologies  such  as  Artificial  Intelligence  (AI),  the  Internet  of  Things  (IoT),  and  Data 
Analytics offers promising potential in addressing this issue. Nevertheless, current deep learning solutions have 
limitations related to data variability, interpretability, and performance. To address these limitations, this study 
proposes  a  comprehensive  framework  that  incorporates  IoT-based  data  collection  and  data  segregation  tech-

Predictions of water quality and methods for managing it have also 
benefited  from  the  work  of  other  scholars.  While  Khullar  and  Singh 
(2022)  developed  a  Bi-LSTM  model  for  projecting  water  quality  pa-
rameters in the Yamuna River in India, Gambín et al. (2021) concen-
trated  on  deep  learning  tactics  for  sustainable  marine  environment 
management. Nouraki et al., 2021 predicted water quality metrics in the 
Karun River, Iran, using machine learning. Rasheed et al. (2022) used 
stastical models to estimate the water quality in ground. Barzegar et al. 
(2020)  used  a  hybrid  CNN-LSTM  model  for  short-term  water  quality 
prediction, and Dehghani et al. (2021) utilized hybrid machine learning 
approaches to predict dissolved oxygen content in flowing streams. Both 
studies were published in the journals (Barzegar et al., 2020; Dehghani 
et al., 2021). Researchers Tousi et al. (2021) employed machine learning
