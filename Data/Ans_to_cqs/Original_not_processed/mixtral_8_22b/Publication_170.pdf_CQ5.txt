memory, we used the incremental training mode to train
and test the DCNN model. On another Dell PowerEdge
C4130 rack server with two Tesla K80 GPUs and 256 GB
of memory, we used the zero‐start and the incremental
training modes to train and test models, respectively.

RESULTS
The incremental training mode performed consistently with
the zero‐start training mode when the training sample size

a i represented serial number of training set Traini, i = 1, 2, …, 7. Here
Train1 was initial training set and Traini (i = 2, 3, …, 7) was in-
cremental training set.

At present, few researchers focus on time costs of model
training and the required computing platform. Yousif et al.
(2019) stated that they optimized their model performance,
but model training still failed to complete on a common PC.
In terms of recognition rate, their rate on a 2.6 GHz CPU
computer was 100 frames/minute, which is lower than our
recognition rate (260 images/minute). One possible reason
is that their preprocessing was more complex.

MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS
Our method can greatly reduce time and personnel costs in
3 ways. First, using our method to automatically ﬁlter empty
images can greatly save labor and time, and the percentage
of the labor and time savings is the same as the proportion

Because the accuracy
(97.3%) of our method is higher than that of human vol-
unteers (96.6%; Norouzzadeh et al. 2018), it can be applied
to actual ecological monitoring projects. Second, the time
and personnel costs of labeling small‐scale training sets are
much lower than that of million‐scale training sets. Note
that to manually label ~5.5 million images, nearly 30,000
persons have spent ~14.6 years with a 40‐hour work week
(Swanson et al. 2015, Norouzzadeh et al. 2018), which
means that manually labeling a training set containing

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, the dataset used in the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model is not explicitly mentioned. However, there is mention of a BMXSM dataset consisting of 36,490 images. It appears this dataset was used for training and testing the DCNN model. Unfortunately, without further information about the BMXSM dataset, I cannot provide specific details regarding its content or how it compares to other well-known datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
