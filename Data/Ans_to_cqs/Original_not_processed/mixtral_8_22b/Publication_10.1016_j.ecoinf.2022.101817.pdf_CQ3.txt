environment condition classification models, the potential influence of 
fish being in the extracted frames was considered negligible. 

The  12,000  frames  (8  frames  *  1500  videos)  extracted  from  the 
training  and  testing  dataset  were  then used  to  generate  five  different 
data sets using repeated random sub-sampling (see Fig. 4 (2)). Each of 
the  sets  was  further  split  into  a  training/testing  split  of  80/20,  con-
taining 9600 frames for training and 2400 for testing. Five CNN models 

using  the  same  model  architecture  were  then  trained  and  tested.  All 
models were trained over 100 epochs and returned an average loss value 
of  0.0126  with  an  average  accuracy  of  99.3%  during  training  and 
testing. Figures  for the  individual models are provided  in the  supple-
mentary material.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer some possible methods based on the nature of the tasks mentioned. For example, in the paper by Xiao et al. (2021), they classify weather phenomena from images using a deep convolutional neural network. This task might involve image-level labeling or multi-label classification, where each image is assigned one or more labels corresponding to the weather phenomena present in it. Similarly, in the work by Salman et al. (2019), real-time fish detection is performed using probabilistic background modeling. This could potentially involve object detection techniques like bounding boxes around detected fishes. Lastly, in the study by Schettini and Corchs (2010), underwater image processing is discussed, which may include various computer vision tasks such as object detection, semantic segmentation, or instance segmentation. Nevertheless, without clear information regarding the data annotation techniques employed in these studies, this remains speculative.
