3.2. Evaluation metrics 

In this study, the effectiveness of the UODN is quantitatively assessed 
using the common objects in context evaluation metrics. Detailed de-
scriptions of the evaluation metrics are shown in Table 1.

The  first  row  is  the  baseline  model,  YOLOv8s.  Compared  to 
YOLOv8s, the CSMB and LKSP modules improved the performance of 
the baseline network. The CSMB module improved the AP50 by 1%, the 
AP75  by 1.6%, and the AP by 0.8%, indicating that the CSMB module 
effectively extracted features of underwater objects. The LKSP module 
also  achieved  outstanding  performance  in  terms  of  AP  values.  It 
perfectly replaced the SPPF module without significantly increasing the 
number  of  parameters,  achieving  a  higher  level  of  accuracy  than  the 
SPPF module. Although both modules increased the number of param-
eters,  UODN  still  had  fewer  parameters  than  YOLOv8m,  and  its  AP 
values  were  better  than  those  of  YOLOv8m.  The  parameters  of 
YOLOv8m increased by 14.7 million, but its AP increased by only 0.6%. 
The AP values of our LKSP module were similar to those of YOLOv8m, 
but the LKSP module increased the number of parameters by only 0.6

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, such as using methods like grid search or random search. Therefore, it cannot be determined from the provided context how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.
