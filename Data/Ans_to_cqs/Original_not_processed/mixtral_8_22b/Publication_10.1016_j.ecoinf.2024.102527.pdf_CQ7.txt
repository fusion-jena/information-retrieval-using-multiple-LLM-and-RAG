respectively.  N  represented  the  number  of  images  in  the  test  set  or 
validation set. 

2.2.6. Model training and hyper-parameters 

We  trained  models  on  the  training  sets  and  tracked  the  model 
training process on the validation set. The training process was stopped 
when  the  loss  value  of  the  model  on  the  validation  set  no  longer 
decreased. We then tested the model performance on the test set. Our 
computing platform was a Dell PowerEdge C4130 rack server with two 
Tesla  K80  GPUs  and  256  GB  of  memory.  For  the  deep  learning  envi-
ronment,  we  utilized  the  PyTorch  1.7.1  platform.  We  employed  the 
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer with a momentum value of 
μ  = 0.9 to train the model. Other hyper-parameter settings for model 
training were shown in Table S.4 of the Supporting Information.

2.2.3. Data splitting 

Based on the conceptual model mentioned above, we split the data to 
construct  the  source  and  target  domain  datasets  to  carry  out  transfer 
learning experiments.  For the  ImageNet  dataset, we directly  used the 
pre-trained model on ImageNet-1 k as the source model, so there was no 
need to split the dataset. Both the SS and the LSM dataset are camera 
trap  image  datasets.  Each  time  the  camera  is  triggered,  it  captures 
multiple images in succession, called a capture event. A capture event 
frequently  comprises  three  images.  Notably,  images  within  the  same 
event are significantly similar to each other. Splitting the images in an 
event into training and test sets may lead to poor generalization of the 
DCNN  model. To  prevent  this, we kept  the integrity  of events  during 
data splitting, putting all images of an event into the same dataset.

When the SS dataset served as target domain datasets, we still uti-
lized the validation and test sets from Table 2, referring to them as S_V 
and S_T, respectively. Regarding the training sets, we randomly selected 
capture  events  from  S_2_100  and  created  five  different  training  sets 
containing 2000, 5000, 8000, 10,000, and 20,000 samples, respectively. 
These  training  sets  were  labeled  as  S_2,  S_5,  S_8,  S_10,  and  S_20  (see 
Table S.3 in the Supporting Information for the details), respectively.

Helpful Answer:
The data was split based on the conceptual model mentioned in the study. When using the ImageNet dataset, the pre-trained model on ImageNet-1k was directly used as the source model, eliminating the need for dataset splitting. However, when dealing with both the SS and LSM datasets, which are camera trap image datasets, special considerations were made due to their unique characteristics. Since multiple images are captured in succession during a single trigger event, these images are often highly similar to each other. To maintain the integrity of events during data splitting and avoid poor generalization of the DCNN model, all images belonging to the same event were placed in the same dataset.

For the SS dataset serving as the target domain datasets, the validation and test sets remained unchanged, referred to as S\_V and S\_T, respectively. As for the training sets, they were created by randomly selecting capture events from S\_2\_100 and generating five different training sets containing 2000, 5000, 8000, 10,000, and 20,000 samples, respectively. These training sets were named S\_2, S\_5, S\_8, S\_10, and S\_20 accordingly. Detailed information about the data splitting can be found in Table S.3 of the Supporting Information.
