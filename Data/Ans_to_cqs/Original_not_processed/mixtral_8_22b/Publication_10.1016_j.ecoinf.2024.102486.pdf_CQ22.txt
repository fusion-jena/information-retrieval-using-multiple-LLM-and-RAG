We exemplify this with a small benchmarking simulation using two machines. The first machine was used to perform the analysis in the main text, 
and is equipped with two RTX 3070 GPUs (5888 ‘CUDA cores’ per GPU). The second was equipped with an Intel i9-9880H CPU (8 cores) and a Quadro 
4000 laptop GPU (2304 ‘CUDA cores’). The execution times of calculations performed using a single core of the latop computer were used as a baseline 
(a speedup factor of 1).

(a measure related to the number of operations the chip can perform 
each second) than GPUs, reducing the time they take to perform an in-
dividual task.

Algorithms are typically either ‘compute-bound’ or ‘memory-bound’. 
In  the  case  of  the  former,  the  majority  of  the  compute  time  is  spent 
performing operations on data. In the latter, more time is spent copying 
data between locations in memory. The amount of time taken to copy 
any data from one memory location to another is known as the memory's 
‘latency’. The amount of data that can be transferred from one location 
in memory to another in a given unit of time is known as the memory's 
‘bandwidth’ (e.g., cache memory typically has a lower latency than off- 
chip  RAM,  although  off-chip  RAM  has  higher  bandwidth).  Memory- 
bound  applications  are  more  difficult  to  parallelise,  as  adding  more 
compute cores does not increase memory bandwidth or reduce its la-
tency,  which  remains  the  bottleneck  of  the  computation.  Compute- 
bound  applications  are  more  easily  parallelised,  as  increasing  the

B.3. Memory transfer 

One of the most common bottlenecks in GPU computing is the transfer of memory from the host to the device and vice versa. The performance of 
data transfer can be summarised by two properties of interest: latency and bandwidth. Latency refers to the length of time it takes to send any in-
formation between two points, and is often measured with a ‘ping’ time: the time it takes to transfer a given quantity of data from the starting point to 
the end point and back again. Bandwidth refers to the total volume of information that can be sent between two points in a given unit of time, typically 
measured on the order of GB/s in modern graphics cards. Generally, GPU memory bandwidth is higher than CPU memory bandwidth, with only high 
latency and low bandwidth memory transfers being available between the two (Fig. B.1).

Helpful Answer:
The query asks for metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model, such as accuracy, precision, recall, etc. However, based on the provided context, there isn't enough information to directly address these specific evaluation metrics. Instead, I will discuss some relevant aspects mentioned in the context regarding computational resources and their impact on algorithm performance.

In the context, we see that two different types of hardware configurations are compared: one with multiple GPUs and another with a combination of CPUs and GPUs. These setups are evaluated based on their execution times when performing certain tasks. The focus here seems to be on comparing the efficiency of various hardware components rather than evaluating the performance of a deep learning model itself.

Two important concepts discussed in the context are 'compute-bound' and'memory-bound' algorithms. A compute-bound algorithm spends most of its processing time executing arithmetic operations, while a memory-bound algorithm primarily focuses on moving data around within the system's memory hierarchy. This distinction plays a significant role in determining how well an application can benefit from parallelization across multiple cores or devices like GPUs.

Additionally, the concept of memory transfer is highlighted as a potential bottleneck in GPU computing. Two key factors affecting memory transfer performance are latency and bandwidth. Latency measures the delay experienced during data transmission, whereas bandwidth indicates the maximum rate at which data can be transferred between two points. High latencies and low bandwidths could negatively affect overall system performance, especially when dealing with large datasets commonly encountered in deep learning applications.

To sum up, while the provided context doesn't explicitly mention evaluation metrics for deep learning models, it emphasizes the importance of understanding hardware capabilities and limitations when optimizing algorithm performance. Factors such as compute-bound vs. memory-bound nature of algorithms, latency, and bandwidth should be considered alongside traditional evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall to achieve optimal results in deep learning projects.
