sun glint, this study reduces the number of 3 × 3 convolutional kernels 
in the convolutional block from 64 to 32, a measure taken to mitigate 
overfitting.  Additionally,  a  residual  structure  is  incorporated  into  the 
ResConv block based on the ResNet network (He et al., 2016). This in-
volves a series of operations: 3 × 3 convolution, batch normalization 
(BN),  rectified  linear  unit  (RELU)  activation  function,  followed  by 
another  3  × 3  convolution,  BN,  and  element-wise  addition  with  the 
output  of  the  initial  3  × 3  convolution.  Subsequently,  the  resulting 
feature map undergoes a secondary RELU activation function to obtain 
the convolutional feature results. Fig. 3(c) shows the Upsample block, 
responsible for restoring the feature map’s size to twice its original di-
mensions, comprising consecutive upsample, 3 × 3 convolution, BN, and 
RELU activation function operations.

network by enhancing the UNet convolutional neural network. The Convolutional Block Attention Module was 
integrated into the encoding-decoding skip connections of the network, we also refined the convolutional blocks 
to better capture the distinctive semantic features associated with water sun glint. To mitigate overfitting, the 
residual structures were incorporated and the number of convolutional kernels within each block was reduced. 
The Res_AUNet network was trained and evaluated using the WSGD dataset, achieving metrics with an Accuracy 
of 98.02%, an F1-score of 83.67%, and an IOU of 74.73%. These results underscore the precision of our proposed 
method for water sun glint detection in UAV water images, offering valuable insights for effectively eliminating 
water sun glint and determining the optimal timing for UAV water image acquisition.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the study used diverse datasets, including the Water Sun Glint Dataset (WSGD), which contains various types of water sun glint images captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Using such a diverse dataset helps prevent overfitting and improves the model's ability to perform well on unseen data. Secondly, the study implemented a residual structure inspired by the ResNet network (He et al., 2016) to improve the flow of information through the layers and reduce the risk of vanishing gradients. Lastly, to further address overfitting, the number of 3x3 convolutional kernels in the convolutional block was reduced from 64 to 32. By taking these measures, the researchers aimed to create a more robust and accurate deep learning model capable of detecting water sun glint in UAV water images.
