%Query
Query: "What are the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet)? "

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it is mentioned that Chalmers et al. (2021) use acoustic monitoring data and deep learning techniques to model animal biodiversity. Additionally, there is reference to birdsong identification software like Bird Song Id Australia and Raven Lite. Therefore, it can be inferred that audio recordings of bird songs might have been used as part of their dataset. Nevertheless, without further information, we cannot definitively state which datasets were utilized in the deep learning pipeline.
