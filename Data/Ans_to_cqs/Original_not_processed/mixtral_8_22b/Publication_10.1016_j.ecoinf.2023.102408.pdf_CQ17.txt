The RF algorithm, which has several advantages, was used in this 
study.  It  has  been  noted  in  prior  research  that  RF  outperforms  other 
machine-learning methods, particularly when handling extensive data-
sets (Lourenço et al., 2021). RF provides accurate information regarding 
critical  factors  and  is  less  sensitive  to  parameter  adjustments  (Cutler 
et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2016). This method uses bagging or boosting 
algorithms to randomly select predictors. Despite these advantages, RF 
has certain limitations. Using a large number of predictors can increase 
model  complexity.  It  also  requires  careful  tuning  and  hyper- 
parameterisation  such  as  “mtry”  and  “ntree”,  there  is  a  risk  of  over-
fitting  if  these  parameters  are  not  adjusted  properly.  This  study  sys-
tematically  evaluated  mtry  from  1  to  10,  aiming  to  strike  a  balance 
between  stability  and  minimise  the  Root  Mean  Square Error  (RMSE).

ANNs are used for modelling complex phenomena and developing 
nonlinear regression (Haykin and Lippmann, 1994). It consists of three 
different  layers:  input,  hidden,  and  output  (Ingram  et  al., 2005).  The 
ANN uses calibration parameters, such as the learning rate and weight, 
to improve the results. The weights were randomly initialized using the 
Nguyen–Widrow method (Zhou et al., 2016). An ANN fitted with CARET 
is a single hidden-layer neural network with two hyperparameters: size 
and decay. The number of units in the hidden layer (size) and regular-
isation parameter to avoid overfitting (decay) were passed as arrays of 
1–20  and  0.025–1,  respectively.  The  Transfer/Activation  function  for 
the  model was  selected  as  the  logistic  function.  The  optimum  combi-
nation of parameters for the best model fit was based on accuracy.

crucial role in mitigating overfitting. Smaller c values lead the optimiser 
to  select  a  larger  margin,  potentially  misinterpreting  numerous  data 
points.  Conversely,  higher  c  values  result in  smaller  margins and  can 
cause overfitting. Thus, we tuned the c value within the range of 0.1 to 
20,  ensuring  a  balanced  trade-off  between  the  margin  size  and  over-
fitting (Table S2).

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, various machine learning algorithms have been discussed along with their respective techniques to prevent overfitting. However, the specific topic of deep learning pipelines and its regularization methods like dropout and L2 regularization are not explicitly mentioned. Nevertheless, some relevant insights can be drawn from the text.

For instance, in the case of Support Vector Machines (SVM), the parameter 'c' is used to control the trade-off between achieving a low error on the training set and having a large margin. By increasing the value of 'c', one can reduce the margin width, thereby making the classifier more prone to overfitting. On the contrary, decreasing the value of 'c' increases the margin width, reducing the chances of overfitting but possibly leading to a higher bias. Therefore, tuning the 'c' value appropriately helps maintain a balance between the margin size and overfitting.

Similarly, while discussing Random Forests (RF), it is stated that careful tuning and hyperparameterization, such as'mtry' and 'ntree,' are required to prevent overfitting. Adjusting these parameters correctly ensures a balance between model stability and minimizing the root mean square error (RMSE).

Lastly, when describing Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), the use of calibration parameters like the learning rate and weight is mentioned to enhance performance. Furthermore, the regularization parameter 'decay' is employed to evade overfitting. In this context, the optimal combination of parameters for the best model fit is determined based on accuracy.

Although the context does not directly address the query about regularization methods in deep learning pipelines, it highlights the importance of appropriate parameter tuning and hyperparameter optimization across different machine learning models to prevent overfitting. These principles could also apply to deep learning architectures where regularization methods like dropout and L2 regularization play crucial roles in preventing overfitting.
