2.2. Data collection

org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2024.102484. 

This study has certain limitations. Since the amount of data publicly 
provided  by  the HWSD  was small, and  the fact  that the  geographical 
detector required a large size of geographic samples (Feng et al., 2021). 
In future research on soil degradation, data from the Basic Soil Property 
Dataset  of  High-resolution  China  Soil  Information  Grids  (Feng  and 
Ganlin, 2021) and HWSD should be processed jointly to improve tem-
poral and spatial accuracy. Moreover, vegetation degradation (Wu et al., 
2022) and soil degradation research should be combined to establish a 
long-term land resource evaluation system for different land-use types in 
HN.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not explicitly mention any specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it mentions several sources of data related to soil degradation studies. These include the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD), the Basic Soil Property Dataset of High-resolution China Soil Information Grids, and various natural and anthropogenic factors like elevation, slope, mean annual temperature, precipitation, population density, GDP density, and points of interest in residential areas and roads. The study also uses ArcGIS 10.8 for direct acquisition and reclassification of some data. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine the exact datasets used in a deep learning pipeline.
