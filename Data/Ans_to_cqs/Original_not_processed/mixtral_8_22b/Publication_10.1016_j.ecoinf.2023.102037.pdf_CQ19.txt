The training procedure of the detection model ran for 150 epochs. 
The model was fed with batches of 16 tiles at a time which was moti-
vated by the available GPU memory and training efficiency. Stochastic 
Gradient Descent (SGD) was used as the model’s optimizer with a mo-
mentum of 0.9. The default data augmentation techniques of YOLOv5 
were applied during training to improve the model robustness. Predicted

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given information, it is not explicitly stated which specific deep learning framework was used to build the model. However, there are some clues that suggest possible frameworks. For instance, the mention of using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as the model's optimizer and applying default data augmentation techniques of YOLOv5 indicate that the model might have been built using a popular object detection framework such as Darknet or PyTorch, both of which support YOLOv5. Additionally, the use of an NVIDIA GPU suggests that the model could be utilizing CUDA for accelerating computations, which is supported by many deep learning frameworks including TensorFlow and PyTorch. Therefore, without further explicit information, we cannot definitively determine which framework was used but can infer that it may be one of these popular deep learning frameworks.
