In  the  development  stage,  the  preprocessed  data  was  divided  into 
training (80%), validation (10%), and test sets (10%) for model training 
and testing purposes (Shah et al., 2018), followed by the construction of 
predictive  models  using  both  deep  learning  algorithms  (e.g.,  Deep 
Neural  Networks)  and  traditional  machine  learning  approaches  (e.g., 
AdaBoost  Regressor,  Support  Vector  Regressor,  etc.),  with  hyper-
parameter tuning performed via GridSearchCV with cross-validation (cv 
= 10).  While some studies  might  use different proportions, such as  a 
70–30 split between training and testing/validation (Khan et al., 2022), 
the  80–10-10  split  employed  in  this  study  ensured  a  more  extensive 
training set, potentially leading to a better-generalized model. The test 
set,  which  the  model  has  not  previously  seen  during  the  training  or 
validation phases indicates the model’s performance in real-world sce-
narios (Shah et al., 2018).

This research underscores the significant impact of machine learning 
(ML) and deep learning (DL) models on the oil palm sector, offering a 
path to precise yield predictions and sustainable crop management. It 
highlights the utility of these models in enhancing agricultural practices 
by considering soil composition, climate variations, and farming tech-
niques, thus aligning production with market demands and optimizing 
the supply chain. Agronomists are encouraged to adopt a comprehensive 
approach leveraging ML and DL for research and development. At the 
same  time,  farmers  can  benefit  from  data-driven  insights,  mainly 
through  the  Extra  Trees  Regressor  model,  to  improve  planning  and 
resource  management.  Additionally,  the  findings  serve  as  a  basis  for 
stakeholders,  including  policymakers  and  the  agribusiness  sector,  to 
support ML integration in agriculture, fostering operational efficiency,

The rising global demand for oil palm emphasizes the importance of accurate oil palm yield predictions. This 
predictive  capability  is  critical  for  effective  crop  management,  supply  chain  optimization,  and  sustainable 
farming practices. However, the oil palm sector faces challenges in yield projection, stressing a noteworthy gap in 
the application and evaluation of modern machine learning and deep learning technologies. Our study addressed 
this  gap  by  systematically  evaluating  17  machine  and  deep  learning  models  in  predicting  oil  palm  yield, 
incorporating various agronomic parameters, e.g., soil composition, climatic conditions, plant age, and farming 
techniques. This holistic approach enhances the application of machine and deep learning in agriculture. Using 
the  feature  selection  technique  and  a  maximum  depth  of  32  and  1000  estimators,  the  Extra  Trees  Regressor

Helpful Answer:

The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is not explicitly stated as either classification, segmentation, or detection. However, it is used for predicting oil palm yields based on various agronomic parameters such as soil composition, climatic conditions, plant age, and farming techniques. The deep learning algorithm mentioned is Deep Neural Networks, which could be utilized for regression tasks like yield prediction. Therefore, the primary objective of employing deep learning here is to create a predictive model capable of accurately forecasting oil palm yields, contributing to efficient crop management, supply chain optimization, and sustainable farming practices.
