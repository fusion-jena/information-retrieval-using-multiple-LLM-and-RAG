through the application of this decreasing threshold.

The  PLUS  model  consists  of  two  main  modules:  the  transformed 
specification mining framework based on the land expansion analysis 
strategy (LEAS) module and the cellular automata (CA) model based on 
a multi-type random patch seed mechanism (CARS). In the LEAS mod-
ule, the PLUS model employs the random forest algorithm to obtain the 
development probabilities of each land use type based on two periods of 
land use data. This approach is considered superior to the FLUS model, 
which  uses  an  artificial  neural  network  (ANN)  to  determine  develop-
ment  probabilities  based  on  only  one  period  of  land  use  data.  Addi-
tionally,  the  PLUS  model  proposes  a  decreasing  threshold  rule  for 
generating  patch  seeds.  This  gradual  constraint  on  patch  growth  of 
various land use types is achieved through the iterative process. Cells 
with a higher total probability are more likely to change preferentially

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any direct information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, I can provide some general insights into these techniques.

Dropout is a regularization technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to avoid overfitting by preventing complex co-adaptations on training data. On the other hand, L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, encouraging smaller weights and thus simpler models, also helping to reduce overfitting. Other common regularization methods include early stopping, weight decay, and data augmentation.

In summary, while the specific regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context aren't explicitly stated, commonly used methods to prevent overfitting include dropout, L2 regularization, early stopping, weight decay, and data augmentation.
