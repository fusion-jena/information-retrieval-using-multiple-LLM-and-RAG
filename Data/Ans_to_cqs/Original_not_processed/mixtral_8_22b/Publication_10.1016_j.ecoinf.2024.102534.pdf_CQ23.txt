data  was  used  to  validate  model  predictions.  The  Area  Under  Curve 
(AUC)  evaluation  metric  and  True  Skill  Statistics  (TSS)  were  used  to 
assess  the  performance  of  model  predictions.  The  predictive  map  of 
current  and  future  areas  were  classified  into  unsuitable  (0–0.6)  and 
suitable  (0.6–1).  The  threshold  value  of  0.6  was  derived  from  equal 
training sensitivity and specificity. The suitable areas from the current 
prediction was compared to future predictions to estimate change over 
time. The predictive maps of four groups of orchids (lowland epiphyte, 
lowland  terrestrial,  upland  epiphyte,  upland  terrestrial)  during  three 
time periods (current, future (2100) using SSP 1–2.6, and future (2100) 
using SSP 5–8.5) were compared in order to identify the potential impact 
of  climate  change  and  land  cover  change  on  suitable  areas  for  each 
group. Predicted suitable areas and elevation ranges were used as spatial

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that some form of validation has been performed based on the mention of "Validation" under several authors' contributions. Additionally, the use of "Area Under Curve (AUC)" and "True Skill Statistics (TSS)" suggests that the model's performance was evaluated using these metrics. It is also mentioned that the data was used to validate model predictions. Nevertheless, there are no direct references to specific techniques such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Therefore, without further context, it cannot be definitively stated what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
