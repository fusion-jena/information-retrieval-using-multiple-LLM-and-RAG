Z-statistics

MAE  shed  light  on  prediction  accuracy,  R2  measures  goodness  of  fit, 
while NSE and MEF assess performance relative to benchmarks. Z sta-
tistics determine statistical significance, and Taylor diagrams provide a 
holistic visualization of multiple metrics. These metrics were thought-
fully  chosen  to  offer  a  comprehensive  evaluation  of  the  algorithms, 
enabling a multifaceted assessment of their performance. Furthermore, 
these  performance  metrics  offer  distinct  perspectives,  allowing  a 
tailored evaluation based on specific modelling objectives and dataset 
characteristics (Bui et al., 2020; Ding et al., 2023; Georgescu et al., 2023; 
Uddin  et  al.,  2022a,  2022b,  2023a,  2023b,  2023c,  2023d,  2023e, 
2023f).  Notably,  recent  water  research  studies  have  successfully 
employed these metrics for evaluating prediction performance in order 
to accurate WQ prediction (Asadollah et al., 2021; Das et al., 2022; Ding

Fig. 9 presents the RMSE and MAE for the eight ML algorithms. The 
majority of performance indicators were found to be higher during the 
training period; however, during the testing period, model performance 
was shown to have greatly improved, which may be due to the under-
fitting problem (Table S4 - supplementary data) (Wang et al., 2022). In 

addition,  the  lowest  prediction  errors  during  the  training  and  testing 
periods belong to GPR, LR, NN, and SVM (Fig. 9).

Helpful Answer:
The study uses several statistical measures to rank and evaluate the performance of machine learning (ML) models. These include prediction performance metrics such as R^2, Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), Mean Error Function (MEF), and Z-statistics. Additionally, they use Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSE) and Standard Deviation (SD) to measure error rates. They also consider model sensitivity by examining R^2 values across different models. To holistically view multiple metrics, they employ Taylor diagrams. Each metric offers a unique perspective, enabling a tailored evaluation based on specific modeling objectives and dataset characteristics. For instance, MAE sheds light on prediction accuracy, while R^2 measures goodness of fit. NSE and MEF assess performance relative to benchmarks, and Z-statistics determine statistical significance.
