linski and Truex (1995) to develop a discriminant model to distinguish 
sex in marten and fisher which correctly classified 98% of training and 
95% of test data using a model consisting of three measurement vari-
ables including interdigital pad height and width and total track length. 
While both of these methods provide robust outcomes with high levels of 
classification success, they involve a detailed and time-consuming hand 
measurement process for tracks that has prohibited widespread use.

The simple fisher sex identification model has a classification accu-
racy of 94.0% for the training data, and 89.4% for the test data. With this 
model, all of the inaccuracy in classification was in mis-classifying males 
as females (test set classification accuracy 75%). However, the majority 
of the misclassified male tracks (7 out of 9) were from a single individual

(3) 

Values above this line (>129.29) would classify the track as male and 
below the line as female. We found this simple sex discrimination model 
produced comparable classification accuracy to the more complex full 
model with some slight increase in misclassification for the training and 
validation  sets  (a  difference  of  1â€“2  individual  tracks),  but  a  modest 
improvement in the test set. (Table 3).

Helpful Answer: The context does not explicitly state the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, based on common machine learning practices, one possible criterion could be monitoring the performance metrics such as validation loss or accuracy during the training phase. When the validation loss plateaus or stops improving significantly, it might indicate that the model has learned most of what it can learn from the training data, suggesting that training should be stopped to prevent overfitting. In this case, the table shows different sample sizes for training, validation, and test groups, indicating that there may have been a separate validation dataset used to monitor the model's performance during training. Without further information, we cannot definitively confirm if this specific approach was employed in this study.
