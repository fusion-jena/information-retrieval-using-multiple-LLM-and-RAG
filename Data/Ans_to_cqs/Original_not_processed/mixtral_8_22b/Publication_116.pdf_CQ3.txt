B. Computer Vision Approaches/Pipelines

We use two pipelines to classify leaf-scan images into
species. In one, we use a traditional hand-crafted feature
extraction approach, speciﬁcally, LBPU to extract
texture
features from the images, as done in [14] and [27]. We also
use a deep learning approach as a second pipeline. Both are
discussed in the following subsections.

%Query
Query: "What are the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., bounding box annotation, instance segmentation)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data annotation techniques used in computer vision tasks include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. These techniques help provide labeled datasets necessary for supervised machine learning algorithms such as those employed in deep learning models. Without explicit information about the dataset or methodology used in this study, it is impossible to determine which specific technique was utilized.
