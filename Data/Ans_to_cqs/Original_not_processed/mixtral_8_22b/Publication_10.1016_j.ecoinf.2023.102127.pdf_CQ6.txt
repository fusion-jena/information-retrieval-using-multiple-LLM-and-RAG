2.4. Model evaluation

are not enough data available to reliably fit every type of model, espe-
cially  given  the  demanding  nature  of  some  machine  learning  ap-
proaches,  and  computation  time  can  be  a  considerable  limitation  as 
well, such as for more demanding Bayesian models. The package will 
raise warnings and highlighted messages in case the provided informa-
tion is not sufficient for inferring a species distribution.

curate,  less  biased  representations  of  a  species  niche  while  also 
accounting for some of the biases that plague biodiversity datasets.

Isaac et al. (2020). This is since (a) the consideration of all available data 
is  one of the  main points of  model-based integration, (b)  appropriate 
validation metrics are less straight-forward than for single datasets as 
biases and sampling methods can differ, and (c) any validation dataset 
might not represent the niche and environmental parameters estimated 
by  the  integrated  model.  For  example,  the  standard  practice  of  with-
holding parts of the training data for validating a model often means that 
both  training  and  testing  data  suffer  from  the  same  spatial  and  envi-
ronmental biases (Baker et al., 2022). If, however prior knowledge of the 
biology of a species is integrated in a SDM through a prior or offset, thus 
“nudging”  or constraining response functions towards a more sensible 
outcome  and  ultimately  different  prediction,  the  use  of  any  (biased) 
withheld data would likely indicate a reduced predictive performance

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not directly address the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does discuss some general considerations when working with limited data and biased datasets, which could indirectly relate to preprocessing steps.

In general, preprocessing steps for deep learning models may include:
1. Data Cleaning: Removing irrelevant, redundant, or incorrect data. This might involve handling missing values, removing outliers, or correcting inconsistent entries.
2. Normalization/Standardization: Scaling numeric features to have zero mean and unit variance or between a certain range (like 0-1), ensuring that each feature contributes proportionately to the final output.
3. Feature Engineering: Creating new features from existing ones to better capture patterns in the data. This might involve encoding categorical variables, extracting features from text or images, or creating interaction terms.
4. Splitting Datasets: Dividing the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. This helps evaluate the model's performance on unseen data and prevent overfitting.
5. Handling Class Imbalance: Addressing imbalanced classes by techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or using class weights during training.
