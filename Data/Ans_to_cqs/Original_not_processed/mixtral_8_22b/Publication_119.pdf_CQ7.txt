layer 5 and a batch normalization layer after hidden layer 2 increased the testing accuracy
of the model. These additional layers—dropout and batch normalization—reduce the
over-ﬁtting of the model on the training data and increase generalization on testing data.
The hyperparameters in this network—the learning rate, number of epochs, and batch
size—were further tuned such that the testing accuracy and the kappa were the best among
all models. The optimized hyperparameter values for learning rate and batch size were
0.007 and 48, respectively.

The quantity of training data derived from ground data collection in 2018 was limited.
A U-Net implemented with Keras produced a low training and testing accuracy with
segmentation results on testing data differing between repetitions. Implementing a U-Net
model within the arcgis.learn module of the ArcGIS API for Python [39] removed the
requirement for a quantitatively massive dataset. Additionally, the U-Net implemented
through argis.learn is pretrained on ImageNet to further improve classiﬁcation accuracies.
This reduces the time and resources spent on ground truth data collection. Hyperparameter
tuning was done to select the best U-Net model [31,34,40]. Based on hyperparameter
optimization, it was found that the best model uses an input patch size of 64 × 64 pixels
and a ResNet-50 backbone [31,34,40].

the decision trees within the random forest. The samples that are out of the bag, the so-called out-of-bag samples (OOB), are used for validation of the RF model. The final prediction of the RF is based on the majority vote from all trees. The RF model was created using the sklearn module (scikit-learn 0.24). The number of trees and the maximum number of features to be considered for the best split were tuned via GridSearchCV (scikit-learn 0.24) and were found to be as follows: best number of trees = 130; maximum features required for split = auto.   Remote Sens. 2021, 13, 3495

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, some common practices can be inferred. Typically, the dataset is divided into three subsets: training set, validation set, and testing set. The training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set is used during the training process to fine-tune the model parameters and prevent overfitting. Lastly, the testing set is used to evaluate the performance of the trained model on unseen data. In this case, the context mentions that the same independent testing data was used for evaluating different models, which suggests that the dataset might have been split into training and testing sets beforehand. Furthermore, the context also discusses hyperparameter optimization, which often involves using a separate validation set to tune the model's parameters without affecting the actual training or testing processes.
