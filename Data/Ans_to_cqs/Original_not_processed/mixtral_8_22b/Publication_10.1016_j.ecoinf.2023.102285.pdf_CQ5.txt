There  are  numerous  studies  in  the  literature  to  detect  underwater 
man-made  objects  (MMOs)  within  a  limited  region  of  interest  (RoI) 
using  underwater  imagery,  robots  or  sonography.  For  instance,  Abu 
et  al.  (Abu  and  Diamant,  2022)  proposes  a  contour-based  features 
analysis method to discern underwater MMOs from natural environment 
considering that contours of MMOs' are supposed to be smoother than 
natural objects. There are a limited number of studies in the literature to 
detect specific types of surface marine MMOs using supervised Machine 
Learning  (ML)  and  Deep  Learning  (DL)  approaches  that  require  prior 
training in the marine ecosystem. For instance, Han et al. (Han et al., 
2022) proposed a DL technique titled LCSE-ResNet to detect, classify and 
locate  vessels  and  oil  platforms  based  on  remote  optical  imagery,  by 
which all other MMOs are excluded. There are no studies in the litera-

varies from 7 s to 16 s, depending on the image size and the number of 
objects in the image and their sizes, which is a very fast processing time 
for  high-pixels-per-image  (HPP)  images  up  to  50  MB  based  on  the 
camera system that is explained in Section 3. The overall computational 
complexity of the developed algorithms is O(n log n). It is important to 
point out that the supervised DL and ML approaches, designed by us in 
our previous work in (Kuru et al., 2023), that runs on similar images in 
the same surveys, can detect specific marine small natural objects (e.g., 
birds) in a few seconds (i.e., between 2 and 4 s). In this sense, we can 
conclude that DL and ML techniques slightly outperform the proposed 
non-supervised technique developed in this study considering the pro-
cessing time.

Helpful Answer:
The given references do not provide explicit information about the use of specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet in the deep learning pipelines mentioned in those papers. However, some general insights regarding dataset usage can still be derived from these sources.

In the paper by Abu and Diamant (2022), they propose a feature analysis method to distinguish underwater man-made objects (MMOs) from natural environments using contour-based features. Although it does not explicitly mention any standard datasets like MNIST or CIFAR, it implies that the authors have utilized custom datasets containing underwater imagery and sonographic data.

Similarly, Han et al. (2022) present a deep learning model called LCSE-ResNet for detecting, classifying, and locating marine targets such as vessels and oil platforms using remote optical imagery. This suggests that the researchers employed a custom dataset consisting of satellite or drone-acquired images of marine environments.

Lastly, Kuru et al.'s works (2014, 2018, 2019) discuss various aspects of machine learning and computer vision applications but do not directly address the topic of specific datasets used in deep learning pipelines.

To summarize, while none of the referenced papers specifically state the use of popular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, they imply the utilization of custom datasets tailored to their respective research objectives.
