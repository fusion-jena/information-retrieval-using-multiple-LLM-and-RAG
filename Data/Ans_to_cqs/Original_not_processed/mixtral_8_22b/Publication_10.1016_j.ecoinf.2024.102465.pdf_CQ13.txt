The experiment utilized the pre-trained “ERNIE” model (https://gith 
ub.com/PaddlePaddle/LARK/tree/develop/ERNIE). 
a 
comparative  analysis  of  the  accuracy  of  Rostcm  6.0,  Simple  Bayesian 
Networks,  Long  Short-Term  Memory  networks  (LSTM),  and  Convolu-
tional  Neural  Networks  (CNN)  in  pre-tests,  the  decision  was  made  to 
employ the combined LSTM-CNN-based sentiment analysis framework 
for  determining  the  sentiment  index.  The  LSTM-CNN  model  out-
performed the other models in sentiment task analysis (Sosa, 2017). This 
model leverages the long-term memory capability of LSTM and the local 
feature  extraction  capability  of  CNN  to  process  text  data,  harnessing 
their unique strengths for enhanced model performance.

The study employs the HRNet model due to its high accuracy and 
stability. HRNet effectively performs semantic segmentation by simul-
taneously  merging  high-resolution  and  low-resolution  convolution 
computations (Sun et al., 2019). By using HRNet to model social media 
image data in PyCharm software for semantic segmentation processing, 
in combination with graphics processing software for proofreading, the 
greenness, blueness, and sky openness index can be derived using the 
formulas described by Wu et al. (2023). G indicates the level of greenery 
in  the  panoramic  image;  PGreenness  is  the  total  number  and  amount  of 
pixels  corresponding  to  vegetative  and  green  spaces  identified  in  the 
semantic segmentation process; PTotal  represents the overall number of 
pixels specified in the image; O represents the level of openness in the 
panoramic image; PSky denotes the percentage of identified sky elements

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the type of optimizer employed. It only mentions that the experiment utilized the pre-trained ERNIE model and later decided to employ the combined LSTM-CNN-based sentiment analysis framework for determining the sentiment index. However, it does not delve into the details regarding the configuration of these models or their respective hyperparameters. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to this query based solely on the given context.
