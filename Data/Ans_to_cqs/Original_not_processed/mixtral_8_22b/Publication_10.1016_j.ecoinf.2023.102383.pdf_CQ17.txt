compressed,  reducing  to  only  a  few  pixels  in  deeper  CNN  layers.  For 
instance, an object with dimensions of 15 × 15 pixels in a UAV thermal 
image might be represented by just 1 pixel in the feature map from Layer 
4 of ResNet152 (refer to Fig. 4). The limited spatial resolution can lead to 
loss of fine details, making it difficult for the model to distinguish small 
objects from the background. Through FPN, different feature maps from 
different layers can complement each other, and deeper feature map can 
receive some spatial information from shallower layers. However, still 
certain  spatial  features  might  have  been  lost  during  the  process  of 
convolution operations. Consequently, the models of FRC_ResNet18FPN 
and FRC_ResNet34FPN can obtain higher AP for medium and large ob-
jects than the remaining models because they have less CNN layers than 
others.  Notably,  the  FRC_ResNet152FPN  obtains  the  best  detection

Deeper layers derive additional features from the output of shallower 
layers  through  progressive  downscaling.  Consequently,  feature  maps 
from shallower layers contain more spatial feature information due to 
higher resolution, while those from deeper layers have more bands and 
may  provide  more  abstract  semantic  feature  information.  However, 
when dealing with small objects containing only a limited number of 
pixels, the vital spatial information about these objects can potentially 
be lost in the deeper layers as part of the downsizing process, which may 
not  only  fail  to  contribute  to  detection  process  but  can  also  diminish 
detection precision. Additionally, to ensure that the predicted RoIs align

The family of residual neural networks includes ResNet18, ResNet34, 
ResNet50, ResNet101, and ResNet152 according to their number of CNN 
layers.  “Stage”  is  an  important term  in  the  context of  residual neural 
networks, which refers to a specific set of convolution layers that output 
feature maps with different resolutions. Take ResNet152 as an example 
in (Fig. 4), it consists of five stages (Conv1, Layer1, Layer2, Layer3, and 
Layer4) and each stage can produce a feature map. The spatial resolution 
of each feature map is progressively reduced by a factor of 2, while the 
number of bands is simutanously increased by a factor of 2. Usually, the 
traditional FPN neglects the feature maps from Conv1, Layer1 and Layer 
2 and only incorporates the two feature maps from Layer 3 and Layer 4. 
For  the  detection  of  large  objects  from  high-resolution  true-color  im-
ages, this may work well. However, for the small objects in UAV thermal

object classification. To overcome this issue, Feature Pyramid Network 
(FPN) was used to fuse feature information extracted from different CNN 
layers. Compared with VGG16, Residual networks exhibit superior ca-
pabilities in feature extraction and hierarchical feature representation. 
Residual  networks  can  effectively  generate  feature  maps  at  various 
scales,  contributing  to  a  more  nuanced  and  comprehensive  under-
standing  of  the  feature  information  of  small  objects.  Therefore,  the 
integration of FPN and residual neural networks is used in this paper. 
Specifically, residual neural networks are used to generate feature maps 
in  different  scales.  Then  FPN  is  used  to  combine  low-resolution, 
semantically  strong  features  with  high-resolution,  semantically  weak 
features  via  a  top-down  pathway  and  lateral  connections  across  the 
feature maps.

Helpful Answer:

In the given context, there isn't any explicit mention or discussion on regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. Instead, the text focuses on the use of residual neural networks like ResNet152, ResNet18, and others, along with Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) for object detection tasks using UAV thermal images.

However, I can explain how regularization techniques help prevent overfitting in general terms. Regularization methods aim to reduce the complexity of the learned model, thus preventing overfitting. Dropout is one popular method where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps avoid relying too much on individual neurons and encourages better overall network performance. Another common technique is L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, which adds a penalty term to the loss function based on the magnitude of weights, discouraging large weights and promoting simpler models. Other regularization methods include early stopping, data augmentation, and batch normalization.
