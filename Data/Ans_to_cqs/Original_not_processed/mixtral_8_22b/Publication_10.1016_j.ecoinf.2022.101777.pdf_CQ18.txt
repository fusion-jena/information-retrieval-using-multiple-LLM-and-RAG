racy assessment requires these parameters to calculate the total number of 
training samples required for the image classified using Eq. 1.

The next step was accuracy assessment, which is necessary to assess 
the  reliability  of  the  results.  The  Error  of  Commission  (EC),  Error  of 
Omission  (EO), Producer  Accuracy (PA)  and User  Accuracy  (UA) were 
computed based on an error matrix resulting from accuracy assessment. 
EO is linked to the classified results and is supplemented by PA. They refer 
to  items  that  are  left  out  of  their  correct  class  in  the  classification.  EC 
represents classified values that were predicted to be in a particular class 
but do not belong to that class. It is supplemented by UA. In this study an 
advance accuracy assessment using the SCP (Semi-Automatic Classifica-
tion Plug-in) functions for the RF classifier was performed. Using the land 
cover classification map generated, the next analytical step was to run a 
post-processing  tool  to  obtain  the  reports  from  each  classifier,  which 
provide the pixel sum and area coverage of each land cover class. Accu-

Acquiring large-scale training data to train the RF classifier in the 
classification  of  complex  regions  with  a  great  many  categories  is  a 
laborious  task  that  requires  hours  of  processing.  Thus,  in  the  present 
study we assumed that training samples should represent approximately 
0.25% of the total study area used by the RF classifier for large-scale 
classification  (Colditz,  2015;  Deng  and  Wu,  2013;  Du  et  al.,  2015). 
Once these errors in classification have been identified, it is useful to 
carry out work with more training areas that include this category of 
“new  vineyard”,  since  its  spectral signature  after 5 years of  growth is 
totally different from what it looks like in the year of planting. Consid-
ering the study area and the strong influence of the wine sector in it, this 
is an issue that can be improved in future studies.

Helpful Answer:
In order to monitor the model performance during training, the authors employed several strategies. Firstly, they conducted an accuracy assessment, which is crucial to evaluate the reliability of the results. This involved computing various metrics such as Error of Commission (EC), Error of Omission (EO), Producer Accuracy (PA), and User Accuracy (UA) based on an error matrix derived from the accuracy assessment. EO is associated with the classified outcomes and complements PA, referring to elements omitted from their accurate classes in the classification. On the other hand, EC represents classified values anticipated to belong to a specific class but actually do not. It is supplemented by UA.

Furthermore, the authors executed an advanced accuracy assessment utilizing the Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin (SCP) functions for the Random Forest (RF) classifier. After generating a land cover classification map, they ran a post-processing tool to acquire reports from each classifier. These reports provide the pixel sum and area coverage of every land cover class.

Moreover, considering the complexity of acquiring extensive training data for the RF classifier in intricate regions with numerous categories, the authors proposed that training samples should constitute around 0.25% of the entire study region utilized by the RF classifier for large-scale classification. Once misclassifications were recognized, additional work was carried out with increased training areas incorporating the "new vineyard" category, given its distinct spectral signature after five years of growth compared to its appearance upon planting.

However, the text does not explicitly mention any real-time monitoring techniques or validation methods applied during the training process itself, such as cross-validation or early stopping. Therefore, while the authors did implement strategies to ensure the quality of the final model, the precise methodology for tracking the model's performance throughout the training phase remains unclear.
