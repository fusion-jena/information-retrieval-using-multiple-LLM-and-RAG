Data-driven models are an alternative type of models, among which 
machine learning and deep learning (ML and DL) models stand out in 
recent years. According to Lee et al. (2023) data-driven models applied 
to freshwater ecosystems have been mainly focused on phytoplankton, 
while there is a lack of research in modelling future changes, such as 
climate change and subsequent changes in habitat conditions. A good 
example of a data-driven model focused on algal blooms prediction is 
that  presented  by  Miura  et  al.  (2023).  Nonetheless,  there  are  several 
examples in the scientific literature about ML or DL models designed to 
predict the temperature profile in water masses. Liu and Chen (2012) 
developed ML models based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) using 
as inputs meteorological conditions to predict the temperature in the 3

2.3. Data analysis framework 

Data  analysis  was  performed  using  open  source  libraries  and 
frameworks for the Python 3 programming language. The main libraries 
that  were  used  and  their  versions  are:  NumPy  1.23.5,  SciPy  1.9.1, 
Pandas  1.4.4,  Scikit-Learn  1.02,  Keras  2.12.0  and  Shap  0.42.1.  The 
specific  functions  used  are  indicated  in  the  text  where  relevant.  This 
Python-based environment was chosen due to its growing usage trend 
for data analytics, being also suitable as a general-purpose programming 
language (Nguyen et al., 2019). 

2.4. Data pre-processing 

The first step consisted of a preliminary screening of the data in order 
to  check  the  general  quality,  which  was  appropriate  enough  for  this 
work  as  the  data  are  supervised  by  the  CHE  before  their  publication 
though the SAICA and the SAIH. It is worth mentioning that the data 
from April 2020 were not available, presumably due to the lockdown
