Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

of fire risk maps that exhibit enhanced efficacy in fire-sensitive forest 
ecosystems  can  be  achieved  by  utilizing  diverse  remote  sensing  data 
characterized by high spatial resolution, particularly Unmanned Aerial 
Vehicle (UAV) images incorporating multispectral bands. Additionally, 
employing  various  modeling  techniques  such  as  artificial  neural  net-
works, deep learning, and logistic regression can further contribute to 
refining these maps.

Agricultural activities are intense, and agricultural areas are inter-
twined with forest areas in Mu˘gla province. Because the site is one of the 
most popular tourist regions of Türkiye, the population is dense, and the 
transportation network is extensive. The most prevalent tree species in 
the Mu˘gla RDF is the Pinus brutia Ten., one of the most vulnerable spe-
cies  to  fire.  There  is  also  a  dense  understory  and  much  litter  in  the
