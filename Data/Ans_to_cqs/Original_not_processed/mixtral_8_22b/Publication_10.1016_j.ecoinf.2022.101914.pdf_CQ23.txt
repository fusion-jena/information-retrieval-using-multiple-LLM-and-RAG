points. Then, to obtain presences and background points to use during 
external evaluation, we set aside one fold. We then used the remaining 
four folds for internal cross-validation during model training.

by  its  relatively  constant  performance  regardless  of  the  number  of 
background  points  used  to  train  component  models.  As  with  many 
ecological  problems, the  decisions made during  the modeling process 
demand careful consideration in the full context of the question at hand, 
since different questions often differ in their requirements from a model.

2.9. Evaluating individual modeling approaches 

To ensure that all models were evaluated with the same relatively 
independent data, we used a common approach to split the data into 
evaluation  and  training  datasets  prior  to  training  the  models.  We  set 
aside the evaluation dataset and used it to evaluate individual averaged 
modeling approaches and the final ensemble models, hereafter referred 

To assess the optimal number of background points for each indi-
vidual modeling approach, we calculated the True Skill Statistic (TSS) 
and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve (AUC-ROC) for each 
model using the external evaluation datasets set aside prior to training 
models (Allouche et al., 2006; Hao et al., 2020; Shabani et al., 2016). 
The  True  Skill  Statistic  is  based  on  a  binary  classification  of  model

Helpful Answer: To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, a diverse dataset was utilized by setting aside one fold for obtaining presences and background points to be used during external evaluation. The remaining four folds were employed for internal cross-validation during model training. This strategy allowed the model to learn from various subsets of the data, reducing overfitting and improving its ability to perform well on unseen data. Secondly, stratified splitting was applied when dividing the data into evaluation and training datasets before training the models. This technique ensured that both datasets contained a representative distribution of classes, preventing any class imbalance issues that could negatively impact the model's performance. Lastly, the optimal number of background points for each individual modeling approach was determined by calculating the True Skill Statistic (TSS) and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve (AUC-ROC) using the external evaluation datasets set aside prior to training models. These metrics helped quantify the model's predictive power and robustness, ensuring that only the most effective configurations were selected for the final ensemble models.
