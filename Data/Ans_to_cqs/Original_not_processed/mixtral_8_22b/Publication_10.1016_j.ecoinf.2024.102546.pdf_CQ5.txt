aforementioned  CropAndWeed  dataset  (Steininger  et  al.,  2023)  con-
tained  a  total  of  43,814  plant  images,  but  only  8,034  images  were 
labeled. Olaniyi et al. (2023) collected 36,374 RGB images from a va-
riety  of  maize  farmlands  for  the  maize  crops  and  associated  weeds. 
Despite the dataset scale, only 500 images were annotated with 5,764 
bounding box instances.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The paper by Olsen et al. (2019) titled 'DeepWeeds: a multiclass weed species image dataset for deep learning' is one of the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. This dataset contains multiple classes of weed species images for deep learning purposes. Another dataset mentioned is the 'CropAndWeed' dataset by Steininger et al. (2023). However, it should be noted that this dataset contained a total of 43,814 plant images, but only 8,034 images were labeled. Additionally, the paper by Olaniyi et al. (2023) collected 36,374 RGB images from various maize farmlands for maize crops and associated weeds. Despite the large number of images, only 500 images were annotated with 5,764 bounding box instances. Other relevant papers include those by Oza et al. (2023), Pimentel et al. (2000), Rahman et al. (2022), and Rai et al. (2024). The specific datasets used in these studies are not explicitly stated in the given information.
