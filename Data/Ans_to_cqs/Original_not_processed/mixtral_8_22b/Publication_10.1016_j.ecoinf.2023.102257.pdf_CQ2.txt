Modern  machine-learning  (ML)  methods  can  perform  a  variety  of 
tasks to help meet these challenges. Determining whether an animal is 
present in an image is a binary classification task that can be performed 
via machine learning to filter out false detections from a dataset. Several 
methods have been used to predict whether an image is empty, including 

measurement  of  differences  between  consecutive  images  (Price  Tack 
et al., 2016; Ren et al., 2013; Wei et al., 2020), convolutional neural 
networks (Tabak et al., 2019; Tabak et al., 2020), and ensemble learning 
(Yang et al., 2021). Alternatively, object detection models that localize 
target  objects  (animals)  within  an  image  can  be  used  to  filter  empty 
images  (Beery  et  al.,  2019).  In  contrast  to  other  techniques,  this 
approach not only identifies empty images through the absence of target 
objects, but also indicates the location of each target object within an 
image (Fig. 1).

the  efficiency  of  tagging  remote  camera  data.  Overall,  we  found  that 
tagging images with ML bounding boxes is nearly twice as fast as tagging 
with bounding boxes, unassisted. Tagging images with only the species 
label  (without  bounding  boxes)  was  the  fastest  tagging  method, 
although not significantly different relative to tagging with ML bound-
ing boxes. Our results highlight the value of combining ML-based ap-
proaches with manual tagging to increase the speed at which camera 
data is processed, which can ultimately allow for faster analyses.

these images can be tagged more quickly based on the context of the 
prior image and occur frequently in real-world datasets.

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss using machine learning methods to determine if an animal is present in an image, suggesting that the input data format could be images. Additionally, the article mentions using bounding boxes, which are often associated with image or video data. Therefore, it can be inferred that the primary data format used in this case might be images. However, without further information, it cannot be confirmed if any additional data formats such as audio, video, or CSV files were utilized in the deep learning pipeline.
