The  pre-trained  model  underwent  inference  and  fine-tuning  for  4 
iterations using the entire SW stratum employing the SAL. This iterative 
process served to enhance the model's performance and gather samples 
pertaining to each key species present in the region. The training pro-
cedure for the two first fine-tuning iterations was the one proposed in 
the  original  paper  (Delplanque  et  al.,  2023a)  which  consisted  of  two 
main steps: 1) training the architecture using positive patches for 200 
epochs, and 2) collecting and including hard negative patches, which are 
patches  containing  false  positives,  to  further  train  the  model  for  50 
epochs in order to reduce the number of false positives. During the two 
last fine-tuning iterations, only the second step of the training procedure 
was used. Hard negative patches were created using false positives that 
emerged from the thumbnail classification (step 1 of the SAL). To avoid a

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were implemented during its development and training stages. Firstly, the model was trained using a diverse dataset consisting of various key species found within the African savanna ecosystem. This diversity helped prevent the model from being biased towards specific species or features, thereby improving its ability to accurately identify different animals across multiple regions.

Secondly, the model selection process involved choosing the version that performed best on the validation set, rather than solely focusing on minimizing errors during training. By prioritizing validation accuracy, this approach aimed to minimize the risk of overfitting – a common issue where models become too specialized to their training data and fail to perform well when applied to new datasets.

Lastly, the patch size was strategically set to 1024 x 1024 pixels during inference to expedite processing without compromising accuracy. This decision allowed for efficient analysis of large areas while maintaining sufficient detail for accurate identification of target species.

In summary, the combination of utilizing a diverse dataset, selecting models based on validation performance, and optimizing patch sizes contributed significantly to ensuring the generalizability of the deep learning model developed for wildlife population estimation in African savannas.
