For each fold, the frames from Trainingclips  were used to train the 
models. The Testingclips were used to assess the robustness of our method 
on short sequences centered around the presence of fish presence. The 
Testingstations, common to all k-fold were used to assess the robustness of 
the method on 1-h videos, corresponding to the real use-case scenarios 
of ecological studies (Supp. Fig. 1). 

2. Methods

displayed a slightly higher F-measure standard deviation, ranging from 
0.08 to 0.11 between models. Considering the superior performance of 
the models trained on 27 species (Supp. Table 1), these were selected for 
subsequent analyses.

dividual sharks present in the test dataset had ever been encountered in 
the training dataset.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions using k-fold cross-validation and evaluating the models based on their performance on both short sequences and longer 1-hour videos. This suggests that the authors might have monitored the model performance by observing its ability to generalize across different data subsets and time scales.
