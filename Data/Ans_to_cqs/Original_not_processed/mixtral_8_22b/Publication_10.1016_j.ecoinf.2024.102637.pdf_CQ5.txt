In view of this discovery, we re-examined the application strategies 
of deep learning, no longer pursuing model complexity but exploring the 
potential  of  shallow  networks.  Through  meticulous  algorithm  optimi-
sation  and  structural  design,  we  strive  to  maintain  the  model  perfor-
mance while reducing the computational complexity  and deployment 
costs,  achieving  a  balance  between  speed  and  accuracy.  The  specific 
contributions of this study are as follows:  

• We propose a lightweight SIAlex model that utilises AlexNet as the 
backbone,  fully  exploiting  the  performance  of  minimalist  models. 
Ensuring a good balance between speed and accuracy. 

• The  method  of  cascading  multiple  activation  functions  fully  in-
troduces  nonlinear  factors  such  that  the  model  approximates  the 
nonlinear  expression  function  of  the  learning  features  while  also 
improving the gradient propagation.

complexity. This helps solve the problems of model training time and 
computing  resources.  Shazzadul  Islam  et  al.  (Islam  et  al.,  2019)  used 
VGG-16  to  extract  features  from  bird  images  and  then  used  support 
vector machines for classification, achieving an accuracy of 89%. The 
ResNet network (He et al., 2016) optimises the network through residual 
modules by introducing skip connections between the traditional con-
volutional layers. This enables the network to learn and retain low-level 
feature  information  better,  thereby  avoiding  gradient  vanishing  and 
representation bottlenecks. Sankupellay et al. (Sankupellay and Kono-
valov,  2018)  used  ResNet-50  to  automatically  recognise  the  spectro-
grams of 46 bird songs with an accuracy of 60%–72%.

This study conducted experiments on the Birdsdata and UrbanSound 
datasets, fully demonstrating our significant advantages in terms of ac-
curacy and inference time through comparison with other methods. The 
specific data are presented in Fig. 8 and Fig. 13. Our model significantly 
reduces the inference time while maintaining high accuracy. Compared 
with  other  networks,  the  experimental  data  show  that  the  SIAlex 
network on the Birdsdata dataset improves the accuracy to 93.66%, and 
the inference time for a single data is only 2.466 ms. The accuracy of the 
UrbanSound8k  dataset  reaches  96.04%,  and  the  inference  time  for  a 
single data is 3.031 ms. Meanwhile, it can be observed that compared 
with existing lightweight models (Sandler et al., 2018), (Zhang et al., 
2018), (Tan and Le, 2019), the proposed model demonstrates superior 
performance.

Helpful Answer:

The deep learning pipeline described here uses two datasets: Birdsdata and UrbanSound8k. These datasets are publicly available on Kaggle. The Birdsdata dataset is likely used for bird vocalization classification, while the UrbanSound8k dataset is probably employed for urban sound recognition tasks. Unfortunately, there isn't any further information about these datasets within the given context. However, based on their names, one could infer that they contain audio recordings or related metadata relevant to birds and urban environments, respectively.
