To simultaneously carry out shrinkage estimation and variable se-
lection,  we  employ  the  penalized  loss  function  with  an  L1  penalty 
(Tibshirani, 1996), defined as follows:

where lΞ  is the loss function minimized by solving the estimating eqs. (2) 
=
and (3), and is given by eq. (10) in Appendix A. We set ϕ0
ϕ (k ∕= 0, ϕ ≥ 0) as a constant tuning parameter. The loss function has no 
penalties for the intercept parameter β0 of the intensity function and the 
coefficient  paramter  α  for  the  detection  probability  model.  We  can 
compute the L1  penalized estimates using the gradient ascent method 
(Goeman,  2010).  The  detailed  computation  algorithm  is  provided  in 
Appendix C.

Helpful Answer:
In this study, the authors use the L1 penalty, also known as LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regularization, to perform simultaneous shrinkage estimation and variable selection. This regularization technique adds a penalty term to the loss function, encouraging smaller weights and thus preventing overfitting. Unlike L2 regularization or Ridge Regression, which uses the sum of the squares of the weights as the penalty term, L1 regularization uses the absolute value of the weights. This often results in sparse solutions where many weights become zero, effectively performing feature selection. However, it should be noted that other regularization techniques such as Dropout, Batch Normalization, and Early Stopping could also be employed in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting. These methods work differently but share the common goal of reducing complexity and improving generalization performance.
