• Weight decay: 0.0005,
• Gamma: 0.1,
• Batch size: 24 (in case of GoogLeNet), 100 (in case of AlexNet).

All the above experiments were conducted using our own fork of

also be replicated using a standard instance of caﬀe.

of classes in our dataset), which feeds the softMax layer. The
softMax layer ﬁnally exponentially normalizes the input that it
gets from (fc8), thereby producing a distribution of values across
the 38 classes that add up to 1. These values can be interpreted
as the conﬁdences of the network that a given input image is
represented by the corresponding classes. All of the ﬁrst 7 layers
of AlexNet have a ReLu non-linearity activation unit associated
with them, and the ﬁrst two fully connected layers (fc{6, 7})
have a dropout layer associated with them, with a dropout
ratio of 0.5.

Helpful Answer:
The study uses two types of deep learning architectures: AlexNet and GoogLeNet. Both models are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). AlexNet was introduced in 2012 and consists of five convolutional layers followed by three fully connected layers. It was one of the first successful applications of CNNs to large-scale image classification tasks. On the other hand, GoogLeNet, also known as Inception v1, was proposed in 2014 and features a more complex design with multiple parallel paths containing different combinations of convolutions, pooling operations, and fully connected layers. This allows the network to capture both local and global patterns within images effectively.
