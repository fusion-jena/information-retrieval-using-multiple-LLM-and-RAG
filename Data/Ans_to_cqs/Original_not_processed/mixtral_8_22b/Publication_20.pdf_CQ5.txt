We used a GoogLeNet architecture as it was the winner of the 2015
competition imageNet (Szegedy et al., 2015), an identiﬁcation chal-
lenge on 1000 diﬀerent classes. This CNN is composed of 22 layers. It
uses inception modules. Inception modules allow the network to use
convolutions of diﬀerent sizes (1*1, 3*3 and 5*5 pixels) and to weight
each of these convolutions. This network could thus account more or
less strongly for the context of each pixel, which increases the range of
possibilities to improve its performance during the training.

A link to a depository with architecture details is given at the end of
references. We stopped the network training after 70 epochs (i.e. a
complete scope of the dataset where each image is used only once), to
−5, an exponential
prevent overﬁtting. We used a learning rate of 10
learning decay with a Gamma of 0.95, a dropout of 50% and an Adam
Solver type as learning parameters. Those are classic hyper-parameters
for a fast convergence of the network without over-ﬁtting (Srivastava
et al., 2014). The weight initialization is also classic with a random
Gaussian initialization. The training lasted 8 days on our conﬁguration;
we trained and ran our code on a computer with 64GB of RAM, an i7
3.50GHz CPU and a Titan X GPU card for 900,000 images.

We used at least 2200 thumbnails per ﬁsh species class, and batches

of 16 images to train our network. We ran this architecture on Caﬀe (Jia
et al., 2014). To focus on the impact of the training data, we used the
same CNN architecture for our training and test procedures.

2.3. Building the training datasets

Using the raw training dataset of 20 ﬁsh species (Table S1) we built
4 diﬀerent datasets to assess the inﬂuence of the dataset building on
classiﬁcation results (Table S2).

The ﬁrst training dataset T1 contained raw ﬁsh thumbnails (T0) and

their respective mirror images.

More precisely, we doubled the number of thumbnails per ﬁsh in-
dividual by ﬂipping each thumbnail with respect to the vertical axis.
Such a procedure homogenizes the proportion of left-oriented and
right-oriented individuals in the database and we hypothesize it could
improve the average identiﬁcation rate since ﬁsh individuals are seen in
all positions.

Helpful Answer:

In the described study, four different datasets were created from a raw training dataset containing 20 fish species. These datasets aimed to evaluate the influence of dataset construction on classification results. The first dataset, T1, consisted of raw fish thumbnails and their corresponding mirror images. Specifically, the number of thumbnails per fish individual was doubled by flipping each thumbnail along the vertical axis. This process ensured equal proportions of left-oriented and right-oriented individuals in the database, hypothesized to enhance the overall identification rate since fish can be observed in various orientations. However, the specific names of the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, were not mentioned in the provided context.
