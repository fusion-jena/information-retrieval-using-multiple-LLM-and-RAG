5. Experiments

This section describes the dataset we utilized as well as the environment in which our
experiment took place. It will also present image encryption results, clarify the encryption
schema’s efﬁciency, and examine the CNN model’s performance with both encrypted
and plain data in order to evaluate the efﬁciency of the proposed encryption method.
Experiments with pre-trained models will also be presented as another means of evaluating
the efﬁciency of the proposed encryption method.

5.5. Discussion

Recent years have seen increasing concerns about protecting the privacy of conﬁdential
information when processing data using models. This leads to the need for cryptographic
techniques to solve privacy concerns in data-driven models. Several PPDL techniques have
been proposed in the literature to solve these concerns. This research is, to the best of our
knowledge, the ﬁrst work that investigates PPDL for satellite image classiﬁcation.

Case 1: Training and testing the proposed CNN model with unencrypted data. The
results from training the model with plain data achieved 96.91% and 96.84% accuracy
for training and validation, respectively, on the training dataset, as well as 93.84%
accuracy for the testing dataset. Figure 7 demonstrates the accuracy results for training
and validating the CNN model over plain satellite images.
Case 2: Training and testing the proposed CNN model over encrypted data. The
results of training the model on encrypted data achieved 94.04% and 94.30% accuracy
for training and validation, respectively, on the training dataset, as well as 90.92%
accuracy for the testing dataset. Figure 8 demonstrates the accuracy results for training
and validating the CNN model on encrypted satellite images.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information regarding the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the authors might have used publicly available datasets or satellite imagery data collected through remote sensing technology. In general, common methods for collecting raw data include surveys, various types of sensors, and accessing public datasets. Surveys involve gathering data directly from individuals or entities through questionnaires or interviews. Sensors can collect a wide range of data such as temperature, humidity, pressure, light intensity, etc. Public datasets are often made available by government agencies, research institutions, or private organizations for use in academic studies or commercial applications.
