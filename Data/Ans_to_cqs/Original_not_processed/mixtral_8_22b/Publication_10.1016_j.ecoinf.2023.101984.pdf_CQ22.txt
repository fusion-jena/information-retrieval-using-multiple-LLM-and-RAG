maximum iterations with the subsample run type and a 30 random test 
percentage.  The  MaxEnt  model's  output  was  analysed,  and  the

temperatures that occur during the wettest season (degrees Celsius); 3) 
bio9,  ‘Mean  temperature  of  driest  quarter’,  is  a  quarterly  index  that 
approximates  the  mean  temperatures  that  occur  during  the  driest 
quarter (degrees Celsius); 4) bio13, ‘Precipitation of wettest month’, is 
the index that identifies the total precipitation that occurs during the 
wettest month (millimetres); 5) bio19, ‘Precipitation of coldest quarter’, 
is  a  quarterly  index  that  indicates  the  total  precipitation  that  occurs 
during the coldest quarter (millimetres); and 6) ‘Slope’ in % values of the 
Iberian  Peninsula  (see  Supplementary  Material  1C).  Finally,  we  used 
clamping  maps  of  MaxEnt  to  project  the  same  set  of  environmental 
variables used to perform the current models but expressing other time

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, common metrics for evaluating the performance of machine learning or deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, and area under the curve (AUC). Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of all predictions made by the model. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made by the model. Recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positives in the dataset. F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances both. ROC curve plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate, while AUC represents the probability that a randomly chosen positive instance will be ranked higher than a randomly chosen negative one. These metrics can help assess the overall performance of the model and its ability to accurately classify instances.
