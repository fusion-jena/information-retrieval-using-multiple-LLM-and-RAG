and so on. Researchers have extended the application and improve the
algorithms based on classical neural network models afterwards. Since
2006 deep learning started to boom in academia and industry. The deep
learning algorithm broke the limitation of the traditional neural net-
work on the number of layers. According to demands of designers, the
number of network layers was chosen and trained by large-scale data to
obtain deeply hidden characteristic information and features which is
beyond imagination before (Hinton and Salakhutdinov, 2006).

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific details about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or managing random seed values. However, I can share some common strategies used to manage randomness in deep learning pipelines.

1. Setting Seeds: One popular strategy is setting seeds for various libraries like NumPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc. This ensures reproducibility across different runs of the same code. By explicitly specifying a seed value, we can control the randomness introduced during operations such as shuffling datasets, initializing weights, etc.

2. Cross-Validation: Another approach to mitigate the impact of randomness is employing cross-validation techniques. K-fold cross-validation involves splitting the dataset into k equal parts and training/testing the model on each subset while keeping the remaining data for validation. This helps in reducing overfitting and provides more robust performance estimates.

3. Ensemble Methods: Combining multiple models with varying levels of randomness can also help reduce overall uncertainty. Techniques like bagging, boosting, and stacking involve creating ensembles of models and aggregating their predictions to produce a final output. These methods often lead to improved generalization and reduced variance compared to individual models.

4. Regularization: Applying regularization techniques such as dropout, weight decay, or early stopping can further aid in controlling randomness. Dropout randomly drops out neurons during training, preventing co-dependencies between them. Weight decay adds a penalty term to the loss function, discouraging large weights. Early stopping halts training when the validation error starts increasing, avoiding overfitting due to excessive training.
