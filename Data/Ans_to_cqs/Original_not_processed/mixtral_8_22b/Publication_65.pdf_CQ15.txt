The most signiﬁcant variation of performance is concerning the number of parameters
and with training and inference time. Despite being the best architecture in performance,
According to Table 2, DeepLabv3+ needed more parameters than the other architectures,
about 2.75 times more parameters than the U-Net, the least requiring one. The need for a
more signiﬁcant number of parameters often implies a higher demand for training samples
that our dataset or another dataset may not have met that the methods present in this
research paper may be applied, possibly causing the DeepLabV3+ architecture to perform
below its potential.

Figure 9. Schematic diagram of the evaluation process.

All deep learning-based models exploited in this work were implemented using the
TensorFlow [51], a Python framework conceived to allow efﬁcient analysis and implemen-
tation of deep learning with Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). All experiments conducted
here were performed on a 64-bit Intel i7-8700K@3.70GHz CPU workstation, 64 GB memory,
and NVIDIA® GTX 1080 GPU with 12Gb of memory, under a 10.0 CUDA version. Debian
4.195.98-1 version was used as the operating system.

model that adjusts too well to the training data, but it does not generalize to the unseen
before dataset, i.e., a test dataset), after 50,000 iterations, the learning rate was reduced
following an exponential decay parameter of 0.5 by an SGD scheduler. Aside from this,
we used rotation, noise, and ﬂip (as in [50]) for data augmentation, and we were capable
of augmenting the dataset by six times. With the data augmentation technique, we can
make the CNN classiﬁcation more robust and generalize better. In Figure 9, we can see the
schematic diagram for the evaluation process.

3.3. Visual Analysis

Some features maps, learned by the convolutional layers, are presented in Figure 12.
Speciﬁcally, this image presents low-, mid- and high-level feature maps learned by the
ﬁrst, a middle, and the last layers of the networks, respectively. We can see the each CNN
performs very differently from one another.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, the optimization technique applied in the deep learning pipeline is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). After 50,000 iterations, the learning rate was reduced following an exponential decay parameter of 0.5 by an SGD scheduler. This indicates that the SGD optimizer was used during the training phase of the deep learning models. However, there is no mention of other optimization techniques such as Adam, RMSprop, or Adagrad. Therefore, based on the provided context, only SGD has been explicitly mentioned as an optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline.
