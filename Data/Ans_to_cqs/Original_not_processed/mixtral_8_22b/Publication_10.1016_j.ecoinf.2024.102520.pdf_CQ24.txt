4. Conclusion 

In evaluating the spatiotemporal heterogeneity and mapping of soil 
properties  within  the  ecologically  sensitive  NWH  region,  this  study 
presents  a  crucial  step  towards  precision  agriculture.  The  conducted 
random  sampling  design  was  able  to  measure  efficiently  the  concen-
trations of TSN and TSP in this fragile and environmentally vulnerable 
region. The study identified several key factors influencing TSN and TSP 
levels, including SOC, clay, silt, sand contents, NH4-N, NO3-N, available 
K,  landscape  aspect,  plant  types  and  slope.  Notably,  multiple  linear 
regression models highlighted the significant association between TSN 
and SOC, underlying the role of SOC as a reservoir of N with impact on 
plant and microbial activity. Also, TSP was found to be closely related to 
SOC and finer soil particles, to which P can bind more tightly.

Helpful Answer:
To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, several strategies can be employed. One common approach is using fixed seeds for reproducibility. By setting a specific seed value, the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers will be generated each time the code runs, ensuring consistent results across different executions. Another strategy involves averaging over multiple runs with different initializations or data shuffling orders. This technique, known as ensemble learning, helps reduce variance and improve overall performance by combining predictions from individual models trained on slightly varied inputs. Additionally, techniques such as dropout regularization and batch normalization can also help mitigate the effects of randomness during training by introducing controlled noise into the network architecture and activations respectively.
