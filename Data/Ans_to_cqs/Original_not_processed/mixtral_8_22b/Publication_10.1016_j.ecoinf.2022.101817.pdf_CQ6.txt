classification  pipeline.  The  validation  performance  of  CNN  Model  4 
with respect to each of the six environmental conditions is shown in the 
confusion matrix of Fig. 7 (b).

To  select  the  best  performing  model,  the  five  CNN  models  were 
validated in a final step using the 1500 videos of the validation dataset. 
It should be noted that the validation videos were held-out from training 
and thus contained videos that the models had not encountered before. 
To validate the models, 1 random frame was extracted from each vali-
dation dataset video. After extracting 1500 random frames (1 frame * 
1500 videos) all five CNN models were used to classify the videos into 
the  six  environmental  condition  classes.  The  results  of  the  validation 
phase are detailed in Section 3.1.

Helpful Answer:
The authors do not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps taken before training their deep learning models for environmental condition classification. However, they do discuss some post-processing steps such as image filtering and enhancement after the completion of the environmental classification phase. It can be assumed that standard preprocessing techniques like data augmentation, normalization, or scaling might have been employed but these details are not mentioned in the given text.

Based on common practices in machine learning and deep learning, it is likely that the input images were resized to fit the required dimensions of the convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. Additionally, normalizing the pixel values between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1 could help improve convergence during training. Data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, zooming, or cropping may also have been utilized to increase the size of the training set and prevent overfitting.

However, without explicit information regarding the preprocessing steps taken by J. Soom et al., one cannot provide a definitive list of preprocessing methods used before training their deep learning models.
