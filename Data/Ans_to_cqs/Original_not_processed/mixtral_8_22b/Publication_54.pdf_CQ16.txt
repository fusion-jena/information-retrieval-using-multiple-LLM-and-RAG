the training and validation sets. Then, the model is ﬁt by using
(k − 1) folds and evaluated using the remaining k th fold. The
process is repeated until every k-fold is used as the test set.
However, this may produce varying results. Thus, to improve
the model and analyze the inﬂuence of various components
in the framework, we adopted multistage training with the
training and validation datasets (Fig. 4) to better predict test
dataset.

The model is then iteratively trained and validated on these
different sets. The training set is used to ﬁt the parameters of
the classiﬁer, whereas the validation set provides an unbiased
evaluation of the model ﬁt on the training set while tuning
model hyperparameters, such as the network layer size, ﬁnd-
ing the optimal number of hidden units, and regularizing the
model. Models with few hyperparameters are easy to validate
and tune, but if the model has many hyperparameters, a larger
validation dataset is required. In some cases, the evaluation
is biased when a validation dataset is not incorporated into
the model conﬁguration because the model may perfectly ﬁt
the training data with high accuracy but may fail to ﬁt the
test or validation data. In such cases, k-fold cross-validation,
which is a resampling technique, is used to avoid overﬁtting;
the training set is generated with different combinations of k
groups (say 5 or 10, depending on the size of the dataset) as

3. Furthermore, to enhance the performance and decrease
overﬁtting in the selected model, we proposed a mech-
anism to swap the training and validation misclassiﬁed
datasets. Then, we retrained the model until it yielded
the highest accuracy possible on the validation and test
datasets. Additionally, ﬁve-fold cross-validation was
employed to verify the predictive performance of the
model.

tions even when only a few labeled datasets are available
for training. For instance, in the 2017 CWBF checklist of
the birds of Taiwan, 27 endemic bird species were identi-
ﬁed, whereas in the 2020 CWBF checklist, 29 endemic bird
species were identiﬁed. In such a scenario, the knowledge

Helpful Answer:

Answer: Based on the given context, the criteria used to determine when training is complete include achieving the highest accuracy possible on both the validation and test datasets. This is done by employing five-fold cross-validation to verify the predictive performance of the model. Additionally, a mechanism is proposed to swap the training and validation misclassified datasets, which helps enhance the performance and decrease overfitting in the selected model. However, the specific details about how the swapping process works or what constitutes the 'highest accuracy possible' are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. It should also be noted that models with fewer hyperparameters are easier to validate and tune, but if the model has many hyperparameters, a larger validation dataset is required.
