2.3.2.3. ANN: artificial neural networks classification. In classifying with 
the MLP ANN model, we used the package “nnet”, which provides pos-
sibilities for adjusting weighted decay and size, thereby countering the 
effects of model overfitting. We used an MLP ANN architecture with 1 
hidden layer established as a default setting within the “nnet” package, 
and with 6 neurons defined for our model inputs. The number of neurons 
in the input layer was equal to the number of used bands (6), and the 
output  layer  had  8  neurons  (representing  8  LULC  classes).  A  back 
propagation learning algorithm was used during the training phase of 
the model. Size and decay were used to define the primary model tuning 
parameters, and the control () function was used to control for model 
runs. As with the kNN approach, we defined the LULC classes of the test 
datasets  as  target  variables  and  the  band  reflectance  values  as  pre-

and  Kappas,  2017).  The  kNN  model  is  a  non-parametric  model  that 
performs  LULC  classification  based  on  the  distance  between  k  closest 
samples drawn from training datasets. The approach depends on thor-
ough image (predictor) pre-processing so as to reduce sampling bias and 
ensure equal treatment of predictors when computing distance (Kuhn 
and Johnson, 2016). The SVM model uses support vectors (i.e. based on 
a subset of training data points closest to decision boundaries) to locate 
optimal decision boundaries that separate two LULC classes (Cortes and 
Vapnik, 1995; Kuhn and Johnson, 2016). The ANN model is a mathe-
matical model developed as an analogy of the human brain. Using an 
interconnected  group  of  responsive  and  conducting  nodes,  the  ANN 
model  mimics,  in  a  very  simplified  fashion,  the  functionality  of  the 
human brain for knowledge acquisition, recall, synthesis and problem

solving  (Kubat,  1999;  Yang,  2009).  In  LULC  classification,  the  Multi- 
Layer Perceptron (MLP) type of ANN has been used most often (Silva 
et al., 2020). MLP carries out backpropagation of training samples to 
accurately classify LULC. The RF was developed as an ensemble of ML 
models that use bootstrap techniques to build many single decision tree 
models (Breiman, 2001; Mellor et al., 2013; Rodriguez-Galiano et al., 
2012). The RF model uses subsets of predictor variables (e.g. Landsat 
bands) to split observation datasets into subsets of homogenous samples 
to build each decision tree (Mellor et al., 2013).

Machine learning (ML) models are a leading analytical technique used to monitor, map and quantify land use and 
land cover (LULC) and its change over time. Models such as k-nearest neighbour (kNN), support vector machines 
(SVM), artificial neural networks (ANN), and random forests (RF) have been used effectively to classify LULC 
types at a range of geographical scales. However, ML models have not been widely applied in African tropical 
regions  due  to  methodological  challenges  that  arise  from  relying  on  the  coarse-resolution  satellite  images 
available for these areas. In this study, we compared the performance of four ML algorithms (kNN, SVM, ANN 
and  RF)  applied  to  LULC  monitoring  within  the  Mayo  Rey  department,  North  Province,  Cameroon.  We  used 
satellite data from the Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) combined with 8 Operational Land

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is classification. Specifically, it is used for land use and land cover (LULC) classification. This is evident from the statement, "In classifying with the MLP ANN model..." where MLP stands for Multilayer Perceptron, a type of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) commonly used for classification tasks. Furthermore, the output layer of the model has eight neurons, representing eight different LULC classes. Therefore, the goal of this deep learning model is to accurately categorize each pixel or region of interest into one of these eight LULC classes.
