(Leng et al., 2020; Li et al., 2022c), ecological sustainability assessment
(Lu et al., 2020; Qiu et al., 2022), farmer behavioral decision-making
and crop management system optimization (Ren et al., 2020), and

With the rapid development of multi-scale data and multi-method
coupling research, scholars have started to base their research on
qualitative (Chen, 2020), quantitative (Liao et al., 2021; Mu et al.,
2019), frequency (Lu et al., 2021), probabilistic (Zhao and Xu, 2020),
temporal (Shen et al., 2019), spatial (Zhao et al., 2022) and other multi-
scale data. Improvements in random forest (Jiang et al., 2021; Lian et al.,
2022), support vector machines (Hong et al., 2018), deep learning (Ren
et al., 2021; Wu, 2022), Bayesian networks (Che et al., 2019), and mixed
effects (Yu et al., 2021a) models for improved fusion, e.g., Gu et al. (Gu
et al., 2024) fused optimal parametric geoprobes with partial least
squares structural equations to analyze the effects of topography,
climate, and human activities on the spatial pattern of kNDVI. Research
in natural areas such as agro-land ecology has been performed in the
exploration of influencing factors of land use and agricultural systems

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model mentioned in the report. However, common practices used to improve the generalization performance of a deep learning model include using diverse datasets, cross-validation, stratified splitting, or a combination of these methods. Cross-validation is often employed to evaluate the model's ability to predict new data by dividing the available data into training and validation sets. Stratified splitting ensures that each class is represented proportionally in both the training and validation sets. Using a diverse dataset can help prevent overfitting and increase the robustness of the model when applied to unseen data. Without further details regarding the specific implementation of this deep learning model, it cannot be determined which of these techniques was utilized.
