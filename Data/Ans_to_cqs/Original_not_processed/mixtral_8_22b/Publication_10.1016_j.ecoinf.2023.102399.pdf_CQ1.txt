There is no doubt that low-quality images will increase the workload 
of  image  processing,  requiring  more  complex  algorithms.  Obtaining 
high-quality  images  through  a  fully  automated  biomass  estimation 
method, without any manual intervention, can significantly reduce the 
workload  for  humans.  To  decrease  the  need  for  manual  intervention, 
Ravanbakhsh et al. (2015) implemented a deep learning technique that 
automatically detected and identified the head and mouth of Southern 
Bluefin tuna that were cultured in deep-sea cages. The head and mouth 
of the fish in specific positions within the underwater stereo images were 
accurately recognized using the Haar classifier. Although this technique 
efficiently  decreases  manual  processes,  achieving  fully  automated 
acquisition  of  biomass  information  is  still  lacking  in  certain  aspects.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The paper does not provide explicit details about the method used for collecting raw data in their deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of underwater stereo images for recognizing the head and mouth of Southern Bluefin tuna. This suggests that they might have collected raw data using cameras or other imaging devices installed in deep-sea cages where the fish were being cultured. Additionally, the authors discuss obtaining high-quality images through a fully automated biomass estimation method, which implies that they could be utilizing some form of automated data collection process. Nevertheless, the exact methodology employed for gathering raw data remains unspecified in the given context.
