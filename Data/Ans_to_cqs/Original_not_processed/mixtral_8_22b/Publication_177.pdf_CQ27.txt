The  selected  network  models  were  initialized  with  pre-
trained ImageNet weights and then fine-tuned to our datasets. 
The performance of a deep neural network for a dataset highly 
depends on network hyperparameters. The selection and fine-
tuning of  optimized hyperparameters  is  generally  a  difficult 
and  time-consuming  task.  Instead  of  manually  selecting  the 
hyperparameters, we employed Bayesian optimization to find 
their optimal values for each of the six models.  A Gaussian 
process  model  of  the  objective  function  is  used  by  the 
Bayesian optimization technique.  Different variables can be 
optimized using this technique such as network section depth, 
batch size, initial learning rate, momentum, and regularization 
strength. For this study, we optimized the network for batch 
size  (between  1  and  32)  and  initial  learning  rate  (between 
1×10-4  and  1×10-2).  The  optimization  was  performed  by

training while 40% of the images were used for testing. In 
order to develop and compare the models for both datasets, 
we split the original 40% testing data into validation (20%) 
and testing (20%). So, the final distribution of the dataset 
was  60%  for  training,  20%  for  validation,  and  20%  for 
testing.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning models. Therefore, it is not possible to determine what specific steps or methods were taken to deploy these models after they had been trained and evaluated.
