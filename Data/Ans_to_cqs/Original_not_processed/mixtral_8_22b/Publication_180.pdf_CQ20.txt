TensorFlow
TensorFlow is an open-source software platform (Abadi et al. 2016) 
that supports deep learning research and applications, having been 
released  by  researchers  at  Google  (Google  Brain  Team;  https://re-
search.google.com/teams/brain/).  We  adapted  and  configured 
TensorFlow  for  application  and  use  in  our  project  via  Python. We 
adjusted  two  parameters  from  their  default  values:  validation  per-
centage and number of training steps. Although the default setting 
for validation percentage was 10%, given small numbers of images 
available for some species, we had to increase this number to 16%. 
For number of training steps, although the default value was 4000 
steps,  we  explored  different  numbers  and  compared  the  results  to 
find  the  optimum  balance  between  computing  time  and  classifica-
tion efficiency.

Vector-borne Chagas disease is endemic to the Americas and imposes significant economic and social burdens 
on public health. In a previous contribution, we presented an automated identification system that was able 
to discriminate among 12 Mexican and 39 Brazilian triatomine (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) species from digital 
images. To explore the same data more deeply using machine-learning approaches, hoping for improvements 
in classification, we employed TensorFlow, an open-source software platform for a deep learning algorithm. 
We trained the algorithm based on 405 images for Mexican triatomine species and 1,584 images for Brazilian 
triatomine  species.  Our  system  achieved  83.0  and  86.7%  correct  identification  rates  across  all  Mexican  and 
Brazilian  species,  respectively,  an  improvement  over  comparable  rates  from  statistical  classifiers  (80.3  and

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention which specific hardware resources were used for training the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the authors likely utilized GPU resources due to the common practice of employing graphics processing units for accelerating deep learning tasks. TensorFlow, being a popular deep learning framework, has built-in support for both CPUs and GPUs, with GPU usage often providing faster computations when dealing with large datasets or complex models. Nonetheless, without explicit information regarding the hardware resources used, one cannot definitively state whether only GPUs, TPUs, or other types of hardware were involved in the training process.
