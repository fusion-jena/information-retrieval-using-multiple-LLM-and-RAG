2022; Christin et al., 2019; W¨aldchen and M¨ader, 2018) and promises to 
continue  to  make  further  progress  (Morera,  2024).  These  techniques 
have  allowed  to  improve  the  accuracy  of  results  compared  to  more 
traditional modeling techniques due to the possibility to approximate 
non-linear  relationships  and  to  consider  a  large  number of  predictors 
(Meyer  et  al.,  2019).  Machine  learning  in  ecology  has  been  used  for 
instance to study species distribution (Liang et al., 2022; Bellin et al., 
2022), species identification through imagery (Gao et al., 2024), char-
acterization of land use change (Gelabert et al., 2021), identification of 
conservable or restorable areas (Cheng et al., 2018), biodiversity con-
servation and estimation (Tuia et al., 2022; Chang, 2023), and invasive 
species risk assessment (Jensen et al., 2020).

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information on the type of deep learning models used in the mentioned studies. However, it can be inferred from the context that various types of deep learning models have been applied in ecology, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for species identification through imagery and possibly other architectures like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers for tasks related to species distribution, characterization of land use change, biodiversity conservation, and estimation, among others. To find out the exact type of deep learning model used in each case, one would need to refer to the respective research papers cited in the text.
