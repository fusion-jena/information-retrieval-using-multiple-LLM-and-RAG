Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

for the FWI and FFMC data layers with a spatial resolution of 1 × 1 km.
The nine-cell approach, the results of which are shown in this paper, led
to slightly better prediction results of the variants, likely because it
smoothed existing data inaccuracies within single grid cells.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. The text only mentions the use of a nine-cell approach for smoothing existing data inaccuracies within single grid cells, but does not provide any details regarding the optimization process or techniques used such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate response to the query based on the available information.
