ering larger datasets. Also in this case, larger R2 values are found when 
considering L < 500.

not  analysed  in  the  following  given  their  reduced  size  in  terms  of 
reference points.”  Metrics without windowing are analysed at first. In 
particular, the scatter plots of the NSL are provided in Fig. 9 as a function 
of distance and for the four classes listed above. As already discussed 
both metrics and distances are expressed in logarithmic scale. For the 
“Trees” class, the scatter plot of the NSL metric is clearly elongated along 
the regression line indicated in red. In this case, a coefficient of deter-
mination, R2 = 0.27 was found. For three classes (“Trees”, “Houses” and 
“Other Plants”), the slope coefficient, β, is negative indicating a decrease 
of NSL with distance. In all four cases, however, β assumes values lower

2.8. Metric-to-distance models 

The metrics discussed above have been computed using the reference 
data generated according to the procedure discussed in Section 2.4 and 
plotted as a function of the measured distances, di. In this way, scatter 
plots have been obtained. When both mi and di are plotted in logarithmic 
scale, a linear trend was observed. In the following, symbol mi is used to 
denote  a  generic  metric:  the  appropriate  subscript  is  used  to  indicate 
specific quantities. 

While  the  scatter  plots  obtained  for  the  different  metrics  will  be 
discussed  in  the  “Results”  section,  the  linear  trends  observed  when 
logarithmic scales are adopted suggested the use of linear models for 
regression analysis (Casella and Berger, 2001; Draper and Smith, 1998): 

log(mi) = α + βlog(di).

This model implies a power law between mi and di, 

mi = eαdβ

i = k⋅dβ
i .

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific strategies or techniques employed to monitor the model performance during training. However, it can be inferred from the context that the authors might have used some form of evaluation metrics such as R^2 value, scatter plots, and regression lines to assess the performance of their models. Additionally, they seem to have utilized logarithmic scales for better visualization and interpretation of their data. Nevertheless, without more explicit information regarding the training process, it is impossible to provide a definitive answer on the exact strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training.
