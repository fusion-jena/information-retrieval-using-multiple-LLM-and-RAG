2.4. Computing tools 

All the calculations were carried out using the DAFNE HPC scientific 
computing centre of the Universit`a degli Studi della Tuscia. The system 
provides  for  two  Hewlett  Packard  Enterprise  (HPE)  ProLiant  DL560 
Gen10 nodes, each one equipped with: four processors Intel Xeon Gold 
5118 2.30GHz, 12 cores, 24 threads; and 512 GB of RAM. The two nodes 
worked in a parallel configuration managed by the Python 3.6.8 package 
Ray,  version  1.9.2.  All  the  scripts  and  dataset  to  fully  reproduce  the 
results of this work are publicly available at https://github.com/lucar 
os1190/LS-MCMC-hybridGenAlgo.

Table 1 summarises the overall model parameters considered for the 

Drosophila suzukii case of study. 

To complete the model description, let us consider that in a culti-
vated  field  there  is  a  high  probability  for  males  and  females  to  mate 
(Rossini et al., 2022b, 2021a), that is a transition rate from non-mated to 
mated  females  of  G1→2(t)  = 1  (cid:0) M[T(t)].  Putting  together  all  the  as-
sumptions made, and considering a sex ratio SR  = 0.5 (1:1, males: fe-
males)  (Emiljanowicz  et  al.,  2014)  we  obtain  the  final  version  of  the 
physiologically  based  model  to  test  the  algorithm  introduced  in  the 
following sections:

xL3(t) = GeL(t)xL2(t) (cid:0) GeL(t)xL3(t) (cid:0) M(t)xL3(t)

The  entries  of  the  database  are  subsequently  ordered  from  the 
smaller to the higher sum of the residual values. This operation ends the 
first  step  of  the  LS  algorithm  and  leads  to  the  second  part,  hereafter 
defined  as  the  genetic  algorithm.  This  is  in  turn  based  on  an  iterative 
optimization, and its purpose is to partially optimize the results of the 
estimation and to better explore the space of the parameters. This part of 
the  process  is  analogous  to  the  previously  described  step:  the  first 
quarter  of  the  best  fit  parameter  values  stored  in  the  database  is 
considered as input for the process.

method  to  estimate  the  model  parameters  directly  from  field  data,  where  experimental  activities  are  less 
expensive and less time consuming. In this study we propose a combination of least squares methods via genetic 
algorithms to preliminary evaluate the best parameter values and Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to obtain 
their distribution. The algorithm has been tested in the special case of Drosophila suzukii, to quantify part of the 
parameters  of  an almost  validated model in  two  steps:  i) a first pseudo-validation  using perturbed  numerical 
solutions, and ii) a validation using real field data. The results highlighted the potentialities of the algorithm in 
estimating model parameters and opened several perspectives for further improvements from both the compu-
tational and experimental point of view.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, I cannot provide information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model because it is not mentioned or discussed in the provided context. Therefore, I do not have enough details to give a helpful response regarding the specific steps taken to deploy the model, such as model serialization or platform selection.
