the growing computing capability of machines and availability of big 
data, making it possible to extract high levels of representation of image 
content  (Hassaballah  and  Hosny,  2019).  This  field  falls  into  artificial 
intelligence  and,  in  particular,  deep  learning,  which  has  recently 
received  large  attention  from  ecologists  (Christin  et  al.,  2019).  Deep 
learning  is  a  sub-field  of  artificial  intelligence  which  focuses  on  a 
learning method based on logical structures that closely resemble the 
architectural  characteristics  of  the  brain  (the  so-called  deep  artificial 
neural networks). It consists of processing units within the global system 
that  specialize  in  detecting certain  hidden  characteristics  in the  data. 
The  first  record  of  the  application  of  computer  vision  in  the  field  of

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets. However, it can be inferred that the use of 'big data', 'labelled images', and 'existing deep learning techniques' suggests that the authors may have employed publicly available datasets or collected their own data using various means like cameras or sensors. Additionally, the reference to 'a small amount of K labelled images in each category' implies that some form of manual labeling or annotation was involved in preparing the dataset. Nonetheless, without explicit information about the data collection process, one cannot definitively state the exact methods used for gathering raw data in this case.
