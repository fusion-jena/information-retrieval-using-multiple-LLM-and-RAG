resolution at the landscape scale. To achieve this, we use predictive models based on machine learning algo-
rithms and a fungal database resulting from the sampling of more than 100 permanent sampling plots over 20 
years. We estimate that current and future productivity patterns differ among species, under different climate 
change scenarios and bioclimatic regions. Our results suggest that optimal productivity areas may be shifted to 
higher  elevations,  making  those  species  with  higher  productivity  at  higher  elevations  the  most  affected  by 
climate change. This would mean that some species with high socioeconomic value, such as Lactarius deliciosus 
and Boletus edulis, could be negatively affected in their total productivity in the study area. This study highlights 
the need to anticipate the potential effects of climate change on fungal productivity and in particular on high

The patterns found by random forest models are informative about 
the  relationships  between  species-specific  productivity  and  environ-
mental  conditions.  These  models  have  been  extensively  contrasted  to 
explain relationships between variables and estimate their importance 
(Gregorutti  et  al.,  2017),  and  used  in  different  fields  of  ecology,  for 
instance biomass quantification (Kaveh et al., 2023), species distribution 
modeling (Valavi et al., 2021) and genomic studies (Brieuc et al., 2018). 
Although machine learning models cannot explicitly detect proximate 
variables  that  reveal  the  causal  relationships  between  fungal  produc-
tivity and the sampled environment, they can be very helpful in disen-
tangling these complex relationships (Archer and Kimes, 2008). This is 
especially  helpful  in  Mediterranean  environments,  where  mushroom 
productivity is closely related to short-term weather conditions (Alday

2.2. Modeling 

We  trained productivity  models for  B.  edulis, H.  repandum,  L. deli-
ciosus, M. procera and T. portentosum based on the random forest algo-
rithm and the R package “ranger” (Wright and Ziegler, 2017). Random 
forest models allow us to find consistent nonlinear ecological relation-
ships  among  a  large  number  of  predictors,  making  them  suitable  for 
predicting  this  resource  that  sometimes  appears  to  be  driven  by

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The query asks about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, specifically regarding random seed values. However, the provided context does not directly address this topic. Instead, it discusses the application of random forest models in estimating fungal productivity patterns under various environmental conditions and climate change scenarios. Therefore, I am unable to provide a direct answer to the query using the given information.

However, generally speaking, there are several strategies to manage randomness in deep learning pipelines:

1. Fixing Seeds: One common approach is to fix the seed value for all random processes involved in the pipeline, including weight initialization, batch ordering, and dropout regularization. By fixing seeds, researchers ensure reproducibility and consistency across experiments.

2. Ensemble Methods: Another strategy involves training multiple models with different initializations or architectures and combining their predictions through ensemble methods like bagging or boosting. This helps reduce variance and improve overall performance.

3. Data Augmentation: Applying diverse transformations to input data during training can also help mitigate the impact of randomness. Techniques such as rotation, scaling, cropping, and flipping can generate new samples, effectively increasing dataset size and reducing overfitting.

4. Regularization Techniques: Employing techniques like L1/L2 regularization, early stopping, or dropout can prevent overfitting caused by random fluctuations in the training process. These methods introduce constraints on model complexity, promoting generalization and robustness.
