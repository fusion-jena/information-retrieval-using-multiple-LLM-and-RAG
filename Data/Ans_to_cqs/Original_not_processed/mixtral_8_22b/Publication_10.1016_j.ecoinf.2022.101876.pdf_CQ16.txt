%Query
Query: "What criteria are used to determine when training is complete (e.g., validation loss plateau)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The table does not provide information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete for a machine learning model. However, common criteria include observing a plateau or decrease in validation loss, improvement in accuracy, or reaching a predefined number of epochs or iterations. These criteria can vary depending on the type of model being trained and the specific requirements of the task.
