5.2. Deep GVI learning 

In  GreenCam,  we  measure  photo  GVI  by  SegFormer  (Xie  et  al., 
2021),  a  state-of-the-art  Transformer-based  model  for  semantic  seg-
mentation. As shown in Fig. 12, SegFormer follows the encoder-decoder 
structure, which combines a Transformer-based encoder (i.e., MiT) with 
a  lightweight  decoder  (i.e.,  ALL-MLP)  that  is  composed  entirely  of 
multilayer perceptron (MLP) blocks.

SegFormer offers a set of MiT encoders (marked by MiT-B0, up to 
MiT-B5) with increasing model sizes. To strike a balance between per-
formance  and  efficiency,  and  to  facilitate  model  deployment  on 
resource-constrained  mobile  devices,  we  choose  the  MiT-B1  as  the 
encoder of GVI learning. We train the model on a server with an NVIDIA 
GeForce GTX 3090 GPU (24 GB memory). The weights pretrained on 
ImageNet-1 K dataset are used to initialize the encoder and decoder. In 
training, we use the AdamW optimizer with the momentum parameter 
(cid:0) 8  to prevent division by zero. 
(β1
We employ a cosine annealing schedule and set the initial learning rate 
to 0.0001. The model is trained on the UGE-D dataset for 100 epochs 
with the batch size of eight. We supervise SegFormer's training with the 
Cross-Entropy loss function, which is formulated as:

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It only mentions that the model was trained on a server with an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 3090 GPU but does not specify where it was deployed after training. Therefore, I do not have enough information to determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
