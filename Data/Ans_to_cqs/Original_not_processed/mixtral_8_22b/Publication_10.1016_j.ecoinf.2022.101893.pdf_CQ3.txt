In recent years, deep learning has an excellent performance and is 
also widely used in computer vision, speech recognition and other fields. 
Xie et al. used Chirplet transform, STFT and Mel cepstrum transform to 
obtain the spectrogram, and combined with the bird species recognition 
method of deep learning, classified and recognized 18 species of birds 
(Xie et al., 2018). Since 2015, many research teams have exploited deep 
learning to classify birdsong in the LifeCLEF bird recognition challenge. 
For example, Piczak used deep learning to identify South American birds 
in the BirdCLEF 2016 competition (Piczak, 2016). T´oth et al. used CNN 
for feature learning in the same competition, and achieved good results 
(T´oth  and  Czeba,  2016).  Based  on  Xception,  extracted  logmel  or  log-
linear  spectra  as  features  in  BirdCLEF  2020,  Bai  et  al.  used  data 
enhancement technology to improve the detection performance of bird

shown in the Fig. 6. 

The network is designed with four convolution kernel pooling layers 
to extract deep features. After the convolution pooling, the data enters 
the fully connected layer for connection. The network adds a dropout 
layer  to  the  fully  connected  layer  to  reduce  network  parameters.  A 
Dense_1 layer is added after flatten to reduce the dimension of the deep 
features, and sets the parameter to 500, which is the parameter of the 
deep feature dimension extracted from different views.

5.2. Result analysis 

The datasets are divided into training set and test set according to the 
ratio of 8:2. And the number of test samples and training samples are 
3094 and 12,340, respectively. The classification models are built with 
the training set, and accuracy on test set is used as indicator to evaluate 
performance of classification models. 

5.2.1. Classic CNN model 

The three features of F1, F2 and F3 are input into CNN model, and 

their classification performance on the test set is shown in Table 6.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it can be inferred that some form of labeling was performed during the dataset preparation phase since the paper mentions using labeled data for training and testing purposes. In this case, the labels correspond to the bird species being identified by the deep learning algorithm. Therefore, while the exact methodology of data annotation is not specified, we can assume that each audio sample was assigned a corresponding bird species label.
