leaf-based  plant  species  classification.  However,  medicinal  plants  are 
not the primary focus of this work, and also considered high-resolution 
images for classification tasks. In a recent study (Chulif et al., 2023), 
deep  learning  models  are  used  for  detecting  diseases  in  single  crop 
species by considering real-time field challenges during image acquisi-
tion.  In  a  different  work  (Barhate  et  al.,  2023),  VGG-16  and  dimen-
sionality reduction with ESPCA is adapted to classify thirty-two plant 
species  with  hyperparameter  tuned  and  batch  updated  stochastic 
gradient descent technique. Later, (Ganguly et al., 2022), utilized the 
ResNet-50  architecture  to  capture  the  leaf  feature  patterns  via  fusion 
learning  and  is  trained  on  three  benchmark  datasets  to  showcase  the 
effectiveness of the model. The aforementioned studies do not directly

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipelines mentioned. However, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and landmark annotation. These techniques are often employed depending on the type of dataset and the problem being solved. For example, object detection tasks may use bounding boxes or instance segmentation, while semantic segmentation can be useful for scene understanding tasks. Polygon annotation is typically used for irregular shapes, while key points and landmarks are helpful for identifying specific features within images. Without more detailed information from the context, it cannot be determined which specific annotation techniques were used in these deep learning pipelines.
