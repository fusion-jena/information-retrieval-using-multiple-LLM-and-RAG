scenarios. The study showed the suitability of the SVR algorithm for
making predictions with restricted datasets, a finding that aligns with
previous research investigations (Kaveh et al., 2023; Mehmood et al.,
2024a; Zhang et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2022). An important conclusion
is derived from Fig. 6. It highlights that MLR heavily depends on pre-
dictor variables, demonstrating a more pronounced reliance on these
elements than machine learning methods. Furthermore, it is worth
noting that relying solely on spectral bands to predict AGB is unlikely to
produce favorable outcomes. Integrating these spectral bands with other
variable sets, including those produced from the Shuttle Radar Topog-
raphy Mission Digital Elevation Model (SRTM DEM) and vegetation-
derived indices, will lead to more favorable outcomes.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, we can infer that the study involves remote sensing data, specifically spectral bands and digital elevation model (DEM) data. These types of data are typically represented in raster or grid format, where each cell contains a value representing the reflectance or height at that location. Additionally, the study mentions using EarthExplorer, a platform that provides access to various satellite imagery and remote sensing products. Therefore, it is likely that the deep learning pipeline uses some form of image data, such as multispectral images or DEMs, as input.
