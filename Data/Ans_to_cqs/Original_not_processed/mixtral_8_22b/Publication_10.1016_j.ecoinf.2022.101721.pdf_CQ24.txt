include all observations in statistical modeling, rather than excluding observations, an approach which can affect 
the reliability of studies. This study also, to a great extent, explains the poor performance of software attempting 
automated bat ID. Implementing Bayesian algorithms, and thereby allowing users to interact with the software, 
should significantly improve their performance.

in  predicting  means,  SDs  and  finally  population  sizes  based  on  the 
observed data (e.g. Bhattacharya, 1967), thus reducing manual labour to 
a minimum.

developers could expand on the code in supplement S1 to implement 
more  predictor  variables  and  write  a  custom  algorithm.  Finally,  the 
classification accuracy of software incorporating an informative prior in 
their algorithm should not be determined through training and testing 
data sets alone. The performance must also be evaluated through the 
number  of  correct  classifications  using  real  world  examples.  Current 
software attempting to ID bats are locked in a vacuum. Bats in the real 
world are not!

Further, to test the performance of the two alternative approaches, 
populations  of  each  species  was  simulated  using  a  random  normal 
sample through the rnorm function in R. This data set will from now on 
be referred to as the “rnorm sample”. A total of N = 10,000 observations 
was created based on the means, SDs and the theoretical composition of 
each  species  listed  above  (20%,  1%  and  79%),  producing  2000 
P.  nathusii,  100  P.  pipistrellus  and  7900  P.  pygmaeus  observations. 
Simulated data for each species is stored in .csv format when running the 
code in supplement S1. The rnorm sample has been made fully repro-
ducible through the set.seed function in R. Predictions were made on the

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of the'set.seed' function in R, which is often used to ensure reproducibility by setting the starting point for generating random numbers. This implies that one strategy to handle randomness might be to set a specific seed value to ensure consistent results across different runs of the model. Additionally, the text suggests using more predictor variables and writing a custom algorithm, which could potentially help manage randomness by providing more input features or a tailored method for dealing with uncertainty. Lastly, evaluating the performance of the model using real-world examples instead of solely relying on training and testing datasets can offer insights into how well the model handles randomness present in actual data.
