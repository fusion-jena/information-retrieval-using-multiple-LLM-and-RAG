were utilized in the study: multilayer perceptron (MLP), logistic regression
(LR), naïve Bayes (NB), CatBoost (CAT), random forest (RF), XGBoost (XGB),
LightGBM (LGB), weighted soft voting (WSOFT), weighted hard voting
(WHARD), blending, and stacking.

(V.1.0.6), LightGBM package (V.3.2.1), XGBoost package (V.1.5.0), and
Hyperopt package (V.0.2.7), respectively.

3.2. Bias–variance decomposition

Predictive models that relate river health to gradients of environ-
mental factors can identify potential causes of impairment in areas of
ecological concern, supporting strategic decisions on prioritizing resto-
ration activities and new monitoring initiatives. Such models should be
generalizable to unseen data for predicting the river health in unmoni-
tored areas. Bias–variance decomposition is widely adopted for gener-
alizability evaluations of ML models (Guan and Burton, 2022; Van Der
Putten and Van Someren, 2004; Van Der Valk and Picek, 2019).
Although deep learning and other ML models have been widely
employed in river health predictions (Gazendam et al., 2016; Kwon
et al., 2024; Lee et al., 2021), they have not been supplemented with
evaluation techniques that would confirm their generalizability to un-
seen datasets. In the present study, the generalizability of various ML

The tree-structured Parzen estimator (TPE) improves the perfor-
mances of ML algorithms by finding the optimal hyperparameter set of
each ML model. The TPE estimates the probability distribution of the
hyperparameters using a probabilistic model and iteratively constructs a
tree of Gaussian distributions to approximate the objective function.
This probabilistic model then selects new hyperparameters for the
subsequent rounds of ML evaluation. The TPE is designed for efficient
searching in high-dimensional spaces.

In the present study, the TPE algorithm identified the most effective

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it does not explicitly mention which specific frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch are used to build the deep learning models. However, it mentions several packages like CatBoost, LightGBM, XGBoost, and Hyperopt that are used for implementing certain algorithms related to the machine learning models. These packages might use underlying frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, but without further details, we cannot definitively state which ones are being employed.
