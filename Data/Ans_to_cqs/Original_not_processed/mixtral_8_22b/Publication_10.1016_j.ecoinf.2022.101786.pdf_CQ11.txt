challenge of collecting representative datasets in the deep sea.

The authors acknowledge the officers and crew of RV ‘James Cook’ 
as well as the Autosub support team who assisted in the collection of the 
data. The DeepLinks project is funded by NERC NE/K011855/1. NP was 
funded  by  a  Plymouth  University  studentship  and  by  MISSION 
ATLANTIC. Data analysis was conducted under the MISSION ATLANTIC 
project  funded  by  the  European  Union’s  Horizon  2020  Research  and 
Innovation Program (No. 862428). We thank Kirsty Morris, Erik Simon 
Lledo, Brian Bett and Marcus Shirley for their advice on processing the 
images  prior  to  analysis.  Help  from  the  developers  of  Biigle,  Daniel 
Langenk¨amper  and  Martin  Zurowietz  throughout  the  development  of 
the workflow was equally instrumental and appreciated. We also thank 
Jamie  Cowle  and  Rhodri  Irranca-Davies  whose  undergraduate  and 
masters projects respectively helped with annotation and testing of early 
stage methodology for this study. Finally, we thank Chunxu Li, David

Some model parameters were modified from the default configura-
tion to balance use of resources and training speed. We retained a res-
olution of 704 × 704, batch size 64, 32 subdivisions and trained up to 
6000 iterations. Other parameters were kept to default or set according 
to guidance by the developers (https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet). 
Manual annotations were used to generate training, validation and 
testing  datasets.  Biigle  annotations  (label  name,  centre  x,  center  y,

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in this research. It would be best to refer directly to the authors or relevant sources such as published papers or documentation associated with the project for accurate and detailed information regarding the data repository link.
