Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

(1) LeNet is firstly proposed by LeCun et al. in the 1990s, which includes three convolution layers, 
two  sampling  layers,  two  fully  connected  layers.  At  that  time,  it  is  difficult  to  run  LeNet  due  to  the 
limit of computation and memory capacity [21]. 

(2) AlexNet is proposed by Alex et al. and won the ILSVRC 2012 [22]. AlexNet achieves higher 
identifying accuracy than all the traditional machine learning algorithms. It is significant breakthrough 
for machine learning for classification. 

(3) GoogLeNet is proposed by Christian of Google and is the winner of ILSVRC 2014 [23], in 
which inception layers, including different receptive areas with different kernel sizes capturing sparse 
correlation patterns, are integrated into CNN.

The size of output result is 17,280. 

Eleventh layer: This layer is the full connected layer with 100 neurons. 
Twelfth layer: This layer is the Softmax activation function layer with 2 neurons. 
In  our  ICSNet,  we  adopt  the  inception  module  from  GoogLeNet,  but  only  three  inception 
modules  are  built  in  ICSNet.  And  we  also  add  more  convolution  layers  than  AlextNet,  but  the 
number of convolution layers is less than VGGNet and ResNet. Consequently, the tradeoff between 
accuracy and time consuming can be achieved by our ICSNet. This is basic idea of our work.

3.  Experiments 

3.1.  Data description

After first inception modules, second and third inception modules are set in turn. The output is the 
data with the size of 28 × 28 × 480. Then, the pooling and LRN are performed, the data with the size of 
14 × 14 × 480 is output. 

Ninth  layer: It  is a convolution layer with  480  3  ×  3  filters  and  their stride  is  1. The ReLU is 
selected as the activation function. The result of this layer is the data with the size of 14 × 14 × 480. 
After convolution, the data is performed by LRN. Then, the maximum pooling with a 3 × 3 window 
and 2 strides is used. The output result is the data with the size of 6 × 6 × 480. 

Tenth layer: This layer is dropout layer which is used to improve the generalization capability. 

The size of output result is 17,280.
