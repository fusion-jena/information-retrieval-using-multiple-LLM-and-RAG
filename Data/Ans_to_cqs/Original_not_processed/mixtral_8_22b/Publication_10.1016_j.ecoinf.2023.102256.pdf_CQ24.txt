multiplied with the corresponding outputs of the baseline model (represented in red). 

the network is trained on a relatively small number of examples, which 
is often the case in ecology datasets. We conducted preliminary exper-
iments  on  enhancing  deep  learning  with  metadata  using  the  Hainan 
gibbon case study and the network developed by Dufourq et al. (2021). 
Our findings revealed that this architecture, applied to the bird classi-
fication  task,  resulted  in  good  results  and  thus  we  adopted  this 
straightforward approach. The proposed methodology can be adapted to 
other CNN architectures.

The baseline model comprised a simple CNN architecture that had 
two  convolutional layers (8  filters of  size 16 × 16,  with ReLU activa-
tions), followed by max pooling (4 × 4), a flattening operation, and two 
fully-connected layers (32 ReLU and 22 softmax units respectively) (see 
Fig. 2). Given only a spectrogram input, the baseline model produced a 
probability for each of the 22 species.

Different methods were explored and tested to enhance the neural 
network with contextual information. One straightforward approach to 
incorporate additional information into a deep learning classifier, while 
maintaining  model  simplicity,  is  to  utilize  a  multi-branch  CNN.  As  a 
result, we investigate this approach as the initial method to integrate

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, none of the given contexts directly address the issue of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing the effects of different random seed values. However, I can provide some general strategies used to manage randomness in deep learning models:

1. Fixed Random Seeds: To ensure reproducibility, one common strategy is to set fixed random seeds before running experiments or training models. This ensures that any random processes within the code will produce consistent results across multiple runs.

2. Multiple Runs: Another way to account for randomness is to perform multiple runs of the same experiment with different random seeds. By averaging the performance metrics from these runs, it is possible to get a more robust estimate of the model's true performance.

3. Cross-Validation: Using cross-validation techniques like k-fold cross-validation can help reduce the impact of randomness by ensuring that the entire dataset is utilized during both training and testing phases.

4. Regularization Techniques: Applying regularization techniques such as dropout, weight decay, or early stopping can also help mitigate the effects of randomness by preventing overfitting and improving the model's ability to generalize.

5. Ensemble Methods: Combining multiple models trained with different random seeds through ensemble methods can further improve the overall performance and stability of the final prediction.
