missForest  is  a  Random  Forest-based  algorithm  developed  by 
(Stekhoven and Bühlmann, 2012), which imputes missing values itera-
tively using Random Forests trained on subsets of the dataset. In contrast 
to  the  standard  Random  Forest  methodology,  as  introduced  by  (Brei-
man,  2001),  where  the  focus  is  primarily  on  predictive  modeling  or 
classification tasks, missForest uses the Random Forest algorithm for the 
specific  task  of  imputation.  In  missForest,  each  variable  containing 
missing values is treated as a target variable. For every target variable, a 
dedicated  Random  Forest  model  is  trained,  utilizing  the  remaining 
variables as predictors. This targeted model is then employed to predict 
missing values within subsets of the dataset. This procedure is repeated 
with  the  updated  imputed  missing values  until a  predefined  stopping 
criterion  is  reached  Stekhoven  and  Bühlmann  (2012).  The  iterative

In this paper, the methods used were both intuitive (omitting missing 
values;  mean  imputation)  and  machine-learning-based.  These  proced-
ures and the FIT method are briefly presented below.  

• Control Group 

In the first experiment, the control group consisted of the unmodified 
datasets  of  each  species.  In  the  second  experiment,  we  defined  the 
control  group  as  the  geometric  profile  extracted  by  our  experienced 
operator.

To  further  enhance  the  Footprint  Identification  Technique  (FIT) 
method,  we  recommend  collecting  imperfect  footprints  when  high- 
quality  footprints  are  insufficient  during  field  surveys.  Instead  of  dis-
carding incomplete prints, we advocate using missing value imputation 
as  part  of  the  data  preprocessing  pipeline.  This  approach  preserves 
valuable data and improves the accuracy of FIT predictions when sub- 
quality footprints are included. Our findings are supported by a study 
using  deep  learning  models  to  classify  three  sympatric  otter  species, 
where a model trained on images of all qualities was only marginally 
outperformed  by  a  model  trained  on  high-quality  prints,  highlighting 
the  potential  of  utilizing  lower  quality  data  effectively  Kistner  et  al.

A further limitation when working with footprints is an operator's 
experience and subjectivity for placing the landmark points Alibhai et al. 
(2008).  Although  FIT  has  a  rigorous,  standardized  feature  extraction 
protocol that aims to minimize this operator bias Alibhai et al. (2008), 
we assume some landmarks might still appear clearer to some operators 
than others. Encouraged by the high performance of the best imputation 
methods,  we  argue  that  the  ability  to  skip  unclear  landmarks  might 
further increase the objectivity of FIT. We propose that this should also 
be  further  investigated  when  comparing  the  output  of  different 
operators.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about specific optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam that are applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of deep learning models for classifying three sympatric otter species. Deep learning models often employ optimization algorithms like SGD, Adam, RMSprop, etc., to update their parameters during training. Without explicit mention in the context, one cannot definitively state which optimization technique was utilized in this particular case.
