(s[1],…,s[n]) and the number of observations (m[1],…,m[n]) in the cells. For 
example, e2
[n] represent the minimum and maximum values of the 
squared prediction errors across all grid cells, respectively. The value of 
δ  is set to ensure that 1 (cid:0) δ represents the expected proportion of het-
erogeneous observations. In other words, the REMSPE trims the data of 
observations that have squared residuals with magnitudes in the top 1 (cid:0)
δ, because they are considered to have a high possibility of being het-
erogeneous  observations.  It  may  be  recommended  to  perform  cross- 
validation to obtain the RTMSPE or calculate using a validation data-
set which is independent of the training dataset. Due to computational 
cost of cross-validation, the RTMSPE is calculated using the training data 
in this paper.

Helpful Answer:

Based on the provided context, it appears that the root trimmed mean squared prediction error (RTMSPE) is utilized to select the appropriate values for the tuning parameters τ and ϕ, removing the impact of heterogeneous observations. This suggests that the RTMSPE could potentially serve as a criterion for determining when training is complete. However, it should be noted that the context does not explicitly state that the RTMSPE is used for this purpose.

Additionally, the context mentions that it may be recommended to perform cross-validation to obtain the RTMSPE or calculate using a validation data-set which is independent of the training dataset. This implies that the RTMSPE could also be used in conjunction with cross-validation or validation loss to determine when training is complete.

Furthermore, the context states that due to computational cost of cross-validation, the RTMSPE is calculated using the training data in this paper. This indicates that the authors of the paper did not use cross-validation or validation loss as a criterion for determining when training was complete. Instead, they relied solely on the RTMSPE calculated from the training data.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it cannot be definitively stated what criteria are used to determine when training is complete. However, it can be inferred that the RTMSPE, possibly in combination with cross-validation or validation loss, could potentially serve as such a criterion.
