generalised  model  by  adding  convolution  modules  or  introducing  re-
sidual  connection  techniques.  However,  more  complex  and  deeper 
models  often  incur  higher  computational  costs  and  require  longer 
training  time.  To  solve  these  problems,  the  AlexNet  network  was 
designed to be lightweight and optimised to achieve deep training and 
short-term testing (Zhang et al., 2022). Specifically, the two convolution 
layers are merged in the model deployment mode while ensuring that 
the nonlinear factors caused by the activation function are not reduced. 
By reducing the number of layers in the model, the computational effi-
ciency is improved (Ding et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2017) and the infer-
ence time of the model is significantly shortened.

In  recent  years,  neural  networks  have  significantly  improved  the 
performance of models by increasing the complexity of network struc-
tures. The AlexNet network model proposed by Alex Krizhevsky et al. 
(Krizhevsky et al., 2017) demonstrates that the model depth is crucial 
for  its  performance.  Stacking  the  convolution  layer  and  activating 
function  layers  in  the  model  and  removing  any  intermediate  layers 
resulted in a loss of approximately 2% in the top-level performance of 
the network. In the VGG network, Karen Simonyan et al. (Simonyan and 
Zisserman, 2015) validated the effect of model depth on training per-
formance by stacking convolutional kernels with a size of 3 and training 
them with smaller parameter quantities and multiple scales under the 
same  field  of  view.  Simultaneously,  this  also  opens  up  a  new  idea: 
reducing the memory space occupied by the model while increasing its

In view of this discovery, we re-examined the application strategies 
of deep learning, no longer pursuing model complexity but exploring the 
potential  of  shallow  networks.  Through  meticulous  algorithm  optimi-
sation  and  structural  design,  we  strive  to  maintain  the  model  perfor-
mance while reducing the computational complexity  and deployment 
costs,  achieving  a  balance  between  speed  and  accuracy.  The  specific 
contributions of this study are as follows:  

• We propose a lightweight SIAlex model that utilises AlexNet as the 
backbone,  fully  exploiting  the  performance  of  minimalist  models. 
Ensuring a good balance between speed and accuracy. 

• The  method  of  cascading  multiple  activation  functions  fully  in-
troduces  nonlinear  factors  such  that  the  model  approximates  the 
nonlinear  expression  function  of  the  learning  features  while  also 
improving the gradient propagation.

complexity. This helps solve the problems of model training time and 
computing  resources.  Shazzadul  Islam  et  al.  (Islam  et  al.,  2019)  used 
VGG-16  to  extract  features  from  bird  images  and  then  used  support 
vector machines for classification, achieving an accuracy of 89%. The 
ResNet network (He et al., 2016) optimises the network through residual 
modules by introducing skip connections between the traditional con-
volutional layers. This enables the network to learn and retain low-level 
feature  information  better,  thereby  avoiding  gradient  vanishing  and 
representation bottlenecks. Sankupellay et al. (Sankupellay and Kono-
valov,  2018)  used  ResNet-50  to  automatically  recognise  the  spectro-
grams of 46 bird songs with an accuracy of 60%–72%.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit details about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using diverse datasets, cross-validation, stratified splitting, etc. Instead, it focuses on discussing various aspects related to improving the efficiency and performance of deep learning models like AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet. These improvements include merging convolution layers, reducing the number of layers, stacking convolutional kernels, and utilizing activation functions. Additionally, the text mentions efforts to reduce computational complexity and deployment costs without compromising model performance. Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot offer a precise answer regarding the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
