Looking beyond these data to improve the extensibility of investigations 
on the health of aquatic ecosystems is necessary (Upadhyay and Khan-
delwal,  2019;  Yuan  et  al.,  2017).  Deep  learning  techniques  have  the 
potential to be used to investigate parts of ecosystems. In this study, the 
TDI, BMI, and FAI were calculated using ecological monitoring data, and 
the status of the aquatic ecosystem was determined. Quantitative and 
qualitative  indices  may  constrain  further  applications,  such  as  grade 
prediction of aquatic ecosystem health. However, we demonstrated that 
the CNN model ensemble with an autoencoder is a potential candidate 
for  estimating  aquatic  ecosystem  health  indices  compared  with  the 
original CNN and conventional machine learning models (Table 3). In 
other  words,  deep  learning  methods  can  be  applied  to  water  quality, 
hydraulic, and hydrological data to reflect the quantitative and quali-

sion  trees  with  randomly  selected  input  subsets.  A  random  forest 
regression  model  was  used  to  train  the  water  quality,  hydraulic,  and 
hydrological  inputs  for  estimating  TDI,  BMI,  and  FAI.  The  hyper-
parameters of the RF were set to the number of estimators at 100 and the 
random state at 0. XGBoost is a scalable implementation of tree boost-
ing. This model was built to analyze variations in health indices. We set 
the XGBoost model in which the object was a regression, the subsample 
ratio of the columns when constructing each was 0.3, the learning rate 
was 0.1, the maximum depth of a tree was 30, the alpha was 10, and the 
number  of  estimators  was  100.  The  detailed  principles  of  the  afore-
mentioned machine-learning models are referred to in ANN (Hopfield, 
1988),  SVM  (Hearst  et  al.,  1998),  RF  (Breiman,  2001),  and  XGBoost 
(Chen and Guestrin, 2016).

This  study  used  evaluation  metrics  to  estimate  aquatic  ecosystem 
health  indices  (Moriasi  et  al.,  2007).  The  Nashâ€“Sutcliffe  efficiency 
(NSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and percentage bias (PBIAS) 
were  used  to  measure  the  accuracy  of  the  performance  of  the  deep 
learning  models, including the  CNN model and  CNN with an  autoen-
coder, and conventional machine learning models with ANN, SVM, RF, 
and  XGBoost  for  estimating  TDI,  BMI,  and  FAI  values.  The  NSE  is  a 
commonly  used  score  in  hydrological  and  environmental  models  and 
measures the relative magnitude of the residual variance, indicating the 
degree  of  1:1  line  fitness  of  the  observed  versus  estimated  data  plot 
(Moriasi  et  al.,  2007;  Nash  and  Sutcliffe,  1970).  NSE  ranges  from 
negative infinity to 1, and the mean observed value is used as a refer-
ence.  In  other  words,  an  NSE  below  zero  implies  that  the  estimation

The data-driven approach offers the advantage of being applicable to 
systems  without  prior  knowledge  and  requires  less  time  for  model 
construction and computation while providing robust predictive capa-
bilities  (Altunkaynak and Wang, 2011). Moreover, this approach effi-
ciently extracts the quantitative and qualitative features of ecologically 
induced  data.  Go  et  al.  (2019)  applied  a  random  forest  algorithm  to 
estimate BMI. Kang et al. (2022) estimated FAI using an artificial neural 
network.  In  particular,  deep  neural  networks  have  shown  substantial 
capability to learn dynamic information for processing complex data-
sets. An autoencoder is a deep-learning algorithm that conducts mani-
fold learning by extracting the nonlinear features of enriched data using 
encoding  and  decoding  mechanisms  (Charte  et  al.,  2018;  Tirumala, 
2022).  In  addition,  the  effective  dimensionality reduction  of  complex

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, there isn't any explicit mention or discussion about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, specifically regarding random seed values. However, some general strategies can be mentioned based on common practices in the field.

Randomness in deep learning pipelines often arises due to factors like weight initialization, batch selection during training, dropout regularization, etc. To manage this randomness and ensure reproducible results, one strategy is setting a fixed random seed value. By doing so, the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers will be generated across different runs, leading to consistent results.

Moreover, it's essential to understand that fixing the random seed might not always be desirable, especially when evaluating the model's performance under various conditions. In such cases, running multiple experiments with different random seeds and averaging the results could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the model's behavior.

Lastly, employing deterministic algorithms wherever possible can also help reduce randomness in the deep learning pipeline. For instance, using a deterministic optimizer instead of stochastic gradient descent can eliminate some sources of randomness.
