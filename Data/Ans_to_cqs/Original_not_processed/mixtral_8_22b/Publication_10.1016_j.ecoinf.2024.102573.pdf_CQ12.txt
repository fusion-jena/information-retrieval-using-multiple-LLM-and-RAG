Recent years have seen impressive progress in bird species recogni-
tion and related tasks (Stowell, 2022; Xie et al., 2023). It was foreseeable 
that  deep  learning  would  emerge  as  the  most  successful  method  for 
large-scale  bioacoustics  analysis  (Kahl  et  al.,  2021;  Stowell,  2022; 
Stowell et al., 2019; Tang et al., 2023; Xie et al., 2023; Zsebok et al., 
2019). The main advantage of neural networks is to avoid many brittle 
and  difficult  choices  in  designing  manual  features  for  the  underlying 
task. For example, Xie et al. (Xie and Zhu, 2019) compared three types of 
features  for  bird  species  classification  consisting  of  hand-crafted 
acoustic features, including features from Mel Frequency Cepstral Co-
efficient (MFCC), visual features extracted from the Constant-Q Trans-
form (CQT) time-frequency representation, and training a convolutional 
network directly on the CQT. They also tested the fusion of classifiers

trained on these features and found a slight performance improvement. 
However, training a neural network directly on the CQT was, by far, the 
best  choice  among  the  features.  The  other  successful  contemporary 
works  have  explored  various types  of neural networks as  species rec-
ognizers by leveraging Short-Time Fourier-Transform (henceforth STFT 
or  spectrogram)  (Kahl  et  al.,  2021)  and  its  relatives,  such  as  mel- 
filterbanks  applied  on  STFT  (henceforth  mel-spectrogram)  (Zhang 
et al., 2019) and MFCC (Tang et al., 2023) as input feature.

This  experiment  used  both  learnable  frontends  with  80  filters  of 
length  512  (16 ms)  that were  initialized  by  mel-filterbanks.  Gaussian 
pooling  was  removed,  and  downsampling  happened  in  the  filtering 
convolution layer by a stride of 320 (10 ms). Then, the outputs were log- 
compressed  without  normalization.  These  plain  frontends  are  called 
LEAF-P and SincNet-P, and Table 4 shows their test results.

It  seems  to  require  an  exhaustive  knowledge  of  each  species’  fre-
quency  niche  to  create  optimal  individualized  features.  Yet,  the  most 
celebrated capability of deep neural networks is automatic and task(s)- 
relevant feature extraction while doing the classification task(s) jointly, 
which  has  led  to  unprecedented  achievements  (LeCun  et  al.,  2015). 
Hence, one could ask whether to consider a time-frequency represen-
tation or the waveform as raw input to neural networks to capture all the 
relevant information from bird vocalization. Although the former is the 
prevalent  approach,  data  processing  inequality  indicates  that  post- 
processing can not increase a signal’s information (Beaudry and Ren-
ner,  2011).  Therefore,  the  waveform  is  a  promising  alternative  to 
traditional features derived from it when leveraging neural networks.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly state which specific type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline. However, it mentions that convolutional networks were trained directly on the CQT, suggesting the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Additionally, the text discusses the exploration of various types of neural networks using Short-Time Fourier-Transform (STFT) and its relatives, such as mel-filterbanks applied on STFT (mel-spectrogram) and MFCC, further implying the utilization of CNNs. Furthermore, the mention of LEAF-P and SincNet-P as learnable frontends suggests the application of custom or modified versions of existing models, possibly based on CNN architectures. In summary, although the exact type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not specified, there are strong indications that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) play a significant role in the process.
