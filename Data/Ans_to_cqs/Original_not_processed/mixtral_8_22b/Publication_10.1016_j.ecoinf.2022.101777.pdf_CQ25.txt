Images were then classified out via Random Forest (RF). This is a 
specific  machine  learning  technique  based  on  the  iterative,  random 
creation  of  decision  trees.  First,  the  input  features  and  classes  were 
defined. RF calculates several random decision trees based on (1) the 
number of training samples and (2) the number of trees. The more trees 
there are, the more accurate the model is, but the longer the calculation 
time is. RF creates several decision trees randomly using the Gini coef-
ficient to split them. A model based on the decision trees is thus created 
and used to classify all the pixels. A pixel is classified according to the 
majority vote of the decision trees. The number of training samples was 
5000 and the number of trees was 500.

racy assessment requires these parameters to calculate the total number of 
training samples required for the image classified using Eq. 1.

Acquiring large-scale training data to train the RF classifier in the 
classification  of  complex  regions  with  a  great  many  categories  is  a 
laborious  task  that  requires  hours  of  processing.  Thus,  in  the  present 
study we assumed that training samples should represent approximately 
0.25% of the total study area used by the RF classifier for large-scale 
classification  (Colditz,  2015;  Deng  and  Wu,  2013;  Du  et  al.,  2015). 
Once these errors in classification have been identified, it is useful to 
carry out work with more training areas that include this category of 
“new  vineyard”,  since  its  spectral signature  after 5 years of  growth is 
totally different from what it looks like in the year of planting. Consid-
ering the study area and the strong influence of the wine sector in it, this 
is an issue that can be improved in future studies.

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is not explicitly stated as being a 'deep learning' model, but rather a 'Random Forest' (RF) model, which is a type of machine learning algorithm. However, considering the overall context, the primary goal of this model appears to be image classification. More specifically, the RF model is employed to classify pixels within images into various categories or classes. This process involves creating multiple decision trees randomly using the Gini coefficient to split them, resulting in a model capable of classifying each pixel based on majority voting among the decision trees. In this case, the model aims to distinguish between different land cover types, including new vineyards, whose spectral signatures change significantly over time due to growth. Therefore, the main objective of this model is to accurately classify and identify specific land cover types within the study area.
