tion and Transformer, effectively extracts richer semantic features (Xie 
et al., 2024). A network based on CNN and ViT modules classified mi-
croorganisms with an accuracy of 67.62% (Dwivedi et al., 2024).

The proposed classification network in this paper demonstrates su-
perior performance on the dataset, as indicated by the results presented 
in Table 3. In each classification network, the accuracy for the “medium” 
is consistently higher than that for the “small”. Besides, the experimental 
data in Table 3 also indicates that the classification network proposed 
achieves the highest classification accuracy among the “medium”  and 
“small”.  In  our  proposed  model,  the  classification  accuracy  for  both 
“medium”  and “small”  is improved by 3.56% and 2.93% respectively, 
compared to the ResNet50 and ViT. Additionally, the classification ac-
curacy for the “medium” is 5.6% higher compare with the “small” in the 
CA-Hybrid network.

The experimental results presented in Table 2 and Table 3 illustrate 
the enhancement in classification accuracy achieved by incorporating 
CAM into the residual network. Regardless of “medium”  or “small”  or 
the entire dataset, the best classification results are achieved using the 
CA-Hybrid  network.  Notably,  the  experimental  results  demonstrate  a 
positive correlation between image size and classification performance. 
Specifically, larger image tend to yield better classification outcomes.

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some common methods include stratified splitting, which ensures that different subsets maintain the same proportions of class labels; oversampling, where minority classes are duplicated to balance the dataset; undersampling, where majority classes are reduced to achieve balance; and diverse data collection, which aims to gather more representative samples from underrepresented groups. These techniques can help mitigate data bias and improve the overall performance of deep learning models.

Based on the given context, it appears that the authors have focused on developing a hybrid convolutional neural network (CNN) and vision transformer (ViT) architecture called CA-Hybrid for microorganism classification. They claim that their proposed model outperforms other networks such as ResNet50 and ViT in terms of classification accuracy. To enhance the performance further, they incorporated Class Activation Mapping (CAM) into the residual network, allowing the network to focus on important regions within images. This resulted in improved classification accuracy across all categories ("medium" and "small").

However, there is no mention of any specific techniques employed to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide detailed information regarding the use of stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection in this particular study.
