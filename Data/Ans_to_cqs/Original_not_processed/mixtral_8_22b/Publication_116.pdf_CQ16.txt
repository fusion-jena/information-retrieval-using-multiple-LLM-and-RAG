IV. EXPERIMENTS

A. Hand-crafted Feature Extraction Experiment

1) Biased Dataset: This dataset was created by randomly
taking 70% of the data in D for training and 30% for
testing. These are really approximate percentages because such
distribution has to be attempted for each species in dataset D.
How close to a 70%-30% distribution is achieved depends
on how many photos per species there are in dataset D. For
example, if a given species X has 20 photos, 14 randomly
chosen photos will go to the training dataset and 6 to the
testing dataset. However, if the number of photos for species
X is 2, one will go to the training dataset and the other one to
the testing dataset, resulting in a 50%-50% distribution. This
is the approach most of previous plant identiﬁcation studies
have followed (particularly those based on leaf-scans).

Throughout this paper, we use the term Same-Specimen-
Picture Bias (SSPB) to refer to a particular characteristic of
the datasets used for the training phase and the testing phase
of a supervised learning experiment with a global dataset D.
We say that SSPB is avoided (absent) if all plant images from
dataset D are distributed so that, for each specimen S all its
images are used exclusively in the training phase or in the
testing phase. Otherwise, we say SSPB is (potentially) present.

It

is critical

this point

to understand at

in those experiments SSPB was present. Because that dataset
is fully included in our dataset D and we are using the same
hand-crafted feature extraction algorithm, our ﬁrst experiment,
as described in the following section, allows us to assess the
scalability of the accuracy results when going from dataset
with 66 species to an extended dataset with 255 species.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. Typically, machine learning models use various metrics like validation loss, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., to evaluate model performance during training. A common criterion for stopping training is when the validation loss plateaus, indicating that the model has learned as much as it can from the training data without overfitting. However, since the context does not explicitly mention these details, I cannot provide a definitive answer.
