This research utilizes six organoleptic parameters and applies them 
to seven fish species, serving as the standard for automatically classi-
fying fish freshness. The dataset, generated over 11 days, is employed in 
machine learning experiments. In the clustering process, we exclusively 
consider Euclidean distance as a metric, given the uniform data range. 
However, alternative distance metrics have not been explored, poten-
tially  influencing  the  quality  of  freshness  class  determination.  Future 
research possibilities may involve investigating the impact of different 
distance metrics on class groups. Each distance possesses distinct char-
acteristics,  leading  to  varied  cluster  patterns.  Additionally,  extending 
this work to include other fish species could provide a more compre-
hensive understanding.

2.1. Framework research 

We have developed an automatic standardization of fish freshness 
classes with a clustering approach, considering that each fish species has 
a distinct freshness profile. Therefore, the standard of freshness classes 
varies accordingly. 

The number of days in each freshness class also varies according to 
the freshness defense. In this study, we refer to the framework presented 
in Fig. 1. The stages are described in the following subsection. 

2.2. Step 1: Selecting fish samples

value of fish is rated on a scale from 1 to 9, where 9 indicates the best 
freshness quality, and1 denotes the worst. For instance, the best fresh-
ness  quality of the  eye is  characterized by convexity, clear  and shiny 
cornea and pupil, specific for fish species. The lowest quality is char-
acterized  by  a  very  concave  appearance,  a  very  cloudy  cornea,  gray 
pupils, and a lack of shine. The examination process involves observing 
the eyes, clear observation of the removed gills, confirming body mucus 
by touching the skin surface, dissecting the body to observe the meat, 
inhaling gases emitted by the body of the fish, and touching the meat 
surface to assess its texture (Fig. 2(c)-2(d)). Fish that have undergone

Helpful Answer:
Based on the provided context, it appears that the research primarily focuses on using machine learning techniques, specifically clustering methods, rather than deep learning models. However, I can still address the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of their findings.

Firstly, the researchers used a diverse dataset consisting of seven fish species, which helps improve the applicability of their results across various types of fish. This diversity in the dataset contributes to the generalizability of the proposed methodology.

Secondly, although the text does not explicitly mention cross-validation or stratified splitting, it discusses generating a dataset over 11 days. This timeframe suggests that the researchers collected data points throughout multiple stages of fish decay, capturing varying levels of freshness. By doing so, they likely aimed to create a comprehensive dataset that covers a wide range of possible scenarios, further enhancing the robustness and generalizability of their model.

Lastly, while the authors do not directly discuss employing cross-validation or stratified splitting techniques, these methods are commonly used in machine learning studies to evaluate model performance and prevent overfitting. Given that the paper presents a machine learning experiment, it is reasonable to assume that such practices might have been implemented during the development and evaluation phases of the model. Nevertheless, without explicit confirmation in the provided context, this point remains speculative.
