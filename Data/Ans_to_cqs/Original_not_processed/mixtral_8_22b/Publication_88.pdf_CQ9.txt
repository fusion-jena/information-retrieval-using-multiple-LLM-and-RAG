The EF network architecture consisted of three convolutional layers (Conv) including the
Rectiﬁed Linear Unit (ReLU), two Max-pooling layers (MaxPool), and two Fully Connected layers
(FC), with a softmax layer at the end with two outputs, corresponding to “deforestation” and
“no-deforestation” classes. The ﬁlter and output size of each layer are summarized in Table 3.

2.7. Accuracy Assessment

The performance of the evaluated methods was expressed in terms of Overall Accuracy (OA),

F1-Score, and Alarm Area (AA).

Overall Accuracy (OA): is a global metric that indicates the percentage of samples correctly
classiﬁed in relation to the total samples. It is deﬁned by:

OA =

tp + tn
P + N

1. Introduction

For training the EF and SN models, we selected the following setup empirically: batch size equal
to 32 with 100 number of epochs, early stopping after 10 epochs with no improvement (over the
validation set) and a dropout rate of 0.2 in the ﬁnal FC layer. Additionally, Adam optimizer was
selected empirically with weight decay equal to 0.9 and learning rate equal to 10−3. As loss function,
we used the binary cross-entropy.
