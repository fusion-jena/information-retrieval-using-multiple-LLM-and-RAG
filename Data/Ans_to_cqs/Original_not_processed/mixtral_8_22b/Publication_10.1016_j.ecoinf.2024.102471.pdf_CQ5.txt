4.3. Baseline models 

Hybrid  CNN-LSTM  is  an  architecture  that  combines  the  temporal 
modelling ability of the LSTM with the CNN ability to learn invariant 
features  (Ayadi  and  Lachiri,  2022)  (Yadav  and  Vishwakarma,  2020) 
(Ashraf  et  al.,  2023).  The  combination  of  Convolutional  Neural  Net-
works  (CNN)  and  Long  Short-Term  Memory  (LSTM)  has  the  major 
benefit of learning spatial and temporal data. CNN excels in extracting 
spatial elements like edges, textures, and forms from an input. Mean-
while,  an  LSTM  excels  in  extracting  temporal  data,  like  the  order  of 
words in a phrase or frames in a movie. By combining the two, a model

The  motivation  comes  from  success  of  transformer  in  natural  lan-
guage processing (NLP) is the reason for evolution of advanced archi-
tecture called vision transformer. In (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) proposed 
work, the attention mechanism is focused as network's core component 
for capturing long-range relationship among complex structure of image 
data.  The  vision  transformer  processes  each  input  image  as  patches 
where they are treated as tokens by NLP model. Then the model pro-
cessed the tokens to learn more about the visual representation of the 
input. Hence, in comparison to CNN techniques, transformer-based re-
sults  demonstrated  state-of-the-art  performance  by  processing  more 
deep features in limited computational resources. Subsequently, vision 
transformer is applied along with hyper-head attention mechanism for 
bird  sound  recognition  (Tang  et  al.,  2023).  In  this  work,  author  has

through  the  Mel  spectrogram.  However,  CNN-based  architectures  are 
useful for image-related tasks but unsuitable for audio domains. Several 
studies have been conducted using pre-trained models like transformers, 
where  the  multi-label  classification  work  is  performed  well  across 
various applications (G´omez-G´omez et al., 2023).

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in the deep learning pipelines discussed. However, one dataset mentioned is related to bird species identification based on their vocalizations or calls. This dataset consists of recordings of 14 different bird species collected by the Central Poultry Development Organization (CPDO) in Bhubaneswar, India, using a digital recorder and a unidirectional microphone. The dataset was processed through the Mel spectrogram. It should be noted that while CNN-based architectures are useful for image-related tasks, they may not be suitable for audio domains. Additionally, several studies have utilized pre-trained models like transformers for multi-label classification tasks across various applications.
