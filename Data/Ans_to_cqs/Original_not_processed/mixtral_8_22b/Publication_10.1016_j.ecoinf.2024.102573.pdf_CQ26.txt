datasets.  They  are  not  flexible  enough  to  address  current  open  chal-
lenges unless used purposefully on a narrow task.

This  experiment  used  both  learnable  frontends  with  80  filters  of 
length  512  (16 ms)  that were  initialized  by  mel-filterbanks.  Gaussian 
pooling  was  removed,  and  downsampling  happened  in  the  filtering 
convolution layer by a stride of 320 (10 ms). Then, the outputs were log- 
compressed  without  normalization.  These  plain  frontends  are  called 
LEAF-P and SincNet-P, and Table 4 shows their test results.

3.3. Noise tolerance 

Large  neural  networks  can  handle  minor  variations  in  the  input 
caused by different compression schemes (Sainath et al., 2015). Thus, 
changing  the  range  and  scale  of  the  inputs  is  unlikely  to  make  a 
noticeable difference. Yet, it is readily evident in Table 2 that combining 
the compression with normalization is significantly better regardless of 
the frontend, whether through PCEN or conventional methods. 

Lostanlen  et  al.  (2018)  showed  that  PCEN  whitens  the  data  by 
Gaussianizing the magnitudes and decorrelating the frequency bands. 
Thus, it alleviates stationary background noise. The following analyses 
confirm  this  result  for  species  recognition  from  outdoor  recordings. 
Furthermore,  it  shows  that  other  combinations  of  compression  and 
normalization will also suppress noise.

The (mel-)spectrogram combined with log compression results in a 
static audio frontend. At a high level, a learnable frontend has similar 
components  with  additional  flexibility  to  adapt  to  the  datasetâ€™s  char-
acteristics.  The  usual  design  has  a  convolution  layer  with  specialized 
kernels to capture distinct frequency contents, an activation function, a 
pooling to downsample, and a compression layer, as depicted in Fig. 1. 
LEAF increased the flexibility of the frontend by making the pooling 
and  compression  layers  learnable.  It  substitutes  the  commonly  used 
mean or max pooling by low-pass filtering using Gaussian kernels with 
learnable spreads for each frequency band. The downsampling happens 
by strided convolution during low-pass filtering, where the stride size is 
equivalent to the hop size in STFT. Furthermore, it leverages learnable 
PCEN (Wang et al., 2017) for both compression and normalization.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection being employed to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some relevant information regarding data processing and handling can be found.

In the context, we see that LEAF (Learnable Audio Frontend) is introduced as a more flexible approach compared to traditional static audio frontends like spectrograms. This flexibility allows LEAF to adapt to the characteristics of the dataset. One way LEAF achieves this adaptation is by employing learnable Gaussian pooling instead of mean or max pooling. This learnable pooling uses Gaussian kernels with adjustable spreads for each frequency band, which helps tailor the model to the unique features of the dataset.

Additionally, LEAF utilizes learnable PCEN (Power Compressed Exponential Normalization), which serves as both a compression and normalization method. By applying these techniques, LEAF aims to reduce the impact of stationary background noise and improve overall performance.

While these approaches do not directly correspond to the mentioned techniques for addressing data bias, they demonstrate efforts towards customizing the model to suit the dataset's properties and mitigate potential issues arising from noisy or biased data.
