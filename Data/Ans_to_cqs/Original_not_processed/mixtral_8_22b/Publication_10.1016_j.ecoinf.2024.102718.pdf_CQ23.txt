transformer architecture in vision tasks, and Xception (Chollet, 2017)
for its depthwise separable convolutions that enhance model perfor-
mance and efficiency. Therefore, we employed our BEiT model to
leverage transformer capabilities with these existing models. This
combination ensures effective and complementary strengths for our
purpose. Furthermore, we add the LIME explainable technique to
enhance the interpretability of our model’s decision-making process

For our research reproducibility in Algorithm 1, the definitions
include T and ℰ, denoting the paths to the training and testing dataset
directories, respectively. The functions Dtrain and Dtest represent data
generators for training and testing datasets, where parameters such as α,
β, γ, and δ control aspects like rescaling and augmentation. The batch
size for training and testing is denoted by B, while Gtrain and Gtest
represent the respective data generators. The class weights computed for
addressing class imbalance are denoted by wc, and M stands for our
proposed model, encompassing its architecture and compilation pa-
rameters. The number of training epochs is represented by n, and P and
Q denote the steps per epoch for training and validation, respectively.
Predicted outputs and their class labels from the model are represented
by ̂y and ̂yc, while ytrue signifies the true class labels from the testing
dataset. In our model reproducibility in the testing phase in Algorithm 2,

Initially, we assess our modified BEiT model’s performance against
existing deep learning and base ViT models under both noise-added and
noise-free situations. The results obtained from the PlantVillage are
presented dataset in Tables 6 and 7, The results reveal that the proposed
BEiT (12 M) achieves an outstanding accuracy of 97.33% with the least
loss. It outperforms in AUC, CK, precision, recall, and F1 scores in both
noisy and noiseless conditions. Similarly, the Dhan-Shomadhan dataset
in Tables 8 and 9, the low parameterized BEiT (12 M) model maintains
its lead he highest accuracy (96.22% and 97.50%) and least loss (0.131
and 0.121). It achieves reliable metrics in AUC (0.962), CK (0.88),
precision (0.97), recall (0.96), and F1 score (0.96). Other models also
perform well but continually fall below BEiT (12 M)’s specifications
across both noisy and noiseless situations. These results underline BEiT
(12 M)’s better performance and reliability in leaf disease classification

Helpful Answer:
The authors have not explicitly mentioned any specific techniques used to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model. However, they did use two different datasets - the PlantVillage dataset and the Dhan-Shomadhan dataset - which can be considered diverse datasets. They evaluated their proposed BEiT (12 M) model on both datasets and presented the results separately. Additionally, they compared their proposed model with other existing deep learning and base ViT models using both noise-added and noise-free situations. By doing so, they demonstrated the robustness and adaptability of their model across various scenarios. Although it cannot be confirmed without explicit mention, one could infer that some form of cross-validation might have been implemented due to the nature of the experiments conducted. Nevertheless, further details regarding stratified splitting or other specific methods to ensure generalizability are not available within the provided context.
