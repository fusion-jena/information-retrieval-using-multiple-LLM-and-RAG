cases with nonlinear relationships. For their part, SVR and GP are slow 
to train and scale greatly with increasing amounts of data. Decision trees 
tend to perform worse than other models. KNN can be sensitive to noisy 
data and outliers, and since it needs to store the data in memory, it can 
be computationally expensive with large amounts of data. And XGBoost 
and  Random  Forest  can  be  prone  to  overfitting  depending  on  the  se-
lection of their hyperparameters.

XGB  optimises  predictive  modelling  through  gradient  boosting  and 
regularisation (Chen and Guestrin, 2016). SVR uses kernel functions to 
efficiently handle non-linear data by fitting the best hyperplane within a 
pre-defined  error  margin  (Hsu  et  al.,  2003).  MLP  is  a  feed-forward 
neural network that learns complex patterns using adjustable weights 
and activation functions (Kingma and Ba, 2014).

%Query
Query: "Which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The paper does not provide information about which specific framework was used to build the deep learning model. Therefore, it cannot be determined if TensorFlow, PyTorch or any other framework was utilized.
