Query: "Where is the data repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information regarding the specific data repository of the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context is not explicitly stated or referenced. Therefore, it cannot be determined from the provided context where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It could potentially be found on platforms such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF, but without further information, we cannot confirm its location.
