time variable, and kNDVIj represents the maximum kNDVI value in the 
jth  year.  A  positive  slope  denotes  a  vegetation  improvement  trend 
(kNDVI greening), while a negative slope indicates a degradation trend 
in  vegetation  (kNDVI  browning).  The  significance  of  the  trends  was 
evaluated using the F test. Following the criteria outlined in Table 3 and 
derived from prior studies(Lai et al., 2023; Ren et al., 2023b), the kNDVI 
trends were categorized into four types.

Slope < 0&P > 0.05 
Slope > 0&P > 0.05 
Slope > 0&P < 0.05
