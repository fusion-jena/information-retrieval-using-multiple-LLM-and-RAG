several  times  higher  than  those  of  other  operations  (Li  et  al.,  2018). 
Therefore,  reducing  memory  access  is  the  key  to  further  enhancing 
model  performance.  By  reconfiguring  the  computation  sequence  of 
‘convolutional layer + batch normalisation + activation layer on NVI-
DIA TESLA V100 GPUs, Wang et al. (2019) reduced memory access by 
33%,  22%,  and  31%  for  the  ResNet-50,  Inception  V3,  and  DenseNet 
models,  respectively,  leading  to  increases  in  the  computational  effi-
ciency  of  20.5%,  18.5%,  and  18.1%.  Lowering  the  memory  access  in 
models can accelerate operations across the three main layers of CNNs, 
thus fully harnessing the model's strengths and more effectively utilising 
the computational resources provided by the embedded devices (Gilan 
et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2015). Therefore, by reducing the number of 
layers  in  the  network  model,  the  number  of  convolutions  and  data

modules depicted in Fig. 2 in Section 2.2. (2) The implementation of 
DWConv  (Chollet,  2017)  supersedes  the  standard  two-dimensional 
convolution  within  the  bottleneck  architecture,  diminishing  the 
parameter count and computational complexity while preserving com-
parable performance, thereby rendering the network more streamlined 
and efficient. To validate the efficacy of incorporating DWConv into the 
C1  module  bottleneck,  we  devised  the  DWC1  module  and  performed 
four distinct ablation experiments. (3) The SimAM attention mechanism 
(Yang et al., 2021) was integrated into layers 12 and 18 of the network, 
enabling the acquisition of enhanced target detail information and the 
suppression of irrelevant feature data, thereby accentuating the crucial 
characteristic details of fish to augment the precision of the model. To 
substantiate  the  efficacy  and  benefits  of  the  SimAM  mechanism,  five

(n), small (s), medium (m), large (l), and extra-large (x). These scales 
meet the requirements of various scenarios and tasks. As scale increases, 
so does the network depth and width of the model; therefore, ‘n’  rep-
resents the smallest and fastest scale, whereas ‘x’ is the largest and offers 
the  highest  accuracy.  Although  the  accuracy  improves  as  the  model 
depth increases, this also leads to changes in the number of parameters, 
amount  of  computation,  and  detection  speed,  with  correspondingly 
higher demands on the hardware configuration. To delve deeper into the 
underlying causes of enhancing model lightweight and inference speed, 
we utilised LigObNet, YOLOv5, YOLOv6, YOLOv7, and YOLOv8 to train 
across  four  scales:  n,  s,  m,  and  l.  As  Fig.  9  illustrates,  reducing  the 
number  of  parameters  in  the  various  models  does  not  enhance  the 
processing speed. The total parameter count, representing the combined

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information about the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, translation, and color space transformations. These techniques help increase the size and diversity of training datasets, improve model generalization, and prevent overfitting. It is important to note that the choice of data augmentation technique depends on the nature of the problem and dataset being addressed.
