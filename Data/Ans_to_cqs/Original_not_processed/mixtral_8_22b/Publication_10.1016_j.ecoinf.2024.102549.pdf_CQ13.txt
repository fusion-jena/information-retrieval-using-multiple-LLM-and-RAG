over,  categorizing  research  findings  based  on  the  timing  of  policy  or 
management  interventions  could  elucidate  the  evolving  factors  and 
patterns  influencing  algal  blooms  over  different  periods,  fostering  a 
deeper comprehension of water quality and algal bloom dynamics. Such 
insights are crucial for developing targeted strategies for the prevention 
and management of algal blooms.

the study area is shown in Fig. 5. The CNN structure, depicted in Fig. 3, 
comprises five convolutional layers, one pooling layer; three fully con-

Class II, and Class III. To enhance model reliability, a dropout function 
was incorporated between the fully connected layers. Parameters were 
set with a kernel size of 3, stride of 1, and a dropout rate of 50% post the 
fully connected layer. The training was conducted over 500 epochs with

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The deep learning model described uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. The specific hyperparameters mentioned include a kernel size of 3, a stride of 1, and a dropout rate of 50%. The training process involved an initial learning rate of 10, which was halved every 20 rounds to optimize performance. Additionally, the momentum was set at 0.9. However, the exact optimizer used is not explicitly stated in the provided context.
