Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it appears there isn't any explicit mention of specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, some common methods used for ensuring the generalizability of such models include using diverse datasets, cross-validation, stratified splitting, or other techniques like regularization, early stopping, etc. Without further details about the methodology employed in developing the deep learning model, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding which specific measures were taken to ensure its generalizability.
