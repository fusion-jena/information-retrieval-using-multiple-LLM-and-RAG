Modeling  was  performed  by  generating  1000  random  pseudo- 
absence points and splitting the collected data into training (80%) and 
testing (20%) datasets (Huang et al., 2023; Pant et al., 2021; Salinas- 
Ramos et al., 2021). To avoid sampling bias, pseudo-absence points were 
generated  three  times  for  each  model  and  cross-validated  per  model 
using bootstrapping (Carvalho et al., 2021). We evaluated and compared 
the performance and accuracy of each model using AUC (area under the 
receiver operating curve) and TSS (true skill statistic) (Araújo and New, 
2007).  True  skill  statistics  value  changes  between  (cid:0) 1  and  + 1,  with 
positive values indicating a perfect fit, while AUC values range from 0.5 
to 1, with higher values indicating improved accuracy and predictive 
power (Fielding and Bell, 1997).

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, it mentions that the collected data was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) datasets, which suggests that some form of evaluation or validation process was employed during the modeling phase. Commonly used criteria to determine when training is complete include reaching a certain number of epochs, achieving a desired level of accuracy, or observing a plateau in the validation loss. In this case, since the models were evaluated based on their performance and accuracy using metrics such as AUC and TSS, it can be inferred that these metrics might have been used to assess the completion of training. Nevertheless, without more detailed information about the training process, it is not possible to definitively state what criteria were used to determine when training was complete.
