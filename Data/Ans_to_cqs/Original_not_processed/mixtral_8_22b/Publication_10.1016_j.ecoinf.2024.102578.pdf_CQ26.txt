shown to reduce the processing time of image classification load by as 
much as 5× to 13× depending on the tasks (Fennell et al., 2022; Henrich

We  used  the  keras  image_data_generator  function  for  image 
augmentation,  which  included  random  assignment  of  the  following: 
◦
rotation 0–40
, width and height shift range of 20%, shear range 0–0.2 
rad, zoom range 0–0.2 scalar range, a horizontal flip and a fill mode with 
the nearest pixel. 

We  trained  and  validated  the  image  quality  classifier  on  a  laptop 
(MacBook  Pro,  M1  Pro  8-core  central  processing  unit  (CPU),  14-core 
graphics  processing  unit  (GPU),  16GB  RAM),  using  the  GPU  rather 
than CPU for data processing. GPUs are optimized for complex imaging 
tasks and, in our case, outperform CPUs by ~7×.

2. Workflow 

The multi-step, semi-automated workflow proposed here (Fig. 1) is 
adapted from B¨ohner et al., 2023, including pre-processing of images, 
model  training,  classification,  manual  quality  checks,  and  final  data 
formatting. Specifically, we build on the results of Rigoudy et al. (2022) 
and  Fennell  et  al.  (2022),  who  combined  MegaDetector  with  manual 
classification and custom-trained models. The workflow consists of the 
following two classification steps in addition to pre-processing of images 
and  final  manual  inspection,  quality  control,  and  data  formatting 
(Fig. 1).

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it does discuss some aspects related to data augmentation and model training.

For instance, the authors use the Keras image\_data\_generator function for image augmentation, which includes random assignments like rotation, width and height shifts, shearing, zooming, flipping, and filling modes. This technique can help improve the diversity of the dataset and potentially mitigate biases caused by limited data variability.

Additionally, the paper mentions building upon previous works that combine MegaDetector with manual classification and custom-trained models. While this doesn't directly relate to addressing data bias, it suggests that multiple approaches might be integrated into their methodology to enhance overall performance.

However, without further information regarding the dataset characteristics, potential imbalances, or other sources of bias, it remains unclear whether these methods specifically target data bias reduction. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, I cannot definitively state what techniques are employed to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
