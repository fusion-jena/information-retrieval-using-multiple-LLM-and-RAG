higher  MS is needed to better capture the index response to wildfire. 
Compared to the default parameters, the overall accuracy and kappa of 
optimized  parameters  can  improve  by  up  to  8.4%  and  36.8%, 
respectively.

Model Proportion for best fitting. Runge et al. (2022) optimized the LTR

parameters (Figs. A2–A4 and Fig. 4). Among these, the kappa coefficient 
is  selected  to  comprehensively  evaluate  the  detection  accuracy  for 
different  indices  and  parameter  sets.  Although  overall  accuracy  can 
quantify  the  absolute  accuracy  of  detection,  it  is  not  well-suited  for 
evaluating  the  performance  of  various  indices  for  LTR,  which  uses  a 
binary classification system of ‘burned’ and ‘unburned’ values. As can be 
seen from Figs. A2 and A3, the user's accuracy is always higher than the 
producer's  accuracy  for  any  study  area  and  indices  with  the  same 
parameter setting. That means LTR tends to have a larger omission error 
than commission error. In other words, unburned pixels are less likely to 
be mistakenly identified as burned. In most cases, although the LTR does 
not  effectively  identify  the  burned  pixels,  the  overall  accuracy  still 
maintains at a high level because the unburned pixels can be accurately

climate and vegetation cover conditions. By selecting the most appro-
priate  index  for  a  given  region,  the  LTR  algorithm  can  provide  more 
accurate results that are meaningful in the context of the specific climate 
conditions of that region.

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), or others. However, it discusses the optimization of LandTrendr (LTR) parameters using figures A2-A4 and Figure 4 in Runge et al. (2022). This optimization process aims to improve the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of the model, leading to better capturing of the index response to wildfires. The text also mentions that the Kappa coefficient is chosen to assess the detection accuracy for different indices and parameter sets. It further explains that the User's Accuracy is generally higher than Producer's Accuracy, indicating that LTR has a tendency towards larger omission errors compared to commission errors. Lastly, the context emphasizes the importance of selecting appropriate indices based on regional climate and vegetation cover conditions to achieve accurate results relevant to those regions.
