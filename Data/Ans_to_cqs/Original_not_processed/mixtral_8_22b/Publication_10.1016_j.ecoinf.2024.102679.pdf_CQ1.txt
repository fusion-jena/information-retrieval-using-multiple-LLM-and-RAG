Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

surveys of PAs covering thousands of square kilometers and generating 
thousands of images can be delayed by several months using the OCC 
approach due to the slow but necessary manual processing of images. 
Recent  advances  in  machine  learning  have  propelled  the  perspec-
tives of remotely sensed imagery for wildlife conservation (Tuia et al., 
2022),  and  announced  good  prospects  for  the  automation  of  image 
processing from SRF-OCC surveys (Delplanque et al., 2023b; Eikelboom 
et al., 2019). Deep learning (DL) is a subgroup of machine learning and 
artificial intelligence (AI) where artificial neural networks are trained to 
achieve challenging tasks (e.g. detect animals in aerial imagery) through 
a complex multi-level representation of information learned from a large 
amounts of data (LeCun et al., 2015). In the last decade, DL has been 
widely  employed  to  (semi-)automate  the  detection  and  counting  of

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does provide some clues about potential sources of data. The context mentions the use of aerial surveys for wildlife conservation, which suggests that aerial imagery could be one source of raw data. Additionally, the text discusses recent advancements in machine learning and deep learning techniques applied to remotely sensed imagery for wildlife conservation. This implies that satellite or drone-based remote sensing technologies might also contribute to gathering raw data. Furthermore, the references section includes articles on automated high-definition oblique camera systems and cameras replacing human observers in multi-species aerial counts. These citations indicate that camera systems mounted on aircraft could serve as another method for acquiring raw data. Therefore, while the exact methods are not specified, we can infer that a combination of aerial imagery, remote sensing technologies, and possibly other sources like publicly available datasets may be utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
