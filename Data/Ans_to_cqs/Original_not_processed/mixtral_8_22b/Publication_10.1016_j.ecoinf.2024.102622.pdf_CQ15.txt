and  verification  sets  in  a  ratio  of  3:1.  Five  modelling  methods  were 
selected: random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), multi-layer 
perceptron (MLP), extreme gradient boosting (XGboost), and multiple 
linear  regression  (MLR)  (Abdali  et  al.,  2023;  Fang  et  al.,  2024;  Khan 
et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2023; Xiao et al., 2023b; Xiao et al., 2024). First, 
the model with the highest accuracy was selected to estimate the rice 
LCC and crop coverage degree in the entire study area without consid-
ering the differences in crop coverage. The rice LCC model based on crop 
coverage was then used for estimation, and its accuracy was compared 
with the chlorophyll estimation model without considering differences 
in crop coverage.

EVI is modified to 0.25 and the best parameter L of SAVI is modified to 
0.1.

tively weak. Therefore, the optimal SAVI parameter L of the paddy field 
is herein set to 0.1 (Li et al., 2018). We then selected SAVI as one of VIs 
suitable for all crop coverage region. The high value MIC between the 
SAVI and rice LCC also proves the sensitivity of SAVI.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no information about the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, it does mention the use of various modeling methods like Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). These methods can be optimized using different techniques depending on their implementation. For instance, neural networks like MLP can be trained using backpropagation and optimizers like SGD or Adam. But without further details, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding which optimization techniques are used in this particular case.
