In addition,  in the prediction  of dissolved oxygen in  water, (Chen 
et  al.,  2020)  not  only  applied  water  quality  parameters  but  also 
considered parameters such as temperature, humidity, and atmospheric 
pressure in the air as input variables for the model, providing ideas for 
subsequent research. 

At last, for the dataset as listed in Table 1, and, three different data 
processing methods were trained and tested using the proposed method,

The  above  results  and  analyses  show  that  traditional  machine 
learning  methods  (SVR)  and  deep  learning  methods  (LSTM)  can  be 
adapted  to  address  the  problems  of  poor  generalization  ability,  local 
optimum, underfitting, and overfitting of conventional models to predict 
DO concentration successfully. The machine learning and deep learning 
literature also discuss the prediction of DO concentration. For example,

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer from the information provided that various types of data might have been collected for this study.

For instance, the paper mentions considering parameters such as temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure in the air as input variables for their model. This suggests that they may have used sensors or other devices to collect these environmental data points. Additionally, since the study focuses on predicting dissolved oxygen concentrations in water, it is likely that water samples were taken and analyzed to gather relevant data.

Moreover, the context refers to a dataset listed in Table 1, which could indicate that publicly available datasets were also used in the study. It is common practice in many scientific fields to utilize existing datasets alongside original data collection efforts.

Lastly, while the context does not directly state the use of surveys, it cannot be ruled out entirely. Surveys can provide valuable insights into human activities affecting water bodies, which could influence dissolved oxygen levels indirectly.

To summarize, although the exact methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline are not specified in the provided context, it is reasonable to assume that a combination of sensor measurements, water sample analysis, publicly available datasets, and possibly even survey responses were employed.
