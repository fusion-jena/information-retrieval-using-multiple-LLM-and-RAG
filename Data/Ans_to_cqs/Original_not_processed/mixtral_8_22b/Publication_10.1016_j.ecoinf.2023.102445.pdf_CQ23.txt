input into the model network for training.

2.2.6. Experimental design 

In this paper, a sequence of 10 ablation experiments are conducted 
and labelled to evaluate the enhancements made to various components 
of the network architecture. These experiments use 10 different network 
models,  of  which  the  model  of  Experiment  1  is  the  original  YOLOv8 
model, and the remaining nine models are models with different struc-
tures modified on the basis of YOLOv8. 

The experimental training parameter settings are as follows: a batch 
size of 16 is selected, the input image resolution is set at 640 × 640, and 
the number of epochs is specified as 150. The learning rate is set to 0.01, 
and the optimizer is Adam. Additionally, the depth_scale parameter is 
assigned a value of 0.33, while the width_scale parameter is set to 0.25.

enriches  gradient  flow  information  while  maintaining  a  lightweight 
structure.  The  SPPF  module  is  a  module  for  processing  objects  with 
different scales. It modifies parallel max pooling into a combination of 
serial  and  parallel  modes,  enhancing  the  model's  resilience  to  spatial 
layout and object degradation. This module involves a standard Conv 
operation, followed by kernel sizes of 5, 9, and 13 for Max pooling. The 
results are concatenated with the Conv module for extracting shallow 
semantic  features,  which  subsequently  passed  through  a  final  Conv 
module. The neck network is positioned between the backbone network 
and the head network. Feature fusion is performed using two network 
architectures, the feature pyramid network (FPN) and the path aggre-
gation network (PAN), which are used to solve the problem of multiscale 
feature fusion and strengthen the integration and utilization of feature

In Experiment 9, we achieve a reduction in the number of parame-
ters, GFLOPs, and model size while incurring a marginal loss of 0.8% in 
P and 0.1% in R, and a minor decrease in mAP. In contrast, Experiment 
10 yields a significant reduction in the number of parameters and model 
size, with only 36.32% of the original model parameters and 38.71% of 
its  model  size.  Although  a  reduction  in  the  mAP  is  observed,  the 
improved  model  demonstrates  the  shortest  processing  time.  Further-
more, R reaches its peak, and P remains on par with the original model, 
achieving an optimal balance point. These findings show that the com-
bination  of  the  Multicat  module,  Reduce  detection  head,  and  C2flite 
module has the best overall performance (Fig. 11). The Multicat module 
significantly offsets the large increase in GFLOPs and processing time 
due to reduced detection heads, while the combination with the C2flite

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model such as using diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it can be inferred from the context that the authors have attempted to improve the robustness and adaptability of their model by conducting a series of ablation experiments involving ten different network architectures based on YOLOv8. Each experiment was designed to modify certain aspects of the original model, including the addition of new modules like the Multicat module, Reduced detection head, and C2flite module, as well as modifications to existing ones like the SPPF module. By evaluating these changes across multiple experiments, the authors aimed to identify the most effective combinations of improvements that could lead to better overall performance without significantly increasing computational complexity. While not directly addressing generalizability, these efforts suggest a focus on creating a more versatile and efficient model capable of handling a wider range of scenarios.
