assign varying weights to each channel to allow the network to focus on 
important  features.  Therefore,  the  CAM  in  CBAM  is  incorporated  the 
classification network. Additionally, CAM can enhance the transmission 
and  characterization  of  more important  features in  the  network, thus 
improving  the  feature  representation  capability  of  the  network.  The 
model structure of CAM is shown in Fig. 3. While ViT primarily extracts 
features  from a  spatial  perspective,  the combination  of  CAM and  ViT 
enables the network to better learn image features.

Compared with ViT, CNN has stronger local information extraction 

ability.  In  particular,  the  residual  structure  of  ResNet  connects  the 
different network layers via shortcut, which not only preserves the input 
features  but  also  addresses  the  degradation  problem  of  the  deep 
network, thus mitigating issues such as vanishing or exploding gradi-
ents. The residual structure can help the network to learn the features in 
the input image better, thereby improving the classification effect of the 
network. 

Different classes of objects of the same species have high similarities. 
To better classify objects, CA-Hybrid network is constructed for Cervidae 
classification, based on ResNet and ViT, with the integration of CAM into 
the residual structure of ResNet. The structure of the CA-Hybrid network 
is shown in Fig. 4.

tion and Transformer, effectively extracts richer semantic features (Xie 
et al., 2024). A network based on CNN and ViT modules classified mi-
croorganisms with an accuracy of 67.62% (Dwivedi et al., 2024).

The proposed classification network in this paper demonstrates su-
perior performance on the dataset, as indicated by the results presented 
in Table 3. In each classification network, the accuracy for the “medium” 
is consistently higher than that for the “small”. Besides, the experimental 
data in Table 3 also indicates that the classification network proposed 
achieves the highest classification accuracy among the “medium”  and 
“small”.  In  our  proposed  model,  the  classification  accuracy  for  both 
“medium”  and “small”  is improved by 3.56% and 2.93% respectively, 
compared to the ResNet50 and ViT. Additionally, the classification ac-
curacy for the “medium” is 5.6% higher compare with the “small” in the 
CA-Hybrid network.

Helpful Answer: Unfortunately, there isn't any specific mention of the hardware resources used for training the deep learning models in the given context. However, typically, deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Vision Transformers (ViT), and others often require substantial computational power, usually provided by Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). These units are specifically designed to handle parallel operations, making them highly efficient for matrix multiplication tasks common in deep learning algorithms.
