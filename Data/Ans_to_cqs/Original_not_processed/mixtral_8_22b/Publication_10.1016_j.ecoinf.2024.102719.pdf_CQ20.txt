Fig. 3. Flowchart of the modeling procedure. Eleven machine learning models
were utilized in the study: multilayer perceptron (MLP), logistic regression
(LR), naïve Bayes (NB), CatBoost (CAT), random forest (RF), XGBoost (XGB),
LightGBM (LGB), weighted soft voting (WSOFT), weighted hard voting
(WHARD), blending, and stacking.

and TPE algorithms were implemented in the CatBoost package
(V.1.0.6), LightGBM package (V.3.2.1), XGBoost package (V.1.5.0), and
Hyperopt package (V.0.2.7), respectively.

%Query
Query: "Which hardware resources are used for training the deep learning model (e.g., GPUs, TPUs)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models mentioned in the paper. Therefore, I cannot determine whether they used GPUs, TPUs, or other types of hardware resources for training these models.
