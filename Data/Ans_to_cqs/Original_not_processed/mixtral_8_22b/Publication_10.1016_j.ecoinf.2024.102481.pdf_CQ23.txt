error < 11%, high prevalence (>43%) and sensitivity higher than 86% 
(Table 2). In all classified maturity stages, the specificity was higher than 
85%.

In addition to the OOB, the model performance was also evaluated 
using  the  confusion  matrix  with  the  following  metrics:  Cohen’s  kappa 
coefficient (κ) to measure the proportion of agreements (Cohen, 1960), 
Precision to determine proportion of correct predictions, Sensitivity for 
the true positive rate (correctly predicted phases), Specificity for the true 
negative rate (correct allocation to other phases), and Prevalence for the 
proportion  within  each  phase.  Descriptions  of  these  metrics  are  as 
follows: 

κ =

2 × (TP × TN (cid:0) FN × FP)
(TP + FP) × (FP + TN) + (TP + FN) × (FN + TN)

On each sampled fish, the Gonadosomatic Index (GSI) was computed 
as  GSI  = (OW  /  (TW  -  OW))  × 100.  In  addition,  a  measurement  of 
relative condition factor (Krel) was calculated as an indirect measure of 
nutritional status in according to Le Cren (1951), as Krel = TW / (αTL

distributions,  collinearity).  In  recent  years,  different  algorithms  have 
been successfully applied in fisheries biology, such as Boosted Regres-
sion Trees to assess the relative importance of environmental and har-
vesting  effects  on  herring  growth  (Lyashevska  et  al.,  2020),  as  well 
predicting bycatch on a demersal crustacean fishery in Chile (Montero 
et al., 2020). Random Forest have been applied for stock differentiation 
in pink cusk-eel using morphometric measurements of sagittal otoliths 
(Wiff  et  al.,  2020),  as  well  as  investigating  the  influence  of  environ-
mental and density-dependent factors on the growth of North Sea sprat 
(Lindegren  et  al.,  2020).  Convolutional  Neural  Networks  have  been 
widely applied to analyse salmon scale images for growth determination 
(Vabø et al., 2021). Random Forests (RFs) are one of the most popular 
machine learning techniques for both classification and regression, and

when sampling the fundamentally different population conditions of a 
healthy  versus depleted  stock. The use of  RFs has the  potential to  be 
applied for classifying maturity in other taxa whose reproductive attri-
butes  are  essential  for  their  management  and  conservation  in  the 
ecosystem. Machine learning methods may offer an accurate alternative 
to traditional methods to improve our biological understanding in future 
or retrospective research.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does state that the model performance was evaluated using the confusion matrix with various metrics such as Cohen’s kappa coefficient, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence. This suggests that some form of validation or testing was performed on the model. Additionally, the text mentions that Random Forests (RFs) are widely applied for both classification and regression tasks, which implies that they could potentially be used for validating the model. Nevertheless, without more detailed information about the methodology employed, it cannot be definitively stated what specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
