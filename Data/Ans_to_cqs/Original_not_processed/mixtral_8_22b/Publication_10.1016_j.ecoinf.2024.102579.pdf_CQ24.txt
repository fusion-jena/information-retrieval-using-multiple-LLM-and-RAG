In Eq. (7), n is the number of trees included in the sample at a given 
sample point, i.e. the number of sample trees. In the remainder of this 
paper, we referred to Eq. (7) as the inventory estimator. 

2.2.2. NN1 and NN2 estimators

(Pommerening, 2023), as structural complexity is an important objec-
tive  of  this  type  of  forest  management.  Compared  to  variance,  the 
contribution of bias to the values of rRMSE is rather small. This is where 
the  NN3  and  NN4  estimators  can  help,  since  they  are  effective  in 
reducing the overall index variation. They have performed well with all 
diversity indices other than distance and the aggregation index. In this 
context, it is particularly interesting that the NN4 estimator, which is 
based  on  the  weights  of  both  sample  trees  and  of  the  neighbours  of 
sample trees, has performed best with most diversity indices other than 
distance  and  aggregation  index.  Given  the  general  aim  to  reduce  the 
index variance, this finding seems to suggest that the information pro-
vided by sample-tree neighbours complements that of the sample trees 
and is with most indices more important than spatial edge-bias concerns

from a large-scale forest inventory in Austria. We found that both forest structure and index algorithm greatly 
influence the sampling error. The largest source of sampling error was the index variance and contrary to our 
expectation not so much the bias due to spatial effects. For diversity indices related to distances, it has turned out 
to be best to apply estimators that include spatial edge correction methods. For all other indices an estimator 
performed better that included information on both the sample trees and their nearest neighbours, as it much 
reduced  overall  index  variance.  However,  if  possible  the  plus-sampling  edge  correction  method  should  be 
applied.

Helpful Answer:
The paper does not provide any direct information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, some common strategies used to manage randomness in machine learning models, including deep learning pipelines, are:

1. Fixed Random Seed: Setting a fixed random seed ensures reproducibility of results across different runs of the model. By setting a specific seed value, the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers will be generated each time the code is executed, leading to consistent results.

2. Cross-Validation: Using cross-validation techniques like k-fold cross-validation helps to mitigate the impact of random initialization of parameters in neural networks. It involves splitting the dataset into multiple folds and training/testing the model on different combinations of these folds. Averaging the performance metrics from these iterations provides a more robust estimate of the model's performance.

3. Ensemble Methods: Combining multiple models trained with different initializations or architectures can improve the stability and accuracy of predictions. Techniques such as bagging, boosting, and stacking can be applied to create ensembles of models, reducing the variability caused by randomness.

4. Regularization: Applying regularization techniques like L1, L2, or dropout can help prevent overfitting and improve the generalizability of the model. These methods introduce controlled noise during training, making the model more resilient to variations in input data and parameter initialization.
