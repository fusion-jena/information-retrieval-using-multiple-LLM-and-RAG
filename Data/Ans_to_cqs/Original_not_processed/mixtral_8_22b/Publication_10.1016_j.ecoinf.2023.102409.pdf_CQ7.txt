2023; Yuan et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2023c). The model’s initial learning 
rate was set to 0.01, further refined via iterative testing. The number of 
iterations was 150, with a batch size of 4, downsampling multiplier set 
at 8, and utilized SGD optimizer, ReLu activation function, and Dice loss 
function.

(3) Deeplabv3þ. In the encoding stage of Deeplabv3+ model, the 
backbone  network  is  replaced  with  Mobilenetv2  featuring  expanded 
convolution (Fig. 5). Mobilenetv2 network ensures higher accuracy and 
enhances  the  model’s  lightweight  nature  compared  to  the  originally 
used  Xception+ network  (Fu  et  al.,  2022),  significantly  reducing  the 
model weights file size and accelerating model prediction speed. Addi-
tionally,  the  semantic  segmentation  task  involves  incorporating  ASPP 
module into the encoder-decoder network (Chen et al., 2018b). Five sets 
of feature maps are obtained by utilizing four atrous convolution blocks 
with varied dilation rates (including convolution, batch normalization, 
and activation layers) and a global average pooling block. These feature 
maps are concatenated, then passed through a 1 × 1 convolution block, 
and  ultimately  inputted  into  the  Decoder  module.  ASPP  method  in-

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide explicit information on the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, it can be inferred from common practices in machine learning that the dataset might have been divided into three subsets: training, validation, and testing datasets. Typically, the training dataset is used to fit the model, while the validation dataset is employed to tune hyperparameters during the training process. Lastly, the testing dataset is applied to evaluate the final performance of the trained model. The proportion of each subset varies depending on the specific application or researcher preference but often ranges between 60-80% for training, 10-20% for validation, and 10-20% for testing.
