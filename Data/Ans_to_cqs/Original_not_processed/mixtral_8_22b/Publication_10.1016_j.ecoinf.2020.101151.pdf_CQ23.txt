2.3. Human impact

for the FWI and FFMC data layers with a spatial resolution of 1 × 1 km.
The nine-cell approach, the results of which are shown in this paper, led
to slightly better prediction results of the variants, likely because it
smoothed existing data inaccuracies within single grid cells.

2.7. Combination of factors

We combined the data layers shown in Fig. 1 using different
weighting approaches (Table 3). This was done to test the sensitivity of
the parameters / combinations in predicting forest fire danger. We
based the weighting of the variants on results of previous studies in the
Alpine context (Albers, 2012; Arpaci et al., 2013; Grima, 2011; Müller
et al., 2013; Müller and Vacik, 2017). For variants 1 to 5, the weighting
of the factor lightning was altered according to the season. From May
15th to September 15th, lightning was given high relevance (50%), as
lightning strikes may ignite up to 50% of all forest fires in Austria
during the summer months (Müller and Vacik, 2017). Since almost no
lightning fires are documented for the rest of the year, the weighting of
the factor lightning was set to zero, leading to 100% human cause.

Variant 6 was seen as a control model with equal weighting for all
parameters.
