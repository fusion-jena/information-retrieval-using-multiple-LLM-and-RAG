Python is used to retrieve the necessary picture data for forest fire point 
information  in  the  study  area.  The  obtained  data  is  saved  in  “CSV”

Mi = Ai × BAGB × Ci × λi

(4)  

where Mi refers to the combustible material load of the i-th forest type 
(t), Ai denotes the area engulfed by fire of the i-th forest category (hm2), 
BAGB reflects the above-ground biomass per unit area (tC/hm2), Ci is the 
proportion of biomass specific to the i-th forest type, λi  stands for the 
combustion efficiency associated with the i-th type of forest resource.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the given context is not explicitly stated. However, based on the information provided, it appears that the model was used for image classification tasks related to land use and land cover (LULC) data for the Panhandle area in Florida, USA. Specifically, machine learning techniques were employed to classify fire-damaged monuments, demonstrating notable success in identifying minor fires. Additionally, researchers utilized advanced cloud computing capabilities to perform extensive geospatial computations for quantifying carbon emissions from forest fires with intricate influencing factors. Therefore, we can infer that the deep learning model might have been used for object detection or semantic segmentation purposes to identify and analyze various features within satellite images, such as different types of vegetation, damaged structures, and fire events.
