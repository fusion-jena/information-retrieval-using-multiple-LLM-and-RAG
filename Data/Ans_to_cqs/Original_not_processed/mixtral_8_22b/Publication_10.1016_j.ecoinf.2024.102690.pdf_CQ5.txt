Identification of optional ecological sources 

The SOFM is an unsupervised learning neural network approach that 
combines dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis to allocate 
research units into different ES bundles based on spatial similarities. The 
ES bundles were divided using SOFM (using the R package kohonen) 
based on the results of the reconstructed ESV, and the ideal number of 
bundles  was  established  by  calculating  the  Davis-Boldin  Index  (DBI), 
which was used as the basis for identifying ecological sources and setting 
scenarios. Furthermore, this study used hotspot analysis (Getis-Ord G*
i ) 
to  analyze the  spatial clustering of  ESV and  considered  hotspot areas 
with a significance level of 90% or more as optional ecological sources.

learning neural network characterized by the topographic map structure 
of  the  input  scenario.  This  algorithm  overcomes  the  shortcomings  of 
linear dimensionality reduction techniques and can objectively classify 
ecosystem functions according to a predefined setting and automatically 
form weights among the elements, avoiding the subjectivity of weight 
setting  (Zhao  et  al.,  2023).  Consequently,  applying  SOFM  to  identify 
ecological sources can effectively analyze the geographical variability 
and similarity of ESs while also uncovering the dominant service func-
tions and ecological values of the land-use types where the ecological 
sources  are  located.  This  study  combined  the  SOFM  algorithm  with 
traditional  ESP  construction  paradigms,  which  emphasize  the  consid-
eration of the capacity of different regions to provide dominant ESs, and 
can  provide  a  new  idea  for  the  construction  and  optimization  of

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it appears that the study does not use any traditional deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, various datasets related to ecosystem services, climate, and geography have been utilized. These include:

1. Guangzhou Statistical Yearbook and National Grain Trading Centre - Used to calculate the output value per unit area of grain crops in the study area.
2. GlobeLand30 - A global land cover product with a resolution of 30 meters.
3. ALOS World 3D-30m - Provided by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, offering high-quality digital surface models.
4. China Soil Map Based Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD) v1.1 - Contains soil properties and classes globally.
5. MODIS Image MOD13Q1 - Provided by NASA, containing vegetation indices like NDVI.
6. CRU Dataset - Climatic Research Unit Time Series dataset providing monthly climate variables.
7. Geographic Data Sharing Infrastructure, College of Urban and Environmental Science, Peking University - Offers various geospatial datasets.
8. National Earth System Science Data Center - Provides access to earth system science data.

These datasets have been employed to support the research objectives, including analyzing the geographical variability and similarity of ecosystem services, uncovering dominant service functions, and evaluating ecological values of land-use types.
