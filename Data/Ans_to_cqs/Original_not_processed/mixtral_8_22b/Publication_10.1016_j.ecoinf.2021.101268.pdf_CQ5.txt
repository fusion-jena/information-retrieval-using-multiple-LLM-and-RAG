Like any other complex model, DL requires a large amount of data to 
fit appropriately, which is hard in our context. To overcome this limi-
tation, we employ different architectures pre-trained with the ImageNet 
dataset. Pre-trained models capture low-level features (e.g., edges, cor-
ners, color spots, etc.) from one domain and transfer them to another 
with  similar  characteristics.  The  transfer  process  is  called  fine-tuning 
due  to  the  model  only  learns  specific  higher-level  features  (e.g.,  ar-
rangements, venations, etc.). We compare four pre-trained models: (1) 
AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012, 2) VGG-19 (Simonyan and Zisserman, 
2014, 3) ResNet-101 (He et al., 2016, 4) DenseNet-201 (Huang et al., 
2017).  The  fully  connected  block  is  adjusted  to  feed  off  the  feature 
vector and output the ten species of leaves. Table 3 describe architecture

Convolutional neural networks (CNN) outstand over DL techniques 
by disentangling high-level representations across multiple processing 
layers. CNN’s process data on two levels: a convolutional block for the 
automatic  feature  extraction,  and  fully  connected  layers  to  establish 
feature-output  correlation.  The  convolutional  block  comprises  con-
volutional,  ReLU,  and  max-pooling  layers.  Each  set  of  convolutional 
layers diversify features by applying a set of parallel filters that process 
local sections of the input space. The feature vector integrates low-level 
local features from the first layers and higher-level representations from 
the latest ones.

Deep Learning (DL) methods are at the top of the state-of-the-art on 
feature representation for different domains; albeit, DL lacks interpret-
ability. According to Doshi-Velez and Kim (2017), interpretability lets 
human specialists understand what a model is learning, making them 
flexible  real-world  solutions.  Given  such  topics,  this  paper  has  three 
significant contributions:  

1.  The  paper  introduces  the  first  Peruvian  Amazon  Forestry  Dataset, 
including  its  detailed  metadata  and  the  acquisition  protocol 
description. The dataset collects 59,441 samples from ten of the most 
profitable  and  endangered species (Finer  et al., 2014; Pinedo-Vas-
quez et al., 1992). Further-more, we employ six different commercial 
cameras  to  ensure  variability  and  to  develop  any  flexible  solution 
with real-world conditions in the future.

Helpful Answer:
The text mentions that the authors use different architectures pre-trained with the ImageNet dataset. This means that they leverage existing models trained on the ImageNet dataset, which contains millions of labeled images belonging to thousands of categories. By using these pre-trained models, they can take advantage of the learned features and apply them to their own dataset, which is not explicitly mentioned but consists of leaf images from ten different species.
