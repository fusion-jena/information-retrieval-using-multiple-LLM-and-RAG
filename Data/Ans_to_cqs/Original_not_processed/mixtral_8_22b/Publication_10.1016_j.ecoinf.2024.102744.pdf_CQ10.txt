5.4. Application to the problem of counting pollen-bearing bees 

Counting the number of pollen-bearing bees entering the hive enables beekeepers to monitor the 

hive’s food status and promptly replenish it if necessary. Recognizing this benefit, we integrated

feature  images  while  retaining  crucial  features.  The  Dropout  layer  is  integrated  to  mitigate 

overfitting. Additionally, the Global Average Pooling layer summarizes features, generating input 

for the fully connected layer. This layer also facilitates the visualization of regions relied upon by 

the network for predictions. The subsequent three fully connected layers generate the predicted 

class for the original image

5.1. Setup 

Journal Pre-proof

In  our  experiments,  we  used  the  Python  3.10  programming  environment  along  with  popular 

libraries  such  as  PyTorch,  TensorFlow,  and  OpenCV.  The  detection  models  were  trained  on  a 

server equipped with an Intel® Core™ i7-8700 CPU @ 3.20GHz (32GB DDR4-2666 memory) 

and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 GPU (8GB GDDR6 memory). 

The  methods  utilizing  YOLOv5  will  undergo  training  for  300  epochs,  whereas  the 

classification network in method 1 will undergo training for 200 epochs. Here, one epoch signifies 

training the model on all data once. For YOLOv5 training, fundamental parameters such as the 

learning  rate  will  be  set  to  0.02,  with  weight  decay  and  momentum  values  of  0.001  and  0.9, 

respectively.  In  contrast,  methods  employing  Faster  RCNN  will  be  trained  with  90  thousand

any  size  and  outputs  a  region  proposal,  consisting  of  a  set  of  rectangle  locations  capable  of 

containing objects, along with the corresponding probability of containing the object. An essential 

aspect  of  Faster  RCNN  is  the  utilization  of  anchors  for  generating  bounding  boxes  within  the 

network.  Anchors  are  created  to  differentiate  between  positive  and  negative  anchors  based  on 

overlap.  Furthermore,  by  comparing  the  position  of  predefined  anchors  with  ground-truth 

bounding boxes (using Intersection over Union rate), the network can predict the location of the 

output region proposal. The second module of the network operates similarly to the structure of the
