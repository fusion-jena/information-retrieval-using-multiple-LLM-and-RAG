4.3.3. LSTM model 

The  long  short-term  memory  (LSTM)  model  is  a  common  deep 
learning model used to solve the prediction problem of time series data 
(Tang  et  al.,  2023).  Compared  with  traditional  machine  learning 
models, the LSTM model has better performance and ability to manage 
the  prediction  problem  of  time  series  data,  especially  the  long-term 
dependency  problem  and  multivariate  time  series  data,  and  has 
obvious  advantages  (Liu  et  al.,  2021;  Tang  et  al.,  2023;  Zhou  et  al., 
2023). Fig. 3 shows the prediction process of the LSTM model and the BP 
model.  This  study  compares  these  two  models  and  the  Markov  chain 
model. 

4.4. FMOP model 

Optimizing land allocation through a multiobjective programming 
(MOP) model combined with uncertainty analysis methods can provide 
a reference for decision makers.

5.2. Land type conversion drivers 

We  added  the  extracted  land  type  expansion  raster  to  LEAS  and 
imported  the  driver  raster  map.  Subsequently,  the  RFC  was  used  to 
obtain the probability of development and the contribution of drivers for 
each land category. We also set the sampling rate to 0.1, the number of 
decision trees to 20, the number of features used to train the random 
forest to 9, and the number of parallels to 12 to improve the execution 
speed. In summary, the contribution rates and root mean square errors 
of each driving factor to the expansion of each land type were obtained 
(Fig. 6). The root mean square error (RMSE) of the PLUS model's analysis 
of the drivers of expansion for the six land types in the YRB-SX for the 
years  2000–2010  and  2010–2020  was  less  than  0.2,  and  the  model 
performed well. 

The higher the variable contribution rate is, the greater the impact of

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the LSTM model was compared with other models like the BP model and the Markov chain model, which could be considered a form of validation. Additionally, the study mentions setting parameters like the sampling rate, number of decision trees, and parallel processing to improve execution speed, but this doesn't directly address generalizability concerns. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, I cannot definitively state what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
