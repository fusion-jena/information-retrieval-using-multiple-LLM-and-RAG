On the other hand, transformers are the most frequently deployed 
techniques in natural language processing (NLP) (Vaswani et al., 2017). 
Researchers  are now exploring the capability of transformers  in com-
puter  vision  and  remote  sensing,  given  their  huge  success  in  the  lan-
guage domain. They have recently proven to be practical in a variety of 
applications,  including  the  classification  of  remote  sensing  imagery 
(Bazi et al., 2021; D. Hong et al., 2021; J. He et al., 2020). Transformers 
utilize  an  attention-based  approach  rather  than  using  convolutional 
operations utilized by CNNs. As such, transformers, unlike CNNs, can 
acquire global contextual knowledge through self-attention. This means 
that transformers have a better generalization capability as compared to 
CNN algorithms. For example, the state-of-the-art vision transformer of 
Swin Transformer incorporates a hierarchical transformer with shifting

shallow water, respectively (see Table 5). The inclusion of a CNN-based 
feature extractor (CNN + ST) improved the classification accuracy of the 
Swin Transformer by 2.18%, 1.88%, and 1.49% in terms of the kappa 
index,  overall  accuracy,  and  average  accuracy,  respectively.  On  the 
other hand, the inclusion of synthetic data with the Swin Transformer

Helpful Answer:
The paper does not explicitly mention any specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of synthetic data with the Swin Transformer, which could imply some form of data augmentation. Additionally, the table shows results from a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) combined with the Swin Transformer, suggesting that this might also involve some kind of data generation or augmentation technique. Unfortunately, without more detailed information about these methods, I cannot provide a definitive list of the exact data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
