In the past few years, CNNs have been a hot topic in the ﬁeld of image classiﬁcation. Since the
publication of AlexNet [38], a number of classical CNN architectures have been proposed, including
VGG [39], GoogLeNet [40], and ResNet [41]. VGG can be considered as a deepened version of AlexNet,
which employed small convolutional kernels. GoogLeNet adopted the Inception module, which is
easy to use for network modiﬁcation. It also removed the fully connected layers to reduce the number
of parameters. Moreover, it used two auxiliary classiﬁers to accelerate network convergence. As a
consequence of the auxiliary classiﬁers, GoogLeNet is not as scalable as VGG. On the other hand, the
depth of networks is a crucial factor that inﬂuences CNN performance [39]. Richer features of diﬀerent
levels can be extracted from deep CNN layers, whereas deep models are not easy to optimize. In
many studies, batch normalization (BN) is employed to hamper vanishing/exploding gradients in deep

CNNs. However, the accuracy often becomes saturated and then degrades (degradation problem) in
the training phase, even though BN layers are used. ResNet [41] addressed the degradation problem
by using shallow layers and identity mapping for network construction. Two shortcuts (i.e., identity
and projection shortcuts) have been introduced for residual learning. Recently, these networks have
been introduced into the ﬁeld of remote sensing.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it mentions that batch normalization (BN) is commonly used in many studies to address issues like vanishing or exploding gradients in deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). While this isn't directly related to data preprocessing, it suggests that techniques aimed at improving the stability and efficiency of the training process may be applied during or prior to training. To get more detailed information about common preprocessing steps for deep learning models, one would need to refer to additional resources focusing specifically on data preparation for machine learning tasks.
