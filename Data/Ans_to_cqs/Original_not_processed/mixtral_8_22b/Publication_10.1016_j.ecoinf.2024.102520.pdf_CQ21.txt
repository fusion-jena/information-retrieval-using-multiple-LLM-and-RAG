Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it does not provide specific information about the post-processing steps involved after model training for this particular study. However, generally speaking, some common post-processing steps include calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score; creating confusion matrices to visualize the performance of the model; generating saliency maps to understand which features were important for the model's predictions; and validating the results using statistical tests or cross-validation techniques. In this context, we can see that validation was one of the tasks performed by the authors, but without more details, it is difficult to determine what other post-processing steps may have been taken. Additionally, the RMSE of residuals with a kriging variance mentioned suggests that some form of error analysis was conducted, although the exact method used is unclear from the available information.
