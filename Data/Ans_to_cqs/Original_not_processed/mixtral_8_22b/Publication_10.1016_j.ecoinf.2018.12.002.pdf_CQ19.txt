Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The article does not provide information about the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models. It discusses various machine learning techniques such as supervised learning algorithms, unsupervised learning algorithms, hidden Markov models, state space models, and computational ecology but it does not mention any specific deep learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
