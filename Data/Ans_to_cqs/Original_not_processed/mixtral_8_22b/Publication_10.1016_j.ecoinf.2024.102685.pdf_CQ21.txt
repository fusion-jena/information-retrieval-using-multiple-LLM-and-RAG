2.2. Training data and validation distribution data 

The workflow adopted for data acquisition, preparation and to set RF 
models are summarized in Fig. 2. The field data were collected during 
the summer season in 2010 (see Boscutti et al., 2015 for details about the 
field sampling procedure). The presence or absence and the cover per-
centage of the three seagrass species were recorded for each sampling 
point, by means of inspection and sampling of the seabed. To reduce the 
effects  introduced  by  non-vegetated  and  mixed  pixels,  the  points  not 
falling within the region of interest (ROI) (i.e. main channels and tidal 
islands  of  the  lagoon), and  the  points  considered  mixed  (i.e.  those in 
which  the  co-occurrence  of  multiple  species  was  recorded),  were 
removed. The removed mixed points represented 16.7% of the original 
data.  Considering  the different  combinations of  the three  species’  co-

Helpful Answer:
After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the study. Based on the given context, it appears that the authors have used a random forest classification approach for their analysis. Here are some common postprocessing steps that could be relevant to this type of analysis:

1. Model evaluation: After training the model, it is essential to evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics such as overall accuracy, user accuracy, and producer accuracy. These metrics help assess how well the model has learned from the training data and how accurately it predicts the target variables.

2. Confusion matrix: A confusion matrix is often used to visualize the performance of a classifier. It provides detailed information about actual and predicted classifications done by the model. This allows researchers to understand where the model might be making mistakes and which classes are more challenging to distinguish.

3. Classification map generation: Once the model has been trained and evaluated, it can be applied to new datasets to generate predictions. In this case, the authors may use the trained random forest model to create a classification map showing the spatial distribution of seagrass meadows and species meadows.

4. Validation: To further validate the results obtained from the model, additional data sources like photointerpretation data or field data can be employed. Comparing these independent datasets with the generated classification maps helps confirm the reliability and robustness of the model.

In summary, based on the given context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include evaluating the model's performance using various metrics, generating a confusion matrix, creating classification maps, and validating the results using independent datasets.
