Scenario 5 was selected as the optimal solution as it had the best values for IoU and accuracy
while training on fewer epochs. The resulting architecture is shown in Figure 4 and described in
the following.

2.5.1. Encoding Path

The overall workﬂow of preprocessing, network design, and prediction are shown in Figure 2.
Due to the size of the orthophotos and due to memory limitations when doing computations, it is
intuitive to process the orthophotos into relatively small labeled tiles (or rather small image cubes) and
feed them into the CNN. Each orthophoto of size 10,000 × 10,000 pixels was divided into 1525 tiles of
256 × 256 pixels. The data (orthophoto and corresponding labels) were then split into three datasets:
training (80%), validation (20%), and test (two full images of 10,000 × 10,000 pixels). The training
data were used for optimizing the neural network, while the validation dataset was used to assess the
performance during the training process. The test dataset was used to assess the performance of the
ﬁnal optimized neural network. The training and validation images were read into arrays with the

greater than 0.5 ha. As these results also required choosing optimal parameters, the transferability of
the method was somewhat more complex compared to the pretrained U-Net architecture, which can be
applied without tuning additional parameters speciﬁc to the area of interest. An in-depth investigation
of the performance of the proposed architecture on further datasets would be an interesting future
project, especially with respect to the power of generalization, which can be increased by different data
augmentation techniques.

4.2. Limitations of This Study

In general, the limitations of deep learning in comparison to other machine learning methods
are the requirement of large and high-quality training data, as well as hardware limitations related to
GPU computing power. The most notable advantage of deep learning is the grade of automatization
and a high potential to generalize when using large amounts of representative training data, which
might, however, not always be available; especially with respect to ground-truth labels that might be
scarce or not exist at all.. Furthermore, the black-box nature makes these algorithms a good choice for
classiﬁcation as suggested in this study, but a challenge for modeling physical properties, as is often
the case in forestry. This case study relied on high-resolution orthophotos with 20-cm spatial resolution
obtained from an aerial survey. The great advantage of these data is that many details can be detected.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, some aspects of the preprocessing steps mentioned could potentially help mitigate data bias. For instance, dividing each orthophoto into smaller tiles and creating separate datasets for training, validation, and testing may contribute to reducing bias if done appropriately. Additionally, the use of a larger amount of representative training data could improve the model's ability to generalize, thus indirectly addressing any potential biases in the data. Nonetheless, without concrete evidence from the provided context, one cannot definitively state what techniques are employed to tackle data bias during preprocessing.
