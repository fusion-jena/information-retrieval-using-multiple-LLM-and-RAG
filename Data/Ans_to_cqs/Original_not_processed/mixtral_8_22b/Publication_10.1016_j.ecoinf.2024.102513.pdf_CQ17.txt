The  Pooling  Layer  performs  data  downsampling,  reducing  dimen-
sionality and extracting essential features. The most common pooling 
method is max pooling, which selects the maximum value from a region 
of  input  data.  Pooling  helps  reduce  the  number  of  parameters  and 
computations,  enhances  invariance  to  small  shifts  and  scale  changes, 
and improves the model's generalization ability.

datasets.  This  training  process  was  pivotal  in  developing  a  classifier 
capable of accurately identifying various land cover forms based on their 
spectral signatures. 

2.2. Conducting LULC analysis using deep neural network

While this study provides valuable insights into the dynamics of land 
cover change in the Kerch Peninsula, several avenues for future research 
offer opportunities to enhance the technical aspects of historical land use 
and  land  cover  mapping.  Particularly,  addressing  the  challenge  of 
limited data availability for training deep neural networks in cases of 
sparse historical information warrants further investigation.

Convolutional  neural  networks  are  trained  by  optimizing  filter 
weights based on a given loss function, such as categorical cross-entropy 
(Ruby  and  Yendapalli,  2020).  Backpropagation,  a  commonly  used 
method,  enables  error  propagation  backward  through  the  network  to 
update  weights  using  gradient  descent  or  its  variants  (Bengio  et  al., 
1994).

Helpful Answer:
Regularization methods are techniques used in machine learning models, including deep learning pipelines, to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the noise in the training data instead of the underlying pattern, leading to poor performance on unseen data. Two popular regularization methods mentioned in the context are dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, effectively creating a different architecture for each iteration. This prevents any single neuron from having too much influence and encourages the network to distribute learned features across all neurons. Dropout can be applied to both fully connected layers and convolutional layers.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights. By adding this penalty, the optimization algorithm tries to minimize not only the original loss but also the size of the weights. This discourages large weights and promotes smaller ones, making the model more robust against overfitting.

Other regularization methods not explicitly mentioned in the context include L1 regularization, early stopping, and data augmentation. L1 regularization works similarly to L2 regularization but uses the absolute value of the weights instead of squaring them. Early stopping involves monitoring the validation set performance during training and halting the process once it starts degrading. Data augmentation generates new samples by applying transformations like rotation, scaling, or flipping to existing data points, increasing the dataset size and diversity.
