analyze  changes  in  mangroves  along  the  southeastern  coast  of 
China and the influencing factors. 

3.2. Spatial analysis and transfer path of mangrove forest

5.4. Limitations and future studies 

Due to the limitations of data sources and classification methods (Jia 
et al., 2023), this may largely affect the in-deep understanding of various 
mangrove species status in China and globally. In addition, although this 
study  discussed  the  effects  of  governmental  policies  on  long-term 
mangrove  evolution,  it  was  still  difficult  to  quantify  the  contribution 
rate of policies on mangrove conservation and restoration. Future dis-
cussion  and  in-deep  study  of  quantifiable  policy  factors  as  well  as 
improved  image  resolution  and  machine  learning  approaches  toward 
accurate identification of mangrove species will be great significance for 
dynamic monitoring and evaluation of mangrove interspecies evolution. 

6. Conclusions

(2)  Training samples were created and landscape types were rapidly 
extracted. Google Earth Pro was used to randomly generate 1800 
sample points in the image of the study area for each year (300 
sample  points  for  each  land  cover  type).  These  sample  points 
were imported into the GEE application programming interface 
(API)  for  further  analysis.  The  samples  were  then  randomly 
divided into training and validation datasets at a 7:3 ratio. The 
random forest algorithm was applied to rapidly classify the land 
use types in the study area.  

(3)  Post-classification  processing  was  applied  to  the  images.  A 
manual  visual  interpretation  approach  was  used  to  correct  the 
image classification results for mangroves within a 10-km buffer 
zone extending inland from the coastline. This procedure effec-
tively corrected misclassifications between forest and mangroves 
resulting from “spectral confusion”.

2000 to 2008. Generally, government understanding of the importance 
of coastal environment protection has lagged behind economic devel-
opment, resulting in a large reduction in mangrove forest.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves creating training samples and extracting landscape types using the random forest algorithm. Sample points are generated in the image of the study area for each year, which are then divided into training and validation datasets at a 7:3 ratio. After applying post-classification processing to the images, manual visual interpretation is used to correct any misclassifications between forest and mangroves due to spectral confusion. However, there is no specific mention of how the model performance is monitored or evaluated during training. It can be assumed that standard practices such as cross-validation or tracking metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score might have been employed.
