2.3. Deep learning models 

2.3.1. Semantic segmentation for vegetation mapping

et al., 2023; Hodgson et al., 2018; Ventura et al., 2018). These two deep 
learning approaches require initial ground-truth datasets consisting of 
annotated images, which are used to train a model that iteratively im-
proves  by  evaluating  its  output  against the  provided  annotations  and 
adjusting its parameters to match the desired output. Once trained, the 
models can be applied to new datasets for automatic classification, of-
fering  flexibility  and  power  by  learning  directly  from  image  output. 
Recent advancements in open-source user frameworks have made deep 
learning more accessible (Christin et al., 2019; Paszke et al., 2019; Perry 
et al., 2022). With this study, we aim to further stimulate the uptake of 
deep  learning  techniques  in  ecology  and  conservation  by  providing 
open-access scripts that can be adapted to various ecosystems, including 
challenging coastal environments.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The paper does not provide explicit information on specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it mentions the use of ground-truth datasets consisting of annotated images for training deep learning models, which implies some form of data preparation and preprocessing. To ensure accurate and unbiased results, it is common practice to employ techniques like those mentioned in the query when preparing and preprocessing data for deep learning applications. Without additional context or information, it cannot be determined if any of these specific methods were employed in this particular study.
