Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not directly address the query about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide some general strategies often employed to manage randomness in such scenarios.

Randomness in deep learning pipelines typically arises from various sources like initialization of weights, shuffling of training data, or dropout regularization. To ensure reproducibility and consistency across experiments, several strategies can be adopted:

1. **Fixed Random Seeds**: Setting a fixed random seed value ensures that the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers is generated each time the code runs. This helps maintain consistent results between different runs of the same experiment.

2. **Deterministic Operations**: Some operations, like certain types of matrix multiplication, can have non-deterministic implementations. Using deterministic versions of these operations can help reduce variability in results.

3. **Repeat Experiments**: Running the same experiment multiple times with different seeds and averaging the results can give a more robust estimate of performance. This can also reveal if any observed differences are statistically significant.

4. **Reproducible Environments**: Using containerization tools like Docker or Singularity can help create reproducible environments where all dependencies and configurations are controlled.
