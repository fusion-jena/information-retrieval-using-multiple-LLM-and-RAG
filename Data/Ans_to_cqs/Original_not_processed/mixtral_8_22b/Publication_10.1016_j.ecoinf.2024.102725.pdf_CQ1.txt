coverage, thereby enhancing the accuracy of the prediction results.

This article presents a new high-quality NDVI image product and a
technical framework for regularizing dense-time-series data with high
spatial resolution. This framework offers a feasible method for recon-
structing cloud-free high-resolution NDVI datasets. Using the SOWCEM
technology framework, we successfully produce a Sentinel-2 normalized
NDVI time-series dataset with a 10 m spatial resolution for crop growth
physiological cycles. The key concept of the algorithm is the introduc-
tion of optimal weighted allocation, which calculates and allocates
optimal weights for the prediction simulation results based on spatial
and temporal dimensions. By minimizing the sum of squares of the
combined prediction errors within a specific time period, the algorithm
achieves an optimal combination of prediction model results at the pixel
scale. This method effectively combines the temporal and spatial feature
information of two prediction models, providing a robust approach for

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that remote sensing techniques are employed to gather data related to vegetation indices such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). These techniques typically involve using satellite or airborne sensors to capture images of Earth's surface, which can then be processed to extract information about vegetation health, coverage, and other relevant parameters. Some examples of these sensors include MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and Sentinel-2 satellites. Additionally, the context mentions the use of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technology for generating synthetic optical images, suggesting that radar data may also be collected as part of the process. Publicly available datasets, such as those derived from satellite imagery, could potentially serve as sources of raw data for this application.
