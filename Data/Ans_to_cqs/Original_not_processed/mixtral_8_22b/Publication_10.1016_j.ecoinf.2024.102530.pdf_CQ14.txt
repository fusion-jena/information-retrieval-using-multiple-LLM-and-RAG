Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

b)  Pollinator specie table: this table provides the InVEST model with 
information on bee species, flight distance and nesting requirements 
for each species (Sharp et al., 2014). In this study, we focus only on 
honey bees. Studies have shown that the flight distance of honey bees 
can reach up to 5 km and vary depending on factors like air tem-
perature, the presence of nearby water sources, and floral resources 
near the hive (Tan et al., 2012). We used the same flight distance as 
in these studies Cunningham et al. (2018); Eeraerts et al. (2023) to 
build our pollinator table (Supplementary material, Table S1.1).  
c)  Biophysical attribute table: this table assesses the quality of each 
landscape  area  in  terms  of  its  ability  to  provide  honey  bees  with 
nesting  and/or  foraging  or  nesting  and  foraging  resources  (Sharp 
et al., 2014). Our study includes two evaluations for each land cover

Other studies have noted that reducing the pixel size from 25 m to 5 m in 
urban areas increases the value of the pollination model (Grafius et al., 
2016). Furthermore, Rayner et al. (2021) found that reducing the pixel 
size from 100 to 10 m yield the prediction of abundance of wild bees by 
43%. As a result, they recommend using the 10 m resolution pixel in an 
agricultural context to make more accurate decisions when interpreting 
the output of the crop pollination model.

%Query
Query: "How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether grid search, random search, or another method was used for optimization based solely on the provided information.
