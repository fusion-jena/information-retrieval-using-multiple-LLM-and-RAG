Fig. 4. Performance of the object detection model. The plot depicts bounding box precision (the fraction of insect-containing bounding boxes among all bounding 
boxes returned by the algorithm), as a function of recall (the proportion of all insects that were identified by the algorithm, Gerovichev et al., 2021). Each point 
represents an average precision of a 0.04 recall range. The precision for objects detected with a high (>0.98) confidence score is high, and drops for objects detected 
with lower confidence (<0.90). At the highest recall values, the confidence score is almost 0. The failure to reach higher recall is due to the identification of very close 
insects as a single entity (see Fig. 3). To produce the object detection model, and estimate its performance, we manually annotated all individual insects in 150 scans

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics such as bounding box precision and recall. Bounding box precision refers to the fraction of insect-containing bounding boxes among all bounding boxes returned by the algorithm. Recall, on the other hand, represents the proportion of all insects that were identified by the algorithm. In this case, each point in Figure 4 represents an average precision of a 0.04 recall range. The precision for objects detected with a high (>0.98) confidence score is high, and it drops for objects detected with lower confidence (<0.90). However, at the highest recall values, the confidence score is almost 0. This failure to reach higher recall is attributed to the identification of very close insects as a single entity.
