all  based  on  the  lower  level  representations  learned  in  previous

development  is  shifting  from  programs  hand-written  by  domain 
experts, to training machines by examples â€“ often millions of data 
points  in  the  case  of  difficult  problems  such  as  unconstrained 
image recognition [32]. The major enablers for the success of DL 
have  been  the  availability  of  large  amounts  of  data,  and  the 
corresponding  computational  infrastructure  required  by  the 
learning  algorithms.  In  comparison  to  other  ML  algorithms,  the 
performance of a DL algorithm scales very well with the number 
of  training  examples  and  the  amount  of  compute  cycles  can  be

The specific subfield of ML that we have invested in is known as 
Deep  Learning  (DL)  [31].  DL  is  a  quickly  growing  and  vibrant 
field;  here  we  summarize  our  use  of  DL  and  postulate  how 
biodiversity monitoring can be improved using various properties 
of DL algorithms.

DL  grew  out  of  the  fields  of  representation  learning,  neural 
networks,  and  computational  neuroscience.  It  employs  trainable 
computational  models  composed  of  a  potentially  large  stack  of 
processing layers. Each layer learns a more abstract representation 
of  the  data  based  on  the  more  elementary  representation  in  the 
previous  layer.  For  instance,  in  image  recognition,  the  first  layer 
commonly  represents  any  image  by  its  low  level  visual  features 
such as local edges or gradients. Subsequent layers can be seen to 
combine these low level features in various combinations to form 
corners or textures. In the deepest layers, semantic representations 
are  formed  related  to  the  specific  task  at  hand.  For  example,  in 
face  recognition,  there  forms  a  representation  of  eyes  and  noses, 
and then combinations of those in various geometric relationships,

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps may be involved depending on the nature of the dataset and the problem being solved. While the given context does not explicitly mention specific preprocessing techniques, it provides insights into some general aspects of preparing data for deep learning models. Here are some common preprocessing steps:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing or correcting erroneous data points, handling missing values, and eliminating irrelevant information. Ensuring clean and accurate data helps improve the performance of deep learning models.

2. Normalization/Scaling: Deep learning models work better when all input features have similar scales. Techniques like Min-Max Scaling, Z-score normalization, or Log Transformation can help bring feature values within a comparable range.

3. Feature Engineering: This step involves creating new features from existing ones to provide additional information to the model. Examples include extracting statistical measures, combining multiple variables, or applying transformations like polynomial expansion.

4. Encoding Categorical Variables: Since deep learning models cannot directly process categorical data, encoding methods like one-hot encoding or label encoding are used to convert them into numerical format.

5. Splitting Dataset: Before training, datasets are typically split into three parts - training set, validation set, and test set. Training sets are used to fit the model, while validation sets help tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Test sets evaluate the final model's performance.

6. Augmentation: In tasks involving images, audio, or video, data augmentation techniques like rotation, flipping, cropping, or adding noise can increase the size and diversity of the dataset, improving model robustness.
