We  have  also  adopted  a  broader  and  more  conservative  testing 
strategy as in the classification problem (Q1) involving excluding three 
transects (~17% of the data) for testing in each iteration, specifically 
one  from  each  target  class  -  "Plateau"  (p),  "White-sand"  (w),  and  "Ri-
parian" (r), cross-validation is the same as before with the classification 
problem  (see  2.5.1).  In  order  to  measure  the  model’s  performance 
across all transects, a cumulative evaluation was also performed. Instead 
of analyzing each iteration separately, we assess the model using coef-
ficient  of  determination  (R2)  between  true  vs  predicted  for  all  648 
multitemporal transects predictions.

package  in  R  (Liaw  and  Wiener,  2002).  We  tuned  the  mtry  hyper-
parameter with the caret package in R (Kuhn, 2008) while keeping other 
hyperparameters at their default values. However, we explored varia-
tions in the ntree parameter, experimenting with settings of 500, 1000, 
5000, and 10,000. With a cutoff of 0.7, we also tested models in which 
features are selected prior to training using the findCorrelation function 
in the Caret package in R. We also used a majority voting strategy, using 
the mode for classification Q1 and the median for Q2 regression (see 
2.5.1  and  2.5.2).  In  this  process,  each  5-m  segment  within  a  450  m 
multitemporal  transect  is  assigned  a  predicted  class  or  a  continuous 
value for regression. This side-by-side analysis allowed us to assess the 
relative performance, effectiveness, and accuracy of our novel image- 
based  machine-learning  approach  in  contrast  to  ‘traditional’  metrics- 
based methods.

accuracy of 83% when the majority voting strategy is applied, and the objects 
being classified are the eighteen multitemporal (3*150 m) 450 m transects. For 
each multitemporal transect of 450 m, the topographical class predicted most 
frequently (or simply the mode) among all of its 5-m segments is considered the 
final prediction for that multitemporal transect. Weighted F1 Score was 0.83.

Helpful Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves adopting a broader and more conservative testing strategy. Specifically, one transect from each target class ("Plateau", "White-sand", and "Riparian") is excluded for testing in each iteration, accounting for approximately 17% of the data. Cross-validation is employed similarly to the classification problem. To evaluate the model's overall performance across all transects, a cumulative assessment is conducted by measuring the coefficient of determination (R^2) between true versus predicted values for all 648 multitemporal transect predictions. Additionally, the study employs a comparative evaluation of traditional LiDAR-derived metrics and 2D point cloud image-based machine learning approaches for forest type classification and regression analysis. Hyperparameters such as'mtry' and 'ntree' are fine-tuned using the caret package in R, while features are selected prior to training using the findCorrelation function. Furthermore, a majority voting strategy is utilized, employing the mode for classification and the median for regression. Each 5-m segment within a 450 m multitemporal transect is assigned a predicted class or a continuous value for regression. This allows for a side-by-side comparison to assess the relative performance, effectiveness, and accuracy of the proposed image-based machine learning method against traditional metric-based techniques.
