Fig. 5. Network structure for supervised learning of the fish factor (FF) with all 
measured  variables  as  predictors.  The  latent  FF  comprised  the  manifest  vari-
ables from corals, sponges and gorgonians.

The MWST-learned network was used for the final clustering of each 
group  of  variables.  The  connections  between  nodes  for  different  taxa 
variables  were  first  removed  so  that  only  within-taxon  connections 
remained (Fig. S2). The number of factors requested for variable clus-
tering was chosen based on the number of taxa. Multiple clustering was 
used to construct a new latent factor variable for each taxon, generating 
multiple  cluster  states  within  each  latent  factor  variable.  These  four 
latent variables were then themselves clustered to create a higher-level 
latent factor variable, a meta-cluster, that summarized the cluster states 
across  taxa.  This  meta-clustering  provides  a  hierarchical  clustering 
network that summarizes information on the coral reef community from 
the measured variables across taxa. This network also includes all factor 
nodes  and  observable  nodes  from  monitoring  data  so  it  provides  an
