3. Results 

As indicated before, the ANN model utilised in this study comprises 
an  input,  hidden,  and  output  layer.  The  input  layer  comprises  three 
processing elements (neurons) corresponding to the LST, temperature, 
and precipitation parameters. The EVI data was used as the output layer. 
The number of neurons in the hidden layer is a crucial factor influencing 
the learning capability of the network. Insufficient neurons may hinder 
successful learning, while excessive neurons may lead to over fitting and 
compromise the network’s performance (Çakır, 2018). In this study, the 
number of neurons in the hidden layer was incrementally to determine 
the optimal configuration that yields the best results.

2.3.3. Modelling 

Artificial  neural  networks  are  a  successful  method  in  modelling 
studies and are frequently discussed in the literature. Essentially, neural 
networks learn from past and present data, uncover hidden relationships 
among  the  data,  and  utilise  them  to  make  predictions  for  future  sce-
narios. Among the various types of artificial neural network models, the 
NARX model is widely employed. In this study, the NARX feedback ANN 
model  was  utilised  to  define  vegetation  biomass  density  for  2030.  A 
hybrid  model  was  developed  by  combining  wavelet  analysis  and  the 
NARX ANN algorithm to enhance the performance of the NARX ANN 
model.

By employing the W-ANN model, the training values reached 96% 
for Iznik and 91% for Alanya, while the estimated percentages for all 
data increased to 95% for Iznik and 88% for Alanya, respectively. The 
developed hybrid model improved learning success, with an increase of 
18.7%  in  Iznik  and  7.3%  in  Alanya,  as  determined  by  the  network’s 
performance.  These  findings  highlight  the  hybrid  model’s  enhanced 
predictive capabilities and effectiveness in both study areas.

The model’s training was conducted using data from 2005 to 2015, 
encompassing 264 data points. Subsequently, data from 2016 to 2018, 
comprising  72  data  points,  were  reserved  for  testing  and  validation 
purposes.  This  data  partitioning  resulted  in  a  distribution  of  60%  for 
training and 40% for validation and testing. 

To evaluate the performance of the model, several statistical metrics 
were  employed,  including  the  Mean  Absolute  Percent  Error  (MAPE), 
Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and cor-
relation coefficient (R). These metrics provide insights into the accuracy 
and predictive capability of the model by measuring the deviation be-
tween the predicted EVI values and the actual observed values.

Helpful Answer:

In the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that some form of preprocessing would have been necessary due to the nature of the data being used.

Preprocessing steps typically involve preparing raw data so that it can be effectively utilized by machine learning algorithms. Common preprocessing techniques include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing or correcting erroneous data such as missing values, outliers, or inconsistent entries.

2. Normalization: This process scales numeric columns to a range between 0 and 1. It helps prevent attributes with higher magnitudes from dominating those with smaller ones during the learning process.

3. Feature Scaling: Similar to normalization, feature scaling rescales features to improve the efficiency of gradient descent methods. Techniques like Min-Max scaling and Standardization are commonly used.

4. Encoding Categorical Variables: Machine learning algorithms work primarily with numerical data. Therefore, categorical variables need to be converted into numerical format through encoding techniques like label encoding or one-hot encoding.

5. Splitting Dataset: The dataset is often split into training, validation, and test sets. Training set is used to train the model, validation set to tune hyperparameters, and test set to assess the final model's performance.

While these are common preprocessing steps, the exact requirements depend on the specific problem and the type of data being used. For instance, image data might require different preprocessing steps compared to tabular data.
