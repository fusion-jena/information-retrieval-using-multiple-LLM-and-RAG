3.2. Random forest model 

According to the parameter optimization results of the random forest 
(RF)  model,  five  training  samples  were  analyzed,  whose  importance 
scores (VI) were obtained by simulation, and the selected variables were 
sorted according to their scores. The results are shown in Fig. 3, in which 
the VI plots for the five samples are consistent; the scores of the selected 
10 variables were more than 20% VI, and showed a threshold of 30% VI, 
above which the variables assumed higher importance (Fig. 3). In the 
training  and  test  datasets,  the  intermediate  models  established  by  RF 
showed that the proportion of explained variance was between 91% and 
92%  (Table  4).  Further,  the  correlation  coefficients  between  the

In order to ensure a similar process between the two methods, the 
same subset data were used to apply an RF. Before running the model, it 
was necessary to define two basic parameters in advance: the number of 
variables to try (M), and the number of trees to run (Nt), at each split. 
The parameter M was found through the internal RF function TuneRF, 
which  calculates  the  optimal  number  of  variables  starting  from  the 
default  value  and  finds  the  value  with  the  minimum  OOB  error  rate 
below and above the threshold value (i.e., one-third of the total number 
of  variables  for  regression).  The  function  looks  below  and  above  this 
threshold for the value with the minimum OOB error rate. Typically, the 
value  of  M  in  the  RF  model  is  largely  based  on  empirical  formula. 
However, in this study, the alternate method of successive screening was 
used to determine the optimal parameter M, which attempts to take all

RMSE between the measured and fitting values is 146.202 and 117.430 
ion/cm3, and  the  linear correlation  R2  is  0.275 and  0.980,  indicating 
that the RF model has high prediction accuracy and good fitting effect. 
In addition, to further verify the model’s stability, independent test data 
were used in the RF model for 10-fold cross-validation, and the results 
are shown in Table 5. For that test, the average R2  was 0.931 and the 
average RMSE was 141.124 ion/cm3, reaffirming that the RF model has 
high simulation accuracy and good stability.

Helpful Answer:

The hyperparameters of the Random Forest (RF) model in this case are optimized using an alternate method called successive screening. This method attempts to find the optimal number of variables (M) to be tried at each split. The optimal value of M is determined by looking below and above a certain threshold, which is typically one-third of the total number of variables for regression. The goal is to find the value of M that results in the minimum Out-Of-Bag (OOB) error rate. Unlike other methods such as grid search or random search, successive screening does not rely on predefined ranges or random sampling of hyperparameter values. Instead, it systematically screens different values of M until the optimal value is found.
