3.2.2. Retrieval results 

The retrieval experiments ensued the following strategy: every image 
is used as a query image and is matched with every remaining image in 
the database. Tables 6 and 7 present the retrieval performances of all the 
networks in terms of the four considered measures by choosing the top 
100 matches, i.e. η = 100, and the two chosen similarity distances. 

3.3. Deep learning vs traditional machine learning comparison 

A comparison of deep learning approaches with traditional machine

Our study was mainly to propose a new model based on CNN, which 
provides an efficient and effective approach for single seed classification 
and retrieval. Our network architecture, SeedNet, contains six learnable 
layers, 5 of which are convolutional, and the last is fully-connected. The 
ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation is applied to the output of every 
convolutional  layer.  Moreover,  we  periodically  insert  a  pooling  layer 
between successive convolutional layers, in order to reduce the amount 
of parameters and computation in the network, and hence to also control 
overfitting. More precisely, we employ a Max pooling strategy with a 
3 × 3 filter size, and 1 × 1 stride. The input image size is 224 × 224 × 3. 
According to the chosen dataset, the output of the last fully-connected 
layer  is  fed  to  a  N-way  softmax,  which  produces  a  distribution  over 
the N class labels to predict, i.e. 6 for the Canadian and 23 for the local

retrieval measurements. 

To  sum  up,  SeedNet  seems  robust  for  both  tasks,  reaching 
outstanding performance results with both datasets and having a low 
training time if compared to the  other examined networks. However, 
other CNNs obtained satisfactory results, like the Residual Networks (e. 
g. ResNet18) in both tasks, or SqueezeNet in the retrieval one. The CNNs 
are also generally preferable in performances with respect to the tradi-
tional  methods,  even  though  the  last  ones  reached  interesting  results 
with low training times. 

4. Conclusions

As expected for the retrieval task performed with deep features, the 
similarity  measure  influences  the  retrieval  performances,  and  for  our 
problem, the best one seems to be the Euclidean distance (See Table 6 
and 7). Even a little less effective than for classification, the results can 
be considered satisfying and confirm the potential use of deep learning 
techniques for retrieval tasks. Overall, our proposed model turns out to 
be the most performing among the considered networks.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model such as using diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, some aspects mentioned could contribute to improving the model's generalization capabilities indirectly.

Firstly, the study proposes a new model called SeedNet, which consists of six learnable layers, five of them being convolutional, and the last one being fully connected. This design allows the model to extract relevant features from images effectively. Additionally, ReLU activation function is applied after each convolutional layer, enabling nonlinearity and preventing vanishing gradient problems.

Secondly, max pooling layers are inserted between consecutive convolutional layers to downsample feature maps, reducing computational complexity and controlling overfitting. By doing so, the model becomes more resilient to variations in the data, thus enhancing its ability to generalize better.

Lastly, the model uses a diverse dataset containing different classes of seeds, specifically 6 classes for the Canadian dataset and 23 classes for the local dataset. Although not explicitly stated, this diversity might help improve the model's capacity to handle various types of inputs, contributing to its overall generalizability.

In conclusion, while the text does not provide direct evidence of specific techniques employed to guarantee the generalizability of the deep learning model, it suggests several factors that may positively impact the model's capability to generalize well. These include the model's architecture, usage of max pooling layers, and application of a diverse dataset.
