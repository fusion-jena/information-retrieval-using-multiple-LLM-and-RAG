Priority  restoration  zones  exhibit  a  complex  mosaic  of  patches, 
indicating  a  balanced  juxtaposition  of  diverse  carbon-sequestration 
land-use types, suggesting high restoration potential. Maintaining this 
balanced interaction among land uses is crucial for enhancing carbon 
sequestration functions (Di Sacco et al., 2021). Management strategies 
should  restore  degraded  ecosystems(e.g.,  deforested  areas  and  wet-
lands), while integrating landscape heterogeneity and patch complexity

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved to ensure the input data is suitable for the model. These steps may include:

1. Normalization or Scaling: This involves transforming the features so they have zero mean and unit variance, or rescaling them between a specific range such as [0, 1] or [-1, 1]. This helps prevent any single feature from dominating the others due to its scale, improving convergence during optimization.

2. Cleaning: This step removes missing or inconsistent data points, outliers, or irrelevant features. It also corrects errors and fills gaps in the dataset if necessary. Properly cleaned data ensures better performance and generalizability of the trained models.

3. Feature Engineering: This process creates new features from existing ones to improve the predictive power of the model. Examples include polynomial features, binning, encoding categorical variables, etc.

4. Encoding: For categorical features, one-hot encoding or label encoding can be used to convert these non-numerical attributes into numerical form.

5. Dimensionality Reduction: Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, removing redundant or correlated features. This not only speeds up computation but also improves model interpretability.

6. Data Augmentation: To increase the size of the dataset and introduce more variability, synthetic samples can be generated through techniques like rotation, flipping, zooming, cropping, etc.

These preprocessing steps help prepare the data for efficient and effective training of deep learning models. However, it should be noted that the choice of preprocessing methods depends on the nature of the problem and the characteristics of the available data.
