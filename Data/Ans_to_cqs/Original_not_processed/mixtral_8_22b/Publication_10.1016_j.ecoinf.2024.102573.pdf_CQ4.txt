2.4. Data augmentation 

Data  augmentation  refers  to  any  label  (semantic)  preserving  data 
transformation. Such techniques have proven valuable in enhancing the 
generalization capability of neural networks as they artificially enrich 
the dataset size and diversity. Similar to the normalization scheme, it 
contributes to inconsistencies among the published results. This work 
uses four popular data augmentation for the audio waveform, including 
changing audio speed, pitch shift, amplitude scaling (a.k.a gain modu-
lation),  and  adding  Gaussian  noise.  The  ablation  study  examines  the 
models in the presence and absence of data augmentation. The project 
repository provides additional implementation details. 

2.5. Audio frontends

Data  augmentation:  Although  the  data  augmentation  was  less 
effective than anticipated, we only augmented the waveform to reduce 
the  backend’s  randomness  and  keep  the  experiments  manageable. 
However, the backend could benefit from time-frequency augmentation 
techniques (Park et al., 2019). Thus, we encourage the practitioners to 
try  both  types  of  data  augmentation  for  potential  gain.  For  example, 
adding Gaussian noise could be more effective if applied on the back-
end’s input since the frontend could reduce it by smoothing. Also, we 
suggest focusing more on sensible transformations that one can readily 
trust in their general benefits. Showing that a particular audio classifier 
benefits from extreme image data augmentation is suspicious since they 
do not respect the physical meaning of time-frequency representations. 
For example, birds do not sing flipped or rotated, but slight frequency

datasets.  They  are  not  flexible  enough  to  address  current  open  chal-
lenges unless used purposefully on a narrow task.

3.1. Main results 

Table 2 shows the test results. The largest performance gap between 
the learnable and traditional frontends stems from using PCEN instead 
of log compression. When combined with PCEN, the (mel-)spectrogram 
is on par with the learnable frontends. Noticeably, a proper normaliza-
tion on top of the log compression produced similar results to the PCEN 
version of the models. It is hard to eyeball some of these effects, espe-
cially for the data augmentation. Therefore, a performance summary for 
the 48 models is depicted in Fig. 3 to comprehend the importance of 
each component. Fig. 4 shows the confusion matrices of the base and the 
best configuration for each frontend.

Helpful Answer:
The text mentions several data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline for audio waveforms. These include changing audio speed, pitch shift, amplitude scaling (also known as gain modulation), and adding Gaussian noise. However, it's important to note that while these techniques were found to enhance the generalization capabilities of neural networks, they were less effective than expected when applied solely to the waveform. The authors suggest exploring time-frequency augmentation techniques, such as applying Gaussian noise to the backend's input, which might yield better results due to the reduction of noise through smoothing. Additionally, the authors recommend focusing on'sensible transformations' that maintain the physical meaning of time-frequency representations.
