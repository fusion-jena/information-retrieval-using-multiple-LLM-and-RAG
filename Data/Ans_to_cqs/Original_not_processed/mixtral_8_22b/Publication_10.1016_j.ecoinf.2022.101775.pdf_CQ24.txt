2.2. Embedding layers 

(5)  

Embedding  layers  are  modules  of  deep  neural  networks  that  are 
generally  implemented  in  natural  language  processing  problems 
(Sharma  et  al.,  2020)  and  collaborative  filtering  (He  et  al.,  2017) 
because they can solve the one-hot encoding problem (Yu et al., 2022), 
where the latent representations in the classic models are composed of 
sparse representations generally using vectors mainly composed of zero 
layers  replace  such  dispersed  vectors  with 
values.  Embedding

We  trained  algorithms  with  the  amount  of  data  available  after 
manually  removing  the  testing  set,  as  described  above.  During  the 
training, 10% of data served as the validation set to check for overfitting. 
We used a min-max scaler reverted at the end to compute the perfor-
mance metrics in the test set. In all cases, we used a batch size of 64 
samples and trained the algorithm during 100 epochs using Adam as the 
algorithm  to  optimize  the  network  parameters.  Algorithms  were 
implemented in Pytorch (Paszke et al., n.d.) and models were trained 
and tested in Google Colaboratory.2

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, including managing random seed values. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning pipelines to use techniques like setting fixed seeds or using deterministic algorithms to ensure reproducibility and consistency across experiments. This helps mitigate the effects of randomness introduced by various components, such as weight initialization, shuffling training examples, or dropout regularization. Additionally, cross-validation and ensemble methods can also help reduce variance caused by randomness.
