For standalone object detection, annotation typically focuses solely 
on  the  recognition  and  marking  of  bounding  boxes.  However,  in  the 
context of this research, our detection module has been seamlessly in-
tegrated with instance segmentation, necessitating the inclusion of mask 
annotations that precisely align with the segmented contours during the 
dataset  preparation.  To  maintain  uniformity  and  coherence,  we  have 
classified  both  the  bounding  boxes  and  masks  within  the  Roboflow

integrated visualization. 

After choosing the benchmark model, we move forward to input the 
annotated dataset into the model for several rounds of rigorous training. 
This iterative process allows us to derive the optimal set of weights that 
enhance  the  model’s  performance  to  its  maximum.  Following  this 
training phase, we carry out exhaustive detection tests, and the resulting 
outcomes are displayed in Fig. 8.

Helpful Answer:
The text provides information about the use of two main data annotation techniques in the deep learning pipeline: bounding box annotation and instance segmentation. Bounding box annotation is commonly used for standalone object detection tasks, where it involves recognizing and marking objects with rectangular or square shapes around them. On the other hand, instance segmentation is employed when there is a need to distinguish between different instances of the same class of objects. This technique requires more detailed annotations, such as pixel-level labeling, which can be time-consuming but provide better accuracy.

In the given context, the researchers integrated their detection module with instance segmentation, requiring the inclusion of mask annotations that precisely align with the segmented contours during dataset preparation. Both bounding boxes and masks were classified within the Roboflow integrated visualization to ensure uniformity and coherence. After preparing the annotated dataset, they moved forward to input it into the chosen benchmark model for several rounds of rigorous training. This iterative process allowed them to derive the optimal set of weights that enhance the model’s performance to its maximum.

Therefore, the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline include bounding box annotation and instance segmentation. While bounding box annotation is suitable for simple object detection tasks, instance segmentation offers more precise results by distinguishing between different instances of the same class of objects.
