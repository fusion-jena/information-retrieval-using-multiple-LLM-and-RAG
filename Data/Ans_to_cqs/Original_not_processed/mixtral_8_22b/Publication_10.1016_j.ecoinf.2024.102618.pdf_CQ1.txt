accuracy values. 

This  dataset  is  used  after  these  pre-processing  steps  with  the  sug-
gested models. Table 3 presents a comparison between different trained 
deep learning models proposed in this paper. The table shows the five 
different  deep  learning  models  chosen  for  this  application  and  their 
reported  accuracy  and  F1-score.  The  table  also  shows  ten  different

Accuracy

3.7. Performance metrics 

In this work, we measure the accuracy of the deep-learning models 

by using the following metrics:  

• Accuracy 

accuracy which is a simple metric for deep-learning classification 
models. This metric measures the overall percentage of correct pre-
dictions. However, accuracy does not take into account the different 
types  of  errors.  That  is  the  reason  we  employ  other  metrics  for 
measuring the efficiency of deep learning models. 

Accuracy =

TP + TN
TP + TN + FP + FN

• Precision 

(1)    

Precision  is  a  metric  that  measures  the  number  of  positive  pre-
dictions  that  are  actually  correct  viz.  a  viz.  correct  and  incorrect 
positive predictions. 

recall is a metric that measures the number of positive predictions 
that are actually correct viz. a viz. correct positive predictions and 
incorrect negative predictions. Recall measures how many positive 
predictions were correctly spotted by the model. 

Recall = TP

TP + FN

Ensemble deep learning models

Different  deep  learning  models  are  tested  to  find  the  model  with  the 
highest accuracy. The results show that EfficientNet achieves the highest 
accuracy.  A  data  augmentation  technique  is  added  to  increase  the 
number  of  images  from 55,448  to  61,486  images.  Results  of  the  pro-
posed deep learning models on the dataset with and without augmen-
tation  are  reported. This  work  augments  the  dataset using a  complex 
data augmentation technique to produce a new dataset. However, in our 
proposed work we use an augmented version of PlanVillage that can be 
used by different researchers for comparison. Also, we propose using a

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of a dataset, which could imply that publicly available datasets or previously collected data were used. Additionally, there is mention of data augmentation techniques being applied to increase the number of images, suggesting that visual data was involved. Therefore, while the exact method of data collection is not specified, it can be inferred that publicly available datasets containing visual data were likely used.
