hyperparameters  (i.e.,  ‘AutoML’;  He  et  al.,  2021).  This  represents  an 
important  advantage  for  non-experts  in  deep  learning,  as  it  does  not 
require  the  manual  assembly  of  the  models  and  definition  of  their 
hyperparameters. The AutoML procedure starts by generating a set of 
candidate models with architectures and hyperparameters (e.g. number 
of layers; learning rate) selected at random from a prespecified range of 
values (see Fig. 2). Each candidate model is trained using a small subset 
of the data (data partition At; Fig. 2) during a small number of epochs. 
After  training,  the  performance  of  the  candidate  models  is  compared 
using a left-out validation data set (Av; Fig. 2). The selected candidate 
model (usually the best performing among candidates) is then trained on 
the full training data (Bt; Fig. 2). In this step it is required to identify an 
optimal number of training epochs, to avoid under- or overfitting of the

demanding, alternatives. Research efforts should also attempt to identify 
the deep learning architectures and hyperparameters that are best suited 
for specific ecological phenomena and data types. Thus far, classification 
performances  from  distinct  deep  learning  typologies  were  compared 
using time series data coming from multiple domains (e.g. Fawaz et al., 
2019), and the relevance of these results to ecology remains uncertain. 
Differently  from  feature-based  approaches,  deep  learning  ap-
proaches  allow  classifying  phenomena  directly  from  raw  time  series 
data,  a  characteristic  that  requires  ecologists  to  think  more  critically 
about the temporal component of the phenomena being classified. This 
increased  relevance  of  the  temporal  dimension  was,  perhaps,  best 
illustrated by using continuous climate data (cid:0)
instead of the usual long- 
term climate averages (cid:0)
for predicting the potential distribution of a

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, some clues can be found regarding the nature of the data used in deep learning pipelines. For instance, the text mentions the use of 'raw time series data', which suggests that data collection might involve sensors or other devices capable of recording measurements over time. Additionally, there is a reference to 'continuous climate data' being used instead of 'long-term climate averages'. This implies that real-time or near real-time data could be collected through various means such as weather stations, satellites, or drones equipped with environmental sensors. Furthermore, the context discusses the application of deep learning in ecology, where data might be gathered via field surveys, camera traps, acoustic recorders, or citizen science initiatives. Lastly, the citation of papers related to insect biometrics and image-based species identification indicates that imagery data could also play a significant role in certain deep learning pipelines within ecology. Therefore, while the exact methods for collecting raw data are not specified, one can infer that they may include a combination of sensor technologies, field observations, and publicly available datasets depending on the specific requirements of the deep learning task at hand.
