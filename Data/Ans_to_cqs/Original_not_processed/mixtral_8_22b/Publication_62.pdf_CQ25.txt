Deep learning can greatly surpass conventional machine learning by incorporating multi-
layered neural networks capable of processing natural data in their raw form (LeCun et al.
2015).   Deep   convolutional   neural   networks   (CNNs)   are   especially   well   suited   to   image
classiﬁcation and may even achieve superhuman performance (He et al. 2015). Already,
CNNs are playing important roles in healthcare, speech recognition, and driverless cars.
Natural history collections (NHCs) also beneﬁt society in numerous ways, most notably
supporting   public   health,   safety,   and   agriculture   (Suarez   and   Tsutsui   2004).   NHCs   are
likewise fundamental to understanding biodiversity and they underlie studies of evolution,
habitat loss, biological invasion, and climate change. The billions of specimens in NHCs
could   undoubtedly   provide   even   greater   social   and   scientiﬁc   insight,   but   their   data   are

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning models described in this paper is not explicitly stated, however, based on the information provided, it appears that these models are being used for image classification tasks. Specifically, there are two separate models mentioned: one for classifying images of unstained vs. stained samples, and another for classifying images of clubmoss vs. spikemoss plants. Both models use a deep convolutional neural network architecture, which is commonly used for image classification tasks. Additionally, both models include a softmax layer at the output, which is typically used to produce probabilities for each possible class label. Therefore, it can be inferred that the primary goal of these models is to accurately classify input images into one of two categories.
