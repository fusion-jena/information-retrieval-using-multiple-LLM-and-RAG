Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

The  mini-batch  size  is  user-adjustable  (typically  in  binary-number 
increments,  e.g.  2,  4,  8,  16,  32,  etc.)  depending  on  the  data  set.  Too 
small  a  mini-batch  size  may  provide  insufficient  image  data  for  the 
network  to  meaningfully  learn from  some or  all  of  the  classes  within 
each iteration, while too large a mini-batch size may cause the network 
to  overfit  to  the  training  images.  Because  of  the  high  computational 
complexity  of  the  deep  learning  process,  the  mini-batch  size  is  ulti-
mately limited by the amount of memory available to the GPU (in our 
case 8 GB), factoring in the size of the images (in our case 224 × 224 
pixels × 3 bands) and the number of internal parameters in the network 
(25.6 million in the case of ResNet-50). Thus, we were limited to mini-

Details of the parameters and settings we used for these two training 
stages are summarized in Table 1.

other class(es). The network then performs a new round of learning on 
the  mini-batch  of  images—focusing  relatively  more  on  images  with 
higher  loss  scores—and  updates  its  internal  parameters,  before  pro-
ceeding to the next training iteration with a new mini-batch of images. A 
full cycle through the entire set of training images is referred to as an 
‘epoch’,  and  the  number  of  iterations  per  epoch  is  equal  to  the  total 
number of training images divided by the mini-batch size.

2.2. Deep learning tools, principles and practicalities 

We  performed  all  deep  learning-related  operations  in  MATLAB 
2020b  (MathWorks  Inc.,  Natick,  MA,  USA)  equipped  with  the  Image 
Processing,  Computer  Vision,  Deep  Learning,  and  Parallel  Computing 
toolboxes. CNN training and image classification operations were pro-
cessed  on a  GeForce RTX  2070 Super  graphics processing  unit (GPU) 
(Nvidia Corp., Santa Clara, CA, USA) with 8 GB of memory. 

As the foundation of our CNN for detecting polar bears, we used the 
freely available residual network ResNet-50 (He et al., 2016), which has 
been  pre-trained  on  >1  million  images  from  the  ImageNet  database 
(http://www.image-net.org)  to  recognize  1000  categories  of  common 
objects,  including  numerous  animals.  Although  the  vast  majority  of 
these images are of an entirely different nature and/or visual perspective
