Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

metrics  used are  precision  (P),  recall  (R), harmonic  mean  of  P and  R 
(F1), and mean average precision (mAP). The formulas for calculating 
the evaluation indicators are as follows:

EfficientnetV2 is an efficient, lightweight feature extraction network. 
The  EfficientNet  series  comprises  a  set  of  lightweight  convolutional 
neural networks. In the EfficientNetV1 series, Google’s focus was pre-
dominantly on optimizing the accuracy, parameter count, and compu-
tational  requirements  of  the  model  (Tan  and  Le,  2019).  The 
EfficientNetV2  series  further  reduces  the  number  of  parameters  and 
computations  while  preserving  the  accuracy  of  the  model,  leading  to 
significant  decreases  in  model  training  and  inference  duration. 
Furthermore, the EfficientNetV2 network uses an improved progressive 
learning approach that dynamically adjusts the regularization method 
based on the training image size. This method can improve the training 
speed  and  accuracy  of  the  network.  Compared  with  some  previous 
networks, the experimental results of this method show that the training

speed is increased by 11 times, and the number of parameters is reduced 
by  1/6.8  (Tan  and  Le,  2021).  Based  on  this  network,  we  designed  a 
backbone  to  improve  the  training  speed  of  the  model  while  ensuring 
detection accuracy and speed.

shortened the inference time on RTX 3060 by 54%. This indicates that 
the algorithm is lightweight, achieves an accuracy comparable to state- 
of-the-art methods, and is more suitable for marine zoobenthos recog-
nition tasks.

Helpful Answer:

In evaluating the performance of the deep learning model, several metrics are employed. These include precision (P), recall (R), harmonic mean of P and R (F1), and mean average precision (mAP). Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made by the model. Recall, also known as sensitivity or true positive rate, quantifies the proportion of actual positives correctly identified by the model. The F1 score provides a single metric that combines both precision and recall into a single value, offering a balanced measure between these two aspects. Lastly, mAP serves as an indicator of the overall performance of the model across various thresholds, providing a comprehensive assessment of its effectiveness.
