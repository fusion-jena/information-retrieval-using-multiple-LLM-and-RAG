Build a three-layer back propagation (BP) artificial neural network 
using MATLAB R2014b (Lin et al., 2021). The first layer (i.e. the input 
layer) corresponded to the aCDOM(254) and Fn(355) respectively. The 
intermediate layer (i.e. hidden layers) and the last layer (i.e. the output 
layer)  comprised  a  single  neuron,  that  corresponded  to  the  predictor 
(TSI). Set the maximum training times to 10,000 and the training error 
to 0.001. 64 water samples were utilized for model calibration, with the 
remaining  used  for  validation.  Validation  accuracy  was  assessed  by 
calculating the coefficient of determination (R2) and root-mean-square 
error (RMSE) between the measured and predicted TSI. The RMSE was 
determined using Eq. (6).

2.1. Study area 

The Erhai watershed is located in Dali Prefecture, Yunnan Province, 
China, It includes Lake Erhai (EH), Lake Cibi (CBH), Lake Xihu (XH) as 
well  as  the  Luoshi,  Yong’an,  and  Miju  Rivers.  The  main  lake  of  the 
watershed is Lake Erhai, the second-largest lake in southwestern China, 
which has an average depth of 10.5 m and covers an area of 249.8 km2. 
The Erhai watershed contains 117 rivers and streams, including the Miju 
River, Yong’an River, and Luoshi River, and lakes such as Lake Erhai, 
Lake Cibi, and Lake Xihu. In the northern part of Lake Erhai, Lake Cibi, 
and Lake Xihu are respectively fed by rivers including the Miju River, 
Luoshi River, and Yong’an River before flowing into Lake Erhai. Lake 
Cibi and Lake Xihu are the sources of Lake Erhai and are smaller in size. 
The expansion of tourists and residential pollution present problems for 
the western portion of Lake Erhai.

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the model is being used for regression or prediction purposes. Specifically, the model is designed to predict the Total Suspended Solids Index (TSI) based on two inputs: aCDOM(254) and Fn(355). This is evident from the fact that the model comprises a single neuron in both the intermediate and output layers, which correspond to the predictor (TSI). Additionally, the performance of the model is evaluated using metrics commonly used for regression tasks, namely the coefficient of determination (R^2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE). Therefore, it can be concluded that the purpose of this deep learning model is to predict the TSI based on the given inputs.
