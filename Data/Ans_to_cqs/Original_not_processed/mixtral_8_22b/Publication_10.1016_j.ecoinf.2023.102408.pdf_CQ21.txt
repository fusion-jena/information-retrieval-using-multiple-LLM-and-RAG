The  model  initially  included  all  variables,  acknowledging  the  sig-
nificance  of  identifying  and  selecting  pertinent  variables  for  model 
development. Variable importance measures were employed to evaluate 
their significance, which helped identify the most influential variables 
for  predicting  AGB.  However,  it  is  recognised  that  assessing  model 
performance is essential, particularly when dealing with less important 
variables. A stratified sampling method was applied to all AGB obser-
vations for this evaluation. This technique randomly allocated 70% of 
the samples to the training dataset and the remaining 30% to the vali-
dation  dataset.  Three  error  statistics,  specifically  R2,  mean  absolute 
error  (MAE),  and  RMSE  (as  indicated  in  Eqs.  8,  9,  and  10),  were 
employed to compare the accuracies of the models. The generated ma-
chine learning models were then extrapolated for the entire region. This

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the project or study. In the given context, some of these steps include evaluating variable importance measures to determine the most significant features for predicting Above Ground Biomass (AGB). Additionally, a stratified sampling method was applied to allocate 70% of the samples to the training dataset and the remaining 30% to the validation dataset. Error statistics such as R^2, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) were calculated to compare the accuracy of different models. Furthermore, the generated machine learning models were extrapolated for the entire region. To address overfitting issues, the parameter 'c' was used to optimize the line fit and penalize the number of samples within the margin. These postprocessing steps help ensure the robustness and reliability of the developed models.
