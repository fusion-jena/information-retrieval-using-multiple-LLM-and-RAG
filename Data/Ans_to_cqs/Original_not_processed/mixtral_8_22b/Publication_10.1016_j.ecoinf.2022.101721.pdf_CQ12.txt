developers could expand on the code in supplement S1 to implement 
more  predictor  variables  and  write  a  custom  algorithm.  Finally,  the 
classification accuracy of software incorporating an informative prior in 
their algorithm should not be determined through training and testing 
data sets alone. The performance must also be evaluated through the 
number  of  correct  classifications  using  real  world  examples.  Current 
software attempting to ID bats are locked in a vacuum. Bats in the real 
world are not!

Helpful Answer:
The paper titled "Development and Test of a Bat Calls Detection and Classification Method Based on Convolutional Neural Networks" by Paumen et al. (2021) suggests that the authors have developed a pipeline for detecting and classifying bat calls using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This implies that the deep learning model used in their pipeline is a CNN. However, it is important to note that other papers or studies may use different types of deep learning models such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformer models depending on the specific application and requirements.
