Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide a direct link to the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context. The context discusses various aspects such as prediction methods for means, standard deviations, and population sizes, species identification using machine learning, and some percentage values related to different years and species. However, it does not mention any specific links to repositories like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF where the deep learning pipeline might be stored. Therefore, I cannot provide a precise answer to your query with the given context.
