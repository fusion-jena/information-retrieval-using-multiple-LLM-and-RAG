to obtain individual optimized model hyperparameters. The optimiza-
tion algorithm adopted was the Optuna (Akiba et al., 2019), which
employs complex optimization algorithms to automatically search the
hyperparameter space for the greatest combination of hyperparameters
that minimizes the mean squared error.

sampled data.

4.2. Hyperparameter tuning

For tuning purposes, the model structures were same as described in
Table 3, with the manually sampled chlorophyll-a as output for the
manually sampled scenarios and the continuous regression derived
laboratory chlorophyll-a was the output for the high frequency data
scenario. Using different random training datasets to develop the models
enabled the realization of optimized parameters using the Optuna
package. The multi-modal nature of some of the distribution of the pa-
rameters indicates several peaks that provide a good trade-off between
performance and computational cost. The distribution of the parameters
slightly varies with each modeling scenario. For RF_w/o_Sensor, the
modal n_estimators observed was 20, which increases to 50 in the RF_w/
o_Sensor_cont. This shows the need for more regression trees to be

Helpful Answer:
The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using the Optuna package, which employs complex optimization algorithms to automatically search the hyperparameter space for the greatest combination of hyperparameters that minimizes the mean squared error. Different random training datasets are used to develop the models, enabling the realization of optimized parameters using the Optuna package. The multi-modal nature of some of the distribution of the parameters indicates several peaks that provide a good trade-off between performance and computational cost. The distribution of the parameters slightly varies with each modeling scenario. For example, in the RF\_w/o\_Sensor scenario, the modal number of estimators observed was 20, which increased to 50 in the RF\_w/\_Sensor\_cont scenario.
