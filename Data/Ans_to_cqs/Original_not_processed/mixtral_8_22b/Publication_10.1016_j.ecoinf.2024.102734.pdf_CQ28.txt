query set are negative. Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2019) propose transductive
propagation that iteratively propagates labels from labelled instances to
unlabelled instances according to the graph structure of the embeddings.
Other semi-supervised learning techniques have been applied such as
active learning. Wang et al. (Wang et al., 2022) combines a few-shot

single-channel images. We evaluate a commonly applied pre-trained
ResNet-50 architecture (He et al., 2016). Dufourq et al. (Dufourq
et al., 2022) also demonstrates strong classification performance and
low data requirements of ResNet-50 when comparing alternative pre-
trained CNN-based models. With the rapid development of transformer-
based models we also evaluate two transformer models Audio Spectro-
gram Transformer (AST) (Gong et al., 2021) which, like ResNet, oper-
ates on the spectrogram. We also evaluate HuBERT (Hsu et al., 2021)
which operates directly on the 1-D waveform. We evaluate the models
using the same feature extractor fθ and user model Uϕ pipeline presented
in Fig. 1 using a two-class binary output. Hence Uϕ is a two layer {100,2}
fully connected network.

samples (red line) compared to randomly ordered samples, no active
learning (blue line), and active learning using high-certainty samples
(yellow line). The baseline accuracy is calculated using a 2-shot, 2-way
test accuracy without fine-tuning (81.4%). The AST feature extraction
model is fine-tuned on a subset of 500 training samples. Model perfor-
mance is re-evaluated on the test set at 10 sample increments using each
of the three sample orderings. Low certainty refers to queries with a
similar Euclidean distance to prototypical embeddings and therefore lie
along decision boundaries. For high-certainty samples, the order is
reversed with query embedding in close proximity to prototypical em-
beddings being prioritised for model fine-tuning.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or any other platform was used for deployment based on the available information.
