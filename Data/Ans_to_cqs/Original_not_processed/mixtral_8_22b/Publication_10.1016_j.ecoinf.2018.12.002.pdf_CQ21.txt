(Brown et al., 2013). A key diﬀerence between the two approaches is
that unsupervised learning does not use the observations of pre-deﬁned
behaviors to label movement metrics such as step length, turning angle,
and altitude (of ﬂying birds) for classiﬁcation of general behavioral
modes such as foraging or encamping and taxi or straight, long-distance
movement. On the other hand, supervised learning has training data,
which include behavioral observation as the labels of movement me-
trics. In many cases, the labels are the predeﬁned behaviors of interest
and allow researchers to quantify the spatial and temporal distributions
of speciﬁc behaviors during daily, seasonal, or annual cycles. However,
behavioral labels or observations are almost impossible in some species
such as those living in deep water or unavailable in secretive species or
less studied species. Furthermore, supervised learning requires a vali-
dation of classiﬁcations using additional behavioral observations. The

time (Fig. 6a, b). In this case, the onset of spring migration appeared to
be April 22 when the bird had the migrating state (with the label “2”)
and started to move northward (with increasing latitude). This kind of
inference at individual levels is diﬃcult to make through direct ob-
servations or tracking by human observers due to high ﬂying speed or
mobility of the pelicans. The state-switching state space model does not
explicitly model step length with a statistical distribution, whereas
hidden Markov models use Weibull or gamma distributions to model
step lengths. Although hidden Markov models do not account for ob-
servational error in location estimates, hidden Markov models are still a
promising tool for the behavioral segmentation of animal movement
paths with the increasingly improved accuracy of location estimation

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not directly discuss the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices. These concepts are typically associated with machine learning applications, particularly in computer vision tasks like image classification or object detection.

However, based on the given context, we can infer that after training a model for analyzing animal movement data, one might perform validation of classifications using additional behavioral observations. Additionally, the context mentions the use of state-space models and hidden Markov models for behavioral segmentation of animal movement paths. After applying these models, it may be necessary to interpret the results, which could involve visualizing the predicted states over time or calculating summary statistics related to the identified behaviors.

To summarize, while the provided context does not explicitly mention postprocessing steps like saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices, it suggests that validating classifications and interpreting results would be important steps following model training in the context of analyzing animal movement data.
