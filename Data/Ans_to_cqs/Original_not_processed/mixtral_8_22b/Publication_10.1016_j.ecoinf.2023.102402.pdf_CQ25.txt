goodness-of-fit and complexity. The model with the lowest AICc value (i. 
e. ΔAICc = 0) is considered the best model out of the current suite of 
models;  all  models  with  ΔAICc  <2  are  generally  considered  to  have 
substantial  support  (Muscarella  et  al.,  2014).  The  model  parameter 
settings with the lowest AICc values (ΔAICc = 0) for both H. guttulatus 
and H. hippocampus were chosen to establish the final Maxent models 
(ENMeval outputs in supplementary materials, Appendix 2).

3.3. Model validation 

SDMs showed an excellent level of predictive performance, as indi-
cated by the AUC and TSS values of 0.91 ± 0.02 (mean ± standard de-
viation) and 0.68 ± 0.02 in H. guttulatus and 0.92 ± 0.03 and 0.69 ±
0.03 in H. hippocampus. 

The  high predictive  performance of  our  models was  confirmed by 

validation using multiple databases (Table 2). 

3.4. Niche analysis 

The first and second principal component of the ecospat PCA of both 
species explained 35.4% and 22.2% of the variability in the study area, 
respectively  (Figs.  4a-g).  The  correlation  plot  showed  that  the  mean

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that a deep learning model has been used to create Species Distribution Models (SDMs) for two seahorse species, Hippocampus guttulatus and Hippocampus hippocampus. These SDMs aim to predict suitable habitats for these species based on various environmental variables. The purpose of this modeling approach seems to be related to wildlife management and conservation efforts, as indicated by keywords such as 'conservation biology', 'ecological corridor', and 'wildlife management'. However, the specific type of deep learning model used (e.g., classification, segmentation, or detection) is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, we cannot definitively determine the exact purpose of the deep learning model beyond its use in creating SDMs for these seahorse species.
