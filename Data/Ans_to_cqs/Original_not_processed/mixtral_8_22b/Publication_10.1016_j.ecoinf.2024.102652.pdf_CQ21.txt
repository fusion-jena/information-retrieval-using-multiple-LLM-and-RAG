2.6.3. Training process 

To fit into the network, the training set must have its data normalized 
and standardized. For the training network, the batch size was set to 32. 
The purposes for selecting 32 were to not exceed the memory limit and 
to make full use of computer resources. The optimizer used Adam pro-
cessing, and the learning ratio varied with group based on the cosine 
function’s law, often in the range between 0.0 and 1.0. The 100 epochs 
are used with an early stopping function to halt the learning process if 
there is no improvement in accuracy after 20 epochs. The loss function 
used is the cross-entropy loss function (Abd-Ellah et al., 2024).

is  built  solely  on  the  suggested  RUb  blocks,  in  contrast  to  the  SOD 
(salient  object  detection)  models  built  upon  existing  backbones.  This 
enables it to be set up with varying model sizes based on the restrictions 
of the target environment and trained from scratch. This suggests that 
model  training  does  not  require  sophisticated  technology  and  that 
adequate results can be obtained even in the absence of pretraining.

redundancy compared to the original bands, leading to overfitting of the 
training model. However, the suggested MU-NET model can maximize 
the information from the original bands as a more effective data mining 
method, yielding outcomes that are similar to the salinity indices.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, the given context does not provide explicit details about any specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. Therefore, we cannot definitively state what these steps might be. However, common postprocessing steps in machine learning projects include generating visualizations such as saliency maps or heatmaps, calculating metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score, creating confusion matrices, and performing statistical analysis on the results. These steps help evaluate the performance of the model and gain insights into how well it has learned to classify or predict the desired outputs.
