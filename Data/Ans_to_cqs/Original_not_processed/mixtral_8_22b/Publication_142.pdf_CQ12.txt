the Pl@ntNet user community (currently 1.8 million user accounts). At the time
of writing, the CNN architecture used is the inception model49 extended with
batch normalization.50 The network is pre-trained on the commonly used Im-
ageNet dataset and ﬁne-tuned on Pl@ntNet data. Pl@ntNet currently covers
30,261 species illustrated by more than 2.9 million images. The taxonomic
coverage of our study is therefore one to three orders of magnitude larger
than previously published studies making use of automated species identiﬁca-
tion for ecological research. The training of Pl@ntNet CNN requires the mobi-
lization of a high-performance computing infrastructure and expertise in deep,
distributed, and large-scale learning. Thus, the resulting classiﬁcation tool is in
itself a major advance in biodiversity data science.

Access to the Pl@ntNet classiﬁcation tool is provided through a dedicated
API available at my.plantnet.org. The main feature of this API is a RESTful
JSON-based web service that can accept one to ﬁve images of a plant and re-
turns a list of likely species. The species are associated with classiﬁcation
scores (the softmax output of the CNN), as well as a list of matching images
retrieved from the database. To facilitate the implementation of future studies
based on the methodology of this paper, we have developed the ‘‘plantnet’’51
R-package allowing users to query the Pl@ntNet API. The package is available
online at https://github.com/BiologicalRecordsCentre/plantnet.

AI naturalists, just like their human counterparts, may have
their own biases which must be fully understood if the informa-
tion that they generate is to be trusted and suitably utilized. For
example, most AI systems can only detect or recognize already
seen (or learned) objects or concepts. Benchmark datasets of
images can be organized to precisely assess the limits of AI sys-
tems’ ability, highlighting where human expertise is still required.
Deep learning models (some of the most advanced AI algo-
rithms) are developed with training datasets that allow them to
capture discriminant visual patterns. Their performances are
then strongly correlated to the quality and completeness of the
datasets on which they are trained. Unbalanced, biased, or
otherwise poor-quality training datasets will lead to underper-
forming algorithms in real conditions.27 During the learning
phases, particular attention must be given to any relevant limita-

Applications of AI to biological recording have to date typically
focused on active sampling, that is, images collected speciﬁcally
for the purpose of recording wildlife24 (e.g., wildlife recording
apps or camera traps). However, this has neglected large
amounts of image data that are not collected for the purposes
of biological recording, but which nonetheless may contain
useful information about biodiversity. This includes social media
imagery25 (e.g., Flickr and Instagram), CCTV, and imagery
collected along linear infrastructure (e.g., Google StreetView).
These unexploited image data could be rapidly analyzed using
‘‘AI naturalists’’ designed to locate potential images of biodiver-
sity and classify what they see. This is an example of internet
ecology or ‘‘iEcology’’ as recently proposed by Jari(cid:2)c and col-
leagues,26 whereby digital data collected for a different purpose
is analyzed to gain insights into the natural world. However,

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The pipeline uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model called Inception Model, which is further extended with batch normalization. The network is initially pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and then fine-tuned on PlantNet data.
