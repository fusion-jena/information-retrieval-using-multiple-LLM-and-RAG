teroperable and Reusable) open-data principles (Wilkinson et al.,
2016), were created through a bottom-up, community based initiative.
A component of the FAIR principals requires the usage of existing
standards (e.g. INSPIRE, O&M, Darwin Core). Consequently, scientists
have implemented FAIR data repositories specifically intended for
sample and data management (Adam et al., 2019; Conze et al., 2017;
Dassié et al., 2017; Lehnert et al., 2006; McNutt et al., 2016). However,
a FAIR compliant system and model for local repositories, purposefully
designed for physical ecological sample archives and their derived data,
has yet to materialize.

the procedures involved in storing, uploading metadata, and imaging
samples, a high-level process flow was developed (Fig. 3). The process
flow outlines where the sample metadata is generated, analysed, and
eventually stored. Furthermore, it documents how the physical samples
and digital data are linked. This cross-disciplinary process flow is novel
because it outlines how the operational part (routine sampling of fish
for government mandated stock assessment) of an organization (the
MI), and the research capacity of an organization (imaging and reading
growth on scales and otoliths), can be interlinked. Additionally, the
management of the IFBA dataset follows the procedures and roles
outlined within the MI's Data Management Quality Framework
(Leadbetter et al., 2019).

Helpful Answer:
The sources provided do not directly address the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, they discuss various aspects related to data handling and processing in marine science and fisheries research.

In general, preprocessing steps depend on the nature of the data and the requirements of the machine learning algorithm used. Common preprocessing techniques include data cleaning (removing missing values, outliers, or irrelevant information), normalization (scaling numerical input features to a standard range), and encoding categorical variables into numerical form. These steps help improve the performance and efficiency of the deep learning models by reducing noise, improving convergence speed, and preventing overfitting.

While these sources do not explicitly mention preprocessing steps for deep learning models, they emphasize the need for adherence to FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles in managing and sharing scientific datasets. They also highlight the development of systems and workflows for integrating different types of data, including those obtained from routine sampling and research activities. Therefore, it can be inferred that proper data preprocessing would play a crucial role in ensuring the quality and usability of datasets in marine science and fisheries research.
