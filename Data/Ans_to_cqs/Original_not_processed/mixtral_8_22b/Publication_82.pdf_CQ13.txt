• Momentum: 0.9,
• Weight decay: 0.0005,
• Gamma: 0.1,
• Batch size: 24 (in case of GoogLeNet), 100 (in case of AlexNet).

All the above experiments were conducted using our own fork of
Caﬀe (Jia et al., 2014), which is a fast, open source framework for
deep learning. The basic results, such as the overall accuracy can
also be replicated using a standard instance of caﬀe.

Each of these 60 experiments runs for a total of 30 epochs,
where one epoch is deﬁned as the number of training iterations
in which the particular neural network has completed a full pass
of the whole training set. The choice of 30 epochs was made based
on the empirical observation that in all of these experiments, the
learning always converged well within 30 epochs (as is evident
from the aggregated plots (Figure 3) across all the experiments).
To enable a fair comparison between the results of all the
experimental conﬁgurations, we also tried to standardize the
hyper-parameters across all the experiments, and we used the
following hyper-parameters in all of the experiments:
• Solver type: Stochastic Gradient Descent,
• Base learning rate: 0.005,

• Learning rate policy: Step (decreases by a factor of 10 every

of classes in our dataset), which feeds the softMax layer. The
softMax layer ﬁnally exponentially normalizes the input that it
gets from (fc8), thereby producing a distribution of values across
the 38 classes that add up to 1. These values can be interpreted
as the conﬁdences of the network that a given input image is
represented by the corresponding classes. All of the ﬁrst 7 layers
of AlexNet have a ReLu non-linearity activation unit associated
with them, and the ﬁrst two fully connected layers (fc{6, 7})
have a dropout layer associated with them, with a dropout
ratio of 0.5.

Helpful Answer:
The hyperparameters used in the deep learning models include the solver type, base learning rate, learning rate policy, momentum, weight decay, gamma, batch size, and the number of epochs. Specifically, stochastic gradient descent was used as the solver type, with a base learning rate of 0.005. The learning rate policy was step, decreasing by a factor of 10 every 10,000 iterations. The momentum was set to 0.9, while the weight decay was set to 0.0005. The gamma value was set to 0.1. The batch size varied depending on the deep learning architecture; it was set to 24 for GoogLeNet and 100 for AlexNet. Each experiment ran for a total of 30 epochs, where one epoch was defined as the number of training iterations required for the neural network to complete a full pass of the entire training set.
