+is paper aims to predict the SST and the SWH for the
Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency dataset.
+e proposed work is motivated by comparing the statistical,
machine learning, and deep learning models to understand
the performance gap of these models. +e results of this
work should provide scientiﬁc evidence on which model ﬁts
better the marine data. To anticipate the marine features
eﬃciently, the employed deep learning model combines the
gated recurrent units (GRU) with the regular neural net-
work. In the proposed architecture, the GRU layer is pre-
ceded by an input layer and followed by a fully connected
layer. As a result, the predicted values can be produced from
the output layer. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst use of a
GRU model architecture for forecasting SST and SWH.
Besides, four diﬀerent ML models have been utilized in the
current study, namely, Linear Regression (LR), Decision
Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random

deep learning, and machine learning models for predicting the SSTand SWH on a real dataset obtained from the Korea Hydrographic
and Oceanographic Agency. +en, we proposed comparing these three predictive approaches on four diﬀerent evaluation metrics.
Experimental results have revealed that the deep learning model slightly outperformed the machine learning models for overall
performance, and both of these approaches greatly outperformed the statistical predictive model.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not explicitly mention where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it mentions that the dataset used in the research was obtained from the Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency. Therefore, one could infer that the data might be available through their website or upon request. Unfortunately, without more specific information, it cannot be determined if the data is also available on platforms such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
