Fig. 1. Relationship between the number of natural thumbnails per species for training and the accuracy of deep-learning and few-shot learning models. Non-linear 
mixed effects asymptotic model fit for (a) DL architecture at the fixed-effect level, and for FSL architecture at (b) the fixed-effect level and (c) the random-effect level. 
Grey areas represent 95% CI in fixed-effects estimates. Dotted lines represent the NLME estimate of the number of images per species required to reach the 99% 
asymptote value. We obtained similar magnitude with the 95% asymptote value, reached with 750 images for DL and 5 with FSL. 

T1 corresponded more to a real use case scenario.

There are two ways to tackle this problem of lack of data. The first 
one  consists  of  directly  addressing  the  data  itself,  through  data 
augmentation (Van Dyk and Meng, 2012; Wang and Perez, 2017; Wong 
et al., 2016). The second option is to change the classification algorithm. 
Few-shots learning (FSL) algorithms (Fei-fei et al., 2006; Fink, 2005) are 
designed to compute a classification task (query, noted Q) with only a 
few  thumbnails  to  train  (Support  Sets,  noted  SS),  and  it  has  been 
increasingly studied since 2017 (Finn et al., 2017). Few-shots learning 
methods are divided into three main approaches. Metric-based methods 
are embedding both queries (Q) and support sets (Ss), before assigning to 
the query a class, according to distances computed between Q and Ss 
(Sung et al., 2018; Victor and Bruna, 2018; Yanbin et al., 2019). The 
second approach consists of 1) training a model on a large database, and

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or managing random seed values. However, there are several common strategies used to manage randomness in deep learning pipelines. One strategy is to set a specific seed value for reproducibility purposes, ensuring that results can be reproduced across different runs. Another strategy is to perform multiple runs with different seeds and average the results to reduce variability caused by random initialization. Additionally, some researchers may choose to use deterministic algorithms instead of stochastic ones to eliminate sources of randomness altogether.
