at each split in the tree, 3) determines a split point from many possible 
values, and 4) averages trees. In random forests, the standard is to make 
use of bagging and tree averaging, rather than pruning trees or limiting 
tree size, to prevent over-fitting (Díaz-Uriarte and Alvarez de Andr´es, 
2006; Goldstein et al., 2011). Breiman (2000:4) wrote that ‘the largest 
trees possible result in the best accuracy.’ Indeed, typically fine-tuning 
parameters  is  unnecessary  to  achieve  accurate  performance  with 
random forests (Díaz-Uriarte and Alvarez de Andr´es, 2006).

correlated predictors, only a subset of variables is considered for each

For  modeling  species  distributions,  I  applied  the  random  forests 
classifier with 10-fold cross-validation, repeated three times, for one run 
of each model that varied by input variables, and all modeling used the 
same random number generator (Kuhn, 2008; R Core Team, 2023; the 
caret package is well-documented, e.g., https://cran.r-project.org/web/ 
packages/caret/vignettes/caret.html).  The  random  forests  classifier, 
which is widely used and highly accurate in predictions (i.e., > 90% in 
102 out of 121 of the data sets; Fern´andez-Delgado et al., 2014), is a non- 
linear ensemble method that aggregates results of many decision trees or 
rule-based models to output the most optimal result, helping to mini-
mize the influence of error. The random forests classifier runs models in 
parallel  (i.e.,  bagging)  and  averages  results  to  reduce  variance  (i.e., 
overfitting).  To  help  distinguish  the  influence  of  redundant,  highly

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of a random forest classifier, which is a type of machine learning algorithm that uses multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and minimize overfitting. This technique employs bagging (bootstrap aggregating) and tree averaging to handle randomness. Bagging involves creating subsets of the original dataset through random sampling with replacement, while tree averaging combines the outputs of individual trees to produce a final prediction. These methods help to reduce the impact of noise and variability in the data, thus improving the robustness and generalizability of the model. Additionally, the text notes that the same random number generator was used across all modeling, suggesting that controlling the source of randomness can be important for reproducibility and consistency in machine learning applications.
