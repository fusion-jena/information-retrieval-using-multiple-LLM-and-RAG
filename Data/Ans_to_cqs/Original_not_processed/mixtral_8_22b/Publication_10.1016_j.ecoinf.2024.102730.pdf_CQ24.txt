Despite massive advancements in the field of machine learning (ML)
during the last decade, ML is not yet often used for vegetation studies.
ML models can be used for various tasks, among which are classification,
regression, and image segmentation. In ML, models extract knowledge
from data and use this knowledge to produce an output relevant to the
task at hand. These models use three main learning paradigms: super-
vised learning, unsupervised learning or reinforcement learning. This
study only considers the first paradigm, as we build a regression model.
Within supervised learning, there are a multitude of model types, for
example, support vector machines (Hearst et al., 1998), boosted tree
ensembles (e.g., XGBoost (Chen and Guestrin, 2016) or LightGBM (Ke
et al., 2017)) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) (McCulloch and
Pitts, 1943). This analysis will use ANNs, particularly multilayer per-
ceptrons (MLPs), which are fully connected feedforward neural net-

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, there isn't any direct information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some general practices can be mentioned based on common methods used in the field.

One strategy to manage randomness in deep learning pipelines is setting fixed seeds for reproducibility. By specifying a particular seed value, researchers ensure that their results remain consistent across different runs of the same experiment. This practice helps maintain consistency and allows others to reproduce the findings accurately.

Another approach involves employing cross-validation techniques, where the dataset is divided into multiple subsets, and the model is trained and tested on these subsets iteratively. Cross-validation reduces the impact of randomness by averaging out the performance metrics obtained from each subset.

Additionally, ensemble methods can also help mitigate the effects of randomness. Ensemble methods combine multiple models to improve overall performance and reduce variance. Techniques such as bagging and boosting create diverse sets of models, reducing the influence of random initializations and improving the robustness of predictions.

Lastly, hyperparameter tuning plays a crucial role in optimizing deep learning models. Grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization are popular methods used to find optimal hyperparameters. These techniques explore different combinations of hyperparameters, helping to minimize the impact of randomness and achieve better model performance.
