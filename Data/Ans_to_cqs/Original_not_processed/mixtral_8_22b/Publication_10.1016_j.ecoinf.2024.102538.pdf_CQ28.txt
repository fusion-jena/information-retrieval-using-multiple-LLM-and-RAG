Fig. 3. Architecture of the baseline model: the data first passes through the entry flow, then through the middle flow, which is repeated eight times, and finally 
through the exit flow. The adapted first deep separable convolutional (DSC) block in the Exit flow is shown in (a). In this block, the Position Attention module (b) 
receives the local feature A, which is fed into convolutional layers to generate three new feature maps: B, C, and D, respectively. The output feature E is then obtained 
through matrix multiplication and element-wise summation operations.

The study of bird populations is crucial for biodiversity research and conservation. Deep artificial neural net-
works  have  revolutionized  bird  acoustic  recognition;  however,  most  methods  overlook  inherent  relationships 
among bird populations, resulting in the loss of biological information. To address this limitation, we propose the 
Phylogenetic  Perspective  Neural  Network  (PPNN),  which  incorporates  hierarchical  multilevel  labels  for  each 
bird. PPNN uses a hierarchical semantic embedding framework to capture feature information at different levels. 
Attention  mechanisms  are  employed  to  extract  and  select  common  and  distinguishing  features,  thereby 
improving classification accuracy. We also propose a path correction strategy to rectify inconsistent predictions. 
Experimental results on bird acoustic datasets demonstrate that PPNN outperforms current methods, achieving

3.4. Baseline model 

To assess the impact of hierarchical information, we established a 
baseline  model  employing  a  single  classifier.  Considering  the  limited 
computing resources, we adapted the Xception network Chollet (2017) 
with  a  positional  attention  mechanism  Fu  et  al.  (2019)  to  ensure  the 
effectiveness  of  bird  recognition.  Due  to  the  superiority  of  the  deep 
separable  convolutional  (DSC)  structure,  the  Xception  architecture 
outperforms other CNN architectures of the same caliber such as Resnet 
and DenseNet, delivering significant performance improvement. More-
over,  the  Xception  network  exhibits  quicker  training  and  inference 
speeds compared to vision transformers.
