Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The papers cited do not provide information about which specific framework was used to build their respective deep learning models. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether they used TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other framework based solely on this context. To find out more details regarding the frameworks used, one would need to refer directly to each paper's methodology section or contact the authors for further clarification.
