train a Siamese network using fewer samples, resulting in high accuracy. 
As the training dataset contained an insufficient number of samples, we 
used  the  few-shot  learning  method  to  train  the  network.  Herein,  the 
classification task was defined as the N-way K-shot problem, where the 
training  set  contained  N  different  categories  with  each  category 
comprising K labeled samples. Two categories were defined during the 
training  of  the  tracking  tasks:  target  and  non-target.  Based  on  the 
training pairs assigned to the labels, experiments were performed using 
two-way one-shot learning(Cheng et al., 2021).

%Query
Query: "What methods are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., surveys, sensors, public datasets)? "

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The context does not provide explicit information regarding the specific methods used for collecting raw data in this particular deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the CRediT authorship contribution statement that Zixuan Yin contributed to 'Data curation', which suggests that some form of data collection process took place. Additionally, the mention of 'Data will be made available on request' implies that there is indeed a dataset involved in this research. Unfortunately, without further details, it cannot be determined whether the data was collected through surveys, sensors, public datasets, or other means.
