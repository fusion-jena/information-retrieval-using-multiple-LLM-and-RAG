For our research reproducibility in Algorithm 1, the definitions
include T and ℰ, denoting the paths to the training and testing dataset
directories, respectively. The functions Dtrain and Dtest represent data
generators for training and testing datasets, where parameters such as α,
β, γ, and δ control aspects like rescaling and augmentation. The batch
size for training and testing is denoted by B, while Gtrain and Gtest
represent the respective data generators. The class weights computed for
addressing class imbalance are denoted by wc, and M stands for our
proposed model, encompassing its architecture and compilation pa-
rameters. The number of training epochs is represented by n, and P and
Q denote the steps per epoch for training and validation, respectively.
Predicted outputs and their class labels from the model are represented
by ̂y and ̂yc, while ytrue signifies the true class labels from the testing
dataset. In our model reproducibility in the testing phase in Algorithm 2,

In the BEiT model architecture, our initial steps involve loading the
BEiT model and strategically freezing a substantial portion of its layers
approximately 7 of the total layers. By doing so, the model freezes the
weights in these layers, focusing the training process on fine-tuning the
remaining layers. The model is then derived by isolating the output of a
specific layer (‘out_ln’) from the BEiT architecture. To enhance training

Helpful Answer:
After the model training, several postprocessing steps can be employed depending on the requirements of the project. Some common postprocessing techniques include generating saliency maps, calculating evaluation metrics, and creating confusion matrices.

Saliency maps help visualize which parts of the input image contribute most significantly towards the final prediction made by the model. This technique involves computing gradients of the predicted class score concerning the input pixels, highlighting areas of high importance.

Calculating evaluation metrics is essential to assess the performance of the trained model accurately. Commonly used metrics include precision, recall, F1-score, area under the curve (AUC), Cohen's kappa coefficient, etc. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to correctly identify positive instances, minimize false positives/negatives, and maintain a balance between precision and recall.

Creating confusion matrices offers another way to evaluate the model's performance visually. A confusion matrix is a table layout that allows us to see if the system is confusing two classes (i.e., mislabeling one as another). It provides detailed information about actual vs. predicted values, enabling users to understand the types of errors produced by the model.

In summary, postprocessing steps after model training may consist of generating saliency maps, calculating evaluation metrics, and constructing confusion matrices. Each method serves a unique purpose in evaluating the model's performance and understanding its strengths and weaknesses better.
