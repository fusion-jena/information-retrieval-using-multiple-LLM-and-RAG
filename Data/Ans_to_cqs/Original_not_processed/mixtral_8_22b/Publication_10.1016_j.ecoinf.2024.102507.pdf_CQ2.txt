With regards to the difference between the results of the original, 
reduced,  and  augmented  datasets  applied  to  the  deep  learning 
model, we found that the original and augmented datasets are only 
under  a  few  specific  numbers  of  bands  and  data  formats  (e.g., 
VGG19 + 8band_256_8bit, VGG19 + 72band_256_8bit, ResNet50 +
8band_256_8bit, and ResNet50 + 36band_ 256_8bit). The classifica-
tion accuracy rate reached more than 50%, and there was no regu-
larity in the classification accuracy. However, the sampling action of 
reducing the data had a very obvious and consistent impact on the 
classification  accuracy,  especially  in  the  VGG19  model,  which  is 
more  similar  to  the  traditional  CNN  model.  This  representative 
sampling  action  resulted  in  incomplete  and  complete  feature 
extraction,  and  some  key  features  were  ignored.  Given  the  above 
reasons, it is recommended that sampling actions be avoided in the

When  the  image  units  of  bands  36  and  72  are  input  to  the  deep 
learning model, the memory capacity may be insufficient given the large 
dimensions. Therefore, when inputting sample images for bands 36 and 
72, we used Python's Rasterio module to disassemble them into single- 
band  images,  i.e.,  the  image  units  with  36  bands  were  disassembled 
into 36 single-band images and 72-band images were disassembled into 
72  single-band  images.  This  data  conversion  method  is  equivalent  to 
flattening the thick convolution kernel. During testing, we found that 
through  the  optimization  of  this  process,  the  hardware resources  and 
computing time required for deep learning can be considerably reduced, 
while the corresponding impact on the model's accuracy is limited. 

3.2. Deep learning model and testing results 

After selecting the model, the CNN model in this study was further 

built using the following steps:

After  completing  the  image  format  conversion,  we  used  ArcPy  to 
divide each forest type, starting from the upper left corner, into 256 ×
256-pixel  image  units  to  create  deep  learning  samples.  As  shown  in 
Fig. 4, the forest types in categories 4–9 are not large. However, deep 
learning requires a large number of samples. Therefore, in order to in-
crease  the  number  of  samples  of  the  small  forest  types,  we  moved  a 
distance of 128 pixels in the x and y directions when creating the next 
image unit, giving each image a 50% overlap rate. Simultaneously, at 
◦
each unit position, we rotated every 45
to generate a new image unit 
and used multiple angles to obtain the same set of training samples to 
enhance the data.

This  conversion  method  is  equivalent  to  repeatedly  inputting 
multiple images containing diverse types of features into the deep 
learning model for multi-feature learning, so in essence, it should be 
possible to consider the convenience of data input and the training 
points  of  deep  learning.  As  evident  from  Tables  7,  8  and  9,  our 
research results indicate that no matter what data format VGG19 or 
ResNet50 uses, the accuracy of classification and the time required 
for calculation are much improved compared to the use of the orig-
inal convolution kernels with cube characteristics. The best model is 
VGG19  + ResNet50,  the  overall  classification  accuracy  rate  can 
generally reach 93%–100%, and the time required for model training 
is shortened to less than 30 min. Therefore, when further designing a 
set model in the future, flattening the convolution kernel is essential. 
When further discussing the effect of BATCH_SIZE (the number of

Helpful Answer:
The deep learning pipeline primarily utilizes image data formats. Specifically, the study employs Python's Rasterio module to disassemble multiband images into single-band images. For instance, 36-band images are broken down into 36 single-band images, while 72-band images are divided into 72 single-band images. This data conversion technique effectively reduces the dimensionality of the input data, thereby minimizing the computational requirements and processing time without significantly compromising the model's accuracy. Furthermore, the study mentions converting each forest type into 256x256 pixel image units using ArcPy to create deep learning samples. These operations suggest that the primary data format utilized in the deep learning pipeline is image data.
