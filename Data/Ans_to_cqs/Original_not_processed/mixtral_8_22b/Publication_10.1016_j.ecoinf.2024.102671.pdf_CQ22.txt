Secondly, the main challenge of the study lies in employing a more 
refined  cross-validation  approach  that  should  incorporate  temporal, 
spatial, and hierarchical structures inherent in ecological data. Effective 
cross-validation  is  essential  for  assessing  the  generalizability  and 
robustness of ecological zoning models (Roberts et al., 2017). The future 
study could focus on using statistical and machine learning techniques to 
model the relationship between landscape features and ecological car-
bon  sink capabilities. Implement cross-validation  techniques to  assess 
the predictive accuracy and robustness of each zoning method. 

Lastly,  this  study  did  not  fully  reflect  the  dynamic  changes  in

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific details about the evaluation metrics used for the deep learning model. However, common metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, and area under the curve (AUC). Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of total predictions made. Precision indicates the ratio of true positive predictions to all positive predictions. Recall calculates the fraction of relevant instances retrieved from the dataset. The F1 score combines both precision and recall into a single metric. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate, while the area under the curve (AUC) provides a measure of separability between classes. These metrics can be applied based on the requirements and objectives of the specific task or application.
