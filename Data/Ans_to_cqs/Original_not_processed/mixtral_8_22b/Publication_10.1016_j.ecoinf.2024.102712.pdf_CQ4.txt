bined with other types of data in an efficient, for example in a model- 
assisted framework (e.g., Ståhl et al., 2016) or hierarchical modelling 
(e.g., Saarela et al., 2016, 2018).

Another finding is that Sentinel-2 provide data that can be used to

Where Bi is band 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8 A, 11, and 12. The explanatory 
variables were selected using regsubsets in the R package leaps (Lumley 
and  Lumley,  2013).  The  best  model  was  selected,  by  setting  the 
maximum  number  of  explanatory  variables  (spectral  bands)  to  incor-
porate  in  the  model  to  9  (nvmx  = 9).  Based  on  the  adjusted  R2,  we 
selected the B2, B5 and B6 as predictors for Betul forest. Adding more 
independent variables did only have a marginal effect on the adjusted 
R2. An AGBD map with a cell size of 100 m was constructed by applying 
the AGBD model to all 100 m pixels in the resampled Sentinel-2 image. 
Mean values were calculated for each 1 km grid cell in the GEDI L4B 
dataset based on the cell values in the 100 m-resolution AGBD map. Only 
1  km-cells  that  were  entirely  located  on  forestland  according  to  the

Query: "What are the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Fliping, Roating, Scaling)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about any specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotation, scaling, etc. Therefore, it is not possible to determine what data augmentation techniques were applied in this case.
