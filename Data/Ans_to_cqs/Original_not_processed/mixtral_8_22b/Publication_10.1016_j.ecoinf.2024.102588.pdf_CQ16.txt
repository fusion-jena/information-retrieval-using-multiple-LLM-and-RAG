Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

learning rate was initially set to 0.001; however, this value was auto-
matically adjusted to determine the optimum point, resulting in the best 
performance of the CNN model. The early stopping option stopped the 
model training at a specific epoch where the model validation accuracy 
could not be improved.

estimation of health indices with NSE values of (cid:0) 0.976, (cid:0) 1.201, and (cid:0)
1.290 and RMSE of 38.082, 29.041, and 39.080 for TDI, BMI, and FAI, 
respectively  (Fig.  S2g-i).  The  validation  of  XGBoost  resulted  in  NSE

machine learning model, the RF model provided the best performance in 
estimating the three indices. However, overfitting results were observed 
in the ANN and RF models, with a lower validation performance than 
that of the training model (Figs. S1a-f and S2a-f). When performing 10-

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly state the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions that the early stopping option was used, which stops the model training at a specific epoch where the model validation accuracy could not be improved. This suggests that one criterion used to determine when training is complete might be when there is no further improvement in the validation accuracy. Additionally, the learning rate was automatically adjusted to find the optimal point, indicating another possible criterion - reaching the optimal learning rate.
