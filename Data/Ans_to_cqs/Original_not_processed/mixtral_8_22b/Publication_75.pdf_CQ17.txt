Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

3.2.2. Retrieval results 

The retrieval experiments ensued the following strategy: every image 
is used as a query image and is matched with every remaining image in 
the database. Tables 6 and 7 present the retrieval performances of all the 
networks in terms of the four considered measures by choosing the top 
100 matches, i.e. η = 100, and the two chosen similarity distances. 

3.3. Deep learning vs traditional machine learning comparison 

A comparison of deep learning approaches with traditional machine

Our study was mainly to propose a new model based on CNN, which 
provides an efficient and effective approach for single seed classification 
and retrieval. Our network architecture, SeedNet, contains six learnable 
layers, 5 of which are convolutional, and the last is fully-connected. The 
ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation is applied to the output of every 
convolutional  layer.  Moreover,  we  periodically  insert  a  pooling  layer 
between successive convolutional layers, in order to reduce the amount 
of parameters and computation in the network, and hence to also control 
overfitting. More precisely, we employ a Max pooling strategy with a 
3 × 3 filter size, and 1 × 1 stride. The input image size is 224 × 224 × 3. 
According to the chosen dataset, the output of the last fully-connected 
layer  is  fed  to  a  N-way  softmax,  which  produces  a  distribution  over 
the N class labels to predict, i.e. 6 for the Canadian and 23 for the local

As expected for the retrieval task performed with deep features, the 
similarity  measure  influences  the  retrieval  performances,  and  for  our 
problem, the best one seems to be the Euclidean distance (See Table 6 
and 7). Even a little less effective than for classification, the results can 
be considered satisfying and confirm the potential use of deep learning 
techniques for retrieval tasks. Overall, our proposed model turns out to 
be the most performing among the considered networks.

3. Results and discussion 

We  now  describe  the  experimentation  conducted  in  this  work.  In 
detail, in Section 3.1 we first describe the experimental setup adopted 
for the classification and retrieval tasks. Then, we report the results of 
the  experiments  performed  on  both  datasets  and  tasks  with  SeedNet, 
compared to existing CNNs (Section 3.2). After a further comparison of 
deep  vs  machine  learning methods  in Section  3.3, we  give  a detailed 
discussion of the obtained results in Section 3.4.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the authors have employed max pooling as a method to prevent overfitting in their deep learning pipeline. This technique reduces the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, thereby reducing the number of parameters and computations required in the network. However, there is no explicit mention of other regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization being used in the described deep learning pipeline. Therefore, while max pooling has been utilized to mitigate overfitting, it remains unclear whether additional regularization methods were implemented.
