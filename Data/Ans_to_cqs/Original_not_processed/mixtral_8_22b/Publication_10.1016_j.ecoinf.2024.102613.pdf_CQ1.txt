2019; Zamora-Izquierdo et al., 2019) and then machine learning and, 
more  recently,  deep  learning  techniques  are  applied  to  analyze  the 
generated data (Perakis et al., 2020; Swain et al., 2020). However, the 
traditional  data  management  systems  are  inadequate  to  handle  the 
volume, velocity, and variety of the generated data by the sensors and 
IoT devices (Wolfert et al., 2017). Hence the advanced data management

In smart farming, generally, data management can be divided into 
four elements: (1) data acquisition and storage, (2) data preprocessing, 
(3) data analysis, and (4) data visualization (Ouafiq et al., 2019). Data 
acquisition  is  the  process  of  acquiring  data  from  the  field  and  then 
storing them in digital storage for future analysis purposes (Rawat and 
Yadav,  2021).  The  data  are  collected  from  various  sources,  such  as 
sensors,  electronic  resources  (e.g.,  text,  video,  image),  and  public  re-
sources,  and  as  such,  the  data  are  generated  in  different  forms  (i.e., 
structured, semi-structured, and unstructured). The next element is data 
preprocessing, which can be defined as enhancing the quality of data 
that  impacts  the  analytical  processing  (Meena  and  Sujatha,  2019).  In 
this  stage,  unnecessary  data  (e.g.,  noise,  missing  value,  inconsistent 
data, duplicate data) are removed from the dataset before applying data

organization)  

• Data  loading  (Copying  or  loading  data  from  a  source  to  a

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline include using sensors, electronic resources like text, video, and image, and public resources. Sensors are commonly used to collect data in real-time, while electronic resources provide historical data. Public resources offer open access to large amounts of data that can be used for training models. Additionally, surveys can also be conducted to gather specific types of data required for the project. It is important to note that the type of data collected depends on the problem being solved and the availability of relevant data sources.

Based on the given context, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline include using sensors, electronic resources like text, video, and image, and public resources. These methods allow for the collection of both real-time and historical data, depending on the requirements of the project. Surveys may also be conducted to gather specific types of data required for the project.
