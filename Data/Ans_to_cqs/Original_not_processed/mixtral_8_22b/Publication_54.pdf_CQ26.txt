Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

The structure of this paper is organized as follows.
Section II describes data acquisition and preprocessing of
acquired dataset to overcome imbalanced and data overﬁt-
ting. Section III focuses on the deep learning models and
enhancement of ﬁne grained feature extraction accuracy by
swapping the misclassiﬁed data between the training and
validation datasets. Section IV illustrates the experimental
setting and the hardware requirements. Section V endorses
the proof of concept and validation of the purposed method-
ology. Section VI emphasizes the signiﬁcances of endemic
birds and its habitation. Finally, Section VII summarizes the
impact of the purposed model and presents directions for
future study.

In deep learning, a deep network [30], [31] is consid-
ered better than a shallow network because it learns rele-
vant features layer-by-layer with more precision and achieves
high-level feature extraction (texture, shape, size, color), con-
necting a set of features to a label from a given set of input
categories. However, in practice, deep learning networks have
some problems. For instance, deep neural networks often
suffer from the problem of vanishing gradients, wherein a
deep multilayer feed-forward network is difﬁcult to train and

IV. EXPERIMENTAL SETTINGS
To extract the relevant features of birds, we randomly split
the endemic bird data into 3,132 images for training and
760 images for testing. To allow the deep networks to con-
verge and improve the ability of the model to generalize
adeptly, we augmented the training dataset 10 times, resulting
in a total of 31,320 images. Then, 25,056 (80%) images were
used for training and 6,264 (20%) were used for validation.
The Inception-ResNet-v2 model was trained using the mini-
batch gradient descent algorithm with the batch size set to
32 and the learning rate maintained at 0.0001. The Adam
optimizer was used to ﬁne-tune the model with the following
parameters:

• Exponential decay rate of ﬁrst-moment estimation

of 0.9.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the provided context, there isn't explicit information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, the text does mention that Section II focuses on data acquisition and preprocessing to overcome imbalanced and data overfitting. This suggests that some form of balancing technique might be employed, but without further details, it cannot be confirmed which exact methods are utilized.
