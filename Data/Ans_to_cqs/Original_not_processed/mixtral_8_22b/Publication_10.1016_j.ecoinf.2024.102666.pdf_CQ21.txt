temporal and spatial factors on AC algorithm, and examines the factors 
limiting  its  development.  Lastly,  the  sixth  section  provides  a  concise 
summary of the entire experiment.

The  Case  2  Regional  Coast  Color  (C2RCC)  processor  is  an  atmo-
spheric  correction  module  developed  specifically  for  water  pixel  of 
satellite  images.  Utilizing  ANN  training,  the  processor  identifies  the 
radiation brightness of the top layer of the atmosphere, enabling it to 
obtain the reflectance of the water after AC (Brockmann et al., 2016). 
The  C2RCC  processor  takes  several  input  parameters  into  account, 
including lake salinity, temperature, ozone, atmospheric pressure, and 
elevation data. For the salinity data, a default value of 0.01 Practical 
salinity units (PSU) is set, representing the average salinity of freshwater 
lakes in the western region of China. Temperature and pressure values 
are obtained by searching for local meteorological information specific 
to the area of interest. Ozone levels are determined based on data ac-
quired  from  sources  such  as  the  Air  Quality  Index  (AQICN)  website

options, contribute to the stability of the search. Additionally, its effi-
cient standard marking system can remove low-quality pixels, thereby 
improving  search  quality  (Li  et  al.,  2023a,  2023b,  2023c,  2023d). 
However, L2gen requires an accurate understanding of aerosol types to 
obtain high-quality Rrs  retrieval, and the complex aerosols of PL make 
this practice less efficient.
