Therefore, it is important to take into account several features and 
place  emphasis  on  the  features  that  are  efficient  for  different  herbs. 
Performance  of  deep  neural  networks  will  be  enhanced  when  the 
attention  mechanism  enables  them  to  precisely  focus  on  all  relevant 
input elements. This method has become a popular technique in DL for 
text classification, image interpretation, and sentiment analysis (Wani 
et al., 2020). Models like attention mechanisms have high accuracy, and 
most of these mechanisms can be jointly trained with a basic model, such 
as a recurrent neural network or a convolutional neural network (CNN), 
using  a  regular  back-propagation  algorithm.  In  DL  models,  feature 
extraction  takes  place  hierarchically  through  CNNs  from  a  global 
perspective. At the same time, the attention mechanism focuses on the 
significant information of an image, improving the performance of CNN

attention mechanisms enhance efficiency of deep learning (DL) networks by allowing them to precisely focus on 
all relevant input elements. In order to enhance the performance of the proposed model, the CA was implemented 
based on four pooling operations including global average pooling-based CA (GAP-CA), mixed pooling-based CA 
(Mixed-CA), gated pooling-based CA (Gated-CA), and tree pooling-based CA (Tree-CA) operations. The results 
showed that the DL model based on Tree-CA had promising performance and outperformed other state-of-the-art 
models, achieving the values of 99.63%, 99.38%, 99.52%, 99.74%, and 99.42%, for accuracy, precision, recall, 
specificity, and F1-score, respectively. The findings support our proposed attention model's success in identifying 
medicinal  plants  from  similar  poisonous  plants.  Recent  advancements  in  computer-based  technologies  and

In Fig. 8, the performance of the presented models in different epochs 
is  reported.  As  can  be  seen,  the  performance  of  the  proposed  models 
increases with the number of epochs and the number of training data. 
According to Fig. 8a, the SCAM-Herb model based on Tree-CA module 
with 50% of dataset and 100 epochs achieved an accuracy of 96.64%. 
With  90%  of  the  trained  dataset,  this  model  was  able  to  diagnose

texture features. A SCAM-Herb model based on deep recognition struc-
ture is proposed in this study to address these problems in plant image 
recognition,  especially  for  those  with  similar  features.  The  proposed 
module architecture is constructed based on the ResNeSt model, which 
is a ResNet variant with a CA and SA blocks (He et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 
2022b).  The  proposed  model  employs  a  group  of  convolution  layers 
from  the  ResNeXt  network  with  a  channel-wise  attention  (CWA) 
mechanism while maintaining the ResNet network structure (Xie et al., 
2017). The CWA mechanism uses the ResNeSt block to facilitate infor-
mation interaction between cross feature map groups. To put it more 
simply, the SCAM-Herb model is primarily built on the ResNeSt struc-
ture. Additionally, it uses SA along with CWA for split attention. This 
allows the model focus on both the position and importance of the most
