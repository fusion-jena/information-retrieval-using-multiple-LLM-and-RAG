et al., 2021; Stowell et al., 2019). Some of the state-of-the-art techniques 
for  handling  big  datasets,  such  as  deep  learning  and  convolutional 
neural networks (Stowell, 2022; Stowell et al., 2019), can be difficult to 
run for ornithologists, managers, and researchers without bioacoustics 
or  engineering  backgrounds.  However,  user-friendly  and  ready-to-use 
machine  learning  approaches  have  recently  been  developed  and  are 
increasingly accessible to respond to real-life monitoring challenges and 
the general public (Cole et al., 2022). Among these approaches is Bird-
NET, a research project between The Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the 
Chemnitz University of Technology. BirdNET facilitates the automated 
detection and classification of bird vocalizations, through a developed 
deep neural network, from sound recordings (Kahl et al., 2021). Bird-
NET is able to identify over 3000 bird species (Wood et al., 2021) and is

identify which of the candidate sounds are vocalizations of the desired 
species (e.g. Rycyk et al., 2022).

Passive acoustic monitoring is a powerful tool for monitoring vocally active taxa. Automated signal recognition 
software reduces the expert time needed for recording analyses and allows researchers and managers to manage 
large  acoustic  datasets.  The  application  of  state-of-the-art  techniques  for  automated  identification,  such  as 
Convolutional Neural Networks, may be challenging for ecologists and managers without informatics or engi-
neering expertise. Here, we evaluated the use of AudioMoth — a low-cost and open-source sound recorder — to 
monitor a threatened and patchily distributed species, the Eurasian bittern (Botaurus stellaris). Passive acoustic 
monitoring was carried out across 17 potential wetlands in north Spain. We also assessed the performance of 
BirdNET —  an automated and freely available classifier able to identify over 3000 bird species —  and Kalei-

%Query
Query: "What process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model (e.g., Model serialization, Platform selection)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information on the specific process used to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. However, it mentions that BirdNET is a research project between The Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the Chemnitz University of Technology, and it uses a developed deep neural network to facilitate the automated detection and classification of bird vocalizations from sound recordings. This suggests that the deployment process likely involved collaboration between both institutions and the implementation of the deep neural network into the BirdNET system. Unfortunately, further details about the exact steps taken to deploy the model are not mentioned in the given context.
