where θ is the set of parameters of the neural network to be optimised by 
minimizing the loss function of Eq. (2). 

Using this very common deep learning framework, it is possible to 
show that the species assemblage predictor Sλ(x) of Eq. (1) is consistent 
λ(x) when  the

number  of  training  samples  increases.  In  other  words,  our  species 
assemblage predictor is as simple as training a deep neural network with 
a cross-entropy loss function on the presence-only samples and thresh-
olding  the  output  softmax  probabilities  to  get  the  assemblage  of  pre-
dicted species.

marised in the Fig. 1.

%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide explicit information about which specific cloud computing platform was used for deploying the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the computations were performed using the High Performance Computing (HPC) resources from GENCI-[CINES](http://www.cines.fr/) (Centre Informatique National de l’Enseignement Supérieur) under the allocation [2020-A0080911732](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.46290) made by Grand Equipement National De Calcul Intensif (GENCI). Therefore, we cannot determine if the deployment was done on platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform based solely on the given information.
