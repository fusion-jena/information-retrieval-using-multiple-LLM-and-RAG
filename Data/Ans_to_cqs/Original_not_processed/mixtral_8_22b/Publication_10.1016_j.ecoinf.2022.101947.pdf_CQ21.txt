Trails  were  collected  from  free-ranging  Amur  tiger,  of  unknown 
identity, at the study sites. Table 2 reports the trail ID collected for each 
trail. As described above (Section 3.1) sub-trails were formed where >10 
footprints existed in any one trail. For example, the table indicates that 
using the 25 left hind footprints from trail MW09, we were able to derive 
four sub-trails. Section 3.5 below explains how the sex classification for 
images and the resulting designations for each trail were made.

3.4. Algorithm training using data from captive Amur tigers 

A  classification  dendrogram  was  generated  using  the  FIT  pairwise 
comparison model for 44 trails from captive Amur tigers (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 3). The process was iterated multiple times by altering elements 
within  the  model  to  generate  the  fewest  misclassifications  (Li  et  al., 
2018). The final classification model correctly predicted 44 tigers giving 
100%  accuracy.  This  algorithm  was  then  used  to  classify  the  free-

team. The track ID method, based on an objective approach described by 
Sharma et al., 2005, failed because survey teams were unable to obtain 
enough data at the field site during the study period.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it can be inferred that the FIT pairwise comparison model was used to generate a classification dendrogram for 44 trails from captive Amur tigers. The process was iterated multiple times by altering elements within the model to generate the fewest misclassifications. The final classification model correctly predicted 44 tigers with 100% accuracy. It is possible that postprocessing steps such as metrics calculation or confusion matrix generation may have been performed to evaluate the performance of the model. However, without explicit mention of these steps in the given context, it cannot be confirmed.
