approach zero rapidly. This occurrence impedes the network’s ability to 
learn long-term dependencies effectively.

our baseline (i.e., a variation of the Random Forest algorithm) and maintain efficiency over time. The availability 
of the source code facilitates customization for monitoring additional pollutants, while shared air quality datasets 
ensure reproducibility.

The LSTM model is trained using the mean squared error (MSE) as 
loss function and the ADAM optimization (Kingma and Ba (2015)). To 
avoid overfitting, a dropout layer is added. The dropout layer, described 
¨
by 
Ozgür  and  Nar  (2020),  is  a  regularization  method  that  randomly 
excludes some inputs from activation and weight updates while training 
a network. Inputs not set to zero are scaled up by 1/(1 (cid:0) rate) such that 
the  sum  over  all  inputs  remains  the  same.  The  training  set  is  pre-
processed using a MinMaxScaler that transforms each feature by scaling 
it  to  a  [0–1]  range.  The  dimension  of  the  temporal  window  must  be 
selected  dynamically  considering  the  performance  obtained  with 
different values on the available dataset. 

In  the  specific  case  of  Modena,  an  Italian  city  spanning  183  km2, 

there are two legal AQ stations denoted by red dots in Fig. 6.

Several  configurations  of  the  LSTM  architecture  were  tested  and 
compared  in  Casarotti  (2021)  showing  that  a  three  hidden  layer 
configuration of LSTM does not radically improve the performances, and 
with a small training dataset might be affected by overfitting. 

Since the co-location period needs to be as short as possible and deep 
learning models usually need many input data, the implemented solu-
tion  of  LSTM  is  a  trade-off  between  reaching  good  performances  and 
minimizing the dimension of the training data. 

For this reason, the LSTM model implemented has only one hidden 
layer  of  y  neurons,  where  y  is  determined  based  on  the  number  of 
training observations: 

y =

Ns
α*(Ni + No)

where Ns is the number of samples in the training set, Ni is the number of 
input neurons, No  is the number of output neurons, and α is usually a 
value between 5 and 10.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about the exact location or platform of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions that the source code is available, which ensures reproducibility and enables customization for monitoring additional pollutants. However, without further details, it is impossible to determine whether the code repository can be found on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
