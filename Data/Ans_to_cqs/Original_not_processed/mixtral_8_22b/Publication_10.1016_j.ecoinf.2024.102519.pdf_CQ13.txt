research  on  artificial  intelligence  (AI).  Traditional  linear  program-
ming, nonlinear programming, dynamic programming, modern genetic 
algorithms  (GA),  particle  swarm  optimization  algorithms,  and  deep 
learning have achieved great success in both theoretical and practical 
applications. Mohammadi (2023) modeled various drought timescales 
by  combining  artificial  neural  networks  with  firefly  algorithms. 
Emamgholizadeh  et  al.  (2023)  used  enhanced  machine  learning 
methods to predict soil cation exchange capacity in the southern region 
of China. Ghezelbash et al. (2023a) combined the GA and firefly opti-
mization  algorithm  with  the  K-means  clustering  method  for  copper- 
related geochemical footprints of porphyry and skarn in the Baft area 
of Kerman, Iran, and achieved good research results. Ghezelbash et al. 
(2023b) added GA to K-means and SVM to construct GIS-based mineral 
prospecting maps, and the results showed that the SVM model based on

The process of identifying an ESA is a multicondition optimization 
problem. We first divided the source into multiple candidate lists, each 
with specific location coordinates and areas, to determine the optimal 
source.  Next,  three  key  factors  were  considered:  the  source  area,  dis-
tance from the center of the area, and the importance value of the ESA. 
Basic quantification conditions were set for these three key factors, and 
the  specific  quantification  standards  are  listed  in  Table  5.  Genetic 
optimization  algorithms  were  used  to  adjust  the  hyperparameters  to 
determine the algorithm parameters for this study referring to the use of 
artificial neural networks, SVM, and random forests for landslide sus-
ceptibility prediction (Daviran et al., 2023). Finally, the fitness function 
was determined based on the specific conditions of this study. The entire 
optimization process was implemented by programming in Python, and 
the main steps were as follows:

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning models mentioned. However, it can be noted that genetic optimization algorithms were used to adjust the hyperparameters to determine the algorithm parameters for this study. This suggests that the authors likely experimented with different values for common hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and choice of optimizer. These hyperparameters play a crucial role in determining the performance of a deep learning model, and their optimal values often depend on the specific problem being addressed. Therefore, without further details, it cannot be definitively stated what exact hyperparameters were used in the deep learning models discussed in the given context.
