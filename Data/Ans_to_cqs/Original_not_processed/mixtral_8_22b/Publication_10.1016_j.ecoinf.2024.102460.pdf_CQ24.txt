5.2. Land type conversion drivers 

We  added  the  extracted  land  type  expansion  raster  to  LEAS  and 
imported  the  driver  raster  map.  Subsequently,  the  RFC  was  used  to 
obtain the probability of development and the contribution of drivers for 
each land category. We also set the sampling rate to 0.1, the number of 
decision trees to 20, the number of features used to train the random 
forest to 9, and the number of parallels to 12 to improve the execution 
speed. In summary, the contribution rates and root mean square errors 
of each driving factor to the expansion of each land type were obtained 
(Fig. 6). The root mean square error (RMSE) of the PLUS model's analysis 
of the drivers of expansion for the six land types in the YRB-SX for the 
years  2000–2010  and  2010–2020  was  less  than  0.2,  and  the  model 
performed well. 

The higher the variable contribution rate is, the greater the impact of

These seeds can create a new spatial land type and form a new patch 
unit consisting of a group of cells of the same land type. To control the 
generation  of  multiple  land  type  patches,  we  propose  a  threshold 
reduction rule based on a competitive process, which gradually restricts 
the possibility of organic growth and spontaneous growth of different 
land types as the iteration process progresses. If a new land type gains an 
advantage in a round of competition, the reduced threshold is used to 
evaluate the candidate land type c selected by the wheel to ensure the 
new land type's expansion priority, as follows:

4.3.3. LSTM model 

The  long  short-term  memory  (LSTM)  model  is  a  common  deep 
learning model used to solve the prediction problem of time series data 
(Tang  et  al.,  2023).  Compared  with  traditional  machine  learning 
models, the LSTM model has better performance and ability to manage 
the  prediction  problem  of  time  series  data,  especially  the  long-term 
dependency  problem  and  multivariate  time  series  data,  and  has 
obvious  advantages  (Liu  et  al.,  2021;  Tang  et  al.,  2023;  Zhou  et  al., 
2023). Fig. 3 shows the prediction process of the LSTM model and the BP 
model.  This  study  compares  these  two  models  and  the  Markov  chain 
model.

Optimizing land allocation through a multiobjective programming 
(MOP) model combined with uncertainty analysis methods can provide

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or managing random seed values. However, it does mention the use of the Random Forest Classifier (RFC), which inherently involves some level of randomness due to its nature of creating multiple decision trees from randomly sampled subsets of the dataset.

To address this issue, one strategy could be setting a specific seed value before training the model. By doing so, the results will become reproducible since the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers will be generated every time the code runs. Another approach would be employing cross-validation techniques such as k-fold cross-validation, where the dataset is divided into 'k' equal parts, and the model is trained and tested 'k' times, each time using a different subset as the test set. This helps reduce overfitting and provides more robust estimates of the model's performance.

However, without further details regarding the specific implementation of the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context, I cannot provide a definitive answer on how randomness is handled in this particular case.
