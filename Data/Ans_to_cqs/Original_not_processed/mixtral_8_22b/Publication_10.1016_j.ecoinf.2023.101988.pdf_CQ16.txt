Season x Habitat

• Established streetscapes: urban or suburban zones that were estab-
lished  prior  to  the  year  2000.  Gardens  and  green  spaces  consist 
predominately of mature trees, a mixture of native and introduced 
tropical species; further major development is not anticipated.  
• New  streetscapes:  urban  or  suburban  zones  where  construction 
began no earlier than 2001. Clearing of native vegetation has been 
relatively  recent  and  gardens  and  green  spaces  have  few  mature 
trees. Development may be ongoing.

%Query
Query: "What criteria are used to determine when training is complete (e.g., validation loss plateau)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The table titled "Percentage of species identified by observer and audio for each habitat" provides information about the methods used to identify species in different habitats. However, it does not provide any information regarding the criteria used to determine when training is complete. Therefore, based on the given context, I do not know what criteria are used to determine when training is complete.
