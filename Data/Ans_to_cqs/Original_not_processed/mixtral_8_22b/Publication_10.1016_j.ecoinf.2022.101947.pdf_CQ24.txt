Data validation was performed on the captive Amur tiger dataset to 
determine the optimal number of footprint trails required for the algo-
rithm training set and test sets that could provide an accurate population 
estimate. Fig. 4 shows the result of a holdback trial partitioning test on 
training sets for 44 captive Amur tigers. Using the algorithm generated 
in FIT, the analysis was iterated 10 times for each combination of test/ 
training  size,  with  randomly  selected  trails,  to  examine  how  the  pre-
dicted outcome compared with the known test set size. The figure shows, 
for example, that then the test set size (y axis) comprises trails from 4 
tigers, and the test/training set size comprises trails from 04/40 tigers, 
the predicted test set sizes are very similar across a range of partitioning 
trials. However, when the test set size is 36 tigers, and the test/training 
ratio 36/08 tigers, there is a wide range of predicted test set sizes and the

situations where field data collectors have no experience locating foot-
prints, or there are no local trackers available, it may also be difficult to 
collect enough data. The existence of footprints is also dependent on the 
vagaries of the weather, and so planning a short window of fieldwork 
with no flexibility can present further challenges. In areas where pop-
ulation densities are extremely low (as reported in this study), finding 
enough  signs  (in  this  case  footprints)  for  a  full  survey  may  be  chal-
lenging,  and  require  more  effort,  but  this  applies  to  most  if  not  all 
techniques  for  monitoring  populations  that  exist  at  low  density.  No 
longitudinal studies have yet been undertaken to assess the variability of 
footprints  over  time  and  this  is  an  area  worthy  of  investigation.  Our 
preliminary field observations suggest that frequent monitoring might 
allow changes in track size and shape over time to be incorporated in the

mean of the predicted test set size diverges from the actual test set size. 
Optimal classification accuracy was obtained when the test set size 
was smallest relative to the training set. However, even when the test to 
training set  ratio  was  32:12, the  predicted value  was  close  to the  ex-
pected value, demonstrating the robustness of the model.

Helpful Answer:
The context does not directly address the specific strategies used to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it does discuss a methodology used to manage randomness in the process of determining the optimal number of footprint trails needed for algorithm training and testing sets. This method involves using a holdback trial partitioning test on training sets for 44 captive Amur tigers, which is iterated 10 times for each combination of test/training size with randomly selected trails. This approach allows for examining how the predicted outcome compares with the known test set size, providing insights into the impact of randomness on the results. While this strategy is specific to the given context, it illustrates a broader principle applicable to handling randomness in machine learning pipelines - namely, employing repeated trials with different random seeds or sampling methods to understand the variability and robustness of the models.
