B. Deep Learning Experiment

The second experiment is similar to the ﬁrst one but it uses
deep learning CNNs to determine if the SSPB introduces a
signiﬁcant bias. It corresponds to the second row in Figure I.
There is no segmentation applied to the data, only a resize to
224x224 pixels before running the network on the data.

V. RESULTS

A. Hand-crafted Feature Extraction Experiment

Table III shows the results related to the hand-crafted feature
extraction approach experiment. The accuracy obtained is
always considerably better when the biased dataset is used,
with a 26.4% difference when top-5 is used. This clearly shows
that SSPB introduces a signiﬁcant bias.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of which specific platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, it cannot be determined from this context whether AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or any other platform was used for deployment.
