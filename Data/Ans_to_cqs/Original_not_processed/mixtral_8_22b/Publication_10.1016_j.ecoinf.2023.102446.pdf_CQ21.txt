2.2. Data collection and processing

A  comprehensive  explanation  of  additional  statistics,  such  as  the 
decomposition of individual MI (Eqs. 5 and 6) as well as individual es-
timates of U, S, and R (Eqs. 7, 8, 9, and 10) involved in the generation of 
process networks is provided in the Supplementary text (1.1 Method). 
TPINet  effectively  works  when  there  are  at  least  200  data  points 
(Goodwell  and  Kumar,  2017a).  This  approach  can reveal  interactions 
occurring on hourly to daily time scales over several-day-time windows. 
Studies  employing  an  information  theory-based  transfer  entropy 
approach for network generation, with datasets at sub-hourly and sub- 
daily scales, have consistently provided robust results (Goodwell et al., 
2018; Goodwell and Kumar, 2017a; Goodwell and Kumar, 2017b).

Understanding processes and factors affecting carbon uptake by the 
vegetation is essential for investigating the ability of an ecosystem to 
capture and store CO2 (Di Vita et al., 2017). Gross primary productivity 
(GPP) indicates the overall amount of CO2  captured by the ecosystem 
during the process of photosynthesis (Kirschbaum et al., 2001; Wu et al., 
2014).  Ecosystem  respiration  (RE)  refers  to  the  total  amount  of  CO2 
released  into  the  atmosphere  during  autotrophic  and  heterotrophic 
respiration (Hopkins et al., 2013). The difference between GPP and RE 
indicates Net Ecosystem Productivity (NEP), and the negative of NEP 
denotes  Net  Ecosystem  Exchange  (NEE).  NEE  indicates  whether  the 
ecosystem is a net carbon source to the atmosphere (positive NEE) or a 
net carbon sink (negative NEE). An in-depth understanding of NEE re-
veals the carbon dynamics associated with the ecosystem as it provides

We  used  a  TIPNet-based  process  network  approach  and  identified 
causal  links  between  variables  in  the  pine-dominated  ecosystem.  We 
considered a maximum memory duration of the variables up to 6 h to 
focus on sub-daily scale processes. Similar to Supplementary Fig. 4, we 
computed the contributions of 6-h variability to within-week variability 
(for each week), and the results are shown in Fig. 3. NEE has variance 
ratios around 20â€“40% across 104 weeks with relatively high values in 
DJF; hence, the sub-daily signals cannot be ignored. The total variability 
is highly modulated by sub-daily variabilities of SH, LH, NEE, WS, and P, 
whereas such contributions are poor for VPD, RE, NSR, and RH. Inter-
estingly, the variability of TA is impacted by sub-daily variabilities only 
in  the  monsoon  season,  possibly  due  to  the  influence  of  P  in  the 
ecosystem.  Therefore,  the  present  study  shows  the  sub-daily  scale  in-

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific details about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, based on general machine learning practices, some common postprocessing steps include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, and creating confusion matrices.

Saliency maps help visualize which parts of the input data were most important for the model's predictions. They highlight areas in the input data that had the highest impact on the output prediction.

Calculating metrics involves evaluating the performance of the trained model using various evaluation measures like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc. These metrics help assess how well the model performed on unseen data.

Creating confusion matrices is another way to evaluate the performance of the model. A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the predicted and actual classifications made by the model. It helps identify where the model is making mistakes and what types of errors it is making.

In summary, while the given context does not explicitly mention any postprocessing steps, commonly employed techniques include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, and creating confusion matrices.
