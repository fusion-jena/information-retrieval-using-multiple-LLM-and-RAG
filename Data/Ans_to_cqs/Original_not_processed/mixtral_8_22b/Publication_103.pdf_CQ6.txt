the network. Therefore, a common practice is to initialize
the network by pre-training it on a big available dataset
and then fine-tune it on the scarcer domain-specific data.
Concretely, the methodology we used in our experiment
for transferring knowledge from dataset A to dataset B is
the following:

1. The network is first trained from scratch on dataset
A by using a multinomial logistic regression on top
of the SOFTMAX layer and the linear classification
layer.

2. The linear classification layer used for dataset A is
then replaced by a new one aimed at classifying the
classes in B. It is initialized with random weights.

3. The other layers are kept unchanged so as to

initialize the learning of dataset B with the weights
learned from A.

4. The network is trained on the images in B.

Table 1 shows the modified GoogleNet model with
the batch normalization added outside the Inception
modules. Just like the original GoogleNet, the model is
comprised of several inception modules, however Batch
Normalization is added inside each inception module for
faster convergence right after each pooling layer. Figure 1
shows how the modified Inception module is comprised.
The model was implemented by using the Caffe frame-
work [37]. A batch size of 16 images was used for each
iteration, with a learning rate of 0.0075 with images of
224×224 resolution. Simple crop and resize data augmen-
tation was used with the default settings of Caffe.

very beginning the weights of ImageNet were used.
For example, H1KI.PC.PC means the transfer
learning was progressive, done from ImageNet, to
Herbarium1K, to PlantCLEF, and tested with
PlantCLEF data.

• Initialization: weights used to initialize the model.
• Training: training set used (e.g., Herbarium255

training set, PlantCLEF training set, etc.)

• Testing: test set used (e.g., Herbarium255 test set,

PlantCLEF test set, etc.)

• Top-1/Top-5: accuracy achieved with top-1 and

top-5 best predictions, respectively.

no collector was shared by the training and testing sets
to avoid bias in the data. The following four experiments
were conducted:

• R.H255.H255: The neural network was initialized

randomly, trained on the Herbarium255 training set
(70%), and tested on the Herbarium255 test set (30%).

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, some relevant details can be found regarding the initialization and training process of the deep learning models mentioned.

In the context, it is stated that the network is initially trained from scratch on dataset A using a multinomial logistic regression on top of the SOFTMAX layer and the linear classification layer. This suggests that the input data might have been prepared accordingly to fit these requirements.

Additionally, when dealing with dataset B, the linear classification layer used for dataset A is replaced by a new one aimed at classifying the classes in B. It is initialized with random weights. Other layers remain unchanged to initialize the learning of dataset B with the weights learned from A.

Regarding image processing, simple crop and resize data augmentation was used with the default settings of Caffe. Images had a resolution of 224 x 224 pixels, and a batch size of 16 images was utilized for each iteration during training.

However, without further context, it cannot be determined if any additional preprocessing steps were taken, such as normalizing pixel values, removing noise, or handling missing data.
