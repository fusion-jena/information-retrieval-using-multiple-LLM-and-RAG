6.3. User study 

We conducted a user study on our Urban GVI estimation system, and 
25 participants filled out a questionnaire. The questionnaire includes the 
following items:  

• How familiar are you with Green View Index (GVI)?  
• How  important  do  you  perceive  GVI  to  be  in  urban  green  space 

planning?  

• How willing are you to use GreenCam for capturing urban GVI?  
• How smooth did you find the operation of GreenCam?  

• How usable did you find GreenCam for capturing GVI?  
• How similar do you find the photos captured by GreenCam to what 

the human eye perceives?

performance of the trained SegFormer on each category. The average 
IOU and pixel accuracy (PA) for tree, lawn, and shrub are 72.82% and 
82.89%, respectively. However, the performance on the facility category 
is relatively poor, which could be attributed to the limited annotations 
available for this category in the UGE-D.

5.2. Deep GVI learning 

In  GreenCam,  we  measure  photo  GVI  by  SegFormer  (Xie  et  al., 
2021),  a  state-of-the-art  Transformer-based  model  for  semantic  seg-
mentation. As shown in Fig. 12, SegFormer follows the encoder-decoder 
structure, which combines a Transformer-based encoder (i.e., MiT) with 
a  lightweight  decoder  (i.e.,  ALL-MLP)  that  is  composed  entirely  of 
multilayer perceptron (MLP) blocks.

%Query
Query: "How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. Therefore, I cannot determine whether they used methods such as grid search or random search for optimization.
