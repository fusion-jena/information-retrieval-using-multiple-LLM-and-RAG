Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be taken to improve its performance. These steps often involve preparing the input data so it is suitable for use with machine learning algorithms. Some common preprocessing techniques include:

1. Normalization: This involves rescaling the values of numeric features to a standard range, such as between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. Normalizing inputs helps prevent certain features from being overemphasized due to their larger scale, ensuring all features contribute equally during training.

2. Scaling: Similar to normalization, scaling adjusts the range of feature values but does not necessarily rescale them to a specific range. For example, one might apply z-score normalization, where each value is transformed based on its distance from the mean in terms of standard deviations.

3. Cleaning: Data cleaning involves identifying and handling missing, inconsistent, or erroneous data points. Techniques used for this purpose include imputation (filling in missing values using estimates), outlier detection and removal, and error correction.

4. Feature engineering: This process involves creating new features from existing ones to better represent the underlying patterns in the data. Examples include polynomial expansion, binarization, and encoding categorical variables.

5. Encoding: Categorical variables need to be converted into numerical form before they can be fed into a deep learning model. Common encoding methods include label encoding, one-hot encoding, and ordinal encoding.

6. Splitting datasets: Before training a model, it is essential to split the dataset into separate subsets for training, validation, and testing purposes. This allows for evaluating the model's performance accurately while avoiding issues like overfitting.
