Helpful Answer:
Data bias can significantly affect the performance of deep learning models. To address this issue during preprocessing, several techniques can be employed. One common technique is stratified sampling, which involves dividing the dataset into subsets based on specific criteria, such as class labels, and then randomly selecting samples from each subset to create training and testing datasets. This ensures that the distribution of classes in the training set remains similar to that of the original dataset, reducing potential biases.

Another approach to mitigate data bias is through resampling methods like oversampling and undersampling. Oversampling involves duplicating examples from underrepresented classes to balance the dataset, while undersampling removes instances from overrepresented classes. These techniques help achieve a balanced dataset, improving the model's ability to learn patterns across all classes equally. However, they should be applied carefully, as oversampling may lead to overfitting, and undersampling could result in loss of valuable information.

Diverse data collection is another strategy to tackle data bias by gathering a wide range of representative samples. This method aims to capture various aspects of the problem domain, ensuring that the trained model generalizes well to unseen data. Incorporating diverse data sources can also improve the robustness and fairness of the deep learning model.

In summary, addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline can involve using techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Each method has its advantages and limitations; therefore, choosing the appropriate technique depends on the nature of the dataset and the specific requirements of the task at hand.
