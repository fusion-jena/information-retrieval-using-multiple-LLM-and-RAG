interest and for the official fire perimeters of the EFFIS database. The 
algorithm automatically selects the date range of interest for the pre- 
and post-fire scenes in the case of using an official perimeter from the 
EFFIS database. Otherwise, the date range can be manually selected by 
the user. The automatic search for pre- and post-fire scenes of acceptable 
quality can either be based on a single-date approach or on pixel-based 
temporal  mean  composites  as  determined  by  the  Sentinel  (QA60)  or 
Landsat (QA_PIXEL) quality assessment bands (see Section 2.2.1). When 
the  user requests the  calculation of a  spectral index in FIREMAP, the 
result is automatically displayed on the main screen as a continuous or 
categorized fire severity map, with the possibility of using user-defined 
thresholds.  The  latter  has  been  included  because  of  the  ecosystem- 
dependent  nature  of  the  relationships  between  the  CBI  and  spectral

%Query
Query: "What criteria are used to determine when training is complete (e.g., validation loss plateau)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not explicitly mention any specific criteria used to determine when training is completed in the context of the FIREMAP system. However, it mentions that the system uses machine learning techniques such as Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for burned area mapping and fire severity assessment. In general, common criteria used to determine when training is complete in machine learning include reaching a certain number of epochs, achieving a desired level of accuracy, or observing a plateau in the validation loss. Without further information, we cannot definitively state which criteria are used specifically for the FIREMAP system.
