according to a 60%–40% ratio. Table 6 presents the details about the 
total number of samples, the training, and the validation samples. The 
distribution of samples is represented in Fig. 8. It is worthy to note that 
after selecting the samples, we checked all the samples carefully and as 
we see in Fig. 8 (as an example); surprisingly, no mis-collected samples 
were detected in the automatically collected samples.

• Numerical  evaluation:  The  validation  samples  allow  us  to  measure 
numerous metrics such as overall accuracy (OA), kappa coefficient 
(KC), producer’s accuracy (PA), user’s accuracy (UA), commission 
error (CE), and omission error (OE) and to report them in confusion 
matrix format. The above metrics are defined based on the values of 
true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), and false 
negative (FN). Let Table 5 be a sample for the confusion matrix, then 
the OA and KC are defined as Eqs. (26) and (27), respectively.

• Visual assessment: A variety of image subsets are obtained from cor-
responding  GE  images  and  the  final  citrus  map  to  have  a  visual 
evaluation  of  the  classification  process.  The  coordinates  of  the 
cropped subsets are also surveyed in the field operation.

The  other  category  of  features  that  are  used  in  this  paper  is  the 
textural  indices  group  which  are  calculated  based  on  the  average  of 
three 10 m-RGB bands of the Sentinel-2 dataset. We use eight textural 
descriptors, including entropy, mean, variance, homogeneity, contrast, 
dissimilarity, second momentary, and correlation, which are calculated 
from Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrices (GLCM) (Haralick et al., 1973). 
The  formulas  related  to  the  textural  indices  are  collected  in  Table  4. 
These features help us to detect citrus orchards and are very useful for 
discriminating different types of land coverages from each other.

Helpful Answer:

The numerical evaluation of the deep learning model uses several metrics to assess its performance. These include overall accuracy (OA), kappa coefficient (KC), producer’s accuracy (PA), user’s accuracy (UA), commission error (CE), and omission error (OE). These metrics are reported in a confusion matrix format. They are defined based on the values of true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN). Specifically, the overall accuracy (OA) is calculated using Eq. (26), while the kappa coefficient (KC) is determined by Eq. (27). However, it should be noted that the specific equations were not included in the given context.
