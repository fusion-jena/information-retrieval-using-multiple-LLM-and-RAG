During the DeepLabV3+ model training process, feeding large-size 
images directly to the network may lead to memory overflow. There-
fore, it is necessary to cut all remote sensing images and semantic labels 
of land cover classes into a series of regular image blocks for input. To 
maximize the sample size and maintain consistency with the cropping 
approach in the model prediction stage, we set the cropping size to 32 ×
32  pixels  with  a  redundancy  rate  of  0.5.  In  continuing,  70%  of  the 
dataset  was  used  for  training  and  the  remaining  for  validation.  The 
training set was enhanced by: (i) Flipping the images and labels along 
the X or Y axis; (ii) Exchanging between multiple image channels while 
the  labels remain unchanged; (iii)  Randomly rotating  the images and 
◦
labels by 90
; and (iv) randomly adding noise to the 
images  while  maintaining  the  labels  unchanged  (Ye  et  al.,  2022).

Model

ReduceLROnPlateau was as follows: If the validation loss value did not 
decrease  after  5  consecutive  epochs,  the  learning  rate  was  halved.  If 
there was no decrease in the validation loss value after 10 consecutive 
epochs, the training process was terminated. Both model training and 
inference were executed on a GeForce RTX 3070 GPU.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken during the training process. Firstly, the dataset was divided into two parts - 70% for training and the remaining 30% for validation. This approach helps prevent overfitting and allows the model to learn from diverse data points. Secondly, the training set was enhanced using various techniques such as flipping the images and labels along the X or Y axis, exchanging between multiple image channels, randomly rotating the images and labels by 90 degrees, and randomly adding noise to the images while keeping the labels unchanged. These methods help increase the diversity of the training data and improve the robustness of the model. Lastly, the ReduceLROnPlateau method was employed to adjust the learning rate based on the performance of the validation loss. This technique ensures that the model continues to learn effectively even when the initial learning rate might be too high or low. Overall, these measures contribute to improving the generalization ability of the deep learning model.
