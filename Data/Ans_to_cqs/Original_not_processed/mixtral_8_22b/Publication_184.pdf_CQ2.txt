In  order  to  train  the  model,  it  is important to provide not only 
the  class  of  the  object  but  also  the  bounding  box  data  of  the 
object  as  correct  answer.  In  this  context,  we  parsed  the  x,  y 
coordinates, width and height of the fish in the annotation of the 
image’s  dataset.  In  addition,  we  used  data  augmentation  to 
extend the amount of data. 

The  model  has  better  performance  as  number  of  epochs 
increases.  However,  when  number  of  epochs  exceeds  200,  the 
network  seems  to  be  overfitted  to  training  data.  As  a  result, 
Table  I  shows  the  hyper-parameters  used  to  train  and  validate 
the Yolo model.

Furthermore,  YOLOv3  has  been  made  with  another 
improvement,  the  new  CNN  feature  extractor  named  Darknet-
53. It is a 53 layered CNN that uses 3x3 and 1x1 convolutional 
layers. It has demonstrated the advanced accuracy but with less 
floating-point  tasks  and  better  speed.  For  example,  it  has  less 
the  same 
floating-point  operations 
performance at a double speed. It utilizes also skip connections 
network inspired from ResNet.

The data augmentation technique was used in this study, which 
help  to  extend  the  amount  of  information  by  adding  adjusted 
copies of already existing data, and it acts as a  regularizer and 
makes  a  difference  to  reduce  the  overfitting.  While  training, 
before input into the model, each image was randomly sampled 
by  one  of  the  following  options;  the  entire  original  image, 
horizontal  flip,  grayscale,  blur,  noise  and  cropping.  So,  each 
image  was  horizontally  flipped,  grayscale  was  applied  to  25% 
of images, blur was up to 10px, noise was up to 10% of pixels, 
and for the cropping operation, a patch with the same size as the 
original  image  was  randomly  cropped  from  image.  Some 
examples of the data augmentation step are illustrated in Figure 
3.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context primarily discusses the application of deep learning for hyperspectral image classification and fish tracking using IEEE datasets. From this context, we can infer that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data. This includes both hyperspectral images and standard images containing fishes. The authors use these images to train their models, specifically the YOLOv3 model, for various purposes such as object detection and classification. Additionally, they mention the use of bounding box data, which is typically represented as coordinates within the image data itself. Therefore, based on the given context, the main data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are image data and bounding box data.
