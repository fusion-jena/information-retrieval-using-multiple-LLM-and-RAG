Spinach classification, and columnar cactus recognition. Overall, deep 
learning models have shown great potential in plant leaf recognition and 
disease  detection,  and  their  application  can  contribute  to  improve

leaf-based  plant  species  classification.  However,  medicinal  plants  are 
not the primary focus of this work, and also considered high-resolution 
images for classification tasks. In a recent study (Chulif et al., 2023), 
deep  learning  models  are  used  for  detecting  diseases  in  single  crop 
species by considering real-time field challenges during image acquisi-
tion.  In  a  different  work  (Barhate  et  al.,  2023),  VGG-16  and  dimen-

ResNet-50  architecture  to  capture  the  leaf  feature  patterns  via  fusion

effectiveness of the model. The aforementioned studies do not directly

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. Data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, zooming, and others are commonly used to increase the size of training datasets and prevent overfitting. These techniques generate new images from existing ones by applying various transformations. However, without explicit mention in the provided context, it cannot be confirmed which specific data augmentation techniques were employed in the discussed deep learning pipelines.
