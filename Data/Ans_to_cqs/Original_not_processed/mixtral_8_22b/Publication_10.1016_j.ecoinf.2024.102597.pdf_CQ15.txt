Researchers have developed numerous WQP inversion algorithms for 
different lakes over the years. These algorithms include Band Ratio (BR), 
Three Bands (TB), NDCI, NDTI, Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), and 
more.  In  this  study,  the  development  of  these  algorithms  is  also 
considered. Moreover, deep learning algorithms were also considered, 
however,  the  limited  number  of  samples  was  not  conducive  to  deep 
learning, a point supported by the evidence in the research of Feng et al.

RF is the first algorithm selected as a representative of the bagging 
algorithm family, Random Forest (RF) is the first algorithm we selected 
(Breiman,  2001).  Taking regression  as  an example,  its  core idea  is  to 
construct multiple weak learners in parallel and ultimately output the 
result as the average of the weak learners to enhance model accuracy. In 
addition,  we  chose  several  Boosting  algorithms.  The  GBDT,  improves 
upon the initial boosting algorithm by introducing the concepts of fitting 
residuals and sampling (Friendman, 2001). XGBoost, built upon GBDT, 
it  incorporated  a  structural  risk  term  into  the  loss  function  L(y,y ˆ), 
forming the objective functionO(y,y ˆ), XGBoost also introduced a novel 
impurity measure metric, which considers complexity in splitting rules 
(Chen and Guestrin, 2016). Additionally, it employs new tree-building 
processes, such as estimation greedy algorithms, parallel learning, and

4.3. Model performance 

All algorithms were evaluated using the same dataset, and five EL 
models were established for both the Chla concentration and turbidity: 
RF,  GBDT,  LightGBM,  XGBoost,  and  CatBoost.  Before  tuning  each 
model, we established a benchmark model with default parameters to 
evaluate  whether  parameter  adjustments  had  a  beneficial  impact  on 
model performance. Hyperparameter optimisation was performed using 

both the random grid search and Bayesian optimisation methods, which 
were  implemented  using  GridSearchCV  from  Scikit-learn  and  the 
Hyperopt  library (version 0.2.7).  We selected the best  parameters  for 
each model and compared the results.

The EL algorithms demonstrate superior performance and high ac-
curacy, but its drawback lies in the inability to uncover the relationships 
between input features and output results, thus lacking interpretability 
for the prediction outcomes, such models are often referred to as black- 
box models. With the development of Explainable Artificial Intelligence 
(XAI),  methods  like  Local  Interpretable  Model-Agnostic  Explanations 
(LIME) and SHapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) have been applied to 
explain  black-box  models  (Lundberg  and  Lee,  2017;  Ribeiro  et  al., 
2016). LIME focuses on providing local explanations, that is, it attempts 
to  explain  the  model’s  behaviour  around  a  specific  input  data  point, 
whereas SHAP does not have this limitation. SHAP, originating from the 
concept of cooperative game theory, is employed to ascertain the con-
tributions of each collaborator to a cooperative task. It offers the capa-

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there is no mention of any specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, hyperparameter optimization was performed using both the random grid search and Bayesian optimization methods, which were implemented using GridSearchCV from Scikit-learn and the Hyperopt library (version 0.2.7). This suggests that optimization techniques may have been applied during the training process of the machine learning models mentioned, including RF, GBDT, LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost. Nevertheless, without explicit details about the use of optimization techniques like SGD or Adam, it cannot be confirmed if they were specifically utilized in the deep learning pipeline.
