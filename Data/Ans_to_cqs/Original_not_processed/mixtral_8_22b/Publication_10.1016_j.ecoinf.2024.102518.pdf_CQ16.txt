cross-validation. The threshold was derived from the average output of 
the five models. Nine algorithms—Bioclim, Mahalanobis, Domain, GLM 
(gaussian),  GLM  (binomial),  GLM  (poisson),  MaxEnt,  Random  Forest, 
and SVM—were evaluated using AUC-ROC and Cohen's KAPPA metrics. 
Our analysis revealed that MaxEnt emerged as the most suitable model, 
striking  a  commendable  balance  between  accuracy  and  robustness 
(Fig. A.1).

feature class as ‘L', ‘Q', ‘LQ', ‘LQP’, and set the regularization multiplier 
from 0.5 to 5, using the delta in the Akaike minimum information cri-
terion (delta.AICc) as the metric to determine the best tuning parame-
ters. The optimal model is the one with the minimum delta.AICc value 
(delta.AICc = 0), and a model with delta.AICc <2 is considered credible 
(Phillips et al., 2017). The Continuous Boyce Index (CBI)(Hirzel et al., 
2006) was employed in addition to the Area under the Receiver Oper-
ating Characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) because AUC-ROC is not reliable 
when  obtaining  true  absences  is  challenging  (Jim´enez  and  Sober´on, 
2020). The final optimal parameters were identified as the feature class 
‘LQP’ and a regularization multiplier of 3.5 (Fig. A.2). The mean AUC- 
ROC  stands  at 95.5%,  while the  average  CBI  index  for the  validation 
dataset is 82.6%.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, it mentions that the optimal model is determined based on the minimum delta.AICc value (delta.AICc = 0), and a model with delta.AICc <2 is considered credible. This suggests that the training might be stopped once the model reaches its optimal state or when further improvements do not significantly impact the model's performance. Additionally, the use of cross-validation and evaluation metrics such as AUC-ROC and Cohen's Kappa could also play a role in determining when training should stop. Nonetheless, without more detailed information regarding the training process, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact criteria used to decide when training is complete.
