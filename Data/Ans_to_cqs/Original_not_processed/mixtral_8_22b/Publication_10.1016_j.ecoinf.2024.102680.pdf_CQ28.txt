Owing to the insufficient clarity of underwater optical images, gen-
eral deep learning networks have difficulty capturing accurate feature 
information and cannot detect objects correctly. The original YOLOv8 
network  uses  the  C2f  module  for  feature  extraction.  However,  this 
module employs an split  operation on features after convolution. This 
operation divides the input data into two non-overlapping parts, making 
it  difficult  to  obtain  comprehensive  and  rich  feature  information 
through half of the channel’s features. Specifically, the shape of features 
F obtained after convolution is ℝN×H×W×C, where N represents the batch 
size, C represents the channel number, and H and W denote the height 
and width, respectively. The split  operation evenly divides F  into two 
parts on the channel dimension with shapes of ℝN×H×W×0.5C, and these 
two parts do not overlap. The original YOLOv8 convolves only half of

However,  using  large  kernel  convolutions  usually  leads  to  over-
whelming computational complexity, resulting in a sharp increase in the 
number  of  network  parameters  and  network  computational  load.  To 
overcome this issue, we used dilated convolution (Yu and Koltun, 2016) 
and depthwise separable convolution to reduce computations. Dilated 
convolution can increase the receptive field of the convolution kernel by 
inserting “holes”  without adding parameters or increasing the compu-
tational load. The equation for calculating the receptive field of dilated 
convolution  is  shown  in  Eq.  (4),  where  n  represents  the  size  of  the 
receptive field and d represents the dilation rate.

Input 

The input layer of UODN performs preprocessing operations on the 
initial images. Preprocessing operations include resizing the images to 
the  required  size  and  applying  algorithms  such  as  mosaic  data 
augmentation. These preprocessing steps make the distribution of the 
input  data  more  uniform  and  enhance  the  ability  of  the  model  to 
represent  the  data,  thereby improving  the  model  performance  during 
training.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of which specific platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer based solely on the available information.

Unhelpful Answer:
The deep learning model was deployed on AWS.

Explanation:
This unhelpful answer provides incorrect information since the actual deployment platform is not mentioned in the given context. It is important to avoid providing false or misleading answers when responding to queries.
