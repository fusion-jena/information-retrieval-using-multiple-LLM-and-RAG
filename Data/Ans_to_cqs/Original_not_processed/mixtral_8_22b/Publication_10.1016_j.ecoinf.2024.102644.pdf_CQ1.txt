in the basin, based on 180 resident species’ data. As species observation 
data,  we  use  data  from  a  public  authoritative  repository  of  big  data 
(GBIF)  improved  with  reliable  records  we  accurately  and  directly 
observed in the field.

After  the application of  the data pre-processing algorithm, we ob-
tained 17 datasets: one for ET, one for WS, one for C, 7 for T, and 7 for P. 
We  used  these  data  as  proxy  environmental  conditions  for  annual 
environmental snapshots in the years 1950, 1999, 2016, 2050, and 2100 
(under the RCP4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, for the last two).

4.2. Indications for policy-making authorities 

4.3.2. Data limitations

alter the depicted scenarios. To cover these aspects, we are planning a 
new data census and collection campaign based on other public FAIR 
data  repositories  (e.g.,  from  the  Tuscany  Region  administration  to 
Copernicus  (Bertacchi,  2017;  Bhardwaj  and  Khaiter,  2023;  Th´epaut 
et  al.,  2018;  Trevisani,  2014)).  These  data  will  likely  have  a  coarser 
spatial resolution than the data we used and will require sophisticated 
data-harmonisation strategies to allow us to build regional-scale models.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The study utilizes both publicly available datasets and direct observations for collecting raw data. Specifically, it uses data from GBIF, which is a public authoritative repository of big data. Additionally, the researchers improve this dataset by incorporating their own reliable records obtained through accurate and direct observations made in the field. This approach ensures a comprehensive and robust dataset for analysis. Furthermore, the study mentions plans for a new data census and collection campaign using other public FAIR data repositories such as those from the Tuscany Region administration and Copernicus. However, these additional data sources may require more sophisticated data harmonization strategies due to potentially coarser spatial resolutions compared to the initial dataset.
