racy assessment requires these parameters to calculate the total number of 
training samples required for the image classified using Eq. 1.

For  the  simulations  the  infiltration  capacity  was  quantified  in  a 
parameter  derived  by  the  Soil  Conservation  Service  (SCS)  called  CN. 
This parameter determines the runoff over an area based on soil type, 
soil cover and the hydrological group of the soil (Cronshey, 1986). The 
figure calculated for sub-basin 1 is 80.1, for sub-basin 2 it is 78.5, for 
sub-basin 3 it is 77.3, for sub-basin 4 it is 74.0, for sub-basin 5 it is 76.1 
and for sub-basin 6 it is 81.0. To better assess the possible effects of using 
NBS,  four  hypothetical  scenarios  were  chosen.  These  scenarios  were 
based on changing the land use from agriculture to forestry. According 
to  PerpiËœna  Castillo  et  al.  (2020),  Galicia  has  one  of  with  the  highest 
percentages of abandoned agricultural land of any region in Spain, with

Images were then classified out via Random Forest (RF). This is a 
specific  machine  learning  technique  based  on  the  iterative,  random 
creation  of  decision  trees.  First,  the  input  features  and  classes  were 
defined. RF calculates several random decision trees based on (1) the 
number of training samples and (2) the number of trees. The more trees 
there are, the more accurate the model is, but the longer the calculation 
time is. RF creates several decision trees randomly using the Gini coef-
ficient to split them. A model based on the decision trees is thus created 
and used to classify all the pixels. A pixel is classified according to the 
majority vote of the decision trees. The number of training samples was 
5000 and the number of trees was 500.

tion, the 20 m bands of the imagery were resampled to 10 m in order to 
harmonize all band data and ensure that the classification of images was 
adjusted to this resolution.

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning typically associated with preparing data for a deep learning model. However, there are some relevant preprocessing steps mentioned in the context related to image classification using a Random Forest algorithm, which could also be applicable to deep learning models.

Firstly, the context mentions that the 20m bands of the imagery were resampled to 10m to harmonize all band data and ensure that the classification of images was adjusted to this resolution. This step can be considered as a form of preprocessing where the spatial resolution of the input data is modified to meet certain requirements or standards.

Secondly, although not directly stated, defining the input features and classes for the Random Forest algorithm can be seen as a part of feature engineering, which is often included in the preprocessing stage of building a deep learning model. Feature engineering involves selecting, transforming, and creating new features from raw data to improve the performance of the model. In this case, the input features and classes were defined for the Random Forest algorithm, which could potentially involve similar processes if applied to a deep learning model.

Lastly, while not specifically mentioned in the context, other common preprocessing techniques for deep learning models include normalizing the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. These methods help to prepare the data for efficient and effective training of the deep learning model.
