In this paper, the methods used were both intuitive (omitting missing 
values;  mean  imputation)  and  machine-learning-based.  These  proced-
ures and the FIT method are briefly presented below.  

• Control Group 

In the first experiment, the control group consisted of the unmodified 
datasets  of  each  species.  In  the  second  experiment,  we  defined  the 
control  group  as  the  geometric  profile  extracted  by  our  experienced 
operator.

• Mean imputation 

All data rows containing missing values were removed.

To  further  enhance  the  Footprint  Identification  Technique  (FIT) 
method,  we  recommend  collecting  imperfect  footprints  when  high- 
quality  footprints  are  insufficient  during  field  surveys.  Instead  of  dis-
carding incomplete prints, we advocate using missing value imputation 
as  part  of  the  data  preprocessing  pipeline.  This  approach  preserves 
valuable data and improves the accuracy of FIT predictions when sub- 
quality footprints are included. Our findings are supported by a study 
using  deep  learning  models  to  classify  three  sympatric  otter  species, 
where a model trained on images of all qualities was only marginally 
outperformed  by  a  model  trained  on  high-quality  prints,  highlighting 
the  potential  of  utilizing  lower  quality  data  effectively  Kistner  et  al.

approach of missForest allows it to progressively enhance its imputation 
accuracy.

Regarding  the  usage  of  appropriate  imputation  methods  before 
applying the FIT algorithm, we recommend tree-based nonparametric 
imputation methods like missForest, missRanger or MICE RF. This is in 
line with recent findings on imputing before applying classification al-
gorithms  from  machine  learning  Buczak  et  al.  (2023).  According  to 
Breiman  (2001),  the  advantages  of  Random  Forests  are,  besides  the 
handling of mixed-type data, an accurate prediction performance under 
high dimensions and non-linear data structures. These are often found in 
real datasets and should be considered when imputing missing values. 
In  conclusion,  FIT  is  a  valuable,  non-invasive,  cost-effective  and 
highly applicable tool for wildlife conservation, which provides reliable 
data to inform wildlife management actions as required in Targets 4 and

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide explicit information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it mentions several approaches related to handling missing values and improving the overall dataset quality.

The authors discuss two main types of procedures used in their experiments: intuitive and machine-learning-based. Intuitive methods include omitting missing values and mean imputation. Machine-learning-based methods involve using tree-based nonparametric imputation methods like missForest, missRanger, or MICE RF. They also suggest collecting imperfect footprints when high-quality ones are insufficient and advocating for using missing value imputation as part of the data preprocessing pipeline.

While these techniques do not directly address data bias, they contribute to enhancing the overall quality of the dataset, which can indirectly help mitigate biases. For instance, removing data rows containing missing values could potentially reduce noise and improve the reliability of the dataset. Similarly, employing advanced imputation methods like missForest can lead to more accurate predictions and better representation of the underlying patterns within the data.

However, without explicit mention of techniques specifically targeting data bias, such as stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, one cannot definitively state what methods are employed to tackle data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline based solely on the given context.
