Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it discusses various studies related to geoscience, remote sensing, and machine learning applications. These studies use datasets derived from sources like Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and satellite imagery. Some examples include UAV-derived Digital Surface Models (DSMs), Digital Terrain Models (DTMs), and Digital Orthophoto Models (DOMs). Additionally, there is a reference to neural networks being used for mapping canopy heights of forests by integrating Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) and Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) data. Therefore, while no traditional deep learning datasets are mentioned, the context suggests that researchers in this field utilize custom datasets generated from diverse remote sensing technologies.
