Our results suggest that certain plant functional traits can be retrieved from simple RGB photographs. The key 
for this trait retrieval are deep learning-based Convolutional Neural Networks in concert with Big Data derived 
from open and citizen science projects. Although these models are subject to some noise, there is a wealth of 
applications for this approach, such as global trait maps, monitoring of trait shifts in time and the identification 
of large-scale ecological gradients. This way, the problem of limited data that still impedes us to picture global 
 gradients7 could be alleviated by harnessing the exponentially growing iNaturalist  database16. The performance 
of the CNN models across traits varied strongly, but revealed a clear trend: As expected, the more a trait referred 
to morphological features, the more accurate the predictions were. The models of the Baseline setup explained a

In  order  to  build  upon  a  pre-existing  knowledge  base,  we 
employed  ’transfer  learning’  by  using  pre-trained  layer  weights  (the  storage  of  the  model’s  knowledge)  from 
a classification task on a dataset on www. image- net. org38 for all CNN models used in this study. The regressor 
following the basic CNN consisted of a global average pooling layer followed by two dense layers with 512 and 1 
output units. The latter forces the CNN to output exactly one prediction (trait) value. In case of the mixed data 
model (setups (3) and (4)), the CNN consisted of parallel branches to incorporate the different input data types. 
The branch processing the bioclimatic data consisted of three dense layers with 64, 32 and 4 output units, and 
the last layer of the CNN regressor contained 4 output units. After concatenating the two branches (image and

Currently, this approach is hampered by the lack of a dataset comprising plant photographs with matching 
trait measurements that cover the global plant functional spectrum. In recent years, however, global data initia-
tives and citizen science projects have emerged as a strongly growing data source, which builds upon the collec-
tive effort of the scientific  community14,15. Consequently, we employ a weakly supervised learning approach that 
combines the independent data sources of (1) the iNaturalist database providing a worldwide record of millions 
of plant photographs including taxa and  geolocations16 and (2) the TRY database containing more than 11 mil-
lion trait measurements across more than 270,000  taxa7.
