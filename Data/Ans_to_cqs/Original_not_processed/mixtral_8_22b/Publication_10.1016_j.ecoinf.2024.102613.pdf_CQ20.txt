Regarding data analytics features, machine learning, statistical, and 
mathematical  models  were  commonly  used  to  analyze  the  raw  data. 
Sensors are the primary sensing technology to help generate the data to 
support data analytics performance. The UAVs, UGVs, and GIS can be 
used as additional data sources to get more precise data regarding farm 
conditions. For example, the UAV and GIS can be used as data sources 
when  the  smart  system  needs  spatial,  location  or  area  data.  A  cloud 
computing platform and standalone system (i.e., dedicated server) are 
commonly  found  as  the  computing  infrastructure  to  implement  data 
processing and analytics. Furthermore, WSN and cellular networks are 
used to communicate among the devices in the field, while RFID is an 
optional approach. In order to disseminate and visualize the actual data, 
mobile applications are required in smart dairy farming systems. In this

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any specific details about the hardware resources used for training the deep neural network mentioned in the paper by Zhang et al. (2024). However, generally speaking, deep learning models often require significant computational power due to their complexity. Therefore, it is common to use specialized hardware such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), or Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) for training these models. These hardware resources offer parallel processing capabilities, enabling faster computation and efficient handling of large datasets. Nonetheless, without explicit mention in the provided context, we cannot definitively state which hardware resources were utilized for training the deep learning model discussed in the referenced study.
