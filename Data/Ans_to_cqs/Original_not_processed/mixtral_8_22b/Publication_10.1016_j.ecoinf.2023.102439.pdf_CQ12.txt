2.3.3. Modelling 

Artificial  neural  networks  are  a  successful  method  in  modelling 
studies and are frequently discussed in the literature. Essentially, neural 
networks learn from past and present data, uncover hidden relationships 
among  the  data,  and  utilise  them  to  make  predictions  for  future  sce-
narios. Among the various types of artificial neural network models, the 
NARX model is widely employed. In this study, the NARX feedback ANN 
model  was  utilised  to  define  vegetation  biomass  density  for  2030.  A 
hybrid  model  was  developed  by  combining  wavelet  analysis  and  the 
NARX ANN algorithm to enhance the performance of the NARX ANN 
model.

3. Results 

As indicated before, the ANN model utilised in this study comprises 
an  input,  hidden,  and  output  layer.  The  input  layer  comprises  three 
processing elements (neurons) corresponding to the LST, temperature, 
and precipitation parameters. The EVI data was used as the output layer. 
The number of neurons in the hidden layer is a crucial factor influencing 
the learning capability of the network. Insufficient neurons may hinder 
successful learning, while excessive neurons may lead to over fitting and 
compromise the network’s performance (Çakır, 2018). In this study, the 
number of neurons in the hidden layer was incrementally to determine 
the optimal configuration that yields the best results.

et  al.,  2023).  These  ANN  models  draw  inspiration  from  the  intricate 
architecture and functioning of biological neural networks within the 
human  brain.  They  exhibit  remarkable  capabilities  in  deciphering 
intricate patterns and relationships in diverse datasets. Understanding 
the characteristics of the data stands as one of the most crucial factors 
that  impact  prediction  accuracy  when  selecting  an  appropriate  ANN 
method, as these models have consistently demonstrated their efficacy 
in simulating and estimating satellite data, yielding reliable results (Al- 
Dousari et al., 2023; Bharadiya et al., 2023; Lukas et al., 2023; Ma et al., 
2022; Souza et al., 2022). To illustrate, in the context of rainfall-runoff 
modelling, a multi-conceptual approach has been proposed, integrating 
ANN models with hydrological models like IHACRES, GR4J, and MISD- 
based models (Mohammadi et al., 2022). This synergistic approach aims

By employing the W-ANN model, the training values reached 96% 
for Iznik and 91% for Alanya, while the estimated percentages for all 
data increased to 95% for Iznik and 88% for Alanya, respectively. The 
developed hybrid model improved learning success, with an increase of 
18.7%  in  Iznik  and  7.3%  in  Alanya,  as  determined  by  the  network’s 
performance.  These  findings  highlight  the  hybrid  model’s  enhanced 
predictive capabilities and effectiveness in both study areas.

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly mentioned as either Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer. However, it can be inferred that the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model is utilized in this study. More specifically, the Nonlinear Autoregressive Exogenous Model (NARX) feedforward ANN model is employed to predict vegetation biomass density for 2030. Additionally, a hybrid model is developed by combining wavelet analysis and the NARX ANN algorithm to improve the performance of the NARX ANN model. Therefore, based on the information provided, the deep learning model used in the pipeline is primarily an ANN model, specifically the NARX feedforward ANN model.
