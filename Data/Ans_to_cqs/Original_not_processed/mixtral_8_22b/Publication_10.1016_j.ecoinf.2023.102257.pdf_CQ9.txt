2.1. Objective 1: perform tagging efficiency experiment

As  ML-techniques  become  more  pervasive  in  the  field  of  remote 
wildlife monitoring, further study of how ML model performance im-
pacts their utility could become increasingly important. Several open- 
source  species-level  classification  models  have  recently  been  released 
(B¨ohner et al., 2022; Norouzzadeh et al., 2018; Tabak et al., 2019; Tabak 
et al., 2020; Tabak et al., 2022; Vecvanags et al., 2022; Whytock et al., 
2021) which can similarly be used in tandem with human tagging to 
improve tagging efficiency (Willi et al., 2019). Yet, species-level classi-
fication models can also be geographically constrained and underper-
form when applied on “out-of-sample” data from locations or in contexts 
that differ from the original training data (Tabak et al., 2019). Under-
standing the role of model performance on tagging efficiency for species- 
detection could prove useful in determining in what circumstances these 
models are effective.

%Query
Query: "Where is the data repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The article does not provide information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that several open-source species-level classification models have been released recently but does not specify where they can be accessed. Therefore, it is not possible to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available based on the given context.
