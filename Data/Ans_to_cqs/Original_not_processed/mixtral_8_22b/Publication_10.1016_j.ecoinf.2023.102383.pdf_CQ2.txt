compressed,  reducing  to  only  a  few  pixels  in  deeper  CNN  layers.  For 
instance, an object with dimensions of 15 × 15 pixels in a UAV thermal 
image might be represented by just 1 pixel in the feature map from Layer 
4 of ResNet152 (refer to Fig. 4). The limited spatial resolution can lead to 
loss of fine details, making it difficult for the model to distinguish small 
objects from the background. Through FPN, different feature maps from 
different layers can complement each other, and deeper feature map can 
receive some spatial information from shallower layers. However, still 
certain  spatial  features  might  have  been  lost  during  the  process  of 
convolution operations. Consequently, the models of FRC_ResNet18FPN 
and FRC_ResNet34FPN can obtain higher AP for medium and large ob-
jects than the remaining models because they have less CNN layers than 
others.  Notably,  the  FRC_ResNet152FPN  obtains  the  best  detection

characterized  by  convolutional  neural  networks  (CNNs)  are  being 
increasingly  used  to  automate  the  animal  recognition  and  counting 
tasks, and their performance is continuously improved with the intro-
duction of enhanced architecture (Kaur and Singh, 2022). For example,

As shown on the top of Fig. 8, a feature map extractor based on FPN 
and  ResNet152  extracted  five  feature  maps  from  the  original  UAV 
thermal image, and they each has different resolutions, including 256 ×
320, 128 × 160, 64 × 80, 32 × 40, and 16 × 20. The region proposal 
network  can  utilize  the  five  feature  maps  to  generate  four  RoIs  with 
different sizes, which are respectively colored by purple, red, green and 
yellow from left to right in the middle-right of Fig. 8. The size of the 
purple RoI is the largest, and the model assigns a feature map with the 
resolution of 32 × 40 to it. On the contrary, the red RoI is the smallest, 
and the model selects the feature map with highest spatial resolution for 
it.  Similarly,  the  green  and  yellow  RoIs  are  assigned  corresponding 
feature maps according to their respective sizes. The selection of large 
feature maps means the number of parameters is increasing and needs

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer that the data format used is likely related to images or videos since the text discusses using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are commonly applied to visual tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation. Additionally, the mention of Region of Interest (RoI) generation further supports this assumption, as RoI is often associated with image processing tasks. Therefore, while there isn't direct evidence, it is reasonable to assume that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline discussed here is either image or video data.
