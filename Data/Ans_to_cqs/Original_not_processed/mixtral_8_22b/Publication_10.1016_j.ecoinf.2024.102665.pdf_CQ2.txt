Glossary

Increasing  the  dimensions  used  in  the  assessment  through  additional 
variables can therefore be useful (Peterson and Evans, 2019). Due to the 
restrictions in MWST, the representation of data might not be as high as 
other  learning  methods  (Kekolahti  et  al.,  2015).  However,  the  con-
straints (only one incoming connection per node) allow only the nodes 
with the strongest associations to be connected.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not explicitly state what specific data format is used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of underwater spectral images for dense taxonomic mapping of benthic habitats, which suggests that the deep learning pipeline may involve image data. Additionally, there is mention of automatic underwater fish species classification, further indicating the potential use of image data in the deep learning process. It should also be noted that the glossary includes various metrics related to density, richness, biomass, height, footprint, surface area, surface index, and volume occupied, suggesting that the data could include numerical values or measurements. Without more explicit details about the deep learning pipeline, it cannot be definitively stated what exact data formats are being used.
