While  still  short  of  having  a  robust  and  standardized  biodiversity 
infrastructure (Heberling et al., 2021), there is great diversity of online 
repositories with taxonomic information and species occurrences data. 
Among  the most  important databases  hosting marine information are 
FishBase,  a  platform  that  hosts  information  on  the  taxonomy  of  fish, 
their ecology, trophic information, habitat, and history of uses dating 
back to more than 250 years (Froese and Pauly, 2000); and the Global 
Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), a platform that stores and al-
lows for the free access to species occurrence records from around the 
world.  GBIF  is  currently  one  of  the  repositories  hosting  the  largest 
amount of such data in the world (GBIF: The Global Biodiversity Infor-
mation Facility, 2021; Telenius, 2011); and finally Ocean Biodiversity 
Information System (OBIS), which houses data on the occurrence and

scales associated with data collection (Zizka et al., 2020). Due to these 
disparities,  scholars  recommend  a  thorough  examination  and  refine-
ment  of  these  data  repositories  (Bonnet-Lebrunm  et  al.,  2023).  To 
enhance the quality and reliability of the information, a comprehensive 
series  of  filters  has  been  systematically  applied  to  our  analysis.  To 
minimize errors associated with the public usage of GBIF and OBIS re-
positories,  we  curated  the  dataset  following  Zizka  et  al.  (2020)  and 
filtered the dataset by the columns labeled “scientific name”, “family”, 
“year”, “longitude” and “latitude”. We retained all taxonomic informa-
tion down to the species level and removed records with NA in these 
columns. We also removed all duplicate records with identical latitude

%Query
Query: "Which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any information about the use of specific frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch for building deep learning models. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which frameworks were used based solely on this context.
