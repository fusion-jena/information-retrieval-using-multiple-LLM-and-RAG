Helpful Answer:
The papers listed above discuss various applications of deep learning models in ecological conservation and wildlife surveys. These models are primarily used for tasks such as classification, segmentation, and detection.

In the paper by Le et al. (2022), a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture was designed for the automated survey of seabird colonies. This suggests that their deep learning model was likely used for object detection or localization within images. Similarly, the work by Witharana and Lynch (2016) describes an object-based image analysis approach for detecting penguin guano in satellite images, indicating that their model focused on object detection.

The study by Moreni et al. (2023) explores the use of mean Average Precision (mAP) to evaluate different pretrained neural networks for automated aerial animal detection. This implies that their deep learning models were also employed for object detection purposes.

Additionally, Peng et al. (2020) utilized a modified Faster Region-Based CNN (R-CNN) for kiang detection in Tibetan Plateau, further emphasizing the application of deep learning models for object detection in wildlife surveys.

While some studies do not explicitly state the specific type of deep learning task they employ, it can be inferred based on the context and objectives of each study. Overall, these papers demonstrate the utility of deep learning models in ecological conservation efforts, particularly for tasks related to object detection and localization.
