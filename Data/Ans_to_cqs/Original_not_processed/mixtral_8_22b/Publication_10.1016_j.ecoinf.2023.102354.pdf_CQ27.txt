conditions, groundwater recharge, and discharge processes, patterns of 
anthropogenic water extraction. The generalizability of the conclusions 
should  be  considered  within  the  context  of  similar  environments  or 
conditions. Furthermore, future research should delve deeper into the 
underlying factors contributing to drought patterns, such as the impact 
of land use changes and agricultural practices on regional hydrology and 
water availability.
