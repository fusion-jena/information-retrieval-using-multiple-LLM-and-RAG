Evaluation on Simulated Data Sets
DEPP training and parameter sensitivity.—We start by
evaluating DEPP on simulated data sets, testing the
ability to train the CNN model in reasonable times. As
the training epochs advance, the loss function (1) drops
rapidly and stabilizes after around 500 epochs in a typical
case (Fig. S1 of the Supplementary material available on
Dryad). Here, training, which is a one-time process for
each reference tree, ﬁnished in around 20 min for the 200-
taxon data set and 260 minutes for 10,000-taxon data set,
on a machine with one 2080Ti NVIDIA GPU and 8 CPU
cores. Placement of 1000 queries took 4 seconds for the
200-taxon and 30 s for the 10,000-taxon data sets using a
single CPU core. On the small 200-taxon data set, EPA-ng
has an advantage in terms of running time. However, in
the larger HGT data set (10,000-taxon), DEPP placements
are faster than the alternatives with half the running time
of EPA-ng. In terms of the memory usage, APPLES+JC

by a running average of its recent magnitude to speed
up training (Tieleman and Hinton 2012). The batch size
is ﬁxed to 32. We check the training loss every 50 epochs
and stop the training when the value of the loss function
fails to decrease in two consecutive checks. The model
with the optimal objective function value is chosen.

Placement.—Once the CNN model is trained, we use it to
map a given query sequence q to a vector of distances
D1 ...Dn. For data sets with missing data (gaps), we
compute two sets of distances,
1,
using the models with and without gap reconstruction,
respectively. The ﬁnal distances is set to the weighted
i , where �
sum of the distances, that is, (1
is the proportion of the sites with gaps in the query
sequences. The weighted sum is used to reduce the
impact of reconstructed bases (which are guessed, as
opposed to being observed) on the ﬁnal distance and
will be empirically tested. Given these distances, we then
place q onto T using distance-based placement (Balaban
et al. 2020), which uses dynamic programming to ﬁnd the
dqi(T))2,
placement with the minimum
where dqi(T) represents the tree-based distance between
(cid:30)
the query and each taxon i (Fig. 1).

Embedding size. The Layer and Rhodes (2017) (LR)
formulation requires n
1 dimensions, which introduces
some challenges. According to the theory, the number of
dimensions needs to increase by one after inserting the
query. Our supervised learning formulation does not
allow that (the embedding size is ﬁxed after training).
Thus, there is no guarantee that the embeddings remain
correct after addition, even if they are before addition.
However, we note that, in LR embeddings, adding a
leaf would require simply dividing one of the n
1
dimensions into two dimensions, leaving the rest of the
embeddings intact. Thus, one can hope that having one
less dimension has a minimal practical impact. More
broadly, for large n, training models with n-dimensional
embedding is impractical. Thus, we often set k < n
1,
and the gap can be more than an order of magnitude for
some of our tests described below. In practice, we use a
rule of thumb to select the default k (which the user can

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. It discusses the evaluation of DEPP on simulated datasets, the ability to train the CNN model within reasonable times, and the performance comparison with other methods like EPA-ng. The text also mentions the use of a single 2080Ti NVIDIA GPU and 8 CPU cores during training but does not specify any details regarding model serialization or platform selection for deployment. Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot determine the exact process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
