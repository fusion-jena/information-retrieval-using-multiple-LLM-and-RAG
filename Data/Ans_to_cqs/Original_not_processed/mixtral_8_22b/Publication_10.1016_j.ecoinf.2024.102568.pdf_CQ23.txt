Moreover,  the  LSTM  model  was  not  able  to  predict  the  values  of 
concentration in the 13% of test observations due to the absence of a 
long enough sequence of previous observations without missing values 
in  the  input  features.  VR  + SVR  instead  is  always  able  to  provide  a 
prediction, satisfying the requirement of data completeness reported in 
Williams  et  al.  (2014).  Therefore,  VR  + SVR  is  a  good  alternative  to 
LSTM when there are frequent holes in the time series of measurements 
and when there are not enough past observations to successfully employ 
LSTM. 

With VR + SVR we demonstrated how to overcome the problem of

VR + SVR). As already discussed in Section 6.2, 4004 is a special case 
employed to demonstrate that calibration needs to be repeated when a 
cell is changed, and 4003 and 4013 both had a broken humidity sensor; 
thus, bad performances were expected. In the end, the hourly results of 
Exp.3 suggest that LSTM is able to reach better performances than VR +
SVR for all pollutants.

of RMSE and MAE higher than 20 and in green the values lower than 8; 
while  the  values  of  MRE  are  in  green  if  lower  than  0.4  and  in  red  if 
higher than 1. In the end, we used green for accuracy higher than 0.9 
and red for values lower than 0.75. In addition, the number of obser-
vations in the training set is reported in the column “train size”, while 
the column “% out of range” shows the number of observations in the 
test set with the value of at least one of the two channels out of the range 
between the minimum and the maximum values of the training set.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it can be inferred from the context that the authors have employed some form of validation by dividing their dataset into training and testing sets. This is evident from the use of terms like 'training set', 'test set', and 'out of range'. Additionally, they have also mentioned the use of a separate validation experiment (Exp.3), which suggests that they might have used a three-way split of their dataset into training, validation, and testing sets. Nevertheless, the exact methodology used to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model remains unclear based on the given information.
