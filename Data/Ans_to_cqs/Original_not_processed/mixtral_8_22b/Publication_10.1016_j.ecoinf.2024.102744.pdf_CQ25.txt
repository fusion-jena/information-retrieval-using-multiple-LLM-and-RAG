overfitting. Additionally, the Global Average Pooling layer summarizes features, generating input 

for the fully connected layer. This layer also facilitates the visualization of regions relied upon by 

the network for predictions. The subsequent three fully connected layers generate the predicted 

class for the original image

CNN architecture but  with  different  filter sizes.  The obtained  results depend on the number of 

hidden layers, filter size, and the number of filters in convolution layers. The higher the number of 

hidden layers, filter size, and filters, the higher the accuracy of classification. In [29], the authors 

proposed  four  different  models  for  bee  image  classification,  serving  different  tasks  in  beehive 

monitoring. All these models were based on different Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) that have 

been  pre-trained  on  the  ImageNet  dataset  [30]  including  AlexNet,  DenseNet-201,  GoogLeNet, 

ResNet-101, ResNet-18, VGG-16, VGG-19. In the first model, the authors used a transfer learning 

method based on these pre-trained DNNs. Meanwhile, in the second, third, and fourth models, the 

authors used the SVM classifier with deep features, shallow features, and deep+shallow features

4.4. Second improvement: Two class YOLOv5 + Focal loss 

In this enhancement, an object detection network is trained to detect two classes: pollen-bearing 

and  non-pollen-bearing  bees.  However,  due  to  data  imbalance,  where  one  class  significantly 

outnumbers the other, we propose the implementation of a focal loss function to address this issue. 

Focal  loss  [41]  is  a  technique  designed  to  mitigate  imbalance  problems  in  object  detection 

networks by assigning higher weights to samples that are challenging or prone to misclassification. 

These samples typically include those with complex backgrounds or only partial representations of

In  our  experiments,  we  used  the  Python  3.10  programming  environment  along  with  popular 

libraries  such  as  PyTorch,  TensorFlow,  and  OpenCV.  The  detection  models  were  trained  on  a 

server equipped with an Intel® Core™ i7-8700 CPU @ 3.20GHz (32GB DDR4-2666 memory) 

and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 GPU (8GB GDDR6 memory). 

The  methods  utilizing  YOLOv5  will  undergo  training  for  300  epochs,  whereas  the 

classification network in method 1 will undergo training for 200 epochs. Here, one epoch signifies 

training the model on all data once. For YOLOv5 training, fundamental parameters such as the 

learning  rate  will  be  set  to  0.02,  with  weight  decay  and  momentum  values  of  0.001  and  0.9, 

respectively.  In  contrast,  methods  employing  Faster  RCNN  will  be  trained  with  90  thousand

Helpful Answer:
The main goal of the deep learning model discussed here is image classification. Specifically, it aims to classify bee images into various categories related to beehive monitoring tasks. The model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture with multiple hidden layers, each containing convolution and pooling operations. The Dropout layer is included to prevent overfitting, while the Global Average Pooling layer helps summarize features and provide inputs for the fully connected layer. Ultimately, the final three fully connected layers generate the predicted class for the original image.

Additionally, there is another model mentioned that focuses on object detection. It trains an object detection network to identify two classes: pollen-bearing and non-pollen-bearing bees. To tackle the problem of data imbalance between these two classes, the focal loss function is proposed. This function assigns higher weights to more difficult or potentially misclassified samples, which often involve complex backgrounds or partially represented objects.
