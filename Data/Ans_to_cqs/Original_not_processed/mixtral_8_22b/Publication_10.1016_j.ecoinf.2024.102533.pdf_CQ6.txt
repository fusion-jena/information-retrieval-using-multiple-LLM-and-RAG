Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Therefore, the data normalization stage is unnecessary.

2.6. Step 5: Clustering the freshness data using six body parts parameters 

The  most  suitable  number  of  clusters  from  the  previous  stage  be-
comes the standard for the proposed number of freshness classes. Each 
species  attains  several  freshness classes  based  on  its  freshness strong-
hold. We group the data using the clustering method to automatically 
determine freshness class based on the dataset. Intuitively, the clustering 
method partitions data where similar data are grouped in one cluster, 
while dissimilar data are separated into other clusters. The partitioning 
occurs automatically according to the clustering algorithm. 

2.7. Step 6: Evaluating the clustering results

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that there are several preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, the specific step mentioned in this context is data normalization. According to the text, the data normalization stage is considered unnecessary in this particular case. This suggests that data normalization might not always be required depending on the nature of the dataset or the problem being addressed. Other common preprocessing steps include scaling, cleaning, and transforming the data, but these are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, while we can confirm that data normalization was considered, further information would be needed to provide a comprehensive list of all preprocessing steps used in this study.
