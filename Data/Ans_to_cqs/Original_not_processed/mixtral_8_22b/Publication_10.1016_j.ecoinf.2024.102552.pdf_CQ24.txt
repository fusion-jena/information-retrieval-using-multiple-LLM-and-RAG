There may also be ways to include information from online spectral li-
braries  or  other  remote  sensing  products  with  more  detailed  spectral 
information and coarser spatial detail to refine classifications with the 
help of machine learning tools. We do caution, however, that though 
machine  learning  methods  have  great  potential  for  automatic  or  su-
pervised classification, they are still limited by the quality of their inputs 
(both  imagery  and  training  data):  using  NAIP  and  massive  training 
datasets, they can perform well, but they may not succeed for historical 
imagery with its wildly variable characteristics (e.g. blurriness, distor-
tion). More testing is necessary.

Perhaps  more  promising,  however,  are  emerging  methods  that 
incorporate  the  human  ability  to  see  patterns  with  machine  learning 
methods used for classification, for example “human in the loop” clas-
sification (Buscombe et al., 2022). This could speed up the classification 
of  larger  areas,  and  might  also  enable  finer  classification  of  woody 
vegetation,  especially  in  the  NAIP  imagery.  This  method  could  be 
particularly successful using the four-band spectral information in the 
images  from  2009-present  to  try  to  differentiate  vegetation  types. 
Another possibility would be to use the Normalized Difference Vegeta-
tion  Index  (NDVI)  for  the  four-band  imagery  to  aid  in  classification.

Finally, even if uncertainty can be quantified in all stages of analysis, 
which  we  attempted  to  do  (see  Appendix  B),  a  method  needs  to  be 
developed to incorporate all these sources of uncertainty into the final 
result (Comber et al., 2012). In the end, it was only possible to quali-
tatively  connect  our  results  back  to  ground  truthing  data.  This  was 
enough for our purposes but future work may be able to improve on the 
accuracy of the analysis as well as the propagation of uncertainty.

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not directly address the query about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, there are some relevant points regarding the limitations and potential improvements of machine learning methods used for image classification in ecological studies.

The authors mention that machine learning methods have great potential for automatic or supervised classification, but they are still limited by the quality of their inputs, both imagery and training data. They suggest that using high-quality imagery like NAIP and massive training datasets can help improve performance. Additionally, incorporating human pattern recognition abilities with machine learning methods, such as "human in the loop" classification, could potentially enhance the accuracy and efficiency of large area image classification.

Regarding uncertainty, the authors acknowledge that while they attempted to quantify uncertainty in all stages of analysis, a method needs to be developed to incorporate all sources of uncertainty into the final result. They were only able to qualitatively connect their results back to ground truthing data, which was sufficient for their purposes, but future work may improve the accuracy of the analysis and the propagation of uncertainty.

While this context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it highlights the importance of considering input quality, combining human expertise with machine learning techniques, and addressing uncertainty in the analysis process. These considerations may indirectly contribute to managing randomness in the deep learning pipeline, although specific strategies for dealing with random seeds or other sources of randomness are not mentioned.
