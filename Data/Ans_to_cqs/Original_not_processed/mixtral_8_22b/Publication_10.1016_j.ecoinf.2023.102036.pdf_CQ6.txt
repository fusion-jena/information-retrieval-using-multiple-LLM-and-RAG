Each optimization run consisted of 3000 train iterations with a batch 
size of 25 individuals to pick a pair of similar and a pair of dissimilar 
photos (i.e., a batch size of 100 images), and validating each 300 iter-
ations. TensorBoard —a set of visualization tools included in the open- 
source  library  for  machine  learning  TensorFlow—  was  used  to  study 
the performance of the runs. The selected parameters correspond to the

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about any specific preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model. However, based on common practices in deep learning, some general preprocessing steps can include data normalization, scaling, cleaning, and augmentation. These techniques help improve the quality and consistency of input data, leading to better model performance. Data normalization involves rescaling numeric columns to have a mean of zero and unit variance, while data scaling adjusts values measured on different scales to a common scale. Cleaning data may involve handling missing or inconsistent values, outliers, and noise reduction. Lastly, data augmentation generates additional training samples by applying transformations such as rotation, flipping, zooming, etc., to increase the diversity of the dataset.
