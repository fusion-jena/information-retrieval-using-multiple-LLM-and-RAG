scenarios. The study showed the suitability of the SVR algorithm for
making predictions with restricted datasets, a finding that aligns with
previous research investigations (Kaveh et al., 2023; Mehmood et al.,
2024a; Zhang et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2022). An important conclusion
is derived from Fig. 6. It highlights that MLR heavily depends on pre-
dictor variables, demonstrating a more pronounced reliance on these
elements than machine learning methods. Furthermore, it is worth
noting that relying solely on spectral bands to predict AGB is unlikely to
produce favorable outcomes. Integrating these spectral bands with other
variable sets, including those produced from the Shuttle Radar Topog-
raphy Mission Digital Elevation Model (SRTM DEM) and vegetation-
derived indices, will lead to more favorable outcomes.

parameter combination, enhancing the model’s performance. Important
indices to measure variable importance in XGBoost include “Gain” and
“Frequency” (Gertz et al., 2020; Li et al., 2023; Luo et al., 2024; Meh-
mood et al., 2024a; Ryu et al., 2020). SVR tuning involves selecting the
appropriate kernel function and optimizing the “C” parameter, which
balances margin width and misclassification tolerance. The versatility of
SVR allows it
to handle complex decision boundaries effectively
(Yudong Li et al., 2020; Rodriguez-Galiano et al., 2015).

2.9. Performance evaluation of the models

specifically a max_depth value of 7 and an eta value of 0.3. Out of the
models that were assessed, it was found that the RF model exhibited the
most superior predictive capability. The model demonstrated a strong fit
to the data, as evidenced by R-squared values of 0.66, 0.70, and 0.81.
The RF model showed exceptional error reduction performance, as seen
by an RMAE of 14.33% and RRMSE of 22.23%. The hyperparameters,
namely max_depth = 25, n_estimators = 1000, and mtry = 1,3,7, were
optimized to attain the observed level of performance in each of the
three combinations.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there are no specific details about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, some common practices used to improve the generalization of deep learning models include using diverse datasets, cross-validation, and stratified splitting. These techniques help prevent overfitting and allow the model to perform well on unseen data.

In this case, we can infer that the researchers may have employed similar strategies since they mention the use of various algorithms such as Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). They also discuss the optimization of hyperparameters, which suggests that they might have used techniques like cross-validation or grid search to find the best parameters for their models.

Additionally, the authors emphasize the importance of integrating different types of input features, such as spectral bands, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Digital Elevation Model (SRTM DEM), and vegetation-derived indices, to achieve better results. This approach could contribute to improving the robustness and generalizability of the models by providing them with richer and more diverse sources of information.

However, without explicit mentions of specific techniques like diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, we cannot definitively state what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
