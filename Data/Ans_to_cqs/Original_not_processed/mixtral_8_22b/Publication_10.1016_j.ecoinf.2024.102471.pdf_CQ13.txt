In the supervised fine-tuning phase, the labelled dataset is used in 
training the model to predict particular words or phonemes. Fig. 3 de-
picts the process and components in the fine-tuning phase of wav2vec. 
Phonemes are the smallest unit of sound, usually one or two letters, in 
the language. During fine-tuning, the quantization module is removed. 
Instead, a linear projection layer is added to the context network. Then 
the model is fine-tuned on connectionist temporal classification (CTC) 
loss for the Automatic Speech Recognition task. So, the wav2vec model 
has a general understanding of phonemes present in human speech.

4.4. Wav2Vec model description 

After pre-processing, the whole dataset is splitted into training and 
testing  of  various  ratio  including  70:30,  80:20  and  90:10  for  strong 
performance  analysis.  As  a  part  of  training  proposed  model,  the  raw 
audio signals of various bird species are given as input to extract 768- 
dimensional  vector  as  features.  In  wav2vec,  after  the  transformer 
block, there are three dense layers with ReLU activation function con-
tains 1024, 512, and 256 hidden neurons, respectively. Followed by, one 
classification layer with sigmoid activation function is kept to decide on 

bird categories as output. For this technique, Adam is used as optimizer 
with initial learning rate of order 10e-5 is appropriate for small weight 
updates throughout the network while fine-tuning. Based on the manual 
fine-tuning process, other hyper parameters such as epochs of 30 with 
batch size 1 is chosen as optimal value. 

4.5. Multi labelling framework

Wav2vec is one of the latest state-of-art models for Automatic Speech 
Recognition  and  other  audio-related  problems  (Boigne  et  al.,  2020) 
(Shibano et al., 2021). The architecture of the Wav2vec is based on the 
transformer's  encoder,  with  a  training  objective  like  BERT's  masked 
language modelling objective but adapted for speech instead of text. The 
self-supervised  way  of  training  allows  Wav2vec  to  pre-train  on  unla-
belled data, which is more accessible (Hendrycks et al., 2019). Later, the 
model can be fine-tuned on a particular dataset for a specific purpose. 
This  approach  shows  remarkable  improvement  in  the  model's  perfor-
mance, especially if the dataset size is very small with label.

3.1. Feature encoder 

The feature encoder of the pre-trained Wav2vec model reduces the 
dimensionality of the audio data, converting the raw waveform into a 
sequence of feature vectors Z every 20 milliseconds. The main compo-
nent of the feature encoder's architecture is seven layers of a 1D con-
volutional neural network with 512 channels at each layer. The size of 
the kernel and strides decreases as the layer progresses in the network. 
The waveform is normalized before passing through the convolutional 
layer, followed  by  layer  normalization and  GELU  activation function. 
Finally,  latent  feature  vectors  represent  the  latent  feature  of  bird 
vocalization.  Thus,  it  helps  the  model  to  identify  and  understand  the 
sequential information in the vocalization audio of multi-bird species.

Helpful Answer:

The deep learning model uses the Adam optimizer with an initial learning rate of 10e-5. This learning rate is suitable for small weight updates throughout the network during fine-tuning. Other hyperparameters include epochs set to 30 and a batch size of 1. These values were manually selected as optimal during the fine-tuning process.
