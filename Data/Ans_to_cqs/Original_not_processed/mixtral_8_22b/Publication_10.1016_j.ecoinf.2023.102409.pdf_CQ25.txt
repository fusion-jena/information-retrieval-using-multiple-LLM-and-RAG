(3) Deeplabv3þ. In the encoding stage of Deeplabv3+ model, the 
backbone  network  is  replaced  with  Mobilenetv2  featuring  expanded 
convolution (Fig. 5). Mobilenetv2 network ensures higher accuracy and 
enhances  the  model’s  lightweight  nature  compared  to  the  originally 
used  Xception+ network  (Fu  et  al.,  2022),  significantly  reducing  the 
model weights file size and accelerating model prediction speed. Addi-
tionally,  the  semantic  segmentation  task  involves  incorporating  ASPP 
module into the encoder-decoder network (Chen et al., 2018b). Five sets 
of feature maps are obtained by utilizing four atrous convolution blocks 
with varied dilation rates (including convolution, batch normalization, 
and activation layers) and a global average pooling block. These feature 
maps are concatenated, then passed through a 1 × 1 convolution block, 
and  ultimately  inputted  into  the  Decoder  module.  ASPP  method  in-

(1)  Unet.  By  incorporating  an  encoder-decoder  structure  that  es-
tablishes shortcut connections, Unet model extended upon FCN’s end-to- 
end concept (Ronneberger et al., 2015). The input to the network is a 
512  × 512  pixels  image  (Fig.  3).  The  encoder  (left  dashed  square) 
downsamples the input tensor and encodes it into a vector with reduced 
dimensions. It consists of multiple convolutional blocks, each including 
a  3  × 3  convolutional  kernel  layer,  batch  normalization,  and  an

In recent years, the advancement of artificial intelligence technology 
has  led  to  the  emergence  of  numerous  deep  learning  algorithms, 
including U-Net (Unet), Pyramid Scene Parsing Network (Pspnet), and 
DeepLabV3+,  which  are  increasingly  applied  to  address  geographical 
and ecological challenges (Çalıs¸kan, 2023a; Chen, 2023; Minaee et al., 
2022). Notably, Unet  exhibits proficiency  in achieving  more accurate 
results by requiring a smaller number of training samples (Ronneberger 
et  al.,  2015).  On  the  other  hand,  Pspnet  employs  a  spatial  pyramid 
module  to  gather  contextual  data  from  diverse  regions,  enabling  the 
acquisition  of  comprehensive  global  information  (Zhao  et  al.,  2017). 
DeepLabV3+ integrates an asymmetric spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) 
architecture within an encoder-decoder framework, effectively merging 
multi-scale information. This integration aids in precise object boundary

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the given context is primarily for semantic segmentation tasks. Semantic segmentation is a process where each pixel in an image is classified according to its class or category. For instance, in the case of DeepLabv3+, the model uses MobileNetv2 as its backbone network and incorporates the Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) module to improve the performance of the model in handling multi-scale objects. Similarly, the U-Net model also performs semantic segmentation tasks but utilizes an encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections between them. Both these models aim to achieve high accuracy while maintaining their lightweight nature, making them suitable for various applications such as remote sensing image analysis, medical imaging, etc.
