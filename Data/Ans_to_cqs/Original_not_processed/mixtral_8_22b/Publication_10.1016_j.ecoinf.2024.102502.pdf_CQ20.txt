Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention which specific hardware resources were used for training the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that the use of this technology spans across several disciplines due to its advantages for fast processing multi-petabyte of Earth Observation System (EOS) data. This suggests that powerful computational resources such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) might have been employed during the training process, considering their ability to handle large amounts of data quickly. Nonetheless, without explicit information on the hardware resources used, we cannot definitively state whether GPUs, TPUs, or other types of hardware were utilized.
