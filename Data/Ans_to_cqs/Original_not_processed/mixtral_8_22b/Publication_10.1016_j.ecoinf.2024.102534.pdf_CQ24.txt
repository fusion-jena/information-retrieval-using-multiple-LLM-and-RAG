An  ensemble  model  incorporating  Random  Forest  (RF)  (Breiman, 
2001)  and  Support  Vector  Machine  (SVM)  (Noble  and  Street,  2006) 
components  was  used  to  predict  current  and  future  suitable  areas  of 
orchids under land cover and climate change. 80% of the data for each 
category (epiphyte lowland orchid, terrestrial lowland orchid, epiphyte 
upland  orchid,  and  terrestrial  upland  orchid)  were  used  to  build  the 
model. The R “dismo” and R “sdm” package were used to generate model 
predictions (Naimi and Araújo, 2016). The remaining 20% of the testing

4. Discussion 

Ensemble models for all orchid groups have AUC values >0.90 and 
TSS > 0.80 for predicting current suitable areas. These models include 
almost 92% of the actual occurrence records for lowland epiphyte, 94% 
for lowland terrestrial, 96% for upland epiphyte, and 98% for upland 
terrestrial.  Ensemble  models  also  predict  that  the  suitable  areas  for 
lowland  epiphyte  orchids  cover  14.89%  of  the  total  New  Guinea’s 
mainland  area,  11.11%  for  lowland  terrestrial,  18.83%  for  upland 
epiphyte, and 16.54% for upland terrestrial orchids. Lowland and up-
land orchids, either epiphytic or terrestrial, are predicted to respond to 
climate change and land cover change by shifting their suitable areas. 
The lowland  epiphyte  group is  predicted to  lose suitable  areas in  the 
worst case climate change scenario (SSP 5–8.5), but suitable areas for 
lowland  orchids  will  expand  in  the  most  optimistic  climate  change 
scenario (SSP 1–2.6).

Climate change and land cover change often interactively affect plant species distributions. This study addresses 
the vulnerability of lowland and upland orchids to climate change and land cover change. Endemic orchids of 
New  Guinea  were  grouped  into  four  classes  (lowland  epiphyte,  lowland  terrestrial,  upland  epiphyte,  upland 
terrestrial)  based  on  their  life  form  and  elevation  range.  Forty  occurrence  records  of  endemic  orchids  were 
selected for each class, totaling 160 occurrence records. Ensemble modelling combining two machine learning 
algorithms was used to generate predictive current and future suitable areas for orchid classes. Model perfor-
mance  was  evaluated  using  the  AUC  and  TSS  metrics.  Suitable  areas  for  both  lowland  and  upland  orchids 
(epiphyte and terrestrial) were predicted decrease in the future due to climate change and land cover change.

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, there isn't any direct information about handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline. However, some common strategies to manage randomness in such scenarios can be discussed.

Randomness in deep learning pipelines usually arises from various sources like initial weights, shuffling of training data, dropout layers, etc. To ensure reproducibility and consistency across experiments, one strategy is fixing the random seed value. By setting a fixed seed value, we can reproduce the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers, which helps maintain consistent results between different runs of the same experiment.

Another approach is to use deterministic algorithms wherever possible. For example, instead of using stochastic gradient descent, one could opt for batch gradient descent or other deterministic optimization methods. Similarly, choosing non-randomized versions of certain operations, like sorting or sampling, can help reduce randomness in the pipeline.

Lastly, it's essential to understand that some level of randomness might still exist even after employing these strategies. In such cases, running multiple trials with different seeds and averaging the results can provide more robust estimates of performance.
