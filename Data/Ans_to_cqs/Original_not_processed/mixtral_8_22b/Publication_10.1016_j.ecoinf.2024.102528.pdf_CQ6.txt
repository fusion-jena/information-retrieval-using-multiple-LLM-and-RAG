In this paper, we present an automated framework that allows the 
monitoring of a large number of bird species by their vocalizations over 
extended periods and across various time scales. The framework relies 
on the BirdNET Analyzer deep learning model (BirdNET-Analyzer, n.d.),

Continuous  bioacoustic  monitoring  is  an  emerging  opportunity  as  well  as  a  challenge,  allowing  detection  of 
cryptic species' activity while producing high computational demands. In this paper, we present an automated 
framework that allows the monitoring of a large number of bird species by their vocalizations over extended 
periods. The framework relies on the BirdNET-Analyzer deep learning model. We applied the framework to >80 
species; 20 species with the highest recall scores were selected for further analysis.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it can be generally assumed that these common preprocessing techniques might be employed depending on the nature of the data being used for training the model. For instance, if audio recordings of bird vocalizations are used as input data, then some possible preprocessing steps could include noise reduction, filtering, segmentation, and feature extraction. These steps would help improve the quality of the input data and enhance the performance of the deep learning model during training.
