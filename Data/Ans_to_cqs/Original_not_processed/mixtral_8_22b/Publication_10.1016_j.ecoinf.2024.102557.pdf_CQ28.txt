2.2. Modeling 

We  trained productivity  models for  B.  edulis, H.  repandum,  L. deli-
ciosus, M. procera and T. portentosum based on the random forest algo-
rithm and the R package “ranger” (Wright and Ziegler, 2017). Random 
forest models allow us to find consistent nonlinear ecological relation-
ships  among  a  large  number  of  predictors,  making  them  suitable  for 
predicting  this  resource  that  sometimes  appears  to  be  driven  by

the  field  of  ecological  informatics  (Borowiec  et  al.,  2022;  Tuia  et  al., 
2022; Christin et al., 2019; W¨aldchen and M¨ader, 2018) and promises to 
continue  to  make  further  progress  (Morera,  2024).  These  techniques 
have  allowed  to  improve  the  accuracy  of  results  compared  to  more 
traditional modeling techniques due to the possibility to approximate 
non-linear  relationships  and  to  consider  a  large  number of  predictors 
(Meyer  et  al.,  2019).  Machine  learning  in  ecology  has  been  used  for 
instance to study species distribution (Liang et al., 2022; Bellin et al., 
2022), species identification through imagery (Gao et al., 2024), char-
acterization of land use change (Gelabert et al., 2021), identification of 
conservable or restorable areas (Cheng et al., 2018), biodiversity con-
servation and estimation (Tuia et al., 2022; Chang, 2023), and invasive 
species risk assessment (Jensen et al., 2020).

%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide information about which specific platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or any other platform was used.
