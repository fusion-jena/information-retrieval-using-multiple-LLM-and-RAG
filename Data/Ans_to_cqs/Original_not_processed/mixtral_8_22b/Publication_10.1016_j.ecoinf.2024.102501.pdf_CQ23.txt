In addition,  in the prediction  of dissolved oxygen in  water, (Chen 
et  al.,  2020)  not  only  applied  water  quality  parameters  but  also 
considered parameters such as temperature, humidity, and atmospheric 
pressure in the air as input variables for the model, providing ideas for 
subsequent research.

The  above  results  and  analyses  show  that  traditional  machine 
learning  methods  (SVR)  and  deep  learning  methods  (LSTM)  can  be 
adapted  to  address  the  problems  of  poor  generalization  ability,  local 
optimum, underfitting, and overfitting of conventional models to predict 
DO concentration successfully. The machine learning and deep learning 
literature also discuss the prediction of DO concentration. For example,

concentration  prediction  ability  than  the  standard  MLPNN  model 
(Areerachakul et al., 2013). Du combined RBFNN with the proportional 
integrated  derivative  algorithm  to  control  the  DO  concentration  in 
aviation  tanks.  GRNN  improves  approximation  ability  and  learning 
speed compared to RBF networks and is also suitable for predicting small 
sample sizes (Du et al., 2018). In predicting DO concentration in river 
water,  Heddam  applied  GRNN  for  modeling  hourly  DO,  at  Klamath 
River, Oregon, USA (Heddam, 2014a), whereas Cs´abr´agi used GRNN, 
RBFNN,  MLPNN,  and  MLR  for  the  River  Tisza  and  Danube  (Cs´abr´agi 
et al., 2019; Cs´abr´agi et al., 2017). Antanasijevi´c used GRNN, MLPNN, 
and  recurrent  neural  networks  (RNN)  for  DO  concentrations  in  the 
Danube River, North Serbia, and compared the results with that of MLR. 
ELM is a type of single hidden layer feedforward neural network, which

that  researchers  are  most  interested  in.  Ay  and  Kisi  developed  the 
RBFNN  model  for  DO  concentration  modeling  using  four  parameters, 
including temperature. RBFNN was found to be more effective than the 
MLPNN  and  MLR  models  (Ay  and  Kisi,  2012).  Heddam  compared 
RBFNN and MLPNN and found that both models successfully predicted 
the DO concentration in rivers (Heddam et al., 2016). Akkoyunlu also 
evaluated RBFNN and MLPNN, assuming they were more effective in 
predicting DO concentration than MLR models (Akkoyunlu et al., 2011). 
Areerachakul mixed MLPNN, k-means, and fuzzy c-mean algorithms to 
develop  k-MLPNN  and  found  that  this  model  has  better  DO

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it is not explicitly mentioned what specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some indications that suggest certain practices might have been employed.

Firstly, the authors mention using various datasets from different sources, including water quality parameters and environmental factors like temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure. This suggests that the dataset used for training and testing the model could be diverse, which is one way to improve the generalizability of a model.

Secondly, the authors compare their proposed method with several other machine learning and deep learning techniques, such as SVR, LSTM, BPNN, and others. They evaluate these models based on performance metrics like R2, MSE, and MAE. This implies that the authors may have used cross-validation or similar techniques to assess the robustness and reliability of their model across multiple subsets of the data.

Lastly, while not directly related to ensuring the generalizability of the deep learning model, the authors do mention applying different data processing methods to train and test their proposed method. This indicates that they considered various approaches to preprocess and prepare the data before feeding it into the model, which could potentially impact its overall performance and applicability to new datasets.

However, without further information or explicit statements regarding the use of specific techniques like cross-validation, stratified sampling, or regularization methods, it cannot be definitively stated what exact measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
