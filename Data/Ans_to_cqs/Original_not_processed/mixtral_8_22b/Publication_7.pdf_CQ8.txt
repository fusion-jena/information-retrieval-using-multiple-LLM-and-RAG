Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) [9], also known as
deep networks, are an important class of machine learning
algorithms applicable, among others, to numerous computer
vision problems. Deep CNNs, in particular, are composed of
multiple layers of processing involving linear as well as non-
linear operators. To solve a particular task, the parameters of
networks are learned in an end-to-end manner. Image represen-
tations extracted from deep CNNs trained on a large dataset
such as ImageNet [10] have shown to produce a promising
performance for diverse classiﬁcation and recognition tasks
[11], [12], [13], [14] and [15]. Spatial pyramid pooling (SPP)
[16] and Multi-scale Orderless Pooling (MOP) [17] schemes
have made CNNs independent of the input image size and
robust for diverse classiﬁcation and recognition applications.
In this paper, we propose a computer vision and deep
learning based framework for the automatic annotation of

Image representations extracted from deep neural networks,
trained on large datasets such as ImageNet [9] and ﬁne tuned
on domain speciﬁc datasets, have shown state-of-art perfor-
mance in numerous image classiﬁcation problems [14]. The
activation vectors of the ﬁrst fully connected layer of a pre-
trained VGGnet [24] are employed as feature representations
in our work. The weights of this deep network are ﬁne tuned
using the Benthoz15 dataset [23] which consists of expert-
annotated and geo-referenced marine images from Australian
seas.

V. CONCLUSION

In this work, we applied pre-trained CNN image represen-
tations extracted from VGGnet to a coral reef classiﬁcation
problem. We investigated the effectiveness of our trained clas-
siﬁer on unlabelled coral mosaics of the Abrolhos Islands. We
analysed the coral reef of the Abrolhos Islands to investigate
the trends in coral population. We generated coral maps for
this region and quantiﬁed the coral population automatically.
Our framework detected the decreasing trend in the coral
population of this region as well. The proposed framework is
an important step towards investigating the long-term effects
of environmental change on the effective sustenance of marine
ecosystems automatically.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only discusses the application of pre-trained CNN image representations extracted from VGGnet to a coral reef classification problem, along with some experimental results and conclusions. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the location of the code repository based solely on the provided context.
