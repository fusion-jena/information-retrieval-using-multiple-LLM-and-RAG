measures the amount of error made by the model. The X-axis represents 
the number of epochs, which are the iterations of the training process. 
The  Y-axis  represents  the  values  of  accuracy  or  loss,  which  are  the 
metrics of the model’s performance.

epochs increases, the accuracy curve shows that the model’s classifica-
tion performance improves. Fig. 6 shows two-line graphs, one for ac-
curacy and one for loss, that compare the training and validation results 
over  epochs.  The  data  points  on  the  graphs  are  based  on  the  mathe-
matical calculations that the proposed model performs on the data. The 
data points are connected by lines to show the trend and pattern of the 
model’s  performance.  The  data  points  and  lines  are  color-coded  to 
indicate whether they belong to the training or validation results. The 
blue color represents the training results, while the orange color rep-
resents the validation results. The graphs also have labels and axes to 
indicate  what  they  are  measuring  and  how  they  are  scaled.  The  left 
graph  is  labeled  “Accuracy”  and  measures  the  percentage  of  correct 
predictions made by the model. The right graph is labeled “Loss”  and

means that the model remembered the training data too well and was 
not able to adapt well to the validation data. Dropout is used to help the 
model reduce the gap between the training and validation results and 
improve its generalizability.

Helpful Answer:
To monitor the model performance during training, a strategy involving line graphs representing accuracy and loss over epochs is employed. These graphs display the mathematical calculations performed by the proposed model on the data, with each point connected by lines to illustrate trends and patterns in the model's performance. Data points and lines are color-coded to differentiate between training and validation results; blue indicates training results, while orange signifies validation results.

Two separate graphs are utilized for this purpose. The first graph, labeled "Accuracy," measures the percentage of accurate predictions made by the model. This graph helps track improvements in classification performance as the number of epochs increases. The second graph, titled "Loss," provides insights into the degree of error produced by the model. By observing these graphs, it becomes possible to identify any discrepancies between the training and validation results, such as when the model excessively memorizes the training data without effectively adapting to new information. In such cases, dropout techniques can be applied to minimize the disparity between training and validation outcomes, thereby enhancing the model's overall generalizability.
