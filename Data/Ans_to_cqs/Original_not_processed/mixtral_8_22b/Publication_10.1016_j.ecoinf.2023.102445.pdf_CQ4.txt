(AdaptiveAvgPool). These operations generate lc
Avg. The output 
size of both branches is set to match the size of the m feature map. The 
resulting feature maps from these two branches subsequently summed to 
yield the lc
Max+Avg, and m 
feature maps are concatenated for subsequent processing. In this mod-
ule,  the  attention  mechanism  is  introduced  during  the  concatenation 
operation.  Network  training  yields  three  weight  values,  each  corre-
sponding to one of the feature maps. These weights are subsequently 
applied to the respective feature maps. A greater influence on the model 
is associated with a higher weight, while a lesser influence receives a 
lower weight. Each feature map is then multiplied by its weight before 
being concatenated alongside the others.

2.2.6. Experimental design 

In this paper, a sequence of 10 ablation experiments are conducted 
and labelled to evaluate the enhancements made to various components 
of the network architecture. These experiments use 10 different network 
models,  of  which  the  model  of  Experiment  1  is  the  original  YOLOv8 
model, and the remaining nine models are models with different struc-
tures modified on the basis of YOLOv8. 

The experimental training parameter settings are as follows: a batch 
size of 16 is selected, the input image resolution is set at 640 × 640, and 
the number of epochs is specified as 150. The learning rate is set to 0.01, 
and the optimizer is Adam. Additionally, the depth_scale parameter is 
assigned a value of 0.33, while the width_scale parameter is set to 0.25.

enriches  gradient  flow  information  while  maintaining  a  lightweight 
structure.  The  SPPF  module  is  a  module  for  processing  objects  with 
different scales. It modifies parallel max pooling into a combination of 
serial  and  parallel  modes,  enhancing  the  model's  resilience  to  spatial 
layout and object degradation. This module involves a standard Conv 
operation, followed by kernel sizes of 5, 9, and 13 for Max pooling. The 
results are concatenated with the Conv module for extracting shallow 
semantic  features,  which  subsequently  passed  through  a  final  Conv 
module. The neck network is positioned between the backbone network 
and the head network. Feature fusion is performed using two network 
architectures, the feature pyramid network (FPN) and the path aggre-
gation network (PAN), which are used to solve the problem of multiscale 
feature fusion and strengthen the integration and utilization of feature

input into the model network for training.
