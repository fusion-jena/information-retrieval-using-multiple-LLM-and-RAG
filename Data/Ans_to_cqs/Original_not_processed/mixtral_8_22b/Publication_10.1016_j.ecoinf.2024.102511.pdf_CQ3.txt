BANTER  may  serve  as  an  option  for  automated  machine  learning 
classification.

Development of automated classification routines, if accurate, serves to 
improve the efficiency, reduce the subjectivity, and decrease the cost of 
analyzing large datasets.

Advances in computing have led to a dramatic increase in the op-
portunities  to  use  machine  learning  for  bioacoustic  classification 
(Bianco et al., 2019; Mutanu et al., 2022; Stowell, 2022). In particular, 
use of deep neural networks show great promise for large datasets on a 
wide variety of taxa, including marine mammals (Frainer et al., 2023; 
Frasier et al., 2017; Li et al., 2020a; Rom´an Ruiz et  al., 2023; Zhong 
et al., 2020). Neural networks typically require significant sample sizes 
for all classes, although there are increasingly new tools to enhance data 
or combined disparate datasets (Dufourq et al., 2022; Nanni et al., 2020; 
Nolasco et al., 2023; Padovese et al., 2023; Shorten and Khoshgoftaar, 
2019).  There  is  a  significant  learning  curve  to  understand  how  to

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it can be inferred from the context that some form of data labeling or annotation must have been performed to train the deep learning models mentioned. For example, the paper by Soldevilla et al. (2008) discusses the classification of Risso’s and Pacific white-sided dolphins using spectral properties of echolocation clicks. This implies that the dataset used for training the model was labeled with the correct species information. Similarly, the development of automated classification routines discussed in the context would also require labeled datasets for training and validation purposes. It should be noted that the choice of data annotation technique depends on the nature of the problem being solved and the type of data available. For instance, object detection tasks might require bounding box annotations while semantic segmentation tasks might need pixel-level labels. Therefore, without more specific details about the deep learning pipelines mentioned in the context, it is difficult to determine the exact data annotation techniques used.
