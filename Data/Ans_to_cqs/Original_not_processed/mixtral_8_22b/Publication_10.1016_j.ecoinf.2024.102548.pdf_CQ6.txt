f (x; M) = Mconv(x)

where Mconv  denotes the convolutional layers of the pre-trained model. 
In the fine-tuning stage, the pre-trained model’s weights are further 
optimized on the target dataset to adapt the model to the specific clas-
sification task. This involves training the additional layers added on top 
of the pre-trained model while keeping the pre-trained weights fixed or 
partially  updating  them.  The  fine-tuning  process  adjusts  the  model’s 
parameters to better fit the target dataset, capturing task-specific pat-
terns.  It  involves  minimizing  a  loss  function,  typically  a  categorical 
cross-entropy loss, using gradient-based optimization algorithms such as 
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam. The loss function measures 
the discrepancy between the predicted class probabilities and the true 
labels in the target dataset.

5.1.4. Total model parameters 

Total  parameters  in  a  neural  network encompass  the  aggregate of 
trainable weights and biases, serving as a direct measure of the model’s 
architectural complexity. This parameter count is pivotal in defining the 
model’s capacity for feature extraction and pattern recognition. High- 
parameter  models  are  adept  at  discerning  intricate  data  patterns  but 
are  susceptible  to  overfitting,  particularly  in  scenarios  with  limited 
training samples. Furthermore, such models escalate computational and 
memory  requirements,  potentially  impeding  deployment  in  resource- 
constrained environments.

3. Deep learning techniques 

In the Deep Learning section, we delve into the technical aspects of 
our  model.  We  utilize  RNNs  to  effectively  capture  sequential  de-
pendencies in the data. RNNs, such as LSTM and GRUs, allow our model 
to retain and propagate information from previous steps, enhancing its 
understanding of sequential patterns. Additionally, we employ transfer 
learning  techniques,  initializing  our  model  with  pre-trained  weights 
from  large-scale  datasets  like  ImageNet.  This  transfer  of  knowledge 
enhances  the  model’s  performance  by  leveraging  learned  representa-
tions  from  related  tasks.  Detailed  explanations  and  implementation 
specifics of RNNs and transfer learning are provided in the subsequent 
subsections.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't any explicit mention of preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model in the given context. However, it can be generally stated that common preprocessing steps include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and augmentation. Normalization scales numerical input features to a range between 0 and 1, which helps prevent certain features from dominating others due to their scale. Scaling ensures all features have similar magnitudes, reducing bias towards larger values. Cleaning removes noise and outliers from the data, improving overall quality. Data augmentation generates new examples by applying transformations to existing ones, increasing the size of the dataset and helping the model generalize better. These preprocessing steps may vary depending on the nature of the problem and the type of data being used.
