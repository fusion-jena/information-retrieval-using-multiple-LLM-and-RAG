6. Conclusion

This study analyzed the generalizability of various ML models for
RHI prediction through a bias–variance decomposition analysis. Among
all ML models, weighted soft voting consistently exhibited the highest
generalizability across the three RHIs. Despite the slightly lower
generalizability than voting-based ensembles, homogeneous ensembles
showed comparable levels of generalizability to heterogeneous ensem-
required by
bles. Considering the increased computing power

Predictive models that relate river health to gradients of environ-
mental factors can identify potential causes of impairment in areas of
ecological concern, supporting strategic decisions on prioritizing resto-
ration activities and new monitoring initiatives. Such models should be
generalizable to unseen data for predicting the river health in unmoni-
tored areas. Bias–variance decomposition is widely adopted for gener-
alizability evaluations of ML models (Guan and Burton, 2022; Van Der
Putten and Van Someren, 2004; Van Der Valk and Picek, 2019).
Although deep learning and other ML models have been widely
employed in river health predictions (Gazendam et al., 2016; Kwon
et al., 2024; Lee et al., 2021), they have not been supplemented with
evaluation techniques that would confirm their generalizability to un-
seen datasets. In the present study, the generalizability of various ML

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot determine whether it was deployed on platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform based on the available information.
