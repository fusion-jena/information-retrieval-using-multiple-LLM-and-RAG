Insect forest risk assessment is important to effectively manage insect 
pests, as it promotes efficient identification of hazardous forest condi-
tions and development of strategies for their control by providing in-
formation on pest occurrence patterns (Choi et al., 2017; Mason, 1985; 
Park  et  al.,  2013).  There  are  various  approaches  to  hazard  rating  for 
various  insect  pests  in  forest  ecosystems.  Recently,  machine  learning 
methods  have  been  successfully  used  to  evaluate  the  risk  of  invasive

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
While the given context does not directly provide information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as train, test, and validation sets, it can be inferred from general practices in machine learning. Typically, the dataset is divided into three subsets: training set, validation set, and testing set. The training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters during the training process. Lastly, the testing set is used to assess the final performance of the trained model. The proportion of each subset varies depending on the size of the dataset and the complexity of the problem being addressed. Common splits include 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing or 80% for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing. However, these proportions may differ based on the requirements and constraints of individual projects.
