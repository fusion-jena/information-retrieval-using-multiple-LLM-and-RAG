distillation methods, which have been surveyed extensively and proven 
effective  in  model  compression  through  distillation  and  quantization 
(Gou  et  al.,  2021;  Polino  et  al.,  2018  preprint:  not  peer  reviewed). 
Through this comprehensive suite of improvements and optimizations, 
we aspire to develop lightweight yet powerful fish individual recogni-
tion algorithms, thereby providing robust technical support for intelli-
gent aquaculture and marine ecological protection initiatives.

Looking ahead to future research, we will focus on the dual optimi-
zation  of lightweight  and  high performance  for fish  individual recog-
nition algorithms in real underwater environments. To achieve this, we 
intend to draw inspiration from the innovative strategies presented in 
related literature. Specifically, we can adopt a streamlining approach, 
transforming traditional heavyweight backbone networks into efficient 
lightweight structures, thereby drastically reducing the computational 
load (Zhang et al., 2024). Concurrently, we seek to replace or optimize 
those  modules  with  lower  performance  so  as  to  improve  the  overall 
processing speed of the algorithm (Bakana et al., 2024). Moreover, we 
will harness pruning techniques extensively, which have been shown to 
significantly  simplify  model  structures,  enhance  generalization  capa-
bilities, and expedite model inference speed (Pasandi et al., 2020; Pat-

Helpful Answer:
The text mentions that the optimization is carried out using the Adam optimizer with a momentum of 0.9 and a batch size of 16. This means that the Adam optimization algorithm is being used in the deep learning pipeline. Adam is a popular optimization method used in machine learning and deep learning models due to its ability to adaptively adjust the learning rate based on the first and second moments of gradients. It combines the advantages of two other optimization methods, AdaGrad and RMSProp, making it more suitable for problems with noisy or sparse gradients.
