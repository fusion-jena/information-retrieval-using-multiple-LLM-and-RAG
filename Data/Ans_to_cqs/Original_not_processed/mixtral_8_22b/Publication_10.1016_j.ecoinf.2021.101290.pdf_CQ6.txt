In summary, we want to take advantage of the rapid development in 
machine  learning  without  having  to  constrain  the  environment  too 
much.  We  want  to  enable  re-use  of  developed  components  in  other 
experimental  setups  to  improve  standardisation  and  convergence  of 
methods. Further, we want to base the solution on mature well-known 
technologies and off-the-shelf hardware to keep it easy to maintain. 

We  therefore  propose  an  architecture,  based  on  modern  IT  infra-
structure,  that  delivers  on  those  requirements.  In  the  following,  we 
describe the architecture and explain why we think the solution should 
build on IT infrastructure. 

2.1. Architectural considerations

Leveraging machine learning, computer vision, and artificial intel-
ligence for automated annotation and analysis especially requires high 
quality data (Egnor and Branson, 2016). Although automated annota-
tion is widely applied, it is mostly used offline which has the advantage 
that the researcher can assist the algorithms, fine tune parameters and 
oversee that classifications are correct. However, it also limits the op-
tions for data collection and closed loop experimentation. We instead 
propose  to  automatically  annotate  and  analyse  data  online  while  the

The tools and methods available for event-stream processing are not 
the focus of this paper but they are increasingly many. Most have been 
developed  for  e-commerce,  monitoring  of  financial  markets  and  IT 
system monitoring but could as well be applied in biology. AWS kinesis 
(Amazon, 2011) and Apache Kibana (Elastic, 2016) give access to state 
of the art machine learning methods for event-stream processing at a 
click  and  mature  querying  languages,  such  as  elasticsearch  (Elastic, 
2012) make advanced data mining available to a much broader group of 
users.

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved to ensure that the input data is suitable for the model. These steps may include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing or handling missing values, outliers, and irrelevant features in the dataset. It ensures that the model does not learn from incorrect or misleading information.

2. Normalization/Standardization: This step scales the input features so that they fall within a specific range, usually between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. Scaling helps prevent certain features from dominating others due to their larger magnitudes, ensuring that all features contribute equally during training.

3. Feature Engineering: This process involves creating new features from existing ones to help improve the performance of the model. For example, polynomial features can be created from numerical variables to capture nonlinear relationships.

4. Encoding Categorical Variables: Since neural networks only accept numeric inputs, categorical variables need to be converted into numerical form using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

5. Data Augmentation: To increase the size of the dataset and introduce more variability, synthetic samples can be generated through transformations like rotation, flipping, zooming, etc. This technique is particularly useful when working with image datasets.

6. Splitting Dataset: Before training the model, the dataset needs to be divided into three subsets: training, validation, and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is employed to tune hyperparameters and select models, while the test set evaluates the final model's performance.
