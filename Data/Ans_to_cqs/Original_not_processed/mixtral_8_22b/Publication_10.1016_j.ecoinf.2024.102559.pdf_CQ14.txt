Accuracy metrics for models with entropy feature across window sizes  

Table A.5 
Accuracies and classification results into iceplant (positive class P) and other vegetation (negative class N) from models using spectral, NDVI, and date features together 
with entropy values of each spectral band and NDVI within a window, calculated across multiple window sizes. Accuracies are given in percentages.

classification processing. This step reduced the average number of pixels 
per scene the classification model had to analyze to 3,757,323 and took, 
on average, 18 s per scene.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer based on the information available. However, common methods used for hyperparameter optimization include grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and gradient-based optimization. Grid search involves testing all combinations of hyperparameters within a predefined range, while random search randomly selects combinations of hyperparameters to test. Bayesian optimization uses a probabilistic approach to find the optimal set of hyperparameters, and gradient-based optimization uses gradients to iteratively update the hyperparameters towards their optimal values. Without further information, it cannot be determined which method was used for this particular model.
