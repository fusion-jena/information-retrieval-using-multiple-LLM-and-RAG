study and larger datasets do not necessarily produce more precise
models as the use of too much data can lead to model overtraining and
precision loss (Sj¨oberg and Ljung, 1995). Additionally, water quality
datasets are composed of a large number of parameters that often
represent redundant information (Haghiabi et al., 2018; Muharemi
et al., 2019). Despite these known issues, detailed analysis of historical
variation in a dataset is rarely employed for selecting training data
subsets prior to developing predictive models. It is anticipated that their
implementation may improve the training step and, therefore, lead to
improved predictive outputs. For these reasons, analyzing historical
trends in water quality is necessary to find the most variable and
representative scenarios useful for machine learning model training.

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide explicit details on the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into sets such as train, test, or validation. However, it does mention some general considerations when working with water quality datasets for machine learning models.

The text suggests that using too much data can lead to model overtraining and precision loss. This implies that the amount of data used for training should be carefully considered to avoid this issue. Furthermore, the context mentions that water quality datasets often contain redundant information, which could potentially affect the performance of the model if included in the training set. Therefore, one possible criterion for splitting the data might involve removing or reducing redundant features before dividing the dataset.

Additionally, the context emphasizes the importance of analyzing historical trends in water quality to identify the most variable and representative scenarios for machine learning model training. This indicates that another potential criterion for splitting the data could involve selecting samples based on their representativeness and variability within the dataset. By doing so, the resulting subsets would better capture the overall characteristics of the data, leading to improved predictive outputs.

In summary, while the given context does not explicitly state the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, it provides insights into some factors that should be taken into account during this process. These include considering the amount of data used for training, handling redundant information, and selecting representative and variable samples for each subset.
