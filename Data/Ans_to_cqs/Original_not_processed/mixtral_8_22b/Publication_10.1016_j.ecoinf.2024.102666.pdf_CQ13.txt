artificial neural networks (ANN) (Men et al., 2022). The efficacy of these 
algorithms exhibits considerable variation across diverse aquatic envi-
ronments. For instance, the Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of 
Spectral  Hypercubes  (FLAASH)  model,  originally  developed  for  land 
pixels,  has  proven  effective  in  AC  for  aquatic  environments  utilizing 
Sentinel-2  and  SPOT-6  imagery  (Rotta  et  al.,  2016;  Li  et  al.,  2023a, 
2023b, 2023c, 2023d). Additionally, the FLAASH algorithm mitigates 
the  spatial  proximity  effect  by  employing  an  internal  pixel  averaging 
technique, which is essential for attaining high-quality AC (Wang et al., 
2021).  In  investigations  of  lacustrine  environments  using  Advanced 
Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) AVNIR-2 data, the efficacy of AC al-
gorithms  predicated  on  the  single  scattering  approximation  has  been 
significantly enhanced (Matsui and Kageyama, 2022). The Atmospheric

(FLAASH) is an atmospheric correction module developed by the United 
States  Air  Force  Laboratory,  which  is  proposed  after  improving  the 
Modtran4 model. It does  not rely on the atmospheric  parameter data 
obtained  synchronously  during  remote  sensing  imaging,  and  can 
perform AC for most satellite sensors in the wavelength range of 0.4–3 
μm,  and  obtain  accurate  surface  reflectance  (Kaufman  et  al.,  1997). 
FLAASH assumes that the target is approximately Lambert surface, and 
the correction formula is as follows:

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters used in a deep learning model such as learning rate or optimizer. However, it discusses the application of artificial neural networks (ANNs), specifically the Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes (FLAASH) model, in atmospheric correction for various aquatic environments. The FLAASH model was initially developed for land pixels but has shown effectiveness in aquatic environments using Sentinel-2 and SPOT-6 imagery. Furthermore, the FLAASH algorithm employs an internal pixel averaging technique to mitigate the spatial proximity effect, contributing to achieving high-quality atmospheric correction.

In terms of deep learning models, common hyperparameters include learning rate, optimizer, batch size, number of epochs, and others depending on the specific architecture being used. Learning rate determines how much the weights should be updated with respect to the loss gradient during training. Optimizers like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, or RMSprop help minimize the loss function more efficiently. Batch size refers to the number of samples processed before updating the model weights, while the number of epochs indicates the total number of times the entire dataset is passed through the model during training.

Since the context does not provide explicit information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, I cannot give a definitive answer regarding the learning rate, optimizer, or other hyperparameters employed in this particular case.
