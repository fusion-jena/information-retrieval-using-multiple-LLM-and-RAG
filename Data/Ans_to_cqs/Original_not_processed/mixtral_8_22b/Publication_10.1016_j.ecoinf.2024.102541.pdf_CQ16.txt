where  P r(obj) denotes  the  prediction  accuracy  of  the  bounding  box. 
When  P r(obj) = 1,  the  target  class  falls  within  the  grid;  otherwise, 
P r(obj) = 0.  The  degree  of  overlap  between  the  ground  truth  and 
anticipated bounding box is characterized by a metric called the inter-
section over union (IoU), which is expressed by Eq. (6). 

more efficient and rapidly converging loss function (Zheng et al., 2020). 
EIoU integrates IoU, distance, and aspect ratio losses, directly narrowing 
the width and height discrepancy between the anchors and ground truth 
(gt), thus enhancing positional accuracy. This is achieved using the di-
mensions  of  the  smallest  enclosing  box  (hc 
and  wc)  around  both 
bounding boxes. Eqs. (7) and (8) detail the EIoU loss, maintaining the 
advantageous attributes of CIoU loss.

Eq. (9) was proposed in (Zhang et al., 2022a) to make high-quality 
anchors more beneficial for training. This equation includes a gamma 
(γ) parameter, which regulates the degree of outlier inhibition. For our 
model design, γ = 1.5 improved accuracy was obtained, which was like 
the  YOLOv5s  original  accuracy  for  only  one  metric  (precision).  The 
parameter functions as an exponent to the IoU term; thus, high values 
stress  the  relevance  of  high-quality  anchors  even  more,  whereas  low 
values allow low-quality anchors to contribute more to the loss function.

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide explicit information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, based on common practices in machine learning, some possible criteria include reaching a certain number of epochs or iterations, achieving a desired level of performance on a validation set (such as a minimum threshold for precision, recall, F1 score, etc.), observing a plateau or decrease in the validation loss, or meeting other predefined stopping conditions. It should be noted that these criteria may vary depending on the specific model architecture, task requirements, and available resources.
