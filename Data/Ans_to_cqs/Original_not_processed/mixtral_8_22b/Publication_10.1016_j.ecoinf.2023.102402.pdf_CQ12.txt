goodness-of-fit and complexity. The model with the lowest AICc value (i. 
e. ΔAICc = 0) is considered the best model out of the current suite of 
models;  all  models  with  ΔAICc  <2  are  generally  considered  to  have 
substantial  support  (Muscarella  et  al.,  2014).  The  model  parameter 
settings with the lowest AICc values (ΔAICc = 0) for both H. guttulatus 
and H. hippocampus were chosen to establish the final Maxent models 
(ENMeval outputs in supplementary materials, Appendix 2).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it does not explicitly state what type of deep learning model was used in the pipeline. However, there is a mention of using Maxent models, which stands for Maximum Entropy Models. These are statistical models commonly used in machine learning and other fields such as physics, computer vision, and language processing. They are often used for classification tasks but can also be applied to regression problems. It should be noted that Maxent models are not specifically associated with any particular deep learning architecture like convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN), or transformers. Therefore, based solely on this information, we cannot definitively determine if a specific deep learning model like CNN, RNN, or Transformer was used in their pipeline.
