Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

e.g. machine learning and artiﬁcial neural networks, have been
widely employed in previous studies to solve the above prob-
lems in the agricultural ﬁeld.

5.2. Results

Fig. 4 shows a sample of detection and classiﬁcation results
using the developed recognition system based on Faster R-
CNN. High classiﬁcation accuracy was achieved for all tested
images of insect pests in the range of 97.0 to 99.0%. Moreover,
the developed UI of our mobile application is depicted in
Fig. 5, monitoring the identiﬁcation results; for example, in

case of the ﬂea beetles with a summary including the suggested
pesticides such as Neem oil and insecticidal soaps for guiding
farmers.

5.3. Comparative performance evaluation

The overall performance of developed system for insect pest
recognition has been evaluated using four basic classiﬁcation

executed repetitively until it gives the successful result. It is also
possible for the user to retry the failed and/or unsuccessful task
manually [50]. Second, the failed task of agricultural pest
recognition is re-submitted to the same resource or another
mobile device for completing the software execution correctly
[47].

We are currently working on extending the number of
insect pest classes in our database, considering speciﬁc crops
either in the open ﬁeld or greenhouses. That will also support
the farmers to perform multi-class classiﬁcation of targeted
crop pests simultaneously, as presented in Ref. [51]. Moreover,
security and privacy algorithms of analyzed images [52,53] for
transmission over public mobile networks can be also involved
in the proposed cloud computing system , as shown in Fig. 4.
Nevertheless, the current version of our developed mobile-
based application is still valid and accurate to identify agricul-
tural pests successfully.

7. Conclusions

(cid:1) Flask web [37] is applied for handling the HTTP POST
requests sent by the developed mobile-based user interface.
Then, the recognition result of crop pests is retrieved and
displayed.

(cid:1) MySQL database management system [38] has been used to
save all information and ground-truth images of the insect
pests, e.g. the pest name and the appropriate use of pesti-
cides for crop protection.

(cid:1) PythonAnywhere [39] is a platform solution consisting of a
Python online integrated development environment (IDE)
and web hosting environment to create and run Python
code in the cloud.

4.3. Developed pest recognition system

A new mobile-based application has been developed for iden-
tifying the crop insects in the cloud, as depicted in Fig. 3. The
framework of our developed deep learning-based cloud com-
puting system is composed of three main modules to accom-
plish automatic detection and classiﬁcation of insect pests as
follows.

Query: "How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no explicit mention of how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized in the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query. However, common methods for hyperparameter optimization include techniques like Grid Search, Random Search, Bayesian Optimization, etc. Without further details about the specific model used in this case, we cannot determine which method was utilized here.
