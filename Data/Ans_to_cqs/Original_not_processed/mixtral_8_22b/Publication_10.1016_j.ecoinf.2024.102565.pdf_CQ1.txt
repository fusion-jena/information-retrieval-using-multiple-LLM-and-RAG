During the validation phase of the machine learning algorithms, a K- 
fold cross-validation technique was implemented. Additionally, a four- 
fold  cross-validation  was  conducted  on  the  training  dataset,  as  illus-
trated in Fig. 4. The dataset was initially extracted, and the feature set 
was randomly divided into four mutually exclusive folds through strat-
ified sampling (Guo et al., 2021; Psychalas et al., 2023). Each fold served 
as  the  validation  set,  while  the  remaining  three  folds  constituted  the 
training set for model training. To address imbalances, random under 
sampling (RUS) was applied to the training set, while the validation set 
remained unchanged. The model underwent training using the balanced 
three-fold  training  dataset  for  a  specified  number  of  epochs  and  was 
subsequently  tested  on  the  validation  fold to  generate  predictions for 
that specific fold. This process iterated four times with distinct valida-

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The papers mentioned do not explicitly discuss the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general practices in the field, some common methods include:

1. Surveys or manual collection: For certain types of data, such as textual information or labeled images, human input is often required. This can be done through online surveys, crowdsourcing platforms, or manual labeling efforts.

2. Sensors: Various types of sensors can collect real-time data, including environmental sensors (for temperature, humidity, etc.), image sensors (for capturing visual data), and other specialized sensors depending on the application.

3. Public datasets: Many researchers use publicly available datasets for their work. These datasets may have been collected by government agencies, research institutions, or private organizations and made accessible to the broader scientific community. Examples include ImageNet for computer vision tasks, UCI Machine Learning Repository for various types of data, and many others.

Without more specific details about the context or domain, it is difficult to provide a more precise answer regarding which methods would be most appropriate for collecting raw data in this case.
