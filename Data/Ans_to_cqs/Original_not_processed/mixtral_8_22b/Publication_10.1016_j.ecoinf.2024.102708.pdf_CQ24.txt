Drone imagery and deep learning for mapping the density of wild Pacific 
oysters to manage their expansion into protected areas

This resulted in a dataset consisting of 3643 tiles for the Scoble site 
(758 containing Pacific oysters, 2885 without Pacific oysters) and 7571 
tiles  for  the  Collapit  site  (879  containing  Pacific  oysters  and  6692 
without Pacific oysters). 

2.3. Validation and training datasets 

To create the training and validation datasets, the tiles containing 
Pacific oysters were split into 70% training, and 30% validation. Data 
augmentation  was  used  to  increase  the  size  of  the  training  dataset, 
through random variations and manipulations to the data. Augmenta-
tions  were  applied  in  a  random  order.  The  list  of  augmentations  is 
described in Table 1. 

The training data set had five augmented images created per original 
tile  to  create  an  additional  5735  tiles  split  between  the  two  sites.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or managing random seed values. However, one strategy mentioned indirectly is data augmentation. This technique involves creating new training samples by applying random transformations such as flipping, cropping, contrast shifting, translating, and rotating the existing data. These manipulations introduce variability and help prevent overfitting, which can be caused by randomness in the model initialization or during training. While this doesn't directly address the issue of controlling randomness from factors like random seed values, it does provide a way to mitigate some of its negative impacts. Other common strategies not explicitly mentioned here include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using ensemble methods, or employing techniques like dropout regularization to reduce reliance on specific initializations.
