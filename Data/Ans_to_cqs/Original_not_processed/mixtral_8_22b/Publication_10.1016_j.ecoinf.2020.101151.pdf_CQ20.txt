for the FWI and FFMC data layers with a spatial resolution of 1 × 1 km.
The nine-cell approach, the results of which are shown in this paper, led
to slightly better prediction results of the variants, likely because it
smoothed existing data inaccuracies within single grid cells.

centers) in the development of the system is an essential task for out-
reach, dissemination and operationalization of the system. In this
context, we will ask a selected group of experts for feedback on the
performance, usability and reliability of the system in spring 2020. A
future use of the IFDS could also be the integration into a decision
support system, similar to the approach of Kalabokidis et al. (2013).

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. Therefore, I cannot determine which hardware resources were utilized for training the deep learning model based on the available context.
