bio9,  ‘Mean  temperature  of  driest  quarter’,  is  a  quarterly  index  that 
approximates  the  mean  temperatures  that  occur  during  the  driest 
quarter (degrees Celsius); 4) bio13, ‘Precipitation of wettest month’, is 
the index that identifies the total precipitation that occurs during the 
wettest month (millimetres); 5) bio19, ‘Precipitation of coldest quarter’, 
is  a  quarterly  index  that  indicates  the  total  precipitation  that  occurs 
during the coldest quarter (millimetres); and 6) ‘Slope’ in % values of the

Query: "Which hardware resources are used for training the deep learning model (e.g., GPUs, TPUs)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which hardware resources were utilized based solely on this context.
