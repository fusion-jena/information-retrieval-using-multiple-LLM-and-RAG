As clearly evident in Table 3, the refined model, integrated with the 
VOS  algorithm,  outperforms  both  the  YOLOv5  and  YOLOv8  models 
across  all  evaluation  metrics,  encompassing  Box_loss,  Seg_loss,  Preci-
sion, Recall, Precision (M), Recall (M), mAP, and mAP (M).

partitioned  the  dataset  into  ten  equal  sections,  known  as  folds,  for 
conducting rigorous folded cross-validation. This methodology involves 
a cyclical process of training and testing, where one fold serves as the 
test set while the remaining nine folds are used for training. The trained 
model is then evaluated on the test set, and the resulting performance 
metrics  are  recorded.  By  averaging  these  outcomes,  we  obtain  a 
comprehensive assessment of the model’s performance. When compared 
to the benchmark model, our proposed model shows notable differences 
in  key  metrics,  including  recognition  accuracy  and  recall.  These  dis-
parities are explicitly evidenced through quantitative values and data 
visualizations.  Throughout  the  experimental  phase,  we  rigorously 
controlled for any external factors that could potentially influence the 
results, thereby enhancing the precision and reliability of our tests. In

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model, the authors employed several measures. Firstly, they utilized a diverse dataset, which was likely sourced from high-resolution monitoring of fish length and catch numbers from landings using deep learning, as mentioned in the reference "Fish. Res. 246, 106166." Secondly, they implemented a rigorous cross-validation technique called folded cross-validation. This involved partitioning the dataset into ten equal sections or folds. Each fold served as the test set once, while the remaining nine folds were used for training. This cyclical process allowed them to evaluate the model's performance comprehensively by averaging the results obtained from each fold. Lastly, throughout the experimental phase, they controlled for any external factors that could potentially influence the results, thereby enhancing the precision and reliability of their tests.
