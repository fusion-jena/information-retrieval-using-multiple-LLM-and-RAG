Predictive models that relate river health to gradients of environ-
mental factors can identify potential causes of impairment in areas of
ecological concern, supporting strategic decisions on prioritizing resto-
ration activities and new monitoring initiatives. Such models should be
generalizable to unseen data for predicting the river health in unmoni-
tored areas. Bias–variance decomposition is widely adopted for gener-
alizability evaluations of ML models (Guan and Burton, 2022; Van Der
Putten and Van Someren, 2004; Van Der Valk and Picek, 2019).
Although deep learning and other ML models have been widely
employed in river health predictions (Gazendam et al., 2016; Kwon
et al., 2024; Lee et al., 2021), they have not been supplemented with
evaluation techniques that would confirm their generalizability to un-
seen datasets. In the present study, the generalizability of various ML

Helpful Answer:
The paper by Zamri et al. does not explicitly mention the specific evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the deep learning model. However, it mentions bias-variance decomposition as a technique for evaluating the generalizability of machine learning models. This suggests that the authors may have considered metrics such as mean squared error or root mean squared error, which are commonly used in regression tasks to measure bias and variance. Additionally, since the paper discusses the use of deep learning and other machine learning models for river health prediction, classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score could also potentially be relevant. Nevertheless, without further information, it is impossible to determine precisely which metrics were employed in this particular study.
