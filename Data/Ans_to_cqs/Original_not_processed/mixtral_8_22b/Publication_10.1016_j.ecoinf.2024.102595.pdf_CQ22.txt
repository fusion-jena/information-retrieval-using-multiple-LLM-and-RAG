Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

In  the  development  stage,  the  preprocessed  data  was  divided  into 
training (80%), validation (10%), and test sets (10%) for model training 
and testing purposes (Shah et al., 2018), followed by the construction of 
predictive  models  using  both  deep  learning  algorithms  (e.g.,  Deep 
Neural  Networks)  and  traditional  machine  learning  approaches  (e.g., 
AdaBoost  Regressor,  Support  Vector  Regressor,  etc.),  with  hyper-
parameter tuning performed via GridSearchCV with cross-validation (cv 
= 10).  While some studies  might  use different proportions, such as  a 
70–30 split between training and testing/validation (Khan et al., 2022), 
the  80–10-10  split  employed  in  this  study  ensured  a  more  extensive 
training set, potentially leading to a better-generalized model. The test 
set,  which  the  model  has  not  previously  seen  during  the  training  or 
validation phases indicates the model’s performance in real-world sce-
narios (Shah et al., 2018).

data, including vegetation indices and land surface temperatures from 
Landsat, and addressing errors. They identified key predictors such as 
rainfall, temperature, and vegetation indices, with models using these 
predictors  showing  improved  accuracy.  The  Deep  Neural  Network 
(DNN)  model was  the  most  accurate, explaining  91% yield  variation. 
Their  research  predicted  oil  palm  yields  using  machine  learning  and 
deep learning, demonstrating that models like XGBoost and DNN sur-
passed  traditional  models  (MLR,  RF,  SVR)  in  prediction  accuracy. 
However, they noted slight overfitting in some models and limited their 
focus to oil palm without considering other crops or aspects.

Examining the other models in the study offers a broad view of their 
relative  performances.  Models  like  the  Random  Forest  Regressor, 
Histogram-Based Gradient Boosting Regressor, and Bagging Regressor 
exhibited  moderate  performances.  Their  MSE  values  ranged  from 
1001.27 to 1025.74, and R2 values hovered around the 0.6 mark. On the 
other end of the spectrum, models such as the Deep Neural Network, 
XGBoost  Regressor,  and  Gradient  Boosting  Regressor  showed  lower 
effectiveness, with MSE values exceeding 1100 and R2  values dipping 
below  0.55.  These  variations  emphasize  the  differences  in  how  each 
model architecture interacts with the dataset and the complexity of oil 
palm yield prediction.

Helpful Answer:

Two primary metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models in this study: Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R^2 score (also known as coefficient of determination).

Mean Squared Error (MSE) is a common metric used in regression problems to measure the average squared difference between actual and predicted values. Lower MSE values indicate better model performance. In this study, MSE values varied among the tested models, ranging from approximately 1001 to over 1100.

The R^2 score, also called the coefficient of determination, measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by independent variables in the model. It ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 means that the model perfectly fits the data. In this study, R^2 scores varied among the models, with some reaching around 0.6 and others falling below 0.55.

These two metrics provide insights into the overall performance of the deep learning models in predicting oil palm yields. However, it should be noted that while higher R^2 scores and lower MSE values generally indicate better model performance, there may still be room for improvement due to factors such as overfitting or limitations in the dataset.
