4.3. Data processing

The  processing  of  high-resolution  remote  sensing  data,  which  en-
compasses  a  plethora  of  feature  information  (Girshick  et  al.,  2014), 
demands  significant  time  and  costs.  This  presents  considerable  chal-
lenges for many researchers (Modzelewska et al., 2020). Prior to clas-
sification, samples require training. The representativeness and quantity 
of  these  training  samples  significantly  influence  the  accuracy  of  the 
classification  models.  Platinum  (Ting,  2016)  demonstrated  that  when 
the training samples are not sufficiently typical, other categories can be 
easily misclassified into the sample’s category. If the number of training 
samples is insufficient, network training may not meet the requirements. 
Conversely, an excessive number of training samples can lead to data 
redundancy, reducing the efficiency of model training (Shi, 2018). To 
address  this  issue,  this  study  employed  feature  optimization  tools  to

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it does not provide specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets. However, it mentions the use of high-resolution remote sensing data, which could potentially be collected through various means like satellite imagery, drones, or airborne sensors. It also discusses the challenges faced during the processing of this data due to its large volume and complexity. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of having representative and adequate training samples for classification tasks, but it doesn't explicitly mention how these samples are gathered. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, we cannot definitively state what methods are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
