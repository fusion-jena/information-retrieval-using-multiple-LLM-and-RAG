2.5. Parameterization of the correction methods

The knowledge found in the literature and provided by experts of
the ecology of the An. darlingi species were used to parameterize the
correction methods described in paragraph 2.1 (Table S1 summarizes
the key aspects of such parameterizations).

unbiased model and the corrected one arise more likely from the cor-
rection methods than from the random selection of the sites. Thus, the
chosen parameterization appeared the most appropriate by achieving a
good compromise.

The mean relative rank of each method for each performance index
is shown in Fig. 6. The ranking varied by correction type and the
number of presence sites. Concerning ΔDenv, Fenv was the best method,
followed by BGenv when the amount of presences sites was 20. When

k = 50, BGenv appeared to provide the best results in terms of ΔDenv
and ΔDgeo, even if this result does not appear to be signiﬁcant con-
sidering the dispersed values.

When the number of presence sites increased, BGgeo was ranked the
best in terms of ΔAUC, BGgeo, and Fenv in terms of ΔDenv, and Fgeo in
terms of ΔDgeo.

4. Discussion

This study aimed to present a new sampling bias eﬀect correction
method in the framework of species distribution modeling and to
compare it with other representative approaches of the literature.

4.1. Absolute evaluation

Some authors have performed comparative studies of the methods
intended to correct the sampling bias eﬀects (Fourcade et al., 2014,
Kramer-Schadt et al., 2013, Varela et al., 2014). The study by Fourcade
et al. (2014) compared and evaluated correction method performances
with diﬀerent bias types and intensities. However, these studies have
not compared presence sites ﬁltering and biased background ap-
proaches in the case of a small number of presence sites. As mentioned
above, a background-based correction method appears to be adapted to
a small number of presence sites more. Theoretically, the background-
based correction method implemented in the environmental space, as
proposed by Moua et al. (2017), handles environmental bias and is less
sensitive to a low number of presence sites. This study aims to em-
pirically compare this proposed correction method with other existing
ones – covering the four main categories previously described – in the

Helpful Answer:
Regularization methods are techniques used in machine learning and deep learning models to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise along with underlying patterns, which can lead to poor generalization on unseen data. In the context of deep learning pipelines, two common regularization methods are Dropout and L2 Regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to make the network more robust and prevents complex co-adaptations on training data. Essentially, dropout acts as an ensemble of multiple neural networks, improving overall performance and reducing overfitting.

L2 Regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function based on the sum of squared weights. By adding this penalty, the optimization process encourages smaller weights, leading to simpler models that are less prone to overfitting.

In summary, both Dropout and L2 Regularization are popular regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines to combat overfitting. While Dropout focuses on ignoring certain neurons during training, L2 Regularization imposes a penalty on large weights to encourage simpler models.
