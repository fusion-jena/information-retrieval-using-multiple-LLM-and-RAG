Despite massive advancements in the field of machine learning (ML)
during the last decade, ML is not yet often used for vegetation studies.
ML models can be used for various tasks, among which are classification,
regression, and image segmentation. In ML, models extract knowledge
from data and use this knowledge to produce an output relevant to the
task at hand. These models use three main learning paradigms: super-
vised learning, unsupervised learning or reinforcement learning. This
study only considers the first paradigm, as we build a regression model.
Within supervised learning, there are a multitude of model types, for
example, support vector machines (Hearst et al., 1998), boosted tree
ensembles (e.g., XGBoost (Chen and Guestrin, 2016) or LightGBM (Ke
et al., 2017)) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) (McCulloch and
Pitts, 1943). This analysis will use ANNs, particularly multilayer per-
ceptrons (MLPs), which are fully connected feedforward neural net-

%Query
Query: "Where is the data repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given context, it does not provide information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The sources mentioned in the context primarily focus on research papers related to machine learning, vegetation studies, satellite monitoring, and other related topics. None of them explicitly mention a specific data repository for a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, without additional context or information, it is impossible to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
