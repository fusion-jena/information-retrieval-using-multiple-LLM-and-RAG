However,  the  model  also  has  some  limitations  that  need  to  be 
addressed in future research. Currently, the model has been tested on a 
limited number of case studies. Expanding the sample size and covering 
a  broader  range  of  geographical  areas  will  help  in  more  comprehen-
sively assessing the model's performance and generalizability. Although 
the model aims to avoid arbitrary parameter selection, certain compo-
nents,  such  as  the  dynamic  gating  mechanism,  may  still  require  fine- 
tuning.  The  development  of  automatic  parameter  optimization  tech-
niques  can  help  mitigate  this  issue.  Future  research  should  focus  on 
expanding  the  sample  size,  covering  a  wider  geographical  area,  and 
considering the use of interval models for prediction to further enhance 
the reliability of long-term prediction results. Addressing these limita-
tions will contribute to the development of a more robust, efficient, and

rate of 0.05 is implemented. Throughout the training process, a learning 
rate of 0.0001 is used, with 300 training epochs and 24 data instances 
processed  per  batch.  To  prevent  data  snooping  bias,  the  dataset  is 
divided chronologically: 70% for the training set, 10% for the validation 
set, and 20% for the test set. This allocation strategy better simulates 
real-world scenarios, ensuring that the data in the validation and test 
sets differ from the training set data, thereby enhancing the generaliz-
ability of the model. All the tests are run on a Windows 11 operating 
system  using  Python  3.8,  with  specific  hardware,  including  a  laptop 
possessing a 12th-Gen Intel Core i7-12700H GPU at 2.30 GHz and an 
NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 GPU. Due to the early stopping strategy, the 
training process converges before the last epoch, preventing overfitting 
issues.

√

The self-attention mechanism enables the model to capture context 
from the entire input sequence, making it highly effective for tasks such 
as  sequence-to-sequence  modeling.  Additionally,  the  Transformer  uti-
lizes a positional encoding scheme to give the model a sense of word 
order, which is crucial for understanding the structure of a sentence. The 
positional encoding is added to the input embeddings and is defined as 
follows: 

PE(pos, 2i) = sin

)

(

pos
100002i/dmodel

PE(pos, 2i + 1) = cos

)

(

pos
100002i/dmodel

(7) 

In these equations, pos is the position and i is the dimension. Each 
dimension of the positional encoding corresponds to a sinusoid, which 
helps  the  model  determine  the  position  or  order  of  the  tokens  in  the 
input sequence.

Helpful Answer:

Unfortunately, based on the given information, there isn't any explicit mention of how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, whether through methods like grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, or others. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the method used for hyperparameter optimization in this particular scenario.
