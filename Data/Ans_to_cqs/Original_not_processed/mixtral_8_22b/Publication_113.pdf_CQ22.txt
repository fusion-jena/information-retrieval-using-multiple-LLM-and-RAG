Helpful Answer:
Answer: The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics, including Top-1 Accuracy, Top-5 Precision, Recall, and ±1 Bin. These metrics can be found in Table 1 of the given context, which presents the confusion table of running a pre-trained object detection model on the Snapshot Serengeti dataset. Specifically, the Top-1 Accuracy measures the percentage of correct predictions made by the model when considering only the top predicted class. On the other hand, Top-5 Precision calculates the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made by the model within the top five classes. Recall, also known as sensitivity or true positive rate, determines the ratio of correctly identified positive instances out of all actual positives. Lastly, ±1 Bin refers to the binomial confidence interval, which provides a range of possible values for the true population parameter based on the observed sample data.
