The first step is to express raw data to functions using

where b1(t), ….., bP(t) represents the collection of first P basis functions 
(Fourier, Spline, etc). 

Let us recall some FDA notions useful for PCA. The empirical func-

2.2.1. Aggregated data modeling 

To compare with the benchmark work Diogoul et al. (2020), we first 
modeled the layer descriptors by the environmental data, aggregating 
them through the mean. The aggregated variables are:

%Query
Query: "Which hardware resources are used for training the deep learning model (e.g., GPUs, TPUs)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models mentioned in this study. Therefore, it cannot be determined which hardware resources were used for training the deep learning models, such as GPUs or TPUs.
