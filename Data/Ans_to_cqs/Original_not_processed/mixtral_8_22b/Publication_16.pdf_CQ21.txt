Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

The results presented in this section were obtained over 100 
epochs. Figure 9 shows the loss of the model using both the 
test  and  validation  data  during  model  training.  The  figure 
shows  that  there  was  no  overfitting  during  training  and  that 
the dropout layers helped with model regularisation. Although 
model convergence was achieved early in the training session 
the loss shows continuing decreases throughout the specified 
epochs.

Table 1 shows the performance metrics obtained using the 
test data. The best performing class was the Eurasian Collard 
Dove achieving a Sensitivity of 0.86 and a Specificity of 0.90. 
The  worst  performing  class  was 
the  Lesser  Spotted 
Woodpecker  where  the  model  attained  a  Sensitivity  of  0.58 
and a Specificity of 0.91.

The  acquired  audio  files  are  transmitted  over  4G  using 
SMTP. The audio file is segmented into 15 second windows. 
Each of the sample windows are passed to the feature extractor 
function where MFCC is used to return the extracted features 
for the classifier. The predicted vector is processed and logged 
to the site for review.

EVALUATION AND DISCUSSION 

In this section the classification results are presented using 
the  evaluation  metrics  outlined  previously.  The  deployment 
and inferencing of the trained model in test environment are 
also presented to ascertain the effectiveness of the end-to-end 
pipeline.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

In  this  section  the  dataset  used  in  the  study  is  presented 
along with the modelling approach taken and the evaluation 
metrics used to evaluate the trained model. The section also 
discusses data pre-processing using the Librosa library. Keras 
and TensorFlow 2.2 are utilised as the backend and an Nvidia 
2070 super GPU with 8GB of memory is utilised to accelerate 
model training. In addition, the proposed inferencing pipeline 
is discussed along with the associated technologies.

Figure 9. Train and Validation Loss 

The model achieved an accuracy of 0.83 for the train split 
and 0.74 for the test split. Figure 10 shows the accuracy for 
both the train and validation data over 100 epochs. The results 
illustrate that the accuracy of the model flattens towards the 
end  of  the  training  session  and  shows  that  the  necessary 
number  of  epochs  required  for  model  convergence  is 
sufficient.  Increasing  the  number  of  epochs  would  achieve 
minimal gains in accuracy and would likely lead to overfitting.

Each  of  the  8  classifications  returned  the  prediction  of 
Common Wood Pigeon with an average confidence value of 
0.71. The results from model inference match that of model 
training.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: After the model training, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the project or task. Based on the given context, it appears that the following postprocessing steps have been carried out:

1. Model Evaluation: The model has been evaluated using various performance metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. These metrics help assess the overall performance of the model and its ability to correctly identify different bird species based on their calls.

2. Deployment and Inferencing: The trained model has been deployed in a test environment to evaluate its real-world performance. This involves passing new audio samples through the model and obtaining predictions. In this case, the model was able to accurately predict the Common Wood Pigeon with high confidence.

3. Logging Predictions: The predicted vectors generated by the model have been logged to a website for further analysis and review. This allows researchers to monitor the model's performance over time and make any necessary adjustments.

While not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, other common postprocessing techniques include generating saliency maps, calculating confusion matrices, and visualizing model weights. However, these methods may not always be relevant or applicable depending on the nature of the problem being addressed.
