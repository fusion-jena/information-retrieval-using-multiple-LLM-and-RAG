3.2. Fuel model retrieval 

Once the DL model is trained, a few samples of real MS point clouds 
are segmented using the methodology exposed in Section 2.3 to create a 
ground truth. This ground truth was required to validate the classifica-
tions using a DL model trained with synthetic data. As mentioned in the 
previous section, the best classification performance of the SoftGroup 
semantic branch was achieved by the MS input data case; therefore, this 
pretrained  model was  used,  and  its  efficiency was  tested  by  inferring 
these real MS point clouds (Fig. 9). In addition, these inferences on real 
MS point clouds are taken as inputs for the decision tree scheme pre-
sented in Section 2.5, where the final fuel models are retrieved. The final 
fuel model classifications are summarised in Table 3. 

4. Discussion

Regardless of the model type employed for semantic classification, 
training  a  DNN  model  from  scratch  requires  a  substantial  number  of 
training samples to grasp a diverse range of features. The lack of liter-
ature on semantic classifications of real LiDAR point clouds being pre-
trained  with  synthetic  data  emphasises  the  importance  of  integrating 
augmented  data  simulations  during  the  training  phase  of  DL  models. 
Data augmentation addresses the requirement for large training datasets 
in DNNs, which can be achieved using an external simulator. Current 
research  on  LiDAR  point-cloud  simulations  predominantly  embraces 
two perspectives: aerial and terrestrial, specifically ALS, Terrestrial, and 
Mobile Laser Scanning (TLS and MLS, respectively) point clouds.

The NN takes a collection of N points as input, where each point is 
represented  by  its  coordinates  and  two  spectral  reflectance  values  at 
distinct wavelengths, and outputs a vector with the indices of each point 
in  the  collection  and  another  vector  with  their  semantic  scores.  To 
facilitate  further  processing,  the  point  set  underwent  voxelisation, 
transforming the points into sparse volumetric grids. These grids serve 
as the input for a U-Net-style backbone, enabling the extraction of point 
features.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no information about the specific data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions that the best classification performance of the SoftGroup semantic branch was achieved by the Multispectral (MS) input data case, but it does not provide any details regarding the storage or sharing of the dataset or the deep learning pipeline itself. Therefore, without additional context, it is impossible to determine the exact data repository link of the deep learning pipeline.
