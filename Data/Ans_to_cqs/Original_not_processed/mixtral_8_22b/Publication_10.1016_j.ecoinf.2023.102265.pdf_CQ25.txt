easy to train with reduced complexity, even though they have deeper 
layers than CNN models, because of the presence of skip connections 
between the input and output of each block (He et al., 2016). ResNet has 
different variants with a variety of convolution layers. We trialled three 
depths, ResNet-18, (cid:0) 50 and (cid:0) 101, and compared their training times 
and validation accuracies. They behaved similarly but ResNet-50 had a 
marginally  higher  validation  accuracy  (Section  3.1.1)  leading  us  to 
choose it for feature extraction.

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in this study is not explicitly stated; however, based on the given information, we can infer that the primary goal is image classification. Specifically, the authors use ResNet-50, a popular deep learning architecture known for its effectiveness in image recognition tasks. The model generates a 1000-dimensional feature vector, which is then utilized to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. This SVM classifier is employed to categorize insect image backgrounds into two distinct classes. Therefore, the overall objective of this deep learning approach appears to be the accurate classification of insect images based on their respective backgrounds.
