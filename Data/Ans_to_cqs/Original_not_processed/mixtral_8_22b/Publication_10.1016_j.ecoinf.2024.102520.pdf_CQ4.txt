reprocessed in order to perform de-clouding, mosaicking and cropping. 
All N characteristic bands were retrieved by analyzing the raw reflec-
tivity [1/R, log(1/R), 1/log R].

The Landsat 8 OLI and TIRS bands (Band 4, 3, and 2) of 30-m reso-
lution and remote sensing image data from Google Earth Engine (GEE), 
which  was accessed on April 21,  2023, were used in this study. Geo-
metric, radiometric and image mosaicking, and cropping are all aspects 
considered  in  the  remote  sensing  image  pre-processing.  The  slope, 
aspect, drainage, and parent material of the topographic variables from 
DEM  were  calculated  using  the  System  for  Automated  Geoscientific 
Analysis (SAGA) GIS. After image processing, the original image's Digital 
Number (Fortuna et al., 2022) provided the measured Surface Reflec-
tance (SR). The TOA and SR picture sets from Google Earth Engine (GEE) 
helped to speed up data processing. The function ee. Image Collection in 
image  preprocessing  used  the  Landsat  8  SR  images  (High  resolution 
satellite  L2)  from  the  GEE  platform.  Only  the  chosen  photos  were

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, or scaling being applied in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss various stages of image processing including geometric, radiometric, mosaicking, and cropping. These processes could potentially be considered as forms of data augmentation depending on their implementation. For instance, geometric transformations like rotation and scaling can be part of geometric correction, while radiometric corrections might involve adjustments similar to brightness changes in flipping operations. Nevertheless, without further details about the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the query, it is not possible to provide a definitive list of data augmentation techniques applied in this case.
