We  also  consider  Params  and  FLOPs  to  evaluate  the  model.  The 
“Params”  metric  in  a  neural  network  model  refers  to  the  number  of 
learned variables used for making predictions. It is an essential metric 
for  evaluating  the  model's  complexity  and  computational  efficiency. 
Models  with  more  parameters  generally  require  more  resources  for

The  training  set,  comprising  the  majority  of  the  data  (82%),  con-
taining 4000 images, is used to train the model and adjust its parame-
ters, allowing it to learn from a diverse range of examples and patterns in 
the data. The validation set (13%), consisting of 607 images, is utilized 
during  training  to  fine-tune  hyperparameters  and  assess  the  model's 
performance on unseen data, helping to prevent overfitting and ensuring 
generalization. Lastly, the testing set (5%), which included 260 images, 
serves  as  an  independent  evaluation  of  the  model's  performance  on 
completely unseen data, providing a reliable measure of its real-world 
effectiveness and ability to generalize. 

2.3. Performance evaluation 

To evaluate the ablated model results, we use five metrics, namely 
Precision (Eq. (1)), Recall (Eq. (2)), mAP0.5 and mAP0.5:0.95, related to 
Eq. (3), Params(M), Flops(G), Inference(ms) and Time(h).

During  the  preprocessing  phase,  techniques  like  auto-orientation, 
resizing,  tiling,  and  filtering  were  utilized  to  standardize  and  enrich 
the dataset. These steps ensured that the images were consistently ori-
ented,  had  a  uniform  size  of  640  × 640  pixels,  and  contained  a  sub-
stantial  amount  of  annotated  data,  meeting  the  90%  annotation 

threshold. Augmentation played a crucial role in further diversifying the 
dataset. By introducing random saturation adjustments to each training 
example, the number of outputs per example was increased to two. This

It is worth noting, however, that increasing the network depth also 
comes with some potential downsides, such as increased computational 
complexity and a greater risk of overfitting the model to the training 
data. So, adding the P2 layer to the YOLOv8 architecture is a tradeoff 
that needs to be carefully balanced with other considerations, such as 
model size and performance requirements. In this sense, we proposed in 
this work a modification in the C2f layer due to its importance in the 
general architecture of YOLOv8, in the sense of making it lighter and 
counterbalancing  the  increase  obtained  with  the  addition  of  the  P2 
feature level layer. In our work, we call this new layer C2f2.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were implemented during the development process. Firstly, a diverse dataset was curated, containing 4000 images in the training set, which allowed the model to learn from various examples and patterns. Secondly, stratified splitting was employed to divide the dataset into three distinct sets: training, validation, and testing. The training set constituted the majority of the data (82%) and was used to train the model and adjust its parameters. The validation set (13%) was utilized during training to fine-tune hyperparameters and assess the model's performance on unseen data, preventing overfitting and promoting generalization. Finally, the testing set (5%) served as an independent evaluation of the model's performance on completely unseen data, offering a reliable measure of its real-world effectiveness and ability to generalize. Additionally, during the preprocessing phase, techniques such as auto-orientation, resizing, tiling, and filtering were applied to standardize and enrich the dataset. Images were consistently oriented, had a uniform size of 640 x 640 pixels, and met the 90% annotation threshold. Furthermore, augmentation strategies, including random saturation adjustments, contributed to a more comprehensive and robust training dataset by introducing variations in color intensity and increasing the number of outputs per example to two.
