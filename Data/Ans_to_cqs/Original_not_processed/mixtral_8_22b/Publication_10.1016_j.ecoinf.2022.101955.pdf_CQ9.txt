remote sensing data. Prominent examples include: k-Nearest Neighbors 
(kNN) (Samaniego and Schulz, 2009; Thakur and Panse, 2022; Zerrouki 
et al., 2019); Support Vector Machines (SVM) (Adam et al., 2014; Car-
doso-Fernandes et al., 2020; Gong et al., 2013; Paneque-Ga’lvez et al., 
2013; Thakur and Panse, 2022; Zerrouki et al., 2019); Artificial Neural 
Networks (ANN) (Megahed et al., 2015; Pacheco and Hewitt, 2014; Silva

2014; Gong et al., 2013; Thakur and Panse, 2022; Zerrouki et al., 2019); 
the Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC) (Guermazi et al., 2016); 
and  Decision  Trees  (DT)  (Teodoro,  2015;  Thakur  and  Panse,  2022; 
T¨orm¨a,  2013).  These  algorithms  combine  computer  science  and  data 
mining to solve classification, clustering, regression and other pattern 
recognition problems (Cracknell and Reading, 2014; Hastie et al., 2009).

We used three steps for image classification: 1) the establishment of 
training  datasets,  2)  classification,  and  3)  accuracy  assessment.  In 
generating training datasets, we first identified eight LULC classes in our 
study area, including croplands, dense forest, grassland savanna, open 
savanna/barelands, built-up areas, water bodies, wetlands, and woody 
savanna  (see  Table  S2  for a  full  description  of  the  LULC  classes). We 
identified and selected these eight LULC classes to be consistent with the 
land  cover  types  used  by  Moderate  Resolution  Imaging  Spectroradi-
ometer  (MODIS)  Global  Land  Cover  products  for  the  years  2010  and 
2020. These MODIS data are generated by NASA, and mapped at a 500

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any direct reference or link to where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it mentions that supplementary data related to this study can be found online at <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2022.101955>. This suggests that the data might be accessible through this DOI link. Unfortunately, without further specific details about the location of the dataset, I cannot determine if it is hosted on platforms such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
