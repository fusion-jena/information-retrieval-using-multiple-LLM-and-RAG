several  times  higher  than  those  of  other  operations  (Li  et  al.,  2018). 
Therefore,  reducing  memory  access  is  the  key  to  further  enhancing 
model  performance.  By  reconfiguring  the  computation  sequence  of 
‘convolutional layer + batch normalisation + activation layer on NVI-
DIA TESLA V100 GPUs, Wang et al. (2019) reduced memory access by 
33%,  22%,  and  31%  for  the  ResNet-50,  Inception  V3,  and  DenseNet 
models,  respectively,  leading  to  increases  in  the  computational  effi-
ciency  of  20.5%,  18.5%,  and  18.1%.  Lowering  the  memory  access  in 
models can accelerate operations across the three main layers of CNNs, 
thus fully harnessing the model's strengths and more effectively utilising 
the computational resources provided by the embedded devices (Gilan 
et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2015). Therefore, by reducing the number of 
layers  in  the  network  model,  the  number  of  convolutions  and  data

(n), small (s), medium (m), large (l), and extra-large (x). These scales 
meet the requirements of various scenarios and tasks. As scale increases, 
so does the network depth and width of the model; therefore, ‘n’  rep-
resents the smallest and fastest scale, whereas ‘x’ is the largest and offers 
the  highest  accuracy.  Although  the  accuracy  improves  as  the  model 
depth increases, this also leads to changes in the number of parameters, 
amount  of  computation,  and  detection  speed,  with  correspondingly 
higher demands on the hardware configuration. To delve deeper into the 
underlying causes of enhancing model lightweight and inference speed, 
we utilised LigObNet, YOLOv5, YOLOv6, YOLOv7, and YOLOv8 to train 
across  four  scales:  n,  s,  m,  and  l.  As  Fig.  9  illustrates,  reducing  the 
number  of  parameters  in  the  various  models  does  not  enhance  the 
processing speed. The total parameter count, representing the combined

targeted fish species dataset. This dataset was then divided into training 
and validation sets in an 8:2 ratio using a random selection process.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about which specific cloud platform or service was used to deploy the deep learning model. However, it mentions that TensorRT was used for deployment, which is a platform for high-performance deep learning inference developed by NVIDIA. It optimizes the runtime and memory usage of deep learning models, allowing them to run efficiently on NVIDIA GPUs. Based on this information, we can infer that the deep learning model might have been deployed on a platform that supports NVIDIA GPUs, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instances with GPU support, Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines with GPU capabilities, or Google Cloud Platform Compute Engine instances with GPUs. But without explicit mention of the exact platform, we cannot definitively determine which one was used.
