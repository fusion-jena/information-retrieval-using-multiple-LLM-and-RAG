2.4. Network setup for investigations 

For extracting plant species cover information for our investigations, 
we  use  the  same  setup  as  described  in  K¨orschens  et  al.  (2021b)  with 
slight differences. During all three phases, we use a ResNet50 (He et al., 
2016),  which  is  initialized  with  ImageNet  (Russakovsky  et  al.,  2015) 
weights from Keras (Chollet et al., 2015) before phase 1 and phase 2, as 
well as the AdamW optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014; Loshchilov and 
Hutter, 2017). During each phase, we use the ResNet in conjunction with 
a  Feature  Pyramid  Network  (FPN)  (Lin  et  al.,  2017)  to  increase  the 
network output resolution. Phase-specific parameters are listed in the

%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide any specific details about the deployment platform used for the deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to accurately determine whether platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud were utilized.
