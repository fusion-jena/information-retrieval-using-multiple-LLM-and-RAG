2.7. Accuracy Assessment

The quantity of training data derived from ground data collection in 2018 was limited.
A U-Net implemented with Keras produced a low training and testing accuracy with
segmentation results on testing data differing between repetitions. Implementing a U-Net
model within the arcgis.learn module of the ArcGIS API for Python [39] removed the
requirement for a quantitatively massive dataset. Additionally, the U-Net implemented
through argis.learn is pretrained on ImageNet to further improve classiﬁcation accuracies.
This reduces the time and resources spent on ground truth data collection. Hyperparameter
tuning was done to select the best U-Net model [31,34,40]. Based on hyperparameter
optimization, it was found that the best model uses an input patch size of 64 × 64 pixels
and a ResNet-50 backbone [31,34,40].

2.4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

the U-Net model is the labeling of each pixel in the training data. Abundant data are needed
for training deep neural networks of at least 1000 image samples. In such cases, a pretrained
network can reduce the amount of training data needed [47]. The U-Net implemented
within arcgis.learn had a ResNet-50 backbone that was pretrained on ImageNet.

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, two regularization methods have been mentioned to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. These methods are Dropout and Batch Normalization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training. This means that their contribution to the activation of downstream neurons is temporally removed on the forward pass and any weight updates are not applied to the neuron on the backward pass. This has the effect of making the training process noisy, forcing nodes within a layer to probabilistically take on more or less responsibility for the inputs. It reduces overfitting by providing a way of automatically and adaptively regularizing neural networks.

Batch Normalization is another method used to prevent overfitting. It involves standardizing the inputs in every mini-batch to have zero mean and unit variance. This helps to stabilize the learning process and dramatically reduces the number of training epochs required to train deep networks. It also acts as a form of regularization, implicitly encouraging the network to spread out the learned weights over all the inputs, rather than depending too much on individual features.

These techniques help to ensure that the model does not become too complex and learn the noise in the training data, which would lead to poor performance when tested on unseen data. They contribute to improving the model's ability to generalize well to new, unseen data.
