Maine, USA (January–September 2022) using three tagging methods (one with ML bounding box assistance and 
two  without  assistance).  We  used  a  generalized  linear  mixed  model  to  examine  the  influence  of  ML  model 
performance  and  tagging  method  on  tagging  efficiency.  We  found  that  ML  bounding  boxes  offer  significant 
improvement in tagging efficiency when labelling data compared to unassisted tagging. Additionally, the time 
taken to label with bounding boxes was not statistically different from an unassisted tagging approach. However, 
we  found  that  gains  in  efficiency  are  contingent  on  the  ML  algorithm’s  performance  and  that  incorrect  ML 
predictions, particularly the 4.2% false positive and 3.6% false negative predictions, can slow the tagging process 
compared to a non-hybrid approach. These findings indicate that although practitioners usually forgo the pro-

Helpful Answer:
After the model training, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the project or study. Some common postprocessing steps include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, and creating confusion matrices.

Saliency maps are visualizations that highlight the regions of input images that contribute most significantly to the output prediction made by the machine learning (ML) model. They help identify which parts of the image were important for making the decision, providing insights into how the model is working.

Calculating metrics involves evaluating the performance of the trained ML model based on various criteria such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc. This step helps assess the effectiveness of the model in handling new, unseen data.

A confusion matrix is another useful tool for understanding the performance of the ML model. It provides a summary of prediction results on a dataset, displaying the number of correct and incorrect classifications made by the model. The confusion matrix includes four categories: True Positives (TP), False Positives (FP), True Negatives (TN), and False Negatives (FN). By analyzing these values, one can determine the strengths and weaknesses of the model and further improve its performance if necessary.

In this particular case, the researchers conducted an experiment to measure tagging efficiency using an ML bounding box model. To analyze their results, they created a confusion matrix (Figure 3) to show the percentages of TP, FP, FN, and TN classification outcomes observed during the experiment. Furthermore, they employed a generalized linear mixed model to investigate the impact of ML model performance and tagging method on tagging efficiency. Their analysis revealed that ML bounding boxes significantly improved tagging efficiency compared to unassisted tagging, but also highlighted that incorrect ML predictions could hinder the tagging process.
