3.2.2. Retrieval results 

The retrieval experiments ensued the following strategy: every image 
is used as a query image and is matched with every remaining image in 
the database. Tables 6 and 7 present the retrieval performances of all the 
networks in terms of the four considered measures by choosing the top 
100 matches, i.e. η = 100, and the two chosen similarity distances. 

3.3. Deep learning vs traditional machine learning comparison 

A comparison of deep learning approaches with traditional machine

Our study was mainly to propose a new model based on CNN, which 
provides an efficient and effective approach for single seed classification 
and retrieval. Our network architecture, SeedNet, contains six learnable 
layers, 5 of which are convolutional, and the last is fully-connected. The 
ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation is applied to the output of every 
convolutional  layer.  Moreover,  we  periodically  insert  a  pooling  layer 
between successive convolutional layers, in order to reduce the amount 
of parameters and computation in the network, and hence to also control 
overfitting. More precisely, we employ a Max pooling strategy with a 
3 × 3 filter size, and 1 × 1 stride. The input image size is 224 × 224 × 3. 
According to the chosen dataset, the output of the last fully-connected 
layer  is  fed  to  a  N-way  softmax,  which  produces  a  distribution  over 
the N class labels to predict, i.e. 6 for the Canadian and 23 for the local

As expected for the retrieval task performed with deep features, the 
similarity  measure  influences  the  retrieval  performances,  and  for  our 
problem, the best one seems to be the Euclidean distance (See Table 6 
and 7). Even a little less effective than for classification, the results can 
be considered satisfying and confirm the potential use of deep learning 
techniques for retrieval tasks. Overall, our proposed model turns out to 
be the most performing among the considered networks.

retrieval measurements. 

To  sum  up,  SeedNet  seems  robust  for  both  tasks,  reaching 
outstanding performance results with both datasets and having a low 
training time if compared to the  other examined networks. However, 
other CNNs obtained satisfactory results, like the Residual Networks (e. 
g. ResNet18) in both tasks, or SqueezeNet in the retrieval one. The CNNs 
are also generally preferable in performances with respect to the tradi-
tional  methods,  even  though  the  last  ones  reached  interesting  results 
with low training times.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into sets such as train, test, and validation. Generally, the data is divided into these subsets using various strategies, including random sampling, stratified sampling, or temporal splitting. Random sampling involves randomly selecting instances from the entire dataset to form each subset. Stratified sampling ensures that each subset maintains the same proportions of classes as the original dataset. Temporal splitting separates the data based on timestamps, where earlier data is used for training and later data for testing and validation. However, without explicit details regarding the data splitting methodology employed in this particular case, it cannot be determined which criterion was utilized.
