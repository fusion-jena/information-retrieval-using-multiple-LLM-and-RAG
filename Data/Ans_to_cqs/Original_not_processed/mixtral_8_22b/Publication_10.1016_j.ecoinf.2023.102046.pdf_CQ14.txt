training set. For SVC, we explored a C value in the interval [0.001, 1] 
(see Fig. C.2 in the Appendix C. Based on that result, the hyperparameter 
value chosen was C = 0.1. For ridge regression, we explored α values in 
the interval [0.1, 19.6] and concluded that the performance of the model 
is robust to the choice of the hyperparameter when it ranges from 5 to 15 
(see Fig. C.1 in the Appendix C). Based on that result we chose to use α =
6.0 for our experiments.

Appendix C. Hyperparameter search 

We  performed  hyperparameter  search  for  our  classification  and  regression  model  to  identify  the  right  level  of  regularization.  For  the  linear 
regression model, we considered values of α  that determine the L2 regularization to be in the range {0.1, 0.6, 1.1, …, 19.1, 19.6}. The resulting 
accuracy of the model is shown in Fig. C.1. We observe that the model shows stable performance for α values in the interval [5.0, 15.0]. For the

Helpful Answer:
The authors performed a hyperparameter search for their classification and regression models to find the appropriate level of regularization. They did this by considering various values for the parameters and observing how they affected the accuracy of the models. Specifically, for the linear regression model, they looked at values of alpha (which determines the L2 regularization) ranging from 0.1 to 19.6 with increments of 0.5. They then evaluated the accuracy of the model based on these values and observed that the model showed stable performance for alpha values between 5.0 and 15.0. Similarly, for the classification model, they considered values of C (the regularization parameter) ranging from 0.001 to 1.001 with increments of 0.005. Again, they evaluated the accuracy of the model based on these values and determined that the optimal values for alpha and C were 0.1 and 0.1 respectively. It appears that the authors used a form of grid search or manual search to optimize the hyperparameters of their models. However, the exact method used is not explicitly stated in the given information.
