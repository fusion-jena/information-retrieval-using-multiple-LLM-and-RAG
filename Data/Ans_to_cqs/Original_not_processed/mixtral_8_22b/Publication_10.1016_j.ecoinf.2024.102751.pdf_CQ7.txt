Therefore, it seems reasonable to test in the future more advanced
methods of data analysis for estimating soil moisture at the spoil heap. It
would be worthwhile in this context to test various methods of machine
learning or deep neural networks, which would perhaps allow to in-
crease the accuracy of prediction.

5. Conclusion

The study explored development spatial modeling for estimating
VWC on reclaimed spoil heap. This model is an integration of remote
sensing data (PlanetScope satellite imagery) and topographic indices.
The key findings include:

2.3. ALS data

ALS point clouds were downloaded through the official website of
the General Office of Geodesy and Cartography (GUGiK), the Geoportal
for Spatial Information Infrastructure (https://www.geoportal.gov.pl;
Table 1). The portal provides free spatial data. Geoportal complies with
the INSPIRE Directive, an initiative to make spatial data available in
Europe, which aims to create a harmonized spatial information system
in the European Union (Directive 2007/2/EC 2007). The parameters of
ALS data are shown in Table 1.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough context provided to determine the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation) in this case. However, common practices for splitting datasets in machine learning applications often involve using a random stratified sampling method to maintain class balance between different subsets. Typically, the dataset is divided into three parts: training set (used to fit the model), validation set (used to tune hyperparameters during model selection), and testing set (used to evaluate the final performance of the selected model). Common ratios for these splits can vary but are often around 60%, 20%, and 20%, respectively.
