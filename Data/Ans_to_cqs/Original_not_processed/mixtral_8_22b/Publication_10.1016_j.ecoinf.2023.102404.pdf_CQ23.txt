reproducibility, and we evaluated multiple seeds to select the one that 
provides  the  most  stable  and  reliable  results.  To  carry  out  the  grid 
search, we defined a range of potential values for each parameter based 
on  prior  knowledge  and  literature  review.  The  grid  search  then 
exhaustively tested all possible combinations of these values and eval-
uated the model’s  performance using cross-validation techniques. For 
each  combination,  we  utilized  the  RMSE  as  the  evaluation  metric, 
aiming to minimize the RMSE to achieve the most accurate predictions. 
By employing the grid search method, we aimed to optimize the model’s 
hyperparameters and enhance its ability to generalize well to new, un-
seen data, making it a robust and effective tool for our regression task.

parameters of our machine learning model. Specifically, we focused on 
tuning  several  critical  parameters,  namely  ‘numberOfTrees’,  ‘min-
LeafPopulation’, ‘bagFraction’, and ‘seed’. The ‘numberOfTrees’ repre-
sents the number of decision trees in the ensemble, and through the grid 
search, we explored different values to determine the ideal number of 
trees  that  balances  model  complexity  and  predictive  performance. 
Similarly, ‘minLeafPopulation’  refers to the minimum number of sam-
ples required to form a leaf node in each tree. We experimented with 
various values to find the optimal setting that prevents overfitting while 
capturing meaningful patterns in the data. The ‘bagFraction’  indicates 
the proportion of the training dataset used to train each individual tree, 
and  we  searched  for  the  best  value  to  enhance  model  diversity  and 
generalization. Lastly, ‘seed’  is a random number seed used to ensure

(Hudak et al., 2020). This strategic sampling technique was chosen to 
capture  the  full  distribution  of  AGB  values  within  the  LiDAR-derived 
AGB  maps  accurately.  This  stratified  random  sampling  approach  was 
chosen to ensure that the training/testing dataset accurately represented 
the distribution of AGB values within the LiDAR-derived AGB maps. The 
use of this approach was crucial in ensuring that the AGB maps gener-
ated were accurate and representative of the distribution of AGB values 
in the study area.

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model, the authors employed various strategies. Firstly, they conducted a grid search to tune the hyperparameters of their model. This involved defining a range of potential values for each parameter based on prior knowledge and literature review, and exhaustively testing all possible combinations of these values. They used the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as the evaluation metric, aiming to minimize it to achieve the most accurate predictions. Through this process, they determined the optimal values for 'numberOfTrees','minLeafPopulation', 'bagFraction', and'seed'.

Secondly, they used a stratified random sampling approach to create their training and testing datasets. This involved randomly selecting half of the pixels for the training and testing split. However, unlike simple random sampling, stratified random sampling ensured that the training/testing dataset accurately represented the distribution of Above Ground Biomass (AGB) values within the LiDAR-derived AGB maps. This strategy was crucial in ensuring that the generated AGB maps were accurate and representative of the distribution of AGB values in the study area.

Lastly, they used cross-validation techniques during the grid search to evaluate the model's performance. Cross-validation involves dividing the original sample into a training set to train the model, and a validation set to validate the model. This helps prevent overfitting and ensures that the model can generalize well to new, unseen data.

In summary, the authors took several measures to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model. These included conducting a grid search to tune the model's hyperparameters, using a stratified random sampling approach to create diverse training and testing datasets, and employing cross-validation techniques during the grid search.
