2.4. Data pre-processing 

2.2. Convolutional neural networks 

The  idea  behind  convolutional  neural  networks  (CNNs)  was  first 

As mentioned in the previous sections, the data is first split up into 
several  larger  blocks,  depending  on  coordinates,  with  the  purpose  to 
cross validate the model. These blocks are then split into many smaller 
areas of 80 × 80 pixels, due to limitations in the available amount of

overfitting. These samples are selected randomly from all areas that are 
used in the training set, and are never used to fit the model. The model is 
trained for 150 epochs and with a batch size of 128. Dropout (Srivastava 
et al., 2014) with a rate of 0.3 is used during the training to make it more 
stable. Furthermore, ADAM optimisation (Kingma and Ba, 2014) with a 
learning  rate  of  0.0001  is  used  to  find  optimal  weights  in  the  neural 
network in order to minimise the cross entropy loss between the net-
work’s predictions and the pre-labelled data.

Since the collection and annotation of data for the training of models, 
as  the  one  in  this  paper,  is  a  labour-intensive  process,  it  would  be 
valuable  to  perform  such  profound  investigations  and  quantify  the 
amount of data that may be needed. Another way forward, which avoids 
the labour intense labelling, would be to look for already annotated data 
that have been used for other purposes and then use that data to build AI 
models. One technique, which needs to be further investigated, in order 
to facilitate the collected data better, is to generate additional synthet-
ical  samples  from the  annotated  dataset, using  generative  adversarial 
models,  such  as  in  the  presented  work  by  Fang  et  al.  (2019)  and  Li 
(2019). In such approaches, several new samples are created in a real-
istic  way,  adding  more  variation  and  more  samples  to  the  original 
dataset. Hence, a small dataset can be extended with samples that are

A 10-fold cross validation is performed in order for the result to be 
generalizable for the remaining maps, to which the CNN is also applied. 
To create the 10 different sets for the cross validation, we split the map 
by placing a 3 × 3 grid over the map. The region that is studies is not 
shaped  as  a  square,  and  the  central  cell  contains  more  area  than  the 
other 8. This cell is, therefore, split into two cells making it 10 sets in 
total. The division of the different sets are shown in Fig. 2. During the 
training of the CNN 9 of these sets are used for the training and the final 
one is used for evaluation. A challenge to the CNN is that the terrain 
differs in the different areas, as well as the style of the maps, and thus 
splitting the dataset in this way would give a good hint on the capability 
of  the  CNN  to  generalise.  Among  the  samples  that  are  used  for  the 
training  20%  is  used  as  a  validation  set  to  prevent  the  method  from

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly state the specific task or purpose of the deep learning model being trained. However, based on the information given about the model architecture and training process, it appears that the model is likely being used for image classification tasks. Specifically, the model uses a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is commonly used for image recognition and classification tasks. Additionally, the model is trained using a cross-entropy loss function, which is often used for multi-class classification problems. Therefore, it can be inferred that the purpose of the deep learning model is to classify images into multiple categories.
