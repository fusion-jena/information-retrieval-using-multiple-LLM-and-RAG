ture dataset from Lake Victoria. Sierra et al. (2017) investigated FDA 
methods to examine particle-size distributions in a beach/shallow ma-
rine  sedimentary  environment in  Gij´on  Bay (NW Spain). Acar-Denizli 
et  al.  (2018)  applied  a  functional  linear  regression  model  to  remote 
sensing data, enabling them to predict total suspended solids concen-
tration in the coastal zone of the Guadalquivir estuary. Tarro-Saavedra 
et al. (2020) classified the seabed in coastal environments by employing 
FDA approaches on acoustic curves. Godard (2021) employed FDA to 
study  high-frequency  physical,  biological,  and  behavioral  data  from 
electronic recorders deployed on marine predators, particularly south-
ern elephant seals. Nonparametric functional spatial regression has been 
explored for mapping the presence of demersal coastal fish from Senegal 
in studies by Ndiaye et al. (2022, 2020). Yarger et al. (2022) utilized a

Our  research  strongly  advocates  for  FDA  as  a  powerful  tool  for 
unraveling ecological intricacies and promoting sustainable practices in 
marine conservation efforts and beyond. By embracing innovative sta-
tistical  methodologies,  we  can  better  address  pressing  environmental 
challenges  and  safeguard  the  biodiversity  and  health  of  our  planet's 
marine resources.

%Query
Query: "Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not mention any specific details about a deep learning pipeline or its corresponding code repository. Therefore, it is impossible to determine where the code repository of such a deep learning pipeline might be available, whether it be on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or elsewhere.
