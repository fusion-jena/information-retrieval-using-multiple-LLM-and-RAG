Some model parameters were modified from the default configura-
tion to balance use of resources and training speed. We retained a res-
olution of 704 × 704, batch size 64, 32 subdivisions and trained up to 
6000 iterations. Other parameters were kept to default or set according 
to guidance by the developers (https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet). 
Manual annotations were used to generate training, validation and 
testing  datasets.  Biigle  annotations  (label  name,  centre  x,  center  y,

2.5. Model selection 

CNNs are sensitive to overfitting (Domingos, 2012). Throughout the 
training process, the algorithm goes through cycles of training on the 
training set - evaluating performance on the validation set – adjusting 
CNN node weights – before repeating the entire cycle. These cycles are 
referred to as epochs or iterations when the training dataset is too large 
to  be  processed  in  one  stroke  and  needs  to  be  subdivided  in  several 
smaller batches as is the case in this study. There is an optimum number 
of iterations before the performance on the validation and training sets 
(independent data that the CNN has not seen) start to diverge as the CNN 
overfits  and  becomes  more  specialized  at  predicting  the  training  set 
while becoming less able to predict the validation set (generalization).

2.4. Model evaluation 

The testing dataset was composed of 500 manually annotated images 
from  the  same  transect  and  was  only  used  to  calculate  performances 
outside  the  Darknet  framework  by  comparing  CNN  predictions  with 
manual annotations. 

Predictions  come  as  a  .JSON  file  containing  the  coordinate  of  the 
bounding box of each tentative annotation as well as a confidence score 
ranging from 0.05 at minimum (lower confidence scores introduced too 
much  noise  and  therefore  were  not  recorded)  to  1  at  maximum.  Pre-
dictions made on the testing set were compared to the manual annota-
tion of the same images.

Training  the  CNN  took  approximately  18  h  to  complete  the  6000 
iterations. Measuring the accuracy of the different CNNs and the effect of 
different confidence thresholds took several hours but could be further 
automated. Predictions on the 58,148 images took approximately 10 h 
however  the  training  and  predictions  phases  do  not  require  constant 
supervision and can be performed overnight or while the analysist is free 
to attend to other tasks. Finally, the calculation-intensive nature of the 
training, and to a lesser extent, prediction phases makes their duration 
largely  dependent  on  the  hardware  used  and  thus  may  vary  between 
users. Overall, the whole pipeline could be completed within one or two 
weeks (10 days) once the analysists are familiar with it.

Helpful Answer:
The data was split into three distinct datasets: training, validation, and testing. The training dataset was used during the training phase of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), where the network learns to recognize patterns in the input data. The validation dataset was employed to evaluate the performance of the CNN throughout the training process. This allowed for tuning hyperparameters and preventing overfitting, which occurs when the model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data. Lastly, the testing dataset was utilized to assess the final performance of the fully trained CNN using independent data that the model had never encountered before. Manual annotations were generated for all three datasets, ensuring accurate labeling of the input data.
