Over  the  past  few  years,  deep  learning  has  revolutionized  several 
research  fields  such  as  bioinformatics  (Li  et  al.,  2020)  and  medicine 
(Piccialli et al., 2021) by enabling automated processing of large and 
complex  datasets.  Considered  a  branch  of  machine  learning,  deep 
learning refers to algorithms, commonly called deep neural networks, 
able  to  automatically  detect  very  complex  and  highly  discriminating 
patterns  in  data  (Chollet,  2018).  The  succession  of  processing  layers 
performing  linear  and  non-linear  transformations  allows  the  neural 
networks  to  learn  representations  of  data  with  multiple  levels  of 
abstraction  (LeCun  et  al.,  2015).  This  ability  makes  deep  learning 
particularly  relevant  for  solving  complex  problems  such  as  speech 
recognition, object detection, computer vision, and many other domains 
(Taigman et al., 2014; Hinton et al., 2012). Naturally, these practices

Helpful Answer:
The text mentions that the Adam optimizer was used in the deep learning pipeline with a learning rate of 0.0005. The Adam optimizer is a popular choice among practitioners due to its computational efficiency and ease of implementation. It combines the advantages of two other extensions of stochastic gradient descent, namely Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp) and Adaptive Gradient Algorithm (AdaGrad), resulting in an optimization algorithm that can handle sparse gradients and noisy data effectively. Other common optimization techniques include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), which updates model weights iteratively based on the error gradient calculated from a single training example, and RMSProp, which scales the learning rate dynamically based on the average of recent magnitudes of the gradients for each weight. However, it should be noted that the optimal optimization technique may vary depending on the specific problem and dataset being addressed.
