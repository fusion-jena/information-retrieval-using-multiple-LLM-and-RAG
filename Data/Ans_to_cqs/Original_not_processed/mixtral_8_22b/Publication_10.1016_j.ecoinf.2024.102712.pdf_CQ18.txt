3.2. Modelling AGBD using Sentinel-2 data 

We  used  linear  regression  to  model  AGBD  (field  measured)  as  a 
function  of  Sentinel-2  spectral  data  in  both  test  areas.  As  mentioned 
above, the selected model in the Betul area included bands 2, 5 and 6 
(B2, B5 and B6), and had a root mean square error (RMSE) of 11.27 ton/ 
ha  and  an  R2  of  0.90.  Inspections  of  residual  plots  indicate  that  the 
model  is  good  and  the  validation  of  the  model  using  a  leave-one-out 
cross-validation  (LOOCV)  approach  show  an  RMSE  of  13.93  ton/ha, 
an R2 of 0.88, a mean absolute error (MAE) of 10.77 and a bias of (cid:0) 0.28. 
The selected bands B2, B5 and B6 have been successfully used in recent 
studies to estimate forest biomass (Chen et al., 2021; Xi et al., 2022).

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not explicitly mention the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions that inspections of residual plots were conducted to assess the goodness of the model, which suggests that monitoring was done post-training rather than during training. Additionally, the use of a leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) approach indicates that the model's performance was evaluated after its creation. Therefore, while there isn't explicit information on the strategy used to monitor the model performance during training, these details suggest that evaluations occurred after the completion of the training process.
