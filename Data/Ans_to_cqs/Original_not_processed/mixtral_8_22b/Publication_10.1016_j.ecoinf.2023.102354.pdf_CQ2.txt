cific data information is shown in Table 1 and also in Fig. 2. 

3.1. Standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index 

SPEI, a statistically based index that uses basic climatological data, 
was used in this study as a drought indicator. Data was obtained over a 
40-year period (1980–2019) from https://spei.csic.es/database.html to 
establish a base period for natural variability, from which precipitation 
extremes may be elucidated. This SPEI data was utilized as a drought 
marker to reflect the fluctuation in precipitation extremes (dry and wet 
climate)  and  was  derived using  a water  balance framework,  which  is 
based  on  the  difference  between  precipitation  and  potential  evapo-
transpiration. Additional information on the SPEI data is available in the 
literature (Tirivarombo et al., 2018; Vicente-Serrano et al., 2010).

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the study utilizes various climate indices such as SPEI, ENSO, NAO, AMO, PDO, IOD, Niño 1+2, Niño 3.0, Niño 3.4, Niño 4, NTA, STA, and ETA. These indices are typically represented as time series or gridded spatial data. Additionally, the study mentions datasets like TWS, SMS, and GWS, which could potentially be represented as numerical values or gridded spatial data. Therefore, it can be assumed that the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline might include CSV files for time series data and possibly NetCDF or other geospatial file formats for gridded spatial data. Nevertheless, without more specific details regarding the deep learning pipeline, it is impossible to definitively state the exact data formats employed.
