Gallagher, A., Ferretti, F., 2022. Emergent research and priorities for shark and ray

clips (refer to Methods for details). Our training data included 8 shark 
species and 19 non-shark species commonly associated with sharks on 
baited underwater videos to add diversity in the training. After trans-
forming video clips into still images at a rate of 1 frame per second, we 
annotated  sharks  and  the  19  non-shark  species  present  in  the  frames 
with bounding boxes. This resulted in 26,947 fish annotations (Table 1). 
Given  that  the  Faster  RCNN  architecture  automatically  generates 
negative samples (Ren et al., 2015), there was no need to annotate any. 
It  is  known  that  classic  deep  architectures  need  numerous  image 
sample  per  class  to  work  correctly  (Lecun  et  al.,  2015;  Villon  et  al., 
2022). Hence, shark species that were infrequently captured in our clips 
(Carcharhinus  albimarginatus,  Galeocerdo  cuvier,  Nebrius  ferrugineus, 
Negaprion  acutidens)  were  excluded  from  the  testing  phase.  However,

5. Conclusion 

Our  study  proved  the  effectiveness  of  Convolutional  Neural  Net-
works  (CNNs)  in  extracting  ecologically  significant  indicators  from 
Baited Remote Underwater Video Stations (BRUVS). As for now, semi- 
automated methods, as well as automated MeanCount, could be used 
transitionally until fully automated methods accounting for the speci-
ficities of marine ecosystems can provide usable results for ecologists.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The paper does not explicitly mention the specific method or tool used for collecting raw data. However, it mentions that the study uses Baited Remote Underwater Video Stations (BRUVS) to collect data. BRUVS are a type of camera system used to observe marine life remotely without disturbing them. They consist of a baited container attached to a pole or frame, which is then lowered into the water. A camera is mounted on the frame to record the activity around the bait. This method allows researchers to observe marine animals in their natural habitat and gather data on their behavior, distribution, and abundance. It is likely that the raw data used in this study was collected through the use of BRUVS.
