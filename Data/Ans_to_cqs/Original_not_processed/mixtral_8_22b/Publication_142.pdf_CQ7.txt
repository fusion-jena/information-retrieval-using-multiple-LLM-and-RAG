the Pl@ntNet user community (currently 1.8 million user accounts). At the time
of writing, the CNN architecture used is the inception model49 extended with
batch normalization.50 The network is pre-trained on the commonly used Im-
ageNet dataset and ﬁne-tuned on Pl@ntNet data. Pl@ntNet currently covers
30,261 species illustrated by more than 2.9 million images. The taxonomic
coverage of our study is therefore one to three orders of magnitude larger
than previously published studies making use of automated species identiﬁca-
tion for ecological research. The training of Pl@ntNet CNN requires the mobi-
lization of a high-performance computing infrastructure and expertise in deep,
distributed, and large-scale learning. Thus, the resulting classiﬁcation tool is in
itself a major advance in biodiversity data science.

Once data are generated by AI natural-
ists we must consider how they are
shared to ensure recognition of their au-
thors, observation traceability, and long-
term accessibility. We suggest following
the TDWG standards,43 such as Darwin-
Core among others, to ensure the data
are interoperable with other biodiversity datasets and can be
shared via the GBIF portal (www.gbif.org). Metadata accompa-
nying these datasets should include the AI model architecture,
technical speciﬁcities of the AI model training phase, digital ob-
ject identiﬁer of the dataset used to train it, AI model version,
classiﬁcation score of each image, date, location, photograph
name, and image license. Classiﬁcation score, which provides
a mathematical value of the conﬁdence in the prediction of a
model for a speciﬁc image, is particularly important as it can
be used in subsequent analyses to ﬁlter the data by the level
of conﬁdence in the classiﬁcation accuracy. A researcher will

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into sets like train, test, or validation. However, it mentions the importance of considering the distribution of the training data and the potential gap between this and the test data on which the developed algorithms will be evaluated. This suggests that the choice of splitting criteria may depend on factors such as ensuring representative samples across different classes or categories within the data, maintaining similar distributions between training and testing sets, and avoiding overfitting or underfitting during the training process. Common practices for splitting data include random sampling, stratified sampling based on class labels, or using temporal or spatial splits when dealing with sequential or geospatial data.
