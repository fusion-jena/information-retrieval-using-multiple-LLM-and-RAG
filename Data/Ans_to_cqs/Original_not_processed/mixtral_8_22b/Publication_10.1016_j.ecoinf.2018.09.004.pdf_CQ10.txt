(in terms of comparative presence–absence item counts), Accuracy is a
suitable measure for model performance evaluation. Nevertheless, all
applied algorithms are ranked based on the F-measure (from worst to
best), for reasons to be explained in Section 4.1.1 below.

Question: %INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the provided pieces of context to answer the query in less than 400 words. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

%Query
Query: "What is the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The paper does not provide information about the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if there is a publicly accessible code repository link for this project.
