3.2. Data pre-processing 

Data  pre-processing,  a  crucial  step  in  ensuring  the  reliability  and 
integrity of data, involves preparing and cleaning the dataset to enhance 
its  quality  and  completeness.  In  this  study,  we  employed  various 
methods to pre-process the data, making it suitable for analysis. A sig-
nificant aspect of our pre-processing involved data cleansing, where we 
diligently identified and removed any incomplete or inaccurate records 
to ensure the dataset's accuracy.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: In Section 2, we 
present a comprehensive literature survey, exploring related works in 
the field. Section 3 provides detailed insights into our data collection 
process  and  the  classification  mechanism  employed.  Moving  on  to 

Section  4,  we  discuss  the  experimental  results  obtained  from  our 
approach.  Finally,  in  Section  5,  we  draw  conclusions  based  on  the 
findings and contributions of this research. 

2. Literature survey 

In  this  article,  we  look  at  the  current  literature  on  the  topic  of 
aquaculture  water  quality  analysis  utilizing  IoT  and  deep  learning 
methods.  It  discusses  the  benefits  and  disadvantages  of  the  different 
machine learning and deep learning approaches used for data collection 
and analysis, and it emphasizes the significance of precise and timely 
water  quality  monitoring 
for  the  sustainable  development  of 
aquaculture.
