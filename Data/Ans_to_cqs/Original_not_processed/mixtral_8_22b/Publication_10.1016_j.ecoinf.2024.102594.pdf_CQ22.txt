During the DeepLabV3+ model training process, feeding large-size 
images directly to the network may lead to memory overflow. There-
fore, it is necessary to cut all remote sensing images and semantic labels 
of land cover classes into a series of regular image blocks for input. To 
maximize the sample size and maintain consistency with the cropping 
approach in the model prediction stage, we set the cropping size to 32 ×
32  pixels  with  a  redundancy  rate  of  0.5.  In  continuing,  70%  of  the 
dataset  was  used  for  training  and  the  remaining  for  validation.  The 
training set was enhanced by: (i) Flipping the images and labels along 
the X or Y axis; (ii) Exchanging between multiple image channels while 
the  labels remain unchanged; (iii)  Randomly rotating  the images and 
◦
labels by 90
; and (iv) randomly adding noise to the 
images  while  maintaining  the  labels  unchanged  (Ye  et  al.,  2022).

classification  results  of  the  MRS_DeepLabV3+ model  with optimal  SP 
selection  were  superior  to  the  DeepLabV3+ model  with  an  accuracy 
enhancement  of  about  3%  (Table  4).  This  approach  was  capable  of 
solving  the  problem  of  fragmented  spatial  edge  information  often 
encountered when using pixel-based CNNs to extract target categories 
(Liu et al., 2019). Compared to previous studies on the classification of 
wetlands using DeepLabV3+ (Buchsteiner et al., 2023; Gonzalez-Perez 
et al., 2022), the classification results of this study showed a significant 
lack of the salt-and-pepper phenomenon. The MRS_DeepLabV3+ model 
was  not  only  capable  of  correcting  the  misclassifications  made  by 
DeepLabV3+ but also enhancing the delineation of PlatSpe and SurfObj

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention which specific evaluation metrics are used to assess the performance of the deep learning model. However, based on common practices in machine learning and deep learning, some commonly used metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, confusion matrix, ROC curve, AUC, etc. In this case, the text mentions that the MRS\_DeepLabV3+ model achieved an accuracy enhancement of around 3% compared to the DeepLabV3+ model. Therefore, one can infer that accuracy might be one of the evaluation metrics used in this study. Additionally, the text mentions that the MRS\_DeepLabV3+ model was able to solve the problem of fragmented spatial edge information often encountered when using pixel-based CNNs to extract target categories. This suggests that the model's ability to accurately classify different land cover types might have been evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, or F1 score. However, without explicit confirmation from the authors, these assumptions should be taken with caution.
