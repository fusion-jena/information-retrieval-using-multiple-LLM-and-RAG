those conditions (Gutzwiller and Serno, 2023; Muckley et al., 2023). We 
expected that creating a mask to delineate the “area of applicability” for 
the trained model (Meyer and Pebesma, 2021) would successfully filter 
out a significant portion of regions lacking training data, particularly in

To create spatial maps of tsetse relative abundance, we applied the 
trained models to the respective predictor variables used during their 
training,  covering  the  entire  land  area  of  Kenya.  Because  of  the 
geographical  constraints  within  our  training  dataset,  we  utilized  the 
“aoa” (Area of Application) function from the CAST package to demar-
cate areas for which the environmental conditions are sufficiently rep-
resented  by  our  training  data  (Meyer  and  Pebesma,  2021).  The 
delineation of these areas depends on a threshold value that is internally 
calculated  by  measuring  the  dissimilarity  between  the  predictor  vari-
ables  in  the  training data and  those  used in  the  model extrapolation. 
Predictor variables are assigned weights in this dissimilarity measure-
ment according to their significance in explaining the response variable.

%Query
Query: "Which hardware resources are used for training the deep learning model (e.g., GPUs, TPUs)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not contain information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which hardware resources were used based solely on the given context.
