Knowledge of reproductive traits in exploited marine populations is crucial for their management and conser-
vation. The maturity status in fish is usually assigned by traditional methods such as macroscopy and histology. 
Macroscopic analysis is the assessing of maturity stages by naked eye and usually introduces large amount of 
error. In contrast, histology is the most accurate method for maturity staging but is expensive and unavailable for 
many  stocks  worldwide.  Here,  we  use  the  Random  Forest  (RF)  machine  learning  method  for classification  of 
reproductive  condition  in  fish,  using  the  extensive  data  from  Chilean  hake  (Merluccius  gayi  gayi).  Gonads 
randomly collected from commercial industrial and acoustic surveys were classified as immature, mature-active 
and  mature-inactive.  A  classifier  for  these  three  maturity  classes  was  fitted  using  RFs,  with  the  continuous

Machine Learning (ML) techniques have been successfully applied in 
teleost  and  elasmobranch  reproductive  biology,  used  to  determine 
maturation  condition,  sex,  and  spawning  habitats  (Brown-Peterson 
et al., 2021; Brownscombe et al., 2020; Rogers et al., 2017; Slembrouck 
et  al.,  2019;  Vitale  et  al.,  2006).  In  this  study,  Random  Forests  (RF) 
analyses  proved  to  be  similarly  effective  in  classifying  maturity  in 
Chilean hake, with high precision measured against the gold-standard of 
histological  staging.  The  RF’s  accuracy  in  classifying  immature  and 
mature-inactive females was notably high, in contrast to macroscopic 
analysis which generally misassigned these stages due to their similar 
external characteristics of the gonads – making them difficult to discern 
by  the  naked  eye,  even  for  experienced  scientific  observers.  This  is  a 
common  problem  in  macroscopic  analysis  beyond  Chilean  hake,

distributions,  collinearity).  In  recent  years,  different  algorithms  have 
been successfully applied in fisheries biology, such as Boosted Regres-
sion Trees to assess the relative importance of environmental and har-
vesting  effects  on  herring  growth  (Lyashevska  et  al.,  2020),  as  well 
predicting bycatch on a demersal crustacean fishery in Chile (Montero 
et al., 2020). Random Forest have been applied for stock differentiation 
in pink cusk-eel using morphometric measurements of sagittal otoliths 
(Wiff  et  al.,  2020),  as  well  as  investigating  the  influence  of  environ-
mental and density-dependent factors on the growth of North Sea sprat 
(Lindegren  et  al.,  2020).  Convolutional  Neural  Networks  have  been 
widely applied to analyse salmon scale images for growth determination 
(Vabø et al., 2021). Random Forests (RFs) are one of the most popular 
machine learning techniques for both classification and regression, and

Helpful Answer:
The query asks about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, specifically regarding random seed values. However, the provided context does not directly address this topic. Instead, it discusses the application of machine learning techniques, particularly Random Forests (RF), in classifying maturity conditions in Chilean hake. It also mentions other applications of ML techniques in teleost and elasmobranch reproductive biology. Unfortunately, without additional information or context related to managing randomness in deep learning pipelines, I cannot provide a helpful response to the query.
