This   rising   number   of   digitised   herbarium   sheets   provides   an   opportunity   to   employ
computer-based   image   processing   techniques,   such   as   deep   learning,   to   automatically
identify species and higher taxa (Carranza-Rojas et al. 2017, Younis et al. 2018, Carranza-
Rojas   et   al.   2018)   or   to   extract   other   useful   information   from   the   images,   such   as   the
presence   of   pathogens   (as   done   for   live   plant   photos   by   Mohanty   et   al.   2016).   Deep
learning is a subset of machine learning methods for learning data representation. Deep
learning   techniques   require   huge   amounts   of   training   data   to   learn   the   features   and
representation of those data for the specified task by fine tuning parameters of hundreds or
thousands of neural networks, arranged in multiple layers. Learning the value of these
parameters can take vast computer and time resources, especially on huge datasets.

In order to reduce the training time and, more importantly, because of the small size of the
training dataset, transfer learning (Yosinski et al. 2014) was implemented to initialise the
model weights pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset (Deng et al. 2009). Since the initial
layers of a CNN usually learn very generic features that can also be used in new contexts,
pre-trained   weights   can   initialise   the   weights   for   these   layers.   For   the   deeper   layers,
transfer learning is used to initialise the parameter weights pre-trained on the ImageNet
dataset and then fine-tuned during training, using the annotated herbarium scan dataset
until convergence.

Due to the large image size and additional parameters of Faster R-CNN, a minibatch size
of four images per GPU (TITAN Xp) was selected for training the model. The model was
trained   twice,   once   with   a   training   subset   of   498   images   on   a   single   GPU   for   9000
iterations and performance evaluated on the test subset of 155 images, also on a single
GPU   and   then   trained   again   on   all   653   annotated   images   on   three   GPUs   for   18000
iterations   for   predicting   plant   organs   on   another   un-annotated   independent   dataset   to
evaluate   our   method.   This   dataset   consists   of   708   full   scale   herbarium   scans,   with   an
average  size of  ca. 9600  by  6500  pixels,   from  the   Herbarium  Senckenbergianum  (FR)
(Otte et al. 2011) with a different set of species (Fig. 2) and geographical origins, which is
also available at GBIF (Senckenberg 2020). The Python code and the trained model have

The   model   was   implemented   with   the   Detectron2   (Wu   et   al.   2019)   library   in   PyTorch
framework and trained using Stochastic Gradient Descent optimiser with a learning rate of
0.0025 and momentum of 0.9. The anchor generator in the Region Proposal Network (see
section above on network architecture) had six anchor scales [32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024]
(square root of area in absolute pixels) each with three aspect ratios of [1:2, 1:1, 2:1]. The
thresholds for non-maximum suppression (NMS) were 0.6 for training and 0.25 for testing,
respectively.

Helpful Answer:
The deep learning model was implemented with the Detectron2 library in the PyTorch framework. It was trained using the Stochastic Gradient Descent optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0025 and momentum of 0.9. The anchor generator in the Region Proposal Network had six anchor scales [32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024] (square root of area in absolute pixels), each with three aspect ratios of [1:2, 1:1, 2:1].
