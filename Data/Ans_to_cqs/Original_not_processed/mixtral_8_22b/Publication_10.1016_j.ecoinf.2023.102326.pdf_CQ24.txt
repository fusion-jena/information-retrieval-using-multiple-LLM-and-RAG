located in urban forests (AAD20 and 24). It can be assumed that these 
matches are also due to the high percentage of forest vegetation and the 
low percentage of built-up area around those sites.

We  use  complex  networks  and  selected  network  quantifiers  to 
investigate the spatial coherence of different AEs. Frequency correlation 
matrices (FCMs) are used as the basis for the adjacency matrix, as we 
want to capture the strongest correlations between frequency bins. As 
the dimension of FCMs is only dependent on the number of frequency

the  analysis  of  observational  complex  networks  can  inform  novel  ap-
proaches for model representations (e.g. stochastic block models (Fas-
kowitz  et  al.,  2018)).  A  special  feature  of  this  work  is  that  we  have 
concentrated on diel cycles, but concerning the possibility that FCMs can 
be  formed  for  any  recording  groups,  other  time  scales  also  become 
feasible. For instance, networks for days, weeks or months can be build 
or  we  could  even  analyze  networks  within  single  recordings.  Finally, 
evolving networks could reveal transitions in the dynamics of the urban 
AE (Belykh et al., 2014).
