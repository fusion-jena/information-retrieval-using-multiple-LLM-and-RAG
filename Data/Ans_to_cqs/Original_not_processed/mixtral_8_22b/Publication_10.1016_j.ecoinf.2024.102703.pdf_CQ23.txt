Due  to  the  increased  complexity  of  the  interactions  between  vari-
ables,  the  selection  of  important  variables  becomes  challenging.  The 
LASSO model was used for variable selection and statistical regulariza-
tion to enhance the prediction accuracy of the model (Mukherjee et al., 
2019). This model states that the impact of nutrient and environmental 
factors on FDOM varies with trophic state. Previous research conducted 
on the Inner Mongolia Plateau has validated the strong positive corre-
lations between the optical properties of DOM and the TSI, suggesting 
that  DOM  is  influenced  by  nutrient  variation  (Wen  et  al.,  2016). 
Regardless of the trophic state, pH consistently correlates with FDOM, 
with the highest pH values found under light-eutrophic conditions. Prior 
research indicated that pH significantly influences DOM photolysis rates 
and absorbance (Timko et al., 2015). pH is also the environmental driver

Build a three-layer back propagation (BP) artificial neural network 
using MATLAB R2014b (Lin et al., 2021). The first layer (i.e. the input 
layer) corresponded to the aCDOM(254) and Fn(355) respectively. The 
intermediate layer (i.e. hidden layers) and the last layer (i.e. the output 
layer)  comprised  a  single  neuron,  that  corresponded  to  the  predictor 
(TSI). Set the maximum training times to 10,000 and the training error 
to 0.001. 64 water samples were utilized for model calibration, with the 
remaining  used  for  validation.  Validation  accuracy  was  assessed  by 
calculating the coefficient of determination (R2) and root-mean-square 
error (RMSE) between the measured and predicted TSI. The RMSE was 
determined using Eq. (6).

nent Analysis (PCA) categorized samples from the Erhai watershed into 
four  groups  (CBH,  EH,  R,  and  XH)  based  on  distinct  geographical 
characteristics (Fig.A1). This implies that distinct lakes exhibit distin-
guishable  DOM  optical  parameters  across  various  trophic  states.  The 
new  models  developed  in  our  study  encompass  lakes  and  rivers  with 
diverse trophic states, providing a valuable opportunity to investigate 
general trends in nutrient gradients associated with CDOM absorption 
variability with broader applicability to other plateau lakes. However, 
applying these models to oligotrophic and hypereutrophic samples may 
introduce  uncertainty.  Variables  such  as  climate,  non-point  source

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it mentions that the new models developed in this study encompass lakes and rivers with diverse trophic states, which could be considered a form of data diversity. Additionally, the use of a separate set of water samples for validation suggests some level of model testing beyond the initial calibration phase. Nonetheless, without more detailed information regarding the methodology employed, it is difficult to definitively identify all the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
