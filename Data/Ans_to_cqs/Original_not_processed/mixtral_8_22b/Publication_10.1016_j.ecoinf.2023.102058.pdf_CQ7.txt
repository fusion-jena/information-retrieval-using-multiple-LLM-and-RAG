Other  ML  algorithms,  in  general,  and  deep  learning  algorithms,in 
particular,  can  be  applied  to  hyperspectral  data  to  predict  the  water 
quality parameters with better accuracy and performance using orbital 
hyperspectral data. The number and spatial distribution of the samples, 
and influence of different atmospheric correction algorithms (Vanhel-

be noticed in  all future studies  to create  a representative dataset and

PCR  is  a  linear  regression  model  obtained  by  combining  multiple 
linear  regression  (MLR)  and  principal  component  analysis  (PCA)  to 
suppress the problem of MLR methods facing the multi-collinearity be-
tween  variables  (Liu  et  al.,  2003).  PLSR  is  another  linear  regression 
method  that  projects  independent  variables  (X)  as  predictors  and 
dependent  variables  (Y)  as  responses  into  a  set  of  orthogonal  latent 
factors while maximising the covariance between X- and Y-scores (Wold 
et al., 2001). In RF, as an ensemble learning method, decision trees are 
trained and then a voting procedure is employed to combine the result 
obtained by each tree. Unlike the noise sensitivity of every single tree’s 
prediction outcome, uncorrelated trees combination will not yield that 
much noisy results. Furthermore, training data will be created by the 
bagging  approach,  drawing  sample  subsets  with  replacement,  which

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, it does not provide specific information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training such as train, test, and validation sets. However, generally speaking, there are several common ways to split the data for machine learning models including deep learning models. One popular way is to use a random sampling technique where the entire dataset is randomly divided into three parts: training set, testing set, and validation set. Typically, the training set consists of around 60-80% of the total data, while the remaining data is equally divided into testing and validation sets. Another commonly used criterion is stratified sampling, where the data is divided based on class labels or target variable values to ensure that each subset has approximately equal representation from each class. Additionally, some researchers also use cross-validation techniques like k-fold cross-validation to evaluate their models more robustly. It is important to note that the choice of splitting criteria depends on various factors such as the size of the dataset, the complexity of the model, and the nature of the task being performed. Therefore, it is recommended to choose the appropriate splitting strategy based on these considerations.
