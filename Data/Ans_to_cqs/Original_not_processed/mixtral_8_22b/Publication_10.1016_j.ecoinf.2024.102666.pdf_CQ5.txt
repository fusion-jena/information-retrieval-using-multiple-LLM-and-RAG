artificial neural networks (ANN) (Men et al., 2022). The efficacy of these 
algorithms exhibits considerable variation across diverse aquatic envi-

Spectral  Hypercubes  (FLAASH)  model,  originally  developed  for  land 
pixels,  has  proven  effective  in  AC  for  aquatic  environments  utilizing 
Sentinel-2  and  SPOT-6  imagery  (Rotta  et  al.,  2016;  Li  et  al.,  2023a, 
2023b, 2023c, 2023d). Additionally, the FLAASH algorithm mitigates 
the  spatial  proximity  effect  by  employing  an  internal  pixel  averaging 
technique, which is essential for attaining high-quality AC (Wang et al., 
2021).  In  investigations  of  lacustrine  environments  using  Advanced 
Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) AVNIR-2 data, the efficacy of AC al-
gorithms  predicated  on  the  single  scattering  approximation  has  been 
significantly enhanced (Matsui and Kageyama, 2022). The Atmospheric

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions two types of data sources utilized in this study: satellite images and in-situ measured data.

For satellite images, the sensors mentioned are MSI and OLCI with various spectral bands like blue, green, red, vegetation red edge, and near-infrared. These sensors have different central wavelengths and resolutions.

As for in-situ measured data, several studies are referenced but no explicit dataset names are provided. These studies focus on atmospheric correction for HY-1C CZI images, classification of inland lake water quality levels based on Sentinel-2 images, measurement of cyanobacterial bloom magnitude using satellite remote sensing, validation of a high-resolution acoustic imaging sonar method, and estimation of the remote-sensing reflectance from above-surface measurements.

Therefore, while there isn't direct mention of popular machine learning datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, the research uses satellite image data and in-situ measured data for its analysis.
