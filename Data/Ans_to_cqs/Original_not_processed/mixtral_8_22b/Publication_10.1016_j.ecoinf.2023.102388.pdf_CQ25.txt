Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

• No-overfitting. In this setting, the optimization algorithm of CNNs is 
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), with a learning rate of 0.0001 
and a weight decay of 0.5. The batch size is set to 32, the number of 
training epochs to 200 and finally the batch-norm and dropout (0.5) 
are used to reduce the overfitting level.  

• Overfitting.  We  use  the  same  hyperparameters  setting  as  the  no- 
overfitting  but  we  remove  the  use  of  batch-norm,  weight  decay 
and dropout techniques to ensure that the model overfits.

6.4. Biodiversity challenges 

In a recent article, Villon and collaborators (Villon et al., 2022) have 
delved  into  challenges that extend  beyond dataset limitations,  with a 
particular focus on biodiversity and its impact on deep learning-based 
automated  monitoring  of  marine  mammals  and  fish  habitats  through 
computer  vision.  More  specifically,  they  explored  the  implications  of 
three  fundamental  rules  of  biodiversity,  namely  the  distribution  of 
species  abundance,  species  rarity  and  ecosystem  openness.  They  also 
proposed promising solutions to these problems,  some of which  were 
previously briefly discussed in Section 2.

To  enhance  the  learning  capacity  of  the  SNN  model,  the  distance 
scores  are  normalized  within  the  range  of  0  to  1.  Subsequently,  a 
contrastive  loss  function  is  applied  to  evaluate  the  loss  and  accuracy 
based on the prediction and ground truth. This ensures that the model’s 
weights are trained in a manner that minimizes the distance between 
two similar images (of the same beluga) while maximizing the distance 
between dissimilar images (of different belugas). Once the model has 
converged  to  an  optimal  point  over  time,  the  generalized  network  is 
subsequently employed to assess the discrimination performance across 
the entire dataset. In Section 5.5, we provide a detailed account of the 
implementation and the result of the evaluation.

4.3. Target and attack models 

We adopted two popular neural network architectures as our target 
model:  ResNet50  (He  et  al.,  2016b)  and  DenseNet121  (Huang  et  al., 
2017).  

• ResNet50. The ResNet50 architecture contains 50 layers and uses a 
stack of three layers with 1 × 1, 3 × 3 and 1 × 1 convolutions as the 

Fig.  7. Distribution  of  the  dataset  for  the  experimental  setting.  The  main 
dataset is split in 1
3 of individuals (e.g., 60 individuals in each subset: target set, 
attack set and evaluation set for GREMM dataset). The arrows indicate that the 
same individuals and pictures were re-used from one dataset to another.

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the model is likely being used for image recognition or identification tasks related to marine mammals and fish habitats. Specifically, the model appears to be designed to distinguish between different beluga whales using contrastive loss functions and normalization techniques. Additionally, the mention of popular neural network architectures such as ResNet50 and DenseNet121 further suggests that the model may be used for image classification or object detection purposes.
