whilst providing very reasonable data and computational requirements. 
In Section 6, we discuss the advantages and limitations of the model and 
future work. And finally, we summarize the main findings in Section 7.

processes also brings significant data requirements, including detailed 
meteorological,  soil,  and  vegetation  data,  as  well  as  substantial 
computational costs. This can make energy balance models impractical

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide specific information on the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the model requires meteorological, soil, and vegetation data. These types of data could be collected using various methods such as weather stations or satellites for meteorological data, soil sampling for soil data, and remote sensing or field observations for vegetation data. Public datasets may also be available for these types of data. Without more specific context, it is impossible to determine exactly which methods are being used in this case.
