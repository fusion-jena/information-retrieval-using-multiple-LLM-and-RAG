2.6. Training and validation set 

The  study  utilized  a  training-and-test  approach  with  stratification 
splitting. For each setting, 100 different splits to the training-and-test set 
were given. Tuning of the hyperparameter on the training set was done 
for  each  set.  This  was  followed  by  model  training  using  an  optimal 
setting of the hyperparameter. 

2.7. Regression models 

Four methods were used to model forest AGB in the study: AdaBoost, 
random  decision  forest  (RF),  multilayer  neural  network  (NET),  and 
Bayesian ridge regression (Bayes).

In  recent  years,  nonparametric  machine  learning  models  have 
become  predominant  for  quantifying  forest  biomass  within  a  space 
based  on  ALS  data  (Ali  et  al.,  2015;  Zhang  et  al.,  2019).  Machine

Helpful Answer: The study employed a training-and-test approach with stratified splitting. Each setting had 100 different splits into training and testing sets. Hyperparameters were tuned on the training set for each split, followed by model training using the optimal hyperparameter settings. Four regression models were used: AdaBoost, random decision forest (RF), multilayer neural network (NET), and Bayesian ridge regression (Bayes). Nonparametric machine learning models have become popular for estimating forest biomass based on ALS data. Model performance was evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy with assigned tolerances (AC\_T1 and AC\_T2), root mean squared error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2), cross-validation R2 (CV\_R2), and average angle deviation from the line 1:1 for samples (AD). These metrics were calculated for both test and all samples. However, it is not explicitly mentioned how these metrics were monitored during the training process. It can be assumed that they were used after the completion of training to evaluate the final model performance rather than monitoring them continuously during training.
