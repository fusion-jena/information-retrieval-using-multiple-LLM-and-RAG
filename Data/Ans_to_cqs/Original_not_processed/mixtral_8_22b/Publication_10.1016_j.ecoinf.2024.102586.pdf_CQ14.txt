accuracy in comparison to other supervised learning techniques (Brei-
man, 2001; Archer and Kimes, 2008) and allows quantification of var-
iable importance for each potential predictor. To obtain a high level of 
predicted  accuracy,  the  RF  model,  a  regression  tree  method  uses 

bootstrap aggregation and randomisation of predictors (Rigatti, 2017). 
The  model  works  by  using  the  training  dataset  containing  both  the 
response  and  predictor variables,  associated  distance matrix,  and  dis-
tance  thresholds  (Benito,  2021).  The  distance  threshold  is  simply  a

2) What are the relative roles of these drivers in determining the rich-

ness and abundance of invasive alien species in the region?  

3)  Does the relative importance of these drivers differ between the two 

diversity metrics (i.e., species richness and abundance)?

2.3. Data analysis 

In  recent  times,  the  use  of  powerful  analytical  tools  have  proven 
beneficial  in  modelling  and  predicting  the  drivers  of  invasive  species 
diversity, with immense implications in guiding invasion management 
and mitigation measures (Lenzner et al., 2019). To examine the relative 
importance of the selected environmental and anthropogenic variables 
on  the  invasive  plant  species  richness  and  abundance  separately,  we 
employed  the  random  forest  (RF)  model  using  the  spatialRF  package 
(Benito,  2021)  in  R  4.2.2  software  (R  Core  Team,  2021).  The  RF 
modelling  approach,  a  particular  kind  of  bagging,  has  an  enhanced

executions. The relative importance of each predictor variable on both 
the  response  variables  (i.e.,  richness  and  abundance)  was  calculated 
based on the change in prediction error, relying on the median obtained 
from the 30 repetitions. A higher variable  importance score indicates 
that the variable has a greater influence on the model (Xu et al., 2022). 
In addition, the response curves of the most important predictor vari-
ables were plotted to show how the respective variables are important in 
explaining  the  response  variable,  while keeping  all  other explanatory 
variables at their average values.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the provided information, there is no explicit mention of how the hyperparameters of the Random Forest (RF) model used in this study were optimized. However, common practices for optimizing hyperparameters include Grid Search, Random Search, Bayesian Optimization, or even manual tuning. Since the authors did not specify which optimization technique they employed, it would be best to assume that they followed standard practices for optimizing hyperparameters in machine learning models like the RF model.

It should also be noted that the RF model itself does not require extensive hyperparameter tuning compared to some other machine learning algorithms due to its robustness and ability to handle complex interactions among features. Nevertheless, some key parameters such as the number of trees (ntree), the number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split (mtry), and the minimum size of terminal nodes (nodesize) can still impact the performance of the RF model. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the authors might have adjusted these parameters during the modeling process to achieve optimal results.
