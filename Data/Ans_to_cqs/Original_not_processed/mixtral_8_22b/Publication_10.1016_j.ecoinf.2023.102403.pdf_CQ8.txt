While  still  short  of  having  a  robust  and  standardized  biodiversity 
infrastructure (Heberling et al., 2021), there is great diversity of online 
repositories with taxonomic information and species occurrences data. 
Among  the most  important databases  hosting marine information are 
FishBase,  a  platform  that  hosts  information  on  the  taxonomy  of  fish, 
their ecology, trophic information, habitat, and history of uses dating 
back to more than 250 years (Froese and Pauly, 2000); and the Global 
Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), a platform that stores and al-
lows for the free access to species occurrence records from around the 
world.  GBIF  is  currently  one  of  the  repositories  hosting  the  largest 
amount of such data in the world (GBIF: The Global Biodiversity Infor-
mation Facility, 2021; Telenius, 2011); and finally Ocean Biodiversity 
Information System (OBIS), which houses data on the occurrence and

scales associated with data collection (Zizka et al., 2020). Due to these 
disparities,  scholars  recommend  a  thorough  examination  and  refine-
ment  of  these  data  repositories  (Bonnet-Lebrunm  et  al.,  2023).  To 
enhance the quality and reliability of the information, a comprehensive 
series  of  filters  has  been  systematically  applied  to  our  analysis.  To 
minimize errors associated with the public usage of GBIF and OBIS re-
positories,  we  curated  the  dataset  following  Zizka  et  al.  (2020)  and 
filtered the dataset by the columns labeled “scientific name”, “family”, 
“year”, “longitude” and “latitude”. We retained all taxonomic informa-
tion down to the species level and removed records with NA in these 
columns. We also removed all duplicate records with identical latitude

Finally, we also analyzed the potential effect of some attributes on 
the  incidence  of  more  records  in  global  database  repositories.  Specif-
ically, we evaluated three research questions related to how body size, 
habitat depth, and commercial use relate to the representation of marine 
fish occurrences. We ask whether: (i) a better representation in online 
platforms may be due to the oversampling of larger fish, resulting from 
an easier identification; (ii) shallow areas provide easy access to sam-
pling; and (iii) economic and commercial interests have elicited a larger 
representation  of  culturally  relevant  species  in  online  biodiversity 
repositories. 

2. Methods 

2.1. Species data

Recently, however, a large number of online repositories have emerged, which catalogue, store and distribute 
biodiversity  information,  including  taxonomic  and  species  occurrence  data.  FishBase,  the  Global  Biodiversity 
Information  Facility  (GBIF)  and  the  Ocean  Biodiversity  Information  System  (OBIS)  are  part  of  these  publicly 
available  repositories  representing  a  variety  of  sources  that  have  exploded  in  number.  However,  despite  the 
incredible accumulation of biodiversity records, not all the information is actually useful, nor does it represent 
any new knowledge regarding global species richness patterns.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not mention any specific details about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful response based solely on this context. It would require additional information or resources to accurately determine the location of the code repository.
