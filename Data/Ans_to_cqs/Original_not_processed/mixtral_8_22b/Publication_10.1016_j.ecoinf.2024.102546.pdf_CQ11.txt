2. Public weed dataset survey 

Weed datasets were surveyed based on a systematic search in major 
databases including Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, IEEE 
Xplore, and arXiv. The search keywords included “weed dataset”, “weed 
database”,  “agriculture”,  “machine  vision”  and  “computer  vision”. 
Particularly,  to  facilitate searching  via  Google  Scholar,  the  Python  li-
brary “scholarly”3  was employed to automatically retrieve publication 
records. A total of 451 records were collected from the literature search,

%Query
Query: "What is the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The paper does not provide information about the specific data repository link of the deep learning pipeline used. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact link to resources such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. However, the authors do mention using various datasets, including the DeepWeeds dataset, which can be found in the cited reference by Olsen et al. (2019). Additionally, they use other sources like the work by Rahman et al. (2022) and Rai et al. (not explicitly mentioned but referenced in the text). Unfortunately, without more specific details, it is impossible to pinpoint the precise data repositories utilized in this study.
