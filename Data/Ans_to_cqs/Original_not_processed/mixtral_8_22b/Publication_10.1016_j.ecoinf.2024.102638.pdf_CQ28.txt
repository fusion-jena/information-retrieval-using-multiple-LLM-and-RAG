Table 4 includes details such as the name of the prediction model, its 
hyperparameters,  the  parameters  selected  during  the  5-fold  cross- 
validation,  and  the  hyperparameters  adjusted  according  to  the  selec-
tion  criteria  to  determine  the  most  appropriate  configuration  for  the 
prediction model.
