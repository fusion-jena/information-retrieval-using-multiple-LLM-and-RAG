2.5. Model description 

2.5.1. MLPnn-MC modelling 

MLPnn-MC  modelling  integrates  the  multi-layer  perceptron  (MLP) 
algorithm  and  Markov  chain,  which  unravels  robust  future  LULC 
simulation (Gebresellase et al., 2023; Nasiri et al., 2019). The novelty of 
this model lies in the fact that it utilises deep machine learning to learn 
the model in automated mode in less calibration time through complex, 
multivariate, and non-linear relationships to create several transitions 
and predict unseen data within the model at a single time by compre-
hending the hidden relationships (Kumar and Agrawal, 2023). MLP is 
the  most  prevalent  machine  learning  algorithm  in  ANN  (Artificial 
Neural Network) modelling (Alla et al., 2021; Band et al., 2020), which 
uses  back  propagation  (BP)  or  the  reverse  method  of  automatic

executed as an important post-classification step in which a reference 
dataset is used to compare the classified image to determine the level of 
accuracy. Stratified random sampling is adopted in ERDAS IMAGINE, 
and  then  500  sample  points  were  created  in  the  study  area.  Kappa 
analysis,  a  discrete  multivariate  technique,  is  used  to  calculate  pro-
ducer’s accuracy, user’s accuracy, overall accuracy, and overall kappa 
statistics to find the accuracy and reliability of the LULC maps produced 
(Table 2).

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the mention of LULC (Land Use Land Cover) classification and the use of ERDAS IMAGINE software for stratified random sampling, we can infer that the data format used in this case might be related to remote sensing imagery such as satellite images or aerial photographs. These types of data are commonly used in land cover classification tasks. Nevertheless, without more detailed information, we cannot definitively state the exact data format used in the deep learning pipeline.
