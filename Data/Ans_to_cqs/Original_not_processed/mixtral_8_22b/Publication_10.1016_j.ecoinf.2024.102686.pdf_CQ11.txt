Query: "What is the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no information available regarding the data repository link for the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context. The sources cited primarily focus on studies related to geospatial big data handling theories and methods, coupling coordination degrees of production, living, and ecological spaces, and significant spatiotemporal patterns of urban expansion. None of these sources provide specific details about a deep learning pipeline or its associated data repository links. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the requested data repository link based on the provided context.
