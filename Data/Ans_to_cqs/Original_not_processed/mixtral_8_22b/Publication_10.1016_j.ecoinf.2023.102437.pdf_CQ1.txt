The  recurrent  neural  network  (RNN)  model  is  an  artificial  model 
used  for  processing  sequential  data.  RNNs  have  been  successfully 
applied  in  areas  such  as  speech  recognition,  language  models,  and 
translation,  where  the  material  is  continuous.  However,  RNN  have 
limitations  in  processing  past  information  if  there  is  a  considerable 
difference  in  time  duration  between  the  initial  and  final  parts  of  the 
data.  LSTM  (Long  Short-Term  Memory)  is  a  type  of  recurrent  neural 
network (RNN) architecture designed to address some of the limitations 
of  traditional  RNNs  when  it  comes  to  handling  long  sequences  and 
capturing long-term dependencies in data. LSTM networks are used in 
machine learning and deep learning for sequential data tasks, such as 
natural language processing, speech recognition, time series forecasting, 
and  more.  Especially,  LSTM  models  possess  the  ability  to  make  pre-

Our  findings  also  revealed  a  significant  reduction  in  computation 
time when ML models, along with preselection, were used. Unlike ex-
pected, pre-selection lowered the accuracy of the results, which likely 
indicates  a  loss  of  information  in  the  database  transformed  using  the 
signature method. As we expected that the Lasso model, in the absence 
of the signature method, would not provide convincing results; there-
fore, we only retained this analysis to maintain consistency in compar-
ison with the ML models. Though it is possible to extract PDPs from RF 
runs  coupled  with  the  signature  method,  their  interpretation  is  not 
possible because of this transformation. The amount of input data, or in 
our case, the size of the time series used during the learning phase of an 
ML  model,  can  have  a  non-negligible  influence  on  predictive  perfor-
mance (Bustillo et al., 2022; Derot et al., 2020b). In other words, a long

using  the  PDP  (see  Section  3.2).  As  discussed  above,  the  size  of  the 
database can have a significant impact on the accuracy of the model. 
Moreover, there appears to be a strong correlation between ENSO cycles 
and  the  proxy  of  the  phytoplankton  biomass  (Park  et  al.,  2018;  Tian 
et  al.,  2021).  Hence, in  future  studies,  these  tests  should  be  repeated 
with  larger  datasets  and/or  with  relevant  biological  data  to  assess 
whether the Lasso model coupled with the signature method still out-
performs the ML models under these conditions.

Helpful Answer:

Unfortunately, the given context does not explicitly mention any specific methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot directly provide an answer based solely on the provided context. However, generally speaking, various methods are commonly employed for gathering raw data in deep learning pipelines. These include but are not limited to:

1. Surveys: Data collection via surveys involves gathering information by asking individuals questions about certain topics. This method is often used in social sciences, market research, and user experience studies.

2. Sensors: Sensor data collection involves utilizing devices equipped with sensors to measure physical quantities like temperature, humidity, pressure, etc. Examples of sensor data sources include IoT devices, wearable technology, and environmental monitoring systems.

3. Public Datasets: Utilizing publicly available datasets is another common approach for obtaining raw data. Many organizations and institutions share large amounts of data online, covering diverse domains such as image recognition, natural language processing, and bioinformatics. Some popular examples of public datasets include ImageNet, MNIST, and UCI Machine Learning Repository.
