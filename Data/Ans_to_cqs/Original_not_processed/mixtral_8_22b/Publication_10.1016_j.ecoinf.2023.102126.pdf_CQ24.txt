store and disseminate a genomic data archive that complies with FAIR 
principles  in  terms  of  metadata  traceability  and  dataset  citability,  in 
accordance with Open Science  recommendations. Another example is 
the work of Wise et al. (2019) on the benefits of FAIR for research and 
development in the biopharmaceutical industry and other life sciences, 
such  as  biomedical,  environmental,  agricultural,  and  food  sciences. 
According to these studies, industry investment in following the FAIR 
principles could be a differentiating factor with respect to how data are 
exploited both internally and externally by other actors. Additionally, 
one line of research that promotes the advantages of FAIR principles and 
highlighted the shortcomings pertaining to their application is the work 
of Kinkade and Shepherd (2021) on the publication of geoscience data. 
Among  the  primary  conclusions  of  these  authors  are  claims  that  the

3.2. Results of the FAIR assessment of the datasets selected by the F-UJI 
tool 

The  results  obtained  using  the  F-UJI  tool  were  based  on  the  16 
metrics described previously, which were established in the FAIRsFAIR 
project and distributed among four principles. 

Following the analysis of each group of repositories using this tool, 
we  passed  the  results  through  a  computational  notebook  report, 

ultimately  obtaining  visualisations  of  the  summaries  of  each  FAIR 
principle for all eight repositories. 

The report itself contained two sections:  

1.  “Read jsons responses” creates a data frame that includes all scores 

obtained for each of the 16 metrics,  

2.  “Visualize different FAIR metrics”  creates a histogram plot of the 
results that includes visualisations of each principle and the overall 
FAIR score, as shown below (Figs. 4(cid:0) 11).

Using F-UJI and conducting this study was possible because its cre-
ators made the code necessary to evaluate a large number of datasets 
quickly  and  automatically  available  to  the  scientific  community, 
without having to enter each identifier individually. Therefore, we were 
able  to  install  our  own  server  using  the  latest  version  of  the  code 
available on GitHub. In this way, compliance with the FAIR principles of 
6288 datasets related to the agricultural field was evaluated, and the 
results  indicated  that,  from  highest  to  lowest,  compliance  with  the 
principles  followed  the  same  alphabetical  order  as  the  principles 
themselves, with findability being the highest rated and reusability the 
lowest. None of the repositories analysed reached 50% of the score for 
the  reusability  principle;  therefore,  it  is  important  to  investigate  the 
causes  of  this  low  score  and,  at  the  same  time,  seek  mechanisms  for

2.3. FAIR evaluation of datasets using the F-UJI tool 

The FAIR evaluation performed using the F-UJI tool was based on 
aggregated metadata, including metadata embedded in the landing page 
and  metadata  retrieved  from  a  PID  (Persistent  Identifier).  F-UJI  con-
siders  the  following  schemes  to  be  PIDs:  Handle,  Persistent  Uniform 
Resource Locator, Archival Resource Key, Permanent Identifier for Web 
Applications, and DOI (Sun et al., 2022). 

The assessment of datasets using the F-UJI focused on several generic 
cross-domain  metadata  standards,  such  as  those  proposed  by  Dublin 
Core, DCAT, DataCite, and Schema.org (Devaraju et al., 2020). The re-
sults of these evaluations provided various scores regarding the data and 
dataset metadata based on 16 metrics distributed across four principles:

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to provide an accurate response about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, some common strategies used to manage randomness include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, employing techniques like cross-validation or bootstrapping to account for variability, and utilizing ensemble methods to combine multiple models trained with different initializations.
