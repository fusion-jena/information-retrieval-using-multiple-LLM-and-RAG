Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not contain information on the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model such as accuracy, precision, or recall. However, these are common evaluation metrics used in machine learning and deep learning models. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of total predictions made by the model. Precision is the ratio of true positive predictions to the sum of true positives and false positives, indicating how many of the predicted positives were actually correct. Recall, also known as sensitivity, is the ratio of true positive predictions to the sum of true positives and false negatives, showing how well the model can identify all relevant instances. Other commonly used metrics include F1 score, ROC curve, and area under the curve (AUC), among others.
