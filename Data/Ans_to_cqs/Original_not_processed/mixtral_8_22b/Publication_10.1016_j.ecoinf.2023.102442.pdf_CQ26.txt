Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The papers mentioned do not directly discuss specific techniques to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some general approaches can be considered when dealing with data bias. These include stratified sampling, which ensures that each class is represented proportionally in both training and validation sets; oversampling, where samples from underrepresented classes are duplicated or synthesized to balance the dataset; undersampling, where samples from overrepresented classes are removed to achieve balance; and diverse data collection, which involves gathering more representative data from various sources to reduce bias. It should also be noted that addressing data bias may involve other steps such as normalization, standardization, and feature engineering.
