The  implemented  CNN  corresponded  to  a  modified  version  of 
ResNet50, one of the dominant architectures in bioacoustic tasks, and, 
although other authors have applied previous ImageNet training to the 
bioacoustic  domain  (LeBien  et  al.,  2020;  Zhong  et  al.,  2021),  other 
datasets such as Audio Set (Gemmeke et al., 2017) or VGG-Sound (Chen 
et al., 2020) can be just as good as ImageNet for pre-training, either on 
ResNet or on other architectures, such as VGGish, Inception or Mobile-
Net. Another viable option is to pretrain with synthetic clicks or chirps 
(Glotin  et  al.,  2017;  Yang  et  al.,  2021).  Models  already  available  in 
mobile  apps  that  perform  this  same  spectrogram-based  identification 
task are advancing rapidly. To date (October 2022), the BirdNet appli-
cation (Kahl et al., 2021) allows for the identification of more than 3000 
bird species (Wood et al., 2022). In the short term, this particular model

We applied the transfer learning and fine-tuning technique with the 
deep learning model ResNet50 (He et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2018), which 
was already pre-trained on ImageNet data (Deng et al., 2009). Transfer 
learning is a technique that enabled us to overcome the issue of shortage 
of  training  data  and  construct  a  model  efficiently  by  transferring 
knowledge  from  a  similar  task  to,  in  this  case,  our  target  task.  The 
implemented  architecture  received  RGB  images  of  224×224×3  as 
inputs—in this case, color spectrograms of two-second durations—and 
included  only  the  feature  extraction  layers  from  the  ResNet50,  dis-
carding the superior classification layers (known as the top network). 
The newly created model reconfigured the top network with two fully 
connected  layers  (FC)  that  could  learn  new  features.  To  reduce  over-
fitting and imitate the training of a set of different models, a dropout

On  the  other  hand,  supervised  learning  techniques  based  on  deep 
artificial  neural  networks  (deep  learning)  are  suitable  for  identifying 
species through the automatic analysis of recordings that can come from 
a  whole  season  in  different  simultaneous  locations  (Borowiec  et  al., 
2021; Zhong et al., 2021). 

Knowing  the  potential  of  these  technologies  and  the  context  of 
climate emergency and biodiversity loss (Butt et al., 2021; Sueur et al., 
2019;  Tittensor  et  al.,  2019),  we  wonder  how  we  can  precisely  and 
exhaustively  monitor  the  diversity  and  acoustic  activity  of  birds.  In 
addition, we are interested in examining some abiotic oscillations and 
their relationship with the annual dynamics of the calls of bird species as 
an approach to the field of acoustic phenology.

Helpful Answer:
To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets while maintaining the original class proportions. This ensures that each subset has a representative sample of all classes, reducing the risk of biased results due to unequal distribution of samples across classes.

Oversampling is a technique where additional copies of minority class examples are added to the dataset to balance it out. This helps prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class. However, oversampling may lead to overfitting if not handled carefully.

Undersampling, on the other hand, involves removing instances from the majority class until both classes have equal representation. While this reduces the overall size of the dataset, it can help mitigate the effects of class imbalance.

Lastly, collecting diverse data is crucial to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data. This includes gathering data from various sources, environments, and conditions to capture the full range of variability present in real-world scenarios. By incorporating diverse data, the model becomes more robust and less prone to biases introduced by limited or skewed datasets.
