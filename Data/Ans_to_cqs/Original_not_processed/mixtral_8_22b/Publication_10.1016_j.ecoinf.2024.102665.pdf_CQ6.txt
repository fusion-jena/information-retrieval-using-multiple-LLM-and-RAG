Increasing  the  dimensions  used  in  the  assessment  through  additional 
variables can therefore be useful (Peterson and Evans, 2019). Due to the 
restrictions in MWST, the representation of data might not be as high as 
other  learning  methods  (Kekolahti  et  al.,  2015).  However,  the  con-
straints (only one incoming connection per node) allow only the nodes 
with the strongest associations to be connected.

The MWST-learned network was used for the final clustering of each 
group  of  variables.  The  connections  between  nodes  for  different  taxa 
variables  were  first  removed  so  that  only  within-taxon  connections 
remained (Fig. S2). The number of factors requested for variable clus-
tering was chosen based on the number of taxa. Multiple clustering was 
used to construct a new latent factor variable for each taxon, generating 
multiple  cluster  states  within  each  latent  factor  variable.  These  four 
latent variables were then themselves clustered to create a higher-level 
latent factor variable, a meta-cluster, that summarized the cluster states 
across  taxa.  This  meta-clustering  provides  a  hierarchical  clustering 
network that summarizes information on the coral reef community from 
the measured variables across taxa. This network also includes all factor 
nodes  and  observable  nodes  from  monitoring  data  so  it  provides  an

data.  The  maximization  step  uses  the  imputations  from  this  step  to 
realign the conditional probabilities in the network from the data. This 
process is repeated until convergence (no change) or a stopping point is 
reached.

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved to ensure the quality and usability of the input data. While the specific steps may vary depending on the nature of the dataset and the problem being addressed, some common preprocessing techniques include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing any irrelevant, redundant, or erroneous data points from the dataset. It could also involve handling missing values by either filling them with appropriate estimates or dropping those records altogether.

2. Normalization/Standardization: Deep learning models often perform better when the input features have similar scales. Techniques such as Min-Max Scaling, which rescales the range of features to fall within a specified range (often 0 to 1), or Standardization, where features are centered around the mean with unit standard deviation, help achieve this.

3. Feature Engineering: This process involves creating new features from existing ones to improve the performance of the model. For example, polynomial features can be created from numerical inputs, or categorical variables can be converted into binary indicators using One-Hot Encoding.

4. Dimensionality Reduction: High dimensional datasets can lead to overfitting and increased computational complexity. Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can reduce the dimensionality while retaining most of the variance in the original data.

5. Data Augmentation: To increase the size of the dataset and prevent overfitting, synthetic samples can be generated from existing data via transformations such as rotation, zooming, flipping, etc.

6. Train-Test Split: Before training the model, the dataset should ideally be split into two parts - a training set and a test set. The model learns patterns from the training data, and its performance is evaluated on unseen test data.

These preprocessing steps aim to prepare the raw data for efficient processing by the deep learning algorithm, thereby improving the overall accuracy and reliability of the trained model.
