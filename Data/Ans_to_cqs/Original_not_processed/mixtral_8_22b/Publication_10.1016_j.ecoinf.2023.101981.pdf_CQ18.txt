2.4. Statistical analyses

cation. The precision was estimated by dividing the number of cow calls 
detected by the software by the total number of ROIs within the “Cow” 
cluster (Knight et al., 2017; P´erez-Granados and Schuchmann, 2020a) 
and can be interpreted as an index of the percentage of ROIs correctly 
labeled by Kaleidoscope.

4. Discussion

is the FFT window size. We opted for a larger FFT window size, which 
should  improve  the  resolution  at  lower  frequencies  on  which  cows 
vocalize. Finally, while Karmiris et al. (2021) used the same settings for 
detecting  the  three  ungulate  species  (e.g.,  their  minimum  frequency 
introduced  for  detecting  cow  vocalization  was  much  higher,  500  Hz, 
than the mean minimum frequency measured in our dataset, approxi-
mately 250 Hz), we fitted cow-specific parameters in the model, which 
could also partly explain why our model detected a much larger number 
of cow vocalizations.

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it discusses some aspects related to the model's performance and its configuration. For instance, the text mentions using a larger FFT window size to improve the resolution at lower frequencies where cows typically vocalize. Additionally, the authors employed cow-specific parameters in the model, which could have contributed to detecting a larger number of cow vocalizations compared to previous studies. Nevertheless, without further information or context, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the monitoring strategy for the model's performance during training.
