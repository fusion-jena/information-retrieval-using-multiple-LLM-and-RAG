where D2 is the dry spell duration that causes the species to decline to the 
worst possible condition. It is defined depending on whether the target is 
on a recovery or declining trajectory. 

D2 = D2,D(1 (cid:0) T) + D2,RT,

D2,R = γICδ,

D2,D = ζICη.

Eqs.  (13)  and  (14)  ensure  a  physically  meaningful  D2  value  by 
asserting that the time taken to decline to the lowest condition is zero if 
the target is already in a lower condition. 

4.1.3. Distance weighting under dry spell 

Three parameters are included to bound the target’s condition below 
based  on  the  proximity  to  any  river  channel  (Table  1).  Even  though 
flooding  is  a  significant  driver  of  ecological  health  in  floodplains, 
ecological targets sufficiently close to the river channel can maintain at 
least  a  minimum  condition  without  flooding.  The worst  condition  Cw 
becomes a variable and is calculated as:

two parameters, R
I C, describing the maximum increase in con-
dition during recovering and declining trajectories. It is expected as in 
the event that the increase in condition exceeds the maximum possible 
condition, the increase in condition would be capped. For example, if the 
maximum  possible  condition  is  set  to  0.5,  any  choice  of  parameter 
greater then 0.5 would give identical results for the duration of a wet 
spell.  The  model  is  therefore  insensitive  to  these  two  parameters. 
Although this may indicate over-parametrisation, it could be specifically 
related to the target species used in this study. Sensitivity analysis per-
formed  on  a  wider  variety  of  target  species  and  locations  would  be 
required to confirm this conclusion.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, some common regularization techniques used in deep learning include Dropout, L1 Regularization, and L2 Regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent overfitting. L1 Regularization adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients to the loss function, while L2 Regularization adds a penalty equal to the square of the magnitude of coefficients to the loss function. Both L1 and L2 Regularization help prevent overfitting by reducing the complexity of the model. Other regularization techniques include Early Stopping, Data Augmentation, and Batch Normalization.
