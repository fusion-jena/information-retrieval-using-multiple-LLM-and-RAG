specified number of iterations. For this study, the Eureka Pro software is 
utilized for GP modeling. This software was developed by Cornell Uni-
versity’s Data Science Order and was released in 2009 (Eureqa, 2009). It 
is crucial to emphasize that GP serves multiple roles in this paper. Once 
GP is employed as the forecasting model, we extract the inputs utilized 
in  the  optimal  GP  tree  and  utilize  them  as  the  optimal  inputs  for 
modeling  with  ANN.  The  primary  reason  for  selecting  GP  as  our  IVS 
technique is its ability to simultaneously select appropriate features and 
perform modeling tasks (Althoey et al., 2023; Hu, 2023).

Helpful Answer:
The research article titled "Comparative evaluation of LSTM, CNN, and ConvLSTM for hourly short-term streamflow forecasting using deep learning approaches" published in Eco. Inform. 75, 102119 (2023) uses three types of deep learning models - Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) for hourly short-term streamflow forecasting. These models are used in a comparative evaluation to determine their performance in predicting streamflow based on historical data. The authors use these models to develop a pipeline for forecasting streamflow, which involves preprocessing the input data, training the models, and evaluating their performance. The results show that all three models perform well in predicting streamflow, but there are differences in their accuracy and computational efficiency. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the potential of deep learning models for streamflow forecasting and highlights the importance of choosing the right model for specific applications.
