model 1. However, model 1 is superior to model 2 where for YFT which 
is the only species where model 1 has more training data than model 2. 
Analyzing both models and Table 4 at the same time, looks like accuracy 
is dependent on the number of training segments per species and not 
dependent on the dataset itself.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions that manual tuning was employed, suggesting that human intervention played a role in monitoring and adjusting the model's performance during training. Additionally, the use of data augmentation indicates that efforts were made to improve the model's learning process by increasing the diversity of the training data. The mention of the total number of training segments and the duration of training also suggests that some form of tracking or logging occurred during the training process. Nevertheless, without further details, it cannot be definitively stated what specific strategy was used to monitor the model performance during training.
