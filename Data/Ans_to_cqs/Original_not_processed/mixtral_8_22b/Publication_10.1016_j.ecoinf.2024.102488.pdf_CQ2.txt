2.2. Remote sensing data 

The  remote  sensing  data  utilized  in  this  study  encompassed  GF-1 

optical imagery, GF-3 SAR imagery, and MODIS NDVI imagery. 

The  GF-1  images  used  in  this  study  were  multispectral  images 
captured with a wide-format WFV camera. The GF-1 multispectral im-
ages have four bands of blue, green, red, and near-infrared with a spatial 
resolution of 16 m. The China Centre for Resources Satellite Data and 
Application (https://data.cresda.cn) was accessed to retrieve a total of 
21  GF-1  multispectral  images  (cloud  percentage  less  than  5%)  of  the 
study area in 2020 (Fig. 3). Due to the dense cloud cover, there was no 
applicable imagery for  the  months of June,  July, or August.  All  GF-1 
multispectral images were radiometrically calibrated, corrected for the 
atmosphere, and registered.

The MODIS NDVI images used in this study were derived from the 
MOD09Q1 dataset (with a resolution of 250 m and an interval of 8 days). 
A  total  of  thirteen  MOD09Q1  images  in  2020  were  obtained  from 
Earthdata database (https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov). The MOD09Q1 
images were then projected into the GF-1 image and resampled to 16 m 
resolutions using nearest neighbor resampling method.

Helpful Answer:
In this study, the deep learning pipeline primarily utilizes optical imagery and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery data formats. Specifically, the researchers employed GF-1 optical imagery, which consists of multispectral images captured by a wide-format WFV camera. These images contain four bands - blue, green, red, and near-infrared - with a spatial resolution of 16 meters. Additionally, they also incorporated GF-3 SAR imagery, although the specific details regarding its format are not explicitly mentioned in the given context. Furthermore, the study uses MODIS NDVI imagery, derived from the MOD09Q1 dataset, with a resolution of 250 meters and an interval of eight days. This dataset is later processed and resampled to match the 16-meter resolution of the GF-1 images. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning pipeline in this research predominantly employs image data formats.
