Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

It  is  worth  noting  that  the  typical  operation  of  fully-supervised 
models  in  Table  3  is  extracted  from  a  recent  survey  paper  by  Saleh 
et  al.  (2022b),  which  is  mainly  focused  on  clear-water  scenarios. 
Therefore, a more accurate comparison between our semi- and weakly- 
supervised models with a fully-supervised deep learning in both clear 
and turbid waters is required. We believe that applying the clear-water 
models of Saleh et al. (2022b) in turbid water situations (like our Fish-
InTurbidWater dataset) would dramatically degrade their performance. 
Besides,  the  approximate  turnaround  time  in  Table  3  is  measured 
against a non-experienced human agent. Here, we added an extra 30% 
to  the  labeling  time  of  fully-supervised  networks  to  consider  the 
necessary  double-checks  and  quality  controls.  Overall,  these  numbers 
are only rough estimates of the required time, and they heavily depend

2.3.1. EfficientNet 

The first model selected is EfficientNet-B7, which is a Convolutional 
Neural Network (CNN) with efficient scaling factors (Tan and Le, 2019). 
To elaborate, all CNNs are a cascade of convolutional layers that can 
scale  the  input  image’s  resolution  (width  and  height)  and  channel 
(number  of  color  channels).  CNN  architectures  can  also  scale  by  the 
number of consecutive convolutional layers (depth).

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 de-
scribes  the  weakly-supervised  database  and  proposes  two  DNN  struc-
tures  as  a  novel  solution  to  the  problem  of  fish  detection  in  turbid 
waters. We evaluate the accuracy of the proposed models, compare them 
with each other, and with the other fully-supervised models in Section 3. 
A  detailed  discussion  of  our  findings  is  carried  out  in  Section  4.  The 
paper is concluded in Section 5. 

2. Material and methods 

This section starts by describing our labeled dataset and then pro-
ceeds by proposing two DNN models to enhance the capability of marine 
scientists in turbid underwater and coastal environment monitoring.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model such as using diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the study uses a weakly labeled public FishInTurbidWater dataset for training and evaluation purposes. This could imply some level of diversity in the data used for training the model. Additionally, the authors propose two different DNN structures and compare them with each other and with fully supervised models, suggesting that they may have employed some form of validation techniques to assess the performance of their models. Nevertheless, without further details, it cannot be confirmed what exact measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
