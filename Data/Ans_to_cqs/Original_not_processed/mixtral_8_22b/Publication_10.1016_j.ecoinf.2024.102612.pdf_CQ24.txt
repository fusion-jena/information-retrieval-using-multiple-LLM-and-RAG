Given that existing fuel models solely account for structural infor-
mation, this study emphasises the importance of incorporating semantic 
information into the flammability and fuel load of different vegetation 
species. Because conventional fuel schemes typically account solely for 
structural information, the addition of the proposed semantic informa-
tion  enhances  the  retrieval  of  fuel  models  in  forest  ecosystems  and 
contributes to more effective wildfire management efforts, considering 
the varying behaviours of different vegetation species in response to fire. 
The methodology presented in this study can improve forest manage-
ment practices and reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires, making it a 
valuable tool for forest managers and fire management agencies.

3.2. Fuel model retrieval 

Once the DL model is trained, a few samples of real MS point clouds 
are segmented using the methodology exposed in Section 2.3 to create a 
ground truth. This ground truth was required to validate the classifica-
tions using a DL model trained with synthetic data. As mentioned in the 
previous section, the best classification performance of the SoftGroup 
semantic branch was achieved by the MS input data case; therefore, this 
pretrained  model was  used,  and  its  efficiency was  tested  by  inferring 
these real MS point clouds (Fig. 9). In addition, these inferences on real 
MS point clouds are taken as inputs for the decision tree scheme pre-
sented in Section 2.5, where the final fuel models are retrieved. The final 
fuel model classifications are summarised in Table 3.

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention or discussion about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some common strategies to address randomness in deep learning pipelines include:

1. Fixing the random seed: By setting a fixed random seed value, one can ensure reproducibility in their experiments. This means that every time the code runs, it will produce the same results, which makes debugging and comparing different approaches easier.

2. Using multiple seeds: To avoid overfitting to a specific random initialization, researchers often train their models with several different random seeds and report average performance metrics. This helps to provide a better estimate of the true performance of the model.

3. Stratified sampling: When dealing with imbalanced datasets, stratified sampling can be used to maintain the original distribution of classes during training and validation splits. This ensures that each subset has roughly the same proportion of examples from each class, reducing bias in the evaluation process.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, common methods include fixing the random seed, using multiple seeds, and employing stratified sampling techniques.
