With the rapid development of multi-scale data and multi-method
coupling research, scholars have started to base their research on
qualitative (Chen, 2020), quantitative (Liao et al., 2021; Mu et al.,
2019), frequency (Lu et al., 2021), probabilistic (Zhao and Xu, 2020),
temporal (Shen et al., 2019), spatial (Zhao et al., 2022) and other multi-
scale data. Improvements in random forest (Jiang et al., 2021; Lian et al.,
2022), support vector machines (Hong et al., 2018), deep learning (Ren
et al., 2021; Wu, 2022), Bayesian networks (Che et al., 2019), and mixed
effects (Yu et al., 2021a) models for improved fusion, e.g., Gu et al. (Gu
et al., 2024) fused optimal parametric geoprobes with partial least
squares structural equations to analyze the effects of topography,
climate, and human activities on the spatial pattern of kNDVI. Research
in natural areas such as agro-land ecology has been performed in the
exploration of influencing factors of land use and agricultural systems

2.1. Definition of concepts

EF is a measure of the biologically productive land and water area
required to support human consumption and absorb waste (Rees, 1995).
It encompasses both terrestrial and aquatic resources necessary to meet
demands at various scales—from individuals to nations—reflecting the
environmental impact of resource use and waste generation. Specif-
ically, the EF of arable land pertains to the area needed to sustain re-
sources derived from arable ecosystems, offering insights into human
demands on these productive environments over time and across spe-
cific regions (Passeri et al., 2013). Therefore, this study calculated CEF
from both productive and ecological perspectives to more comprehen-
sively reflect the pressure on arable ecosystems.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the given context is not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred that the deep learning model is used for strategic planning purposes. This information is found in the citation "strategic planning based on deep learning algorithm. IseB 21, 9." Without further details, it is difficult to determine whether the specific application of the deep learning model is for classification, segmentation, or detection tasks.
