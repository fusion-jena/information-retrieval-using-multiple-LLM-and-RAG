the weights were obtained from an already trained implementation of 
DeeplabV3+ (https://github.com/zllrunning/deeplab-pytorch-crf) with 
the COCO dataset. COCO is a dataset that has 121,408 images and a total 
of 883,331 object annotations divided in 184 classes. COCO is a widely 
used  dataset  to  train  computer  vision  models  and  sets  a  baseline  to 
benchmark their performance. Since we want to derive common objects 
below the skyline, we inference without training the model directly on 
the landscape photos. A typical example of the masks obtained with such 
a semantic segmentation is provided in Fig. 3.

Helpful Answer:
The authors used an already trained implementation of DeeplabV3+ for their study. The specific implementation they used can be found on GitHub (<https://github.com/zllrunning/deeplab-pytorch-crf>). This implementation was trained using the COCO dataset, which contains over 120,000 images and nearly 900,000 object annotations across 184 different classes. The COCO dataset is commonly used to benchmark the performance of computer vision models. In order to extract common objects below the skyline, the authors did not retrain the model on their own set of landscape photos; instead, they applied the pretrained model directly to these photos. Unfortunately, the text does not provide information about how exactly the trained model was deployed or any details regarding model serialization or platform selection.
