Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Boosting, 
and Random Trees (Yang et al., 2010). However, a growing subarea in 
machine learning, called deep learning, can leverage large image data-
sets  to train  deep neural networks such as  Convolutional Neural  Net-
works (CNNs) (Jordan and Mitchell, 2015) to make accurate predictions 
on new, unseen images.

2.3. Imagery splitting ratio 

We split the dataset in a ratio of 80:10:10 for training, validation, and 
testing sets, respectively. This ratio was used due to prior evidence of 
exceed performances in detecting small insects and diseases using deep 
learning models (Kiratiratanapruk et al., 2022; Krishnadas and Sampa-
thila, 2021; Mulchandani et al., 2019). The training dataset consisted of 
1543 images, 243 images for the validation set, and 247 images for the 
testing set and all were at input resolution of 640 × 640 pixels. The 1280 
× 1280 pixels input resolution consisted of 1637 images for the training 
set, 255 images for the validation set, and 262 images for the testing set. 
Independently,  we  trained  5  different  versions  of  the  YOLOv5  model 
family  including:  YOLOv5n,  YOLOv5s,  YOLOv5m,  YOLOv5l,  and 
YOLOv5x models to detect alates on sorghum leaves. 

2.4. Characteristics of deep learning models

A CNN is a deep neural network that can be used to process any data 
with  a  grid  pattern,  including imagery  data  (Yamashita et  al., 2018). 
Deep neural networks, particularly CNNs, have been successfully used 
for pattern recognition in a diverse range of insect images because of 
their higher performance in detection and classification tasks compared 
to traditional machine learning approaches (Hansen et al., 2020; Motta 
et al., 2020; O'Shea and Nash, 2015). CNNs perform mathematical op-
erations focusing on convolution operations, which is a linear operation 
that  can  extract  image  features  useful  for  detection  and  classification 
tasks (Yamashita et al., 2018). The use of CNNs to identify species is 
rapidly growing in entomology (Høye et al., 2021). Different tasks, such 
as  manual  identification and  counting, can be  performed  using CNNs 
and potentially aid or even replace humans in key scouting activities. To

using  the  Common  Objects  in  Context  (COCO)  dataset  for  training

extra-large,  the  file  size  and  processing  time  increases  (Ultralytics, 
2023).

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, it mentions that five different versions of the YOLOv5 model family were independently trained, including YOLOv5n, YOLOv5s, YOLOv5m, YOLOv5l, and YOLOv5x models. These models are known to utilize various optimization techniques during their training phase. For instance, the YOLOv5 architecture typically employs the Adam optimizer for weight updates, but this may vary depending on the specific implementation or configuration. Therefore, while the exact optimization technique used in this case cannot be determined from the provided context, it is reasonable to infer that some form of optimization technique, possibly Adam or another popular choice like SGD, would have been employed during the training of these models.
