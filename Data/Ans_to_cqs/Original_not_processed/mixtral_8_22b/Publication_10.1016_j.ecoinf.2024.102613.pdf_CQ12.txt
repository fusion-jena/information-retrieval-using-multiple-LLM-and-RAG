there are two types of data processing: batch and stream processing. 

3.2.2.6. Data  visualization. This feature provides the way how the in-
formation is presented to the end-users. There are two common purposes 
of developing  visualization systems  in the  smart system  to help users 
identify the trend of data or the pattern of data. The data visualization 
types  were  also  considered  to  deliver  insightful  information  to  users 
(Krisnawijaya et al., 2022). There are three types of visualization based 
on the generated information from the system, such as temporal infor-
mation  (represented  by  using  a  line  graph  or  scatter  plot),  multi- 
dimensional information (using a pie chart, Venn diagram, bar graph, 
or  histogram),  and  geospatial  information  (using  heat  or  flow  map). 
Fig. 19 shows the features diagram of the data visualization.

2019; Zamora-Izquierdo et al., 2019) and then machine learning and, 
more  recently,  deep  learning  techniques  are  applied  to  analyze  the 
generated data (Perakis et al., 2020; Swain et al., 2020). However, the 
traditional  data  management  systems  are  inadequate  to  handle  the 
volume, velocity, and variety of the generated data by the sensors and 
IoT devices (Wolfert et al., 2017). Hence the advanced data management

%Query
Query: "What type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific details about the use of any particular deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers in the pipeline. Therefore, it is not possible to determine what type of deep learning model is being used in this case.
