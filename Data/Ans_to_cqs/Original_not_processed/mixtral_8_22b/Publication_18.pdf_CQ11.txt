dataset for training is costly, the learning of CNNs on small datasets can be boosted by data-augmentation, which 
consists of increasing the volume of the training dataset artificially, and additionally by transfer learning, which 
consists of starting the learning of the network from a prior knowledge rather from scratch38,39.

%Query
Query: "What is the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific data repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in this study. The references mentioned in the text are related to various research papers published in different journals such as Nature, International Journal of Remote Sensing, and Proceedings of the IEEE. However, none of these sources contain any direct links to a data repository hosting the deep learning pipeline used in this study. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact data repository link based solely on the provided context.
