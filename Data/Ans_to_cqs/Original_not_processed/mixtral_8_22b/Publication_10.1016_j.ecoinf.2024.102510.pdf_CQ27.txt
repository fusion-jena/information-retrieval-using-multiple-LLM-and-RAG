search  tests  various combinations of  the hyperparameters  identified in  manual  search and  trains the selected 
models to achieve the maximum possible accuracy through multiple iterations. Experimental analysis revealed 
that the Fine-tuned EfficientNetB0 model exhibited superior performance, achieving an accuracy of 99.12%. In 
contrast, the performance of the ResNet18 model was disappointing with an accuracy of 93.24%, while other 
models outperformed it.

models as feature extractors and fine tuners along with a visual repre-
sentation of the time, measured in minutes, required by each model to 
complete its computational tasks. The experimental results demonstrate 
that fine-tuning pre-trained models leads to a significant improvement 
in performance. Table 12 depicts the performance of existing and pro-
posed  methods,  with  EfficientB0  achieving  higher  accuracy  than 
compared to other existing models. This can be attributed to the effec-
tive  selection  of  optimal  hyperparameters  during  transfer  learning, 
which significantly enhanced the performance. Additionally, fine-tuning 
the top layers of the convolutional base on our dataset further contrib-
uted to the overall success of our method.

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information about the specific process used to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, common practices include model serialization, which involves saving the model architecture and weights into a file or database, and platform selection, where the deployment environment is chosen based on factors such as scalability, security, and ease of integration. Other considerations may also apply depending on the use case and requirements.
