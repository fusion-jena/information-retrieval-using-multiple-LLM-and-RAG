Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

whilst providing very reasonable data and computational requirements. 
In Section 6, we discuss the advantages and limitations of the model and 
future work. And finally, we summarize the main findings in Section 7.

The condition score is then calculated using Eq. (9).

(6)  

D0,  min  defines the time taken for the ecological target to reach a con-
dition score of 1- ε from a condition score of 0. FERM then assumes that 
the time taken to reach a condition score of 1- ε is linear within respect to 
the condition score at the start of the wet spell. Epsilon is used to solve 
the asymptotic nature of the curve, which allows for physically-based 
parameterization.

Query: "What are the postprocessing steps involved after the model training (e.g., Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, Confusion matrix)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on discussing the study area, parameters, equations, and calculations related to the ecological target and its condition score. Therefore, it is not possible to provide specific details regarding the postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices. These concepts typically belong to the field of machine learning and computer vision, while the provided context appears to be more related to environmental science or hydrology.
