The implementation of the CNN classiﬁer was done in Python
programming language (https://www.python.org/), using the
Keras high level deep learning library (https://keras.io/), and Ten-
sorFlow with graphical processing unit (GPU) execution as the
back-end engine (https://www.tensorﬂow.org/). The regions of
the images most informative for the decision making process in
the deep learning model were visualized using Gradient-
weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM; (Selvaraju et al.,
2017)). As an output, heatmaps were generated that indicated
important aspects of the each head capsule used to determine
the taxonomic decision-making process of the model.

2014), which is suggested for relatively small datasets such as ours
(Ng et al., 2015; Peng et al., 2018). The CNN model (Fig. 2) is trained
using a two-stage process. In the ﬁrst stage only a top classiﬁer
(fully connected layer) is trained based on features extracted from
processing images with a pretrained convolutional part of the net-
work. In the second stage, an adjustment of the network in a ﬁne-
tuned manner (using smaller learning rates) is done by training it
as a whole. A two phase approach was used to speed up the process
by preserving pretrained encoder weights in the ﬁrst phase of the
training and achieve optimal model performance using the second
phase. We also applied data augmentation by randomly deforming
input images in each training cycle due to the small sample size.
Additionally, dropout techniques (Hinton et al., 2012) were applied
to extracted features to enhance model robustness.

cies level (Table 2). The network performed surprisingly well con-
sidering the ImageNet dataset does not contain any similar object
(e.g., does not contain non-biting midges). As expected, the results
further improved when ﬁne-tuning was applied in the second
training phase, where the whole network was trained allowing
the model to learn additional features speciﬁc to our dataset.

Helpful Answer:

The text does not explicitly mention the specific optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does provide some clues about the methods employed to improve the model's performance. For instance, the authors use a two-stage training process, where the first stage involves training only a top classifier (fully connected layer) based on features extracted from processing images with a pretrained convolutional part of the network. This suggests that they might have used transfer learning, leveraging pretrained models like VGG or ResNet, which often employ optimizers like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam).

In the second stage, the network undergoes fine-tuning with smaller learning rates, indicating that the initial learning rate could be higher during the first stage. Fine-tuning allows the model to learn additional features specific to their dataset, improving its overall performance. Although the exact optimization technique isn't mentioned, this process implies the usage of adaptive learning rate algorithms like Adam or RMSprop.

Moreover, the authors apply data augmentation by randomly deforming input images in each training cycle to address the issue of having a small sample size. Data augmentation helps prevent overfitting and improves the model's generalization capabilities. Additionally, dropout techniques are utilized to enhance model robustness by preventing complex co-adaptations between neurons. Dropout can be considered a regularization method rather than an optimization technique, but it still contributes significantly to enhancing the model's performance.

In conclusion, while the text doesn't directly state the optimization techniques used, it hints at possible methods like SGD, Adam, or other adaptive learning rate algorithms through the application of transfer learning, fine-tuning, and data augmentation.
