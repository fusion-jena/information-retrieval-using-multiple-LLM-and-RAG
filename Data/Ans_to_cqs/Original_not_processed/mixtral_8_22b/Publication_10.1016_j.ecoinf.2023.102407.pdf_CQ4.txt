them for data augmentation.

Because the teacher model is initially trained using only DL  with a 
small amount of observation data, its accuracy may be lower compared 
to SDMs trained with sufficient observation data. We alleviate this by re- 
training the teacher model using augmented DT and generating pseudo- 
labels for unlabeled data. These steps are performed every 100 epochs 
(Line 4 in Algorithm 1) and terminate when the number of epochs for 
training the student model reaches a predefined value (Line 3 in Algo-
rithm 1). This incremental data augmentation improves the accuracy of 
the initial teacher model, which in turn improves the accuracy of the 
student  model,  resulting  in  more  accurate  predictions  of  species 
distribution.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide specific details about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that data augmentation is done using Deep Transfer (DT), which could potentially involve various techniques such as flipping, rotating, scaling, etc. The process involves retraining the teacher model using augmented DT and generating pseudo-labels for unlabeled data. This is done every 100 epochs and continues until the number of epochs for training the student model reaches a predefined value. This incremental data augmentation helps improve the accuracy of both the teacher and student models, leading to more accurate predictions of species distribution.
