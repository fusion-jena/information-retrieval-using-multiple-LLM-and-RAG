%Query
Query: "What are the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet)? "

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The information provided does not contain any details about a deep learning pipeline or specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it mentions the use of NDVI datasets (NDVI3g) generated from AVHRR sensors by the Global Inventory Monitoring and Modeling Studies (GIMMS) in the research. Therefore, based on the given context, we can only confirm that the NDVI dataset was used in the research, but no other specific datasets related to deep learning pipelines were mentioned.
