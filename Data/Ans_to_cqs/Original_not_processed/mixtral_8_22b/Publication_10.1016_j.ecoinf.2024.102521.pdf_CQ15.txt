dataset  (Fig.  4,  legend),  it  encompasses  only  a  tiny  fraction  of  insect 
diversity.  Thus,  STARdbi  provides  a  built-in  mechanism  for  users  to 
manually  label  some  of  their  images,  and  trigger  retraining.  These 
innovative features are not available in existing datasets of annotated 
insect  images  (e.g.,  Ciampi  et  al.,  2023;  Wang  et  al.,  2020).  We  also 
acknowledge the rapid development pace of general AI-based methods 
for  image  processing,  with  the  speed  and  accuracy  of  the  algorithms 
steadily improving. Thus, we aim to periodically replace the networks 
that are currently implemented in STARdbi by new state-of-the-art ones 
as better algorithms are released. With this in mind, we don’t focus on 
STARdbi’s performance compared to other AI software for insect iden-
tification. In fact, we welcome suggestions for improved models from

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline of STARdbi or any other mentioned systems. However, based on common practices in deep learning, popular optimization techniques include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSprop), and others. Without explicit mention in the provided context, one cannot definitively determine which optimization technique is employed in these systems.
