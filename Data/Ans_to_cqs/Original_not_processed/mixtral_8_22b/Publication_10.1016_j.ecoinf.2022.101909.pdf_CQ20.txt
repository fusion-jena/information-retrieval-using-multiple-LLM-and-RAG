CNN training was run successfully, and the optimized weights of the 
model were stored. To evaluate the predictive performance in the testing 
dataset, we plotted the P (cid:0) R curves of all classes on the same graph 
(Fig. 5). The points of each curve closest to the coordinate (1, 1) corre-
spond to the best performance in the prediction, with the threshold θ 
associated with that point. The observed performance was ideal in the 
Scytalopus  magellanicus class  and very  close to the ideal in a majority 
group of classes. The curves that were separated from this group rep-
resented classes far from the ideal: Glaucidium nana (a) and Glaucidium 
nana (b), which in turn were augmented with simulated samples. This 
suggests three likely sources of conflict: (1) inconsistency between real 
and simulated samples, (2) less relative differentiation between classes 
belonging to the same species and (3), in the case of G. nana (a), a gap of

We applied the transfer learning and fine-tuning technique with the 
deep learning model ResNet50 (He et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2018), which 
was already pre-trained on ImageNet data (Deng et al., 2009). Transfer 
learning is a technique that enabled us to overcome the issue of shortage 
of  training  data  and  construct  a  model  efficiently  by  transferring 
knowledge  from  a  similar  task  to,  in  this  case,  our  target  task.  The 
implemented  architecture  received  RGB  images  of  224×224×3  as 
inputs—in this case, color spectrograms of two-second durations—and 
included  only  the  feature  extraction  layers  from  the  ResNet50,  dis-
carding the superior classification layers (known as the top network). 
The newly created model reconfigured the top network with two fully 
connected  layers  (FC)  that  could  learn  new  features.  To  reduce  over-
fitting and imitate the training of a set of different models, a dropout
