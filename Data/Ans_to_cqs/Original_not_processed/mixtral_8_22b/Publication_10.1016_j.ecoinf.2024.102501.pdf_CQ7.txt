In addition,  in the prediction  of dissolved oxygen in  water, (Chen 
et  al.,  2020)  not  only  applied  water  quality  parameters  but  also 
considered parameters such as temperature, humidity, and atmospheric 
pressure in the air as input variables for the model, providing ideas for 
subsequent research. 

At last, for the dataset as listed in Table 1, and, three different data 
processing methods were trained and tested using the proposed method,

The  above  results  and  analyses  show  that  traditional  machine 
learning  methods  (SVR)  and  deep  learning  methods  (LSTM)  can  be 
adapted  to  address  the  problems  of  poor  generalization  ability,  local 
optimum, underfitting, and overfitting of conventional models to predict 
DO concentration successfully. The machine learning and deep learning 
literature also discuss the prediction of DO concentration. For example, 

Models

3.1. Data and test environment 

In this experiment, the data from the first eight days were used as the 
training set, and the data from the last two days were used as the vali-
dation set. The four water quality parameters, Ec, Tem, Tur, and H, were 
used as inputs of the model to predict the DO concentration after 10 min. 
The test environment consisted of an Intel I5–5200U processor with 
CPU clock speed of 2.2 GHz and memory of 8 GB. The operating system 
was Windows 10 (64-bit). The programming language was Python 3.7 
(64-bit), and the integrated development environment was Anaconda 3, 
with Anaconda's sklearn package used for support vector regression and 
PyWavelets used for the wavelet transform.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, it is mentioned that the data from the first eight days were used as the training set, and the data from the last two days were used as the validation set. This indicates that the criterion used to split the data for deep learning model training was temporal, i.e., based on time. Specifically, the data collected during the initial period (first eight days) was used for training the model, while the data collected during the subsequent period (last two days) was used for validating the model. This approach is commonly used when dealing with time series data, where the goal is often to forecast future values based on historical observations. By splitting the data into training and validation sets based on time, one can ensure that the model is evaluated on unseen data that comes chronologically after the training data, which helps to assess its performance more accurately.
