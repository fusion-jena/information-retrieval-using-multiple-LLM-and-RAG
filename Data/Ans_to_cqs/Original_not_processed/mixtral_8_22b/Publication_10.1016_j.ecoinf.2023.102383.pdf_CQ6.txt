compressed,  reducing  to  only  a  few  pixels  in  deeper  CNN  layers.  For 
instance, an object with dimensions of 15 × 15 pixels in a UAV thermal 
image might be represented by just 1 pixel in the feature map from Layer 
4 of ResNet152 (refer to Fig. 4). The limited spatial resolution can lead to 
loss of fine details, making it difficult for the model to distinguish small 
objects from the background. Through FPN, different feature maps from 
different layers can complement each other, and deeper feature map can 
receive some spatial information from shallower layers. However, still 
certain  spatial  features  might  have  been  lost  during  the  process  of 
convolution operations. Consequently, the models of FRC_ResNet18FPN 
and FRC_ResNet34FPN can obtain higher AP for medium and large ob-
jects than the remaining models because they have less CNN layers than 
others.  Notably,  the  FRC_ResNet152FPN  obtains  the  best  detection

The family of residual neural networks includes ResNet18, ResNet34, 
ResNet50, ResNet101, and ResNet152 according to their number of CNN 
layers.  “Stage”  is  an  important term  in  the  context of  residual neural 
networks, which refers to a specific set of convolution layers that output 
feature maps with different resolutions. Take ResNet152 as an example 
in (Fig. 4), it consists of five stages (Conv1, Layer1, Layer2, Layer3, and 
Layer4) and each stage can produce a feature map. The spatial resolution 
of each feature map is progressively reduced by a factor of 2, while the 
number of bands is simutanously increased by a factor of 2. Usually, the 
traditional FPN neglects the feature maps from Conv1, Layer1 and Layer 
2 and only incorporates the two feature maps from Layer 3 and Layer 4. 
For  the  detection  of  large  objects  from  high-resolution  true-color  im-
ages, this may work well. However, for the small objects in UAV thermal

the output of Layer4 and is upsampled by a factor of 2 denoted by D5. 
The output of Layer3 undergoes a 1 × 1 convolutional layer to reduce its 
channel dimensions to be same with C5  denoted by E4. By element-wise 
addition, M4  is generated and satisfies with the equation of M4 = D5 +
E4.  Then,  by  a  3 × 3  convolutional  operation,  the  feature  map  P4  is 
created. Then, M4  is downsampled by a factor of 2 to be D4. The output 
of  Layer2  undergoes  a  1 × 1  convolutional  layer  to  generate  E3.  By 
element-wise addition, M3 is generated and satisfies with the equation of 
M3 = D4 + E3. Similarly, M2  and M1  can be generated and satisfy the 
following equations: M2 = D3 + E2  and M1 = D2 + E1. Subsequently, by 
3 × 3 convolutional operations, M1, M2, M3, and M4 are used to generate 
four feature maps denoted by P1, P2, P3, and P4. Finally, P5  is generated 
by  downsampling  P4.  Five  feature  maps  are  resulted  and  denoted  as

Deeper layers derive additional features from the output of shallower 
layers  through  progressive  downscaling.  Consequently,  feature  maps 
from shallower layers contain more spatial feature information due to 
higher resolution, while those from deeper layers have more bands and 
may  provide  more  abstract  semantic  feature  information.  However, 
when dealing with small objects containing only a limited number of 
pixels, the vital spatial information about these objects can potentially 
be lost in the deeper layers as part of the downsizing process, which may 
not  only  fail  to  contribute  to  detection  process  but  can  also  diminish 
detection precision. Additionally, to ensure that the predicted RoIs align

Helpful Answer:

While the given context does not directly address the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, I can provide some general insights based on common practices. Preprocessing steps often involve data cleaning, normalization, and augmentation. Data cleaning involves removing or correcting erroneous data points, such as missing values or outliers. Normalization scales the input data to a standard range, typically between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1, to improve convergence during training. Scaling adjusts the scale of the input data to prevent any single feature from dominating the others. Lastly, data augmentation generates new samples by applying transformations like rotation, flipping, or zooming to existing ones, helping to increase the size and diversity of the dataset.
