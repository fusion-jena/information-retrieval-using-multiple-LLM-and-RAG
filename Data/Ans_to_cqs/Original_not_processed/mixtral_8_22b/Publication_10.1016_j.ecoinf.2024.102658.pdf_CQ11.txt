3. The study area and data

Question: %INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the provided pieces of context to answer the query in less than 400 words. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

%Query
Query: "What is the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The data and codes created in the research are available at <https://github.com/RyokoNod/sdm-asian-elephants>. Additionally, for informally exploring all outputs of models, an interactive map is available at <https://miro.mind.com/app/board/uXjVOX_Zhf8=/>. However, it should be noted that these links do not appear to be direct repositories like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Instead, they seem to lead to GitHub and Miro, which are platforms often used for sharing code and visualizations respectively.
