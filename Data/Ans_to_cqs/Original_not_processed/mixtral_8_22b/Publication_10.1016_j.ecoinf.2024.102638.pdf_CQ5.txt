considered.

The dataset is then divided into training sets, which comprise 80% of 
the  data,  and  a  test  set  representing  the  remaining  20%,  in  order  to 
maximise model training while maintaining a sufficient amount of data 
for robust model validation (Adjuik and Davis, 2022; Fern´andez-L´opez 
et al., 2020). This division is done by random sampling to ensure that 
both subsets are representative of the overall dataset and minimise the 
risk  of  bias.  Randomisation  helps  to  preserve  the  distribution  of  key 
features  and  target  variables  across  both  training  and  test  sets, 
enhancing the generalisability of the model. We leverage the scikit-learn 
function GridSearchCV to meticulously fine-tune the hyperparameters of 
each model within the confines of the training set, aiming to enhance 
their predictive performance. A five-fold cross-validation is used and the 
negative mean square error is set as the target measure. Following this

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention any specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the study uses a dataset containing various environmental features like soil moisture, pressure, precipitation, air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, global radiation, reflected radiation, atmospheric radiation, emitted radiation, sensible heat flux, latent heat flux, carbon dioxide flux, etc. These features are sourced from different stations like Soil Moisture Probe, Radiation Station, Eddy Covariance Station, and AEMET (Agencia Estatal de Meteorología). The dataset is divided into training and testing sets with an 80:20 ratio using random sampling to maintain representativeness and minimize bias. Hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV function from scikit-learn library, employing a five-fold cross-validation method and negative mean square error as the target metric.
