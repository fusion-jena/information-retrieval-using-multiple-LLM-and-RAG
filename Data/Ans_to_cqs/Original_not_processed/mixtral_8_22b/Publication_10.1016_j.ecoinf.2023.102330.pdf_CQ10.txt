Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The code repository link of the deep learning pipeline is <https://github.com/GAMELab-UGA>. This link provides access to all R and JAGS code, sample data, and results generated and analyzed during the current study. Additionally, python source code used to design, train, and test the northern bobwhite convolutional neural network (CNN) is available for download at <https://github.com/GAMELab-UGA> along with a pre-trained model.
