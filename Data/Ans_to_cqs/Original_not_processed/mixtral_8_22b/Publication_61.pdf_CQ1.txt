3. Dataset

Deep learning approaches require a vast amount of examples to
perform well, otherwise the models can overﬁt to the data. For ex-
ample, COCO (common objects in context) dataset has more than
330,000 of images (Lin et al., 2014). Under those circumstances, it is
essential to build our own dataset due to the lack of previous in-
formation. In this section, we present the methodology that we follow
to build our dataset coupled with an analysis of it.

3.1. Case of study

The Tehuacán-Cuicatlán Valley is located in the south of Mexico,
between the states of Puebla and Oaxaca. The center of the area is lo-
cated at 18.1605° latitude and −97.4202° longitude (decimal degrees)
and covers an area of 10,000 km2. See Fig. 2. Its arid condition is due to
natural walls that surround it, by east the east mountain chain (sierra

5.4. Dataset extension

The proposed approach has shown good performance (accuracy) for
cactus recognition in aerial images. One way to improve the current
accuracy could be to make deeper the current CNN, however, im-
proving the accuracy with a deeper network will tend to memorize the
dataset due to the model capacity (Goodfellow et al., 2016), causing
model overﬁtting. A better improvement to the current work is to in-
clude more examples in the dataset. Such examples should be obtained
under diﬀerent conditions, some variations are diﬀerent daylight con-
ditions or diﬀerent year seasons. Diﬀerent season pictures will provide
a distinctive context because the rainy season changes all valley's ve-
getation.

6. Conclusions

tion. With the modiﬁed images a CNN was trained to classify three
diﬀerent legume species: white bean, red bean and soybean. A relevant
approach for deep learning is a form of transfer learning. It is well
known that deep learning networks need large amounts of data to be
trained, this has led to the use of pre-trained networks that are latter
ﬁne-tuned with speciﬁc data of the addressed problem. The aim is to
take advantage of the knowledge learned from one problem to apply it
to another closely related problem. In (Ghazi et al., 2017), three re-
cognized deep learning architectures, namely GoogLeNet, AlexNet, and
VGGNet, were used to identify the plant species captured in a photo-
graph. The authors studied the impact of critical factors (iteration size,

batch size, and data augmentation) aﬀect the ﬁne-tuning of pre-trained
models. DeepPlant is another example of a system for plant identiﬁ-
cation based on a CNN that uses a pre-training approach (Lee et al.,
2015). Background textures it is always an element that complicates the
classiﬁcation task. Xiao et al. proposed a segmentation and crop
method, based on Fourier transformations and a K-means algorithm, to
generate a region of interest in the images; the cropped images are then
used to train a CNN for diﬀerent plant species classiﬁcation (Xiao et al.,
2018). CNN have not been used only for taxonomic classiﬁcation of
plants, but also for the detection of diseases that can aﬀect them
(Sladojevic et al., 2016).

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, the authors discuss building their own dataset due to the lack of previous information. They focus on the case study of the Tehuacán-Cuicatlán Valley in Mexico, which is an arid region surrounded by natural walls. However, they do not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.

Generally speaking, there are various methods for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines. These include:

1. Surveys: Data collection through surveys involves gathering information directly from individuals using structured questionnaires. This method is often employed when human input is required, such as labeling images or providing subjective opinions.

2. Sensors: Sensor data collection involves capturing real-world signals using devices like cameras, microphones, temperature sensors, etc. This type of data is commonly used in applications such as object detection, speech recognition, and weather forecasting.

3. Public datasets: Utilizing existing datasets available publicly is another common method for obtaining raw data. These datasets may contain labeled or unlabeled samples depending on the application. Examples of popular public datasets include ImageNet, CIFAR-10, MNIST, and COCO.

Based on the provided context, it appears that the authors might have collected their raw data using sensor data collection methods, specifically aerial images. However, without explicit confirmation, it remains uncertain what exact methods were used for collecting raw data in their deep learning pipeline.
