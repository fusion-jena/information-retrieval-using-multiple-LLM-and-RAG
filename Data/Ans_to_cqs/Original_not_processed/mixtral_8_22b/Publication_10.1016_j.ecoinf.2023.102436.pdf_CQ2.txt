and Puschmann (2019) applied a convolutional neural network for the 
automatic  recognition  of  woody  regrowth  vegetation  in  repeat  land-
scape  photographs. By comparing  the changes between repeat  photo-
graphs, planners and designers can identify general trends of landscape 
change.  Although  these  image-based  methods  are  powerful  tools  to 
assess and track landscape visual quality, design projects’ aesthetic and 
scientific meaning may be transformed or lost during the modification 
and  application  process  in  the  widely  used  visualization  tools,  like 
Rhino, Sketchup, and 3D Max (Urech et al., 2020). Moreover, image- 
based  methods  fail  to  capture  or  represent  some  spatial attributes  (e. 
g.,  volumes),  which  is  also  a  key  component  within  the  landscape 
composition. Extracting and representing spatial attributes from the 3D

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images. Specifically, the research papers mentioned use landscape photographs and convolutional neural networks for automatic recognition of woody regrowth vegetation in repeat landscape photographs. However, there is no explicit mention of other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV files being used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, we can only infer that images are the main data format used in this particular case.
