However, for machine learning algorithms like backpropagation to 
be successful, a critical condition must be met: all functions involved 
must be differentiable to compute gradients accurately. As said above, 
to make the update criterion differentiable, we use the Gumbel softmax 

function.  So,  by  changing  our  update  criterion  to

Uk,  we  manage  to 

compute the gradients. 

This new data-driven architecture aims to learn the neighbourhood 
relationship Rk to improve the results of our model. In addition, learning 
the  neighbourhood  relationship  has  value  in  itself,  as  it  allows  us  to 
know and learn how the different elements of the system interact. For 
this purpose, as we can see in Fig. 13 a neural network ANN (or other 
objects) might be defined as Rk, which may take two kinds of inputs:

Despite the positive outcomes yielded by our model, we contend that 
substantial improvements could be achieved by implementing a more 
flexible and complete neighbourhood relation Rk  in terms of variables. 
For  this  reason,  in  Section  5,  we  explore  an  architecture  capable  of 
learning  such  neighbourhood  relationships  through  experience  and 
accumulated data. 

5. Intelligent cellular scheme 

In this section, we aim to present an innovative architecture that uses 
existing  data  and  historical  databases  to  generalize  the  concept  of 
neighbourhood relations. To achieve it, machine learning is a powerful 
tool, with a backpropagation algorithm (Rumelhart et al., 1986) at the 
heart of it.

function. We also avoid defining parameters, this allows us to learn non- 
linear  relationships  with  an  infection  capacity  greater  than  those 
established in (Boters-Pitarch et al., 2023a). Thirdly, the φ filter ensures 
that the expansion is carried out only by the infected elements of the 
system,  making  the  ΔID  parameter  decisive  during  learning,  which 
represents a significant advance over the previous relationship. Finally, 
using the sigmoid activation function σ (or similar) as the output of the 
network guarantees that all the cells of the neighbourhood relationship 
can  be  interpreted  as  probabilities,  without  having  to  consider  those 
with a probability greater than one, i.e. Rk ∈ [0, 1]N×,N.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the proposed intelligent cellular scheme. However, it mentions that a neural network (ANN) is employed to define the neighborhood relationship Rk. This suggests that some form of artificial neural network is utilized within the model. The backpropagation algorithm is mentioned as being central to the approach, which is commonly associated with feedforward neural networks. Nevertheless, without further information, it cannot be definitively stated whether the model specifically employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), transformers, or another type of deep learning model.
