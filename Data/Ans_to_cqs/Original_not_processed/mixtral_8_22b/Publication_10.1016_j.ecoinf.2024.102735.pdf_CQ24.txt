Data-driven models have evolved as effective decision-support tools
for HABs monitoring and prediction. These models are essential for
using patterns between water quality parameters and ecosystem vari-
ables to predict algal-related parameters such as chlorophyll-a, phyco-
cyanin, algal cells, and toxins (Busari et al., 2023; Kimambo et al.,
2019). Machine learning (ML) models such as random forest (RF),
Multilayer perceptron (MLP), long-short term memory (LSTM), and
support vector regression (SVR) have been used successfully to predict
different algal-related parameters and help identify drivers of HABs (Liu
et al., 2019; Qian et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2015, Busari et al., 2023).
Model predictions are, however, influenced by varying degrees of un-
certainty (Gawlikowski et al., 2023). According to Guzman et al. (2015),
uncertainty refers to the variation between the actual state of a variable
and its theoretical assessment at a particular time. These prediction

Uncertainty bands were calculated for each ML model based on the
distribution of predictions made for individual test data points. The
prediction distributions were used to estimate the amount of uncertainty
covered for every instant prediction made by each model. These pre-
diction distributions stem from utilizing optimized models developed
through randomized subsets of training data. This strategy emulates the

RF can handle a variety of data formats, including numerical and
categorical variables, without costly data preprocessing. Even with high-
dimensional datasets, the model performs well and can effectively
capture complicated correlations between features and target variables
(Ao et al., 2019). The major parameters influencing the performance of
the RF model and upon which optimization is focused in this study are
the n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_split, and min_samples_leaf.
The n_estimators determine the number of trees in the random forest
model. While increasing the value of this parameter improves the pre-
diction performance, high values are also associated with more runtime
and high memory requirements. The max_depth parameter impacts the
depth of the trees in the forest. The parameter is responsible for how
deeply the model captures relationships in the data. The min_sam-
ples_split parameter determines the minimum number of samples

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that one strategy employed to handle randomness in the machine learning pipeline is through utilizing optimized models developed via randomized subsets of training data. This approach helps to generate prediction distributions, which can then be used to estimate the amount of uncertainty covered for every instant prediction made by each model. However, the context does not provide specific information about handling randomness related to deep learning pipelines or random seed values. Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed response regarding those aspects.
