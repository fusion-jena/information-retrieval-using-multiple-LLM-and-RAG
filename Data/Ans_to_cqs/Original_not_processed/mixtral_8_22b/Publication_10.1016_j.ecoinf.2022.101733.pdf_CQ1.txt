situation is for the samples to be surveyed in the field. However, because 
these data are sometimes difficult to gather, researchers may be tempted 
to employ fewer sample points. Time and access constraints in croplands 
and other remote environments may force researchers to obtain training 
and validation sample points from imagery rather than field validation, 
i.e., through image interpretation, as has been done here, which benefits 
sample selection from both fields survey and GE HR images. Although 
the certainty of a training sample’s class may be poor in some situations, 
this  method  allows  for  the  quick  and  efficient  gathering  of  a  higher 
number of training samples, allowing for a bigger sample collection size.

McNemars’ test

• batch 1: visible (red, green, and blue) bands of Sentinel-2 data  
• batch 2: twelve MS bands of Sentinel-2 data  
• batch 3: MS + spectral indices  
• batch 4: MS + spectral features + Sentinel-1 bands  
• batch  5:  MS  + spectral  features  + textural  features  + Sentinel-1

according to a 60%–40% ratio. Table 6 presents the details about the 
total number of samples, the training, and the validation samples. The 
distribution of samples is represented in Fig. 8. It is worthy to note that 
after selecting the samples, we checked all the samples carefully and as 
we see in Fig. 8 (as an example); surprisingly, no mis-collected samples 
were detected in the automatically collected samples.

Helpful Answer:
The study utilizes various methods for collecting raw data in its deep learning pipeline. For instance, it employs field surveys to collect samples, although this can be challenging due to time and access constraints in remote environments. In such cases, researchers resort to obtaining training and validation sample points from imagery instead of field validation. This involves interpreting images, benefiting sample selection from both fields survey and high-resolution Google Earth images. Despite the potential uncertainty in determining a training sample's class, this approach enables the rapid and efficient accumulation of a larger number of training samples.

Moreover, the study uses satellite data from Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 missions. From Sentinel-2, it extracts visible red, green, and blue bands, twelve multispectral bands, spectral indices, and spectral features. Additionally, it incorporates Sentinel-1 bands, textural features, and Digital Surface Model (DSM). These diverse sets of features are analyzed using McNemar's test to understand their impact on the model's performance.

Furthermore, the study visualizes the initial datasets using true color composites, false color composites, and specific band combinations of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 data. It also includes AW3D30 data, likely used for topographical information or digital elevation models.

In summary, the study combines field surveys, image interpretation, and publicly available satellite data from Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 missions to collect raw data for its deep learning pipeline.
