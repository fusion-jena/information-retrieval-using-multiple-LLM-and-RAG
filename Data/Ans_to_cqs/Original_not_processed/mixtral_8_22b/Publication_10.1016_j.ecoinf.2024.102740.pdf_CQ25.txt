1. Introduction  

Grasslands  are  among  the  leading  terrestrial  ecosystems  (Zhang  et  al.,  2022), 

occupying more than 40% of the world’s terrestrial area, a third of the agricultural area 

in  Europe,  and  storing  about  a  third  of  the  world’s  terrestrial  biomass  stock  (O‘Mara, 

2012; Stumpf et al., 2020 Bar-On et al., 2018; Erb et al., 2017).  

Moreover, grassland agroecosystems are of significant importance in the production of

shaft number value was tested from 1 to 100 and the minimum sample number from 1 

to 50. Finally, the most accurate results for RF were obtained when the maximum tree 

depth was set to 10 and the minimum number of samples was set to 2. The regression

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the machine learning (not specifically deep learning) model in this context is for classification. The authors use Random Forest (RF) algorithm, a supervised machine learning method, to generate accurate, dynamic information on grassland. This information includes aboveground biomass and nutritive characteristics, which are crucial for sustainable ecosystem management and conservation. The model is trained using ground data points and validated using out-of-bag samples. The goal is to create an unbiased internal estimate of the generalization error. The optimal parameters for the RF model are determined through testing different values for the maximum shaft number and the minimum sample number. The final model is then used to classify grassland species into two main clusters, enabling sustainable grassland management.
