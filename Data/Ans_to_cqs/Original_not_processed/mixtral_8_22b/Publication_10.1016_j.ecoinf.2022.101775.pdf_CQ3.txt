2.2. Embedding layers 

(5)  

Embedding  layers  are  modules  of  deep  neural  networks  that  are 
generally  implemented  in  natural  language  processing  problems 
(Sharma  et  al.,  2020)  and  collaborative  filtering  (He  et  al.,  2017) 
because they can solve the one-hot encoding problem (Yu et al., 2022), 
where the latent representations in the classic models are composed of 
sparse representations generally using vectors mainly composed of zero 
layers  replace  such  dispersed  vectors  with 
values.  Embedding

lations and adapt well to data generated by WSNs (de Wolff et al., 2021), 
if such data do not present a substantial loss of information (Liu et al., n. 
d.;  Liu  et  al.,  2018).  However,  this  represents  a  significant  challenge 
because, currently, the information generated by low-cost WSNs should 
be pre-processed, and, at the same time, the data assurance and quality 
of their growing volume of information should be maintained. Hence, 
matrix factorization (MF) (Rivera-Mu˜noz et al., 2021), and their variants 
using deep learning (Deep Matrix Factorization - DMF) emerged as an 
alternative because they can recover a significant amount of information 
that was not sampled by modeling non-linear interactions of input data 
(sensors,  time  instants).  This  property  enables  the  exploitation  of  the 
spatial-temporal  correlations  and  a  better  adaptation  to  the  data  of 
WSNs (De Handschutter et al., 2021; Xue et al., 2017a).

%Query
Query: "What are the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., bounding box annotation, instance segmentation)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, including bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, it is not possible to accurately determine which data annotation techniques were employed based solely on the provided context.
