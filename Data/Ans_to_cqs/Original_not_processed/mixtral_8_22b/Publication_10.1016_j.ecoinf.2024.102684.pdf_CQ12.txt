Pre-trained  networks  offer  architectures  with  various  convolution 
operations that allow them to extract patterns within the images effi-
ciently.  After  the  convolutional  layers  of  pre-trained  networks,  it  is 
necessary to add a fully connected network architecture, also known as 
multi-layer perceptron. These layers are usually located at the end, and 
are responsible for reproducing the predictions of the final output. We 
compared different fully connected network architectures, exploring up 
to  three  hidden  layers  with  8,  16,  32,  and  64  neurons  in  each  layer. 
Consequently,  we  generated  12  models  for  each  dataset  trained  with 
different fully connected architectures. The output layer consisted of a 
single  neuron  with  a  sigmoid  activation  function,  producing  invasion 
predictions between 0.0 and 1.0.

of the models. For instance, Mil`a et al. (2022) used the Nearest Neighbor 
Distance Matching (NNDM) LOO CV method to delineate a geographic 
space  in  which  predictions  can  be  made.  Many  of  these  approaches 
accurately  demonstrate  the  model's  transfer  learning  capabilities,  yet 
they  impose  limitations  on  the  training  domain,  leading  to  reduced 
training  heterogeneity  (Meyer  and  Pebesma,  2021).  However,  con-
ducting large CV experiments with deep learning-based models is often 
infeasible due to  their high computational costs. Deep  learning-based 
models  typically  employ  simple  data  partitioning  strategies,  such  as 
training, validation, and testing (Ocer et al., 2020). This simple scheme 
can help to add heterogeneous information to the training procedure, 
but may also overlook the diversity of heterogeneous spatial information 
in remotely sensed data that is aligned with different learning domains

While  adopting  deep  learning  techniques  in  remote  sensing  has 
surged, providing novel solutions to complex problems and the devel-
opment of model validation frameworks has lagged, creating a gap in the 
reliability  of  these  advanced  models  (Filippelli  et  al.,  2024).  Deep 
learning models, including CNN architectures and traditional machine 
learning models, frequently underperform in predicting species presence 
or  coverage  in  previously  unconsidered  areas.  This  limitation,  often 
referred  to  as  the  model's  inability  to  generalize  or  transfer  learned 
patterns to new contexts (transfer learning), becomes particularly pro-
nounced in diverse landscapes characterized by significant variations in 
terrain  and  spectral properties  (Barela  et  al., 2021; Kattenborn et  al., 
2022;  Meyer  and  Pebesma,  2021).  The  complex  nature  of  these  het-
erogeneous  environments  poses  significant  challenges  for  model  vali-

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it does refer to "pre-trained networks" and "convolutional layers," suggesting that a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) might have been employed. Additionally, the phrase "fully connected network architecture" indicates the use of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) after the convolutional layers. Therefore, based on this context, it appears that a combination of CNN and MLP was utilized in the pipeline.
