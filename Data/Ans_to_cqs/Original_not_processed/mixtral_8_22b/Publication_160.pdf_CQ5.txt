Since the mid-2000s, automated image classification has seen vast
improvements, most notably in the development of deep Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs). Most researchers now consider the task of
image classification to have achieved its optimum potential (Rawat and
Wang, 2017) in light of the outstanding performances of CNNs on well-
known datasets such as ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009). Since CNNs first
broke
recognition challenges
(Krizhevsky et al., 2012), the networks have grown deeper and more
efficient with various architectures (He et al., 2016a; Huang et al.,
2017; Szegedy et al., 2015). Complications can nonetheless arise in
applied cases such as species recognition. The variability of lighting
conditions and intra-species morphological diversity renders under-
water benthic species recognition particularly challenging (Beijbom
et al., 2012). Some studies have used machine learning algorithms for
the identification of coral reefs species (Beijbom et al., 2012; Marcos

While neural networks excel at image classification, notably re-
garding famous challenges such as ImageNet, their performance can be
curtailed in real-life classification problems, such as face recognition
(Zhou et al., 2015), medicine (De Fauw et al., 2018) or species identi-
fication (Mehdipour Ghazi et al., 2016). It should be noted that CNNs
alone can struggle with datasets if some classes are under-represented;
or if ground truth annotations are unreliable; or in the case of a fine-
grained classification task, where there are intricate links between
classes. Using CNNs in combination with other machine learning al-
gorithms, such as: linear models, random forests, Logistic Regression
(LR), and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) can improve classification
performances (Gao et al., 2017; Li and Yu, 2016). Li and Yu (2016) used
a random forest to process the feature activation map obtained from the
ReLU of a layer of an AlexNet network concatenated with hand-crafted

from underwater video using neural networks. Opt. Express 13, 8766. https://doi.

A ResNet152 was used as the baseline for classification perfor-
mance. This network was initially programmed using pre-trained
weights lifted from the ImageNet challenge. The top fully-connected
layer was replaced with a layer using ReLU activation, followed by a
dropout layer and a softmax layer, with outputs corresponding to the
number of classes (here 61). Firstly, the top layer was trained alone;
using features extracted from the convolutional layers, a Stochastic
Gradient Descent (SGD) with a learning rate of 10−3, and weight decay
rate set to 5 × 10−4. The whole network was then trained with SGD;

Helpful Answer:
The text mentions one dataset explicitly - ImageNet. ImageNet is a large visual database designed for use in visual object recognition software research. Over 14 million URLs of images have been hand-annotated to indicate what objects are pictured and in at least one million of the images, bounding boxes are also provided. More than 20,000 categories are included in this dataset. Other datasets mentioned indirectly include those used for face recognition, medical applications, and species identification. However, specific names of these datasets are not given in the provided context.
