2.3.3. Pest damage identification model 

In the current study, a machine learning algorithm, a CNN, was used 
to construct a pest hazard class classification model. The specific results 
are shown in Fig. 4. The above results are the experimental results of the 
author's  team,  specifically  referring  to  the  study  of  Ma,  L.  (Lei  et  al., 
2022). These sensitive spectral vegetation indices perform well in the 
1D-CNN model, with an overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient of 
89.50% and 0.8666, respectively. Figs. 4-a, 4-b, and 4-c show the results 
of  identifying  the  degree  of  damage  to  forest  trees  by  EJD  in  June, 
August, and September in the study area obtained based on the 1D-CNN 
algorithm, and its distribution was basically consistent with the distri-
bution of the actual affected forest trees.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, common practices include splitting the dataset randomly, stratified sampling, or time series split when dealing with temporal data. It is also important to ensure that the splits maintain the same distribution as the original dataset to avoid bias during training and evaluation.

Unhelpful Answer:
I do not have enough information from the given context to determine the exact criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training.
