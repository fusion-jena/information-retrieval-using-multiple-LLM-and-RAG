The supervised learning workflow adheres to the steps outlined in 
Sections 2.3.1–2.3.5. However, as detailed in Section 2.3.2, we deviated 
by not generating 400 random points over the entire boundary. Instead, 
we used the vegetation types described by Gertenbach (1983) to guide 
the placement of our sampling plots, from which we then collected the 
training and validation points (Fig. A.2). The creation of several small 
sampling plots within each vegetation type, instead of using one large 
area, also helped speed up the sampling process. Performing the data 
collection  within  the  sampling  plots  ensured  that  we  had  training/ 
validation  points  that  were  representative  of  the  diverse  vegetation 
within each boundary. To determine the size of the sampling plots, we 
first calculated 5% of the total area covered by the boundary, divided 
that area by the number of vegetation types intersecting the boundary

The results obtained in this study can be used as a baseline for future 
LULC  analysis  performed  with  other  methodologies,  such  as  deep 
learning  CNN  (Jagannathan  and  Divya,  2021).  Going  forward,  the 
analysis  of  aerial  images  of  KNP  taken  about  every  two  years  deep 
learning methods will be most effective and useful to map land cover or 
more specifically woody cover. Integrating large-area historical datasets 
in  land-use  and  land-cover  analysis  can  serve  as  a  resource  to  better 
understanding  long-term  landscape  changes  and  support  ecological 
monitoring programs. The results of studies such as this one can be used 
to  better  protect  and  preserve  our  natural  heritage,  enable  effective 
management  strategies,  and  contribute  to  the  conservation  of  global 
biodiversity.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it is not explicitly stated what specific data annotation techniques were used in the deep learning pipeline. However, there are some clues that suggest possible techniques. For example, the authors mention that they used vegetation types described by Gertenbach (1983) to guide the placement of their sampling plots, from which they then collected training and validation points. This suggests that they may have used point annotation, where individual pixels or locations are labeled with a particular class or category. Additionally, the authors mention that they created several small sampling plots within each vegetation type rather than using one large area, which could indicate that they used region-based annotation, where larger areas or regions are labeled with a particular class or category. It is also worth noting that the authors do not explicitly mention any object detection or semantic segmentation techniques, which would involve more complex annotations such as bounding boxes or pixel-level masks. Therefore, based on the available information, it seems likely that the authors primarily used point and region-based annotation techniques in their deep learning pipeline.
