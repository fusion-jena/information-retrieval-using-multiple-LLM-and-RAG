Training data were generated as batches of size (m, 256, 256, 3), where m is the batch size (m =
20 in our experiments). The batches consisted of sub-images of size 256 × 256 that were randomly
cropped out from the original satellite images presented in Table 1. We had a stream (internally, a
Python generator) of almost never repeated sub-images; these sub-images were combined into batches
and used for the neural network training. Satellite images for sites #1, #3, #5, #7–10 were used for
training and #2, #4, #6 for validation. Corresponding batches of mask data had shape (20, 256, 256, 1).
The network training assessment was performed on sub-images generated from image #2 (Table 1).
Images #4 and #6 were used for visualization and demonstration of the algorithm eﬃcacy.

2.5. Neural Network Implementation and Tuning

The U-Net-like CNN described in Algorithm A1 was implemented in a Python-based (Python
3.7.3 was used) computational environment, which was built on top of the Keras framework [54] using
Tensorﬂow [62] as a backend. All computations were performed on a PC with 1 GPGPU Nvidia Tesla
K80 with 16 GB of RAM and required up to 10 h to train one CNN architecture.

To tune the architecture of the neural network, we tested the following combinations of parameters
(Algorithm A1, line #24), which correspond to diﬀerent U-Net architectures: num_layers = {64, 32, 16},
depth = {2, 3, 4}, layer_rate = {2, 1.5, 1.2}, batch_norm = {True, False}, residual = {True, False}, dropout
= {0, 0.5}. Thus, we performed a grid search over 216 diﬀerent U-Net-like architectures and found
several of the best ones which are suitable for forest damage segmentation.

All of the best results corresponded to the conﬁguration when the number of layers was equal to
64, and dropout was applied. The best one, whereby an additional batch normalization is applied,
corresponds to the following parameters: num_layers = 64, depth = 4, layer_rate = 2, batch_norm =
True, residual = False, dropout = 0.5.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available in the given context to provide a detailed explanation about how the trained deep learning model was deployed. However, based on common practices in deep learning projects, after training the model, it would typically be saved or serialized so that it can be loaded later without having to retrain it again. This could involve saving the weights of the model or even the entire model structure itself. As for platform selection, this depends on the specific requirements of the project. It might be deployed on a cloud service like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure, or it could be integrated into a local application or system. Without more details, it's not possible to give a definitive answer regarding the deployment process of the trained deep learning model.
