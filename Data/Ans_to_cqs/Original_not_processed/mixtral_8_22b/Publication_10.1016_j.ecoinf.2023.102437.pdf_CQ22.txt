the idea to implement a pre-selection method in our comparative anal-
ysis. For this purpose, we have used the Python function “SelectKBest” 
from the toolbox “Scikitlearn”. This analysis allowed us to see that, un-
like the LSTM and Lasso models, the predictive results of the RF model 
were not necessarily impacted by the signature. However, R2 was >0.5 
for all three models, with LSTM and Lasso models exhibiting the highest 
correlation coefficients.

Our  findings  also  revealed  a  significant  reduction  in  computation 
time when ML models, along with preselection, were used. Unlike ex-
pected, pre-selection lowered the accuracy of the results, which likely 
indicates  a  loss  of  information  in  the  database  transformed  using  the 
signature method. As we expected that the Lasso model, in the absence 
of the signature method, would not provide convincing results; there-
fore, we only retained this analysis to maintain consistency in compar-
ison with the ML models. Though it is possible to extract PDPs from RF 
runs  coupled  with  the  signature  method,  their  interpretation  is  not 
possible because of this transformation. The amount of input data, or in 
our case, the size of the time series used during the learning phase of an 
ML  model,  can  have  a  non-negligible  influence  on  predictive  perfor-
mance (Bustillo et al., 2022; Derot et al., 2020b). In other words, a long

The  recurrent  neural  network  (RNN)  model  is  an  artificial  model 
used  for  processing  sequential  data.  RNNs  have  been  successfully 
applied  in  areas  such  as  speech  recognition,  language  models,  and 
translation,  where  the  material  is  continuous.  However,  RNN  have 
limitations  in  processing  past  information  if  there  is  a  considerable 
difference  in  time  duration  between  the  initial  and  final  parts  of  the 
data.  LSTM  (Long  Short-Term  Memory)  is  a  type  of  recurrent  neural 
network (RNN) architecture designed to address some of the limitations 
of  traditional  RNNs  when  it  comes  to  handling  long  sequences  and 
capturing long-term dependencies in data. LSTM networks are used in 
machine learning and deep learning for sequential data tasks, such as 
natural language processing, speech recognition, time series forecasting, 
and  more.  Especially,  LSTM  models  possess  the  ability  to  make  pre-

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, the paper titled "Enhancing land cover/land use (LCLU) classification through a comparative analysis of hyperparameters optimization approaches for deep neural network (DNN)" uses the metric RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. Additionally, the coefficient of determination (R^2) is mentioned as another metric used to assess the correlation between predicted and actual values. However, the context does not explicitly mention the use of accuracy, precision, or recall as evaluation metrics. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, it appears that RMSE and R^2 are the primary metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model.
