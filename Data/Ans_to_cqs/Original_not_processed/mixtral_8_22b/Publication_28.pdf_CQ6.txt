VAE initially draw an instance z from the code distribution pmodel(z). The 
sample is executed via a differentiable generator network g(z). Lastly, x 
undergo sampling from a distribution Pmodel(x; g(z)) = pmodel(x| z). At the 
time of training process, the estimated inference network (or encoder) q 
(z| x)  can  be  employed  for  obtaining  z  and  Pmodel  (x| z)  is  afterward 
considered  as  the  decoder  network  (Dai  et  al.,  2019).  The  main 
perception of VAE is that it can be trained using the maximization of the 
variational lower bound L(q) related to the data point x:

Stochastic  gradient  descent  (SGD)  on  BP  is  managing  stochastic 
input,  then  not  stochastic  unit  within  the  networks.  The  solution  is 
named as “reparameterization trick”, which is to transfer the sampling 
to input layer. It is easy from N(μ(x), θ(x)) by sampling ∈ ~ N(0, I), af-
terward calculating pmodelz = μ(x) + θ1/2(x) * e. Where μ(x) and θ(x) are 
the mean and covariance of (z| x). So, Eq. (13) is calculated as:

In VAE is comprised of input layer, various AEs, and output layer. 
Then, an unsupervised pre-training step, the supervised fine-tuning step 
is implemented for learning the entire network parameters by employ-
ing the BP technique. This technique is comprised of 1 input layer, 5 
hidden layers, and 1 output layer. 

4. Performance validation

During  the  classification  process,  the  VAE  model  gets  executed  to 
assign proper class labels to the applied satellite images. Autoencoder 
(AE) is a kind of NN which is trained to replace the input with the output. 
It includes a hidden layer h to define a code employed for input repre-
sentation. The network comprises of an encoder function z = f(x) and 
decoder function r = g(z), where x denotes the input data. The mean-
ingful features from the AE by the constraint that the z to have lower 
dimensions compared to x. The code of the AE which is lesser than the 
input  dimensions  are  known  as  under  complete.  The  learning  of  the 
undercomplete  depiction  enforces  the  AE  in  capturing  the  important 
characteristics of the training data. The VAE is a directed network which 
makes  use  of  learned  approximate  inferences  and  undergoes  training 
using gradient approaches. For generating a sample from the model, the

VAE model includes a series of operations such as pre-processing, Effi-
cientNet based feature extraction, IKHO based parameter optimization, 
and VAE based classification. Besides, the IKHO algorithm is designed by 
the  integration  of  KH  algorithm  with  FS  operator  to  avoid  the  local 
optimal problem of the KH algorithm. In addition, the PTDLEN based 
feature extractor by the use of parameter tuned EfficientNet model using 
IKHO  algorithm  helps  to  enhance  the  prediction  outcome  of  the 
PTDLEN-VAE model for unseen data. For validating the improved per-
formance  of  the  PTDLEN-VAE  method,  an  extensive  experimental 
analysis  take  place  on  benchmark  aerial  image  dataset.  The resultant 
experimental  values  highlighted  the  supremacy  of  the  proposed 
PTDLEN-VAE model over the other techniques. In future, the presented 
PTDLEN-VAE  model  can  be  deployed  in  unmanned  aerial  vehicles

Helpful Answer:
The given text does not provide explicit information about specific preprocessing steps used before training a deep learning model like Variational AutoEncoder (VAE). However, it mentions that during the generation of samples from the VAE model, there are several operations involved, including preprocessing. Preprocessing generally refers to preparing raw data into a suitable format for machine learning algorithms. Common preprocessing steps include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and augmentation. Normalization scales numeric columns to a range between 0 and 1, while standardization rescales data to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. Cleaning involves handling missing or inconsistent data points, and augmentation generates new data instances through transformations. Although these general preprocessing steps might apply to any deep learning model, the exact methods used would depend on the specific requirements and characteristics of the dataset being utilized.
