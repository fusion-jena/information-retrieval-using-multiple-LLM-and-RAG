Acknowledgment

We  strongly  believe  that  the  utilization  of  professional  tracking 
combined  with  community  involvement  through  citizen  science  data 
collection  of  footprints  and  state-of-the-art  machine  learning  holds 
immense potential as an additional non-invasive method in the toolbox 
of every conservationist for monitoring endangered and elusive species. 
This integrated approach allows for the collection of valuable data from 
both experts and the general public, fostering a collaborative effort in 
wildlife conservation.

%Query
Query: "Which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not explicitly mention which specific framework was used to build the deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if they used TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other framework based solely on the given context.
