2.2. Acoustic monitoring 

We  deployed  an  acoustic  recorder  (Song  Meter  SM2  recorder, 
Wildlife  Acoustics)  at  each  site.  The  Song  Meters  were  active  from  8 
June 2015 to 31 May 2016 and programmed to record (.wav format) the 
first 15 min of each hour. The sampling rate was 48 kHz, with 16 bits per 
sample resolution. The devices were checked weekly to download data 
and change batteries. A total of 32,023 15-min recordings (8006 h of 
recording) were collected (8044 at Station A, 8075 at Station B, 7782 at 
Station C, and 8122 at Station D).

%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any information about which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, it is impossible to determine whether AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or another platform was used based on this context alone.
