ering larger datasets. Also in this case, larger R2 values are found when 
considering L < 500.

Plants” always lead to R2 larger than 0.25. The results in Fig. 12 confirm 
that model (15) explains a significant portion of the variability observed 
in the skyline metrics. The sample variance shows the most significant 
dependency  on  distance  for  natural  objects  such  as  trees  and  other 
plants.  As  expected,  man-made  objects  such  as  “Houses”  and  “Other 
Buildings” show only a marginal dependency on the metric. 

3.3. Windowing 

The  analysis  discussed  above  has  been  repeated  by  introducing 
windowing.  In  particular,  linear  regression  has  been  performed  by 
considering windowed metrics with a variable window length. The R2 
obtained for the different metrics and for the different object classes is 
provided in Fig. 13 as a function of the window length, L. For the “Trees”

considered in addition to Eq. (15):

.

This model implies that the level of the variations (length) or fractal 

curve increases with the inverse of distance. 

than 0.12 in magnitude. A larger value for β is obtained for the class of 
“Trees”.  These  results  suggest  that  the  NSL  metric  is  only  weakly 
dependent on the distance, di. 

A stronger dependence is observed for the sample variance metric 
whose scatter plots are shown in Fig. 10. In this case, larger values, in 
magnitude, of β are found and, in particular, β = (cid:0) 0.7 is obtained for 
“Trees”. As for the previous case, β is negative for all classes but “Other 
Buildings”. 

Fig. 10 also shows the regression lines obtained by fixing β = (cid:0) 1: in

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no information available regarding how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether they used methods like grid search or random search.
