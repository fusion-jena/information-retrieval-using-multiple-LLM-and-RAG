The challenge for applying deep learning to natural systems is the need for large training datasets.
A lack of training data is a pervasive problem in remote sensing due to the cost of data collection
and annotation [13]. In addition, the spatial extent of training data often prohibits the ﬁeld-based
veriﬁcation of annotated objects. For tree detection, the high variation in tree crown appearance, due
to taxonomy, health status, and human management, increases the risk of overﬁtting when using small
amounts of training data [10]. One approach to addressing the data limitation in deep learning is
“self-supervised learning” (sensus [14]), which uses unsupervised methods to generate training data
that is used to train supervised models [15]. This approach has recently been applied to remote sensing
for hyperspectral image classiﬁcation [9]. Self-supervision, which only relies on unlabeled data, can be

combined with labeled data in a semi-supervised framework (sensu [14]), which may improve deep
learning on limited training data by providing neural networks the opportunity to learn generalized
features on a wider array of training examples, followed by retraining on a smaller number of high
quality annotations [16]. It is unknown whether moderate to low quality annotations can be used
to generate trees for initial model training, given the imperfect nature of existing unsupervised tree
delimitation approaches.

Applying deep learning models to natural landscapes opens new opportunities in ecology, forestry,
and land management. Despite a lack of high-quality training data, deep learning algorithms can
be deployed for tree prediction while using unsupervised detection to produce generated trees for
pretraining the neural network. Although the lidar-based algorithm that was used to generate the
pretraining data achieved less than 20% recall of hand-annotated tree crowns, the deeply learned RGB
features from those data achieved greater than 50% recall. When combined with a small number of
hand-annotated images, the recall increased to 69% with 60% precision. As shown by the comparison
with ﬁeld-collected stems, the majority of the remaining predictions represent valid trees (>80%),
but the overlap with the hand-estimated crown area was less than the desired 50%. Many previous
papers have used a lower overlap threshold (e.g., 20% overlap in [36]), and we expect this value to

samples will be needed to customize the model to a local geographic area. In addition, the availability
of hyperspectral data could assist in dividing the ‘tree’ class into multiple species labels. This would
yield additional insights into the economic value, ecological habitat, and carbon storage capacity for
large geographic areas [39]. While further work is needed to understand the best way to combine data
among scales and sensors, we show that deep learning-based approaches hold the potential for large
scale actionable information on natural systems to be derived from remote sensing data.

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not directly address the specific issue of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing the impact of different random seed values. However, it discusses some strategies related to improving deep learning performance in natural systems despite limitations like insufficient or low-quality training data. These include self-supervised learning, where unsupervised methods are used to generate training data, and semi-supervised learning, combining both labeled and unlabeled data. Additionally, pretraining a neural network using unsupervised detection to generate trees is mentioned. Nevertheless, these techniques do not specifically target the issue of managing randomness within the deep learning process itself.
