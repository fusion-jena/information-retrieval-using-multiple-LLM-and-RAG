Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

quires up-to-date information on where and how these species are using 
the  landscape.  Development  of  non-invasive  survey  methods  such  as 
FIT,  that  can  expand  non-invasive  survey  data  beyond  just  species 
presence/absence to sex identification, provide important new tools for 
the  study  of  wildlife  that can  have  immediate,  on-the-ground conser-
vation applications.

%Query
Query: "Where is the data repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The article does not mention any specific data repositories like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF where the deep learning pipeline used in this research has been made available. Therefore, it seems that the authors did not share their code or datasets in any public data repository. However, they do state that the raw data used in this study were collected by the U.S. Forest Service and other agencies, so those organizations may be able to provide access to the original data upon request.
