Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

The training dataset, including 268 sample plots with 39 features in a 
tabulated format, was used as input during the training process (opti-
mizing  hyper-parameters  and  fitting  models  with  these  data).  The 
training data set was divided into two parts, in which 80% was used for 
training/validation, and the remaining 20% was kept as unseen data for 
testing. To eliminate bias, 10-fold cross-validation was used during the 
training  process,  and  mean  RMSE  was  used  as  the  objective  function 
(lost function). Table 4 shows RMSE, MAE, and R2  using different op-
timizers. In addition, we tested the differences between the RMSEs in 
Table 4 using the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test with paired samples. The 
differences between (XGBoost-BO vs. XGBoost-TDO, XGBoost-BOHB vs. 
XGBoost-TDO) or (LightGBM-BO vs. LightGBM-TDO, LightGBM-BOHB 
vs.  LightGBM-TDO)  are  significant.  However,  the  performance  of 
XGBoost-TDO  versus  LightGBM-TDO  appears  to  be  the  same (Fig.  3),

2. Data and methods 

The overall workflow of the proposed method is shown in (Fig. 1). 
For  simplicity,  the  workflow  starts  with  collecting  sample  plots  and 
image processing to generate a tabulated dataset, including on-field AGB 
and  independent  features.  This  data  set  is  fed  into  hybrid  models,  in 

which  Bayesian  optimizers  and  TDO  tune  the  hyperparameters  of 
XGBoost and LightGBM using RMSE as the objective function. The best 
model  (with  the  smallest  RMSE)  is  selected  to  estimate  AGB  for  the 
entire study area. This model was also interpreted to understand better 
what operates inside the ‘black box.’ More detailed descriptions of the 
study area,  data specifications and preparation, and  algorithm justifi-
cations are presented in the following sections.

predictive efficiency, handle large datasets, and reduce training time. It 
is typically recommended for tabular datasets. LightGBM differs from 
other tree-based methods by implementing leaf-wise splits that create 
more  complex  trees,  which  are  more  efficient  in  reducing  loss  and 
resulting  in  higher  accuracy.  The  split  is  based  on  a  novel  sampling 
method named Gradient-Based One-Side Sampling (Ke et al., 2017), in 
which data with small gradients are excluded, and the rest are used for

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't any information about data augmentation techniques applied in this case since it focuses on a machine learning approach rather than a deep learning one. Therefore, I cannot provide details regarding flipping, rotating, scaling, or other data augmentation techniques related to deep learning pipelines. Instead, the given text discusses the use of Bayesian optimizers and Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TDO) to tune the hyperparameters of XGBoost and LightGBM algorithms for estimating aboveground biomass (AGB). These methods help improve predictive efficiency, manage large datasets, and decrease training times.
