This is the ﬁrst study to our knowledge to investigate the pheno-
logical features in improving the performance of deep learning. As re-
vealed in our results, we have seen great potential in developing phe-
nological knowledge based deep learning methods. Recent literature
has documented the applications and beneﬁts of deep learning, a new
branch of machine learning, in various ﬁelds (LeCun et al., 2015).
However, it is still a controversial topic whether deep learning is more
suitable than traditional machine learning methods for Landsat image
classiﬁcation (Heydari and Mountrakis, 2018; Li et al., 2016). Never-
theless, this study aims to evaluate the hypotheses that applying phe-
nological knowledge as input data of deep learning can improve the
performance in the detection of invasive S. alterniﬂora. A comparison
experiment between SAE and SVM with six diﬀerent types of Landsat
images was conducted (see Table 2). The best performance was

A comparison experiment was carried out to evaluate the perfor-
mance of SAE and SVM, and to choose an optimal strategy to map S.
alterniﬂora. The six types of Landsat images (Table 2) in the ten dif-
ferent mapping years (Table 1) served as input of these two classiﬁers.
The results were evaluated with four diﬀerent metrics: Producer's Ac-
curacy (PA), User's Accuracy (UA), Overall Accuracy (OA), and Kappa
Statistic (KS). The classiﬁcation performance was rather similar for
each type of Landsat images in diﬀerent mapping years from 1995 to
2017. The spatial coverage of the reference data was much higher in
2016–2017 than that in the other years. Accordingly, we focused our
analysis on the results obtained for 2016–2017 (Table 4). The OA and
KS statistic results in the remaining nine mapping years were shown in
Table 5 and S2. The comparison results show that the classiﬁcation
accuracy was improved in three aspects.

et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2016). A growing number of studies to date
(e.g. Heydari and Mountrakis, 2018; Ishii et al., 2015; Li et al., 2016)
have been reported on classiﬁcation of remote sensing images at
moderate spatial resolution with deep learning. For example, deep
learning method (Stacked AutoEncoder, SAE) and traditional machine
learning methods (e.g. Support Vector Machine, SVM) were compared
to map African land-cover (Li et al., 2016). It was reported that SAE
achieved a higher classiﬁcation accuracy than SVM. However, in one of
the latest developments, Heydari and Mountrakis (2018) conducted an
experiment on land cover classiﬁcation using the deep learning method
(SAE) with 26 Landsat images. Surprisingly, the results indicated that
the classiﬁcation accuracy of deep learning was not as good as tradi-
tional machine learning methods, e.g. SVM. Therefore, it is still a well-
worthy topic to investigate which kind of methods is better, deep

Helpful Answer:

In the given context, the performance of the deep learning model, specifically Stacked AutoEncoder (SAE), is evaluated against a traditional machine learning method, Support Vector Machine (SVM). Four different metrics are used to assess their performance: Producer's Accuracy (PA), User's Accuracy (UA), Overall Accuracy (OA), and Kappa Statistic (KS). These metrics help determine the effectiveness of each method in accurately identifying and classifying Spartina alterniflora, an invasive species, within Landsat images. While specific details about how these metrics are calculated are not provided in the context, they generally serve as indicators of classification accuracy and agreement between predicted and actual classes.
