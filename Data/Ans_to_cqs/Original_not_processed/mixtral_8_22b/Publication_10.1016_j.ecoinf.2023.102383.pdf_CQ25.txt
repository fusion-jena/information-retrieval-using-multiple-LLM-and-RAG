for a model to detect and identify them. Under this condition, more CNN 
layers mean that more abstractly semantic information can be extracted. 
Therefore, FRC_ResNet152FPN has more advantages than others in this 
sense.

compressed,  reducing  to  only  a  few  pixels  in  deeper  CNN  layers.  For 
instance, an object with dimensions of 15 × 15 pixels in a UAV thermal 
image might be represented by just 1 pixel in the feature map from Layer 
4 of ResNet152 (refer to Fig. 4). The limited spatial resolution can lead to 
loss of fine details, making it difficult for the model to distinguish small 
objects from the background. Through FPN, different feature maps from 
different layers can complement each other, and deeper feature map can 
receive some spatial information from shallower layers. However, still 
certain  spatial  features  might  have  been  lost  during  the  process  of 
convolution operations. Consequently, the models of FRC_ResNet18FPN 
and FRC_ResNet34FPN can obtain higher AP for medium and large ob-
jects than the remaining models because they have less CNN layers than 
others.  Notably,  the  FRC_ResNet152FPN  obtains  the  best  detection

3. Methodology 

3.1. Overview 

Generally, an object detection model takes images as input, and a 
DCNN,  served  as  the  backbone  network,  is  used  to  construct  feature 
maps.  Subsequently,  a  region  proposal  network  comes  into  play,  and 
generates  region  proposals,  assigning  a  probability  for  containing  an 
object to each region. The derived region proposals are reshaped by a 
pooling layer to generate Regions of Interest (RoIs). Finally, classifica-
tion and bounding box regression is engaged to predict both the pres-
ence and location of objects within the original images. These types of 
models are commonly called ‘two-stage detectors’ due to their two-step 
process (Goyal et al., 2023).

For deep learning-based object detection, two fundamental elements, 
feature  maps  and  anchor  boxes,  play  critical  roles.  Feature  maps  are 
extracted from original images and utilized to identify potential objects 
of  interest  and  locate  their  rough  positions  within  an  image.  Subse-
quently, anchor boxes come into play for generating regions of interest 
(RoIs)  and  facilitating  bounding  box  regression,  which  enables  the 
refinement of RoIs to better match the bounding box of the objects of 
interest. In the general definition of CNNs, the CNN layers that are closer 
to the input layer are called shallower layers, while deeper layers are 
those more distant  from the  input  layer. In the  architecture of  object 
detection,  various  CNNs—such  as  ResNet18,  ResNet34,  ResNet50, 
ResNet101, and ResNet152—differ in the overall depth of their layers. 
These CNNs are used to extract feature maps from the original imagery.

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is object detection. This type of model is designed to take images as input and use a DCNN (Deep Convolutional Neural Network) as its backbone network to construct feature maps. A Region Proposal Network then generates region proposals, assigning a probability for containing an object to each region. These derived region proposals are reshaped by a pooling layer to generate Regions of Interest (RoIs). Finally, classification and bounding box regression are employed to predict both the presence and location of objects within the original images. Such models are often referred to as 'two-stage detectors' due to their two-step process.
