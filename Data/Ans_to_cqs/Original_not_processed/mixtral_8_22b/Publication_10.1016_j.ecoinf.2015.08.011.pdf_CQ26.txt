For the purpose of prediction, the most important property of a
model is its competence to generalize. While generalization compe-
tence indicates a model's power to perform well on data that were not
used to train it, overﬁtting prevents model generalization in the face
of new situations (Schlink et al., 2003). To avoid overﬁtting, early stop-
ping the most frequently used regularization technique was employed.
In order to apply it, the data set was randomly split into two sets, 80% for
model training (to compute the gradient and updating of the network
parameters, such as weights and biases—the training set) and 20% for
model testing (to test the model error validation—the validation set).
The model weights were randomly initialized and the training process
was stopped when the network began to overﬁt the data, i.e., the
error on the validation set.

To develop a robust ANN, we have to consider the selection of the
number of layers, the number of neurons in the hidden layer, the learn-
ing rates, and the number of epochs for model training carefully. For ex-
ample, if we consider an insufﬁcient number of neurons in the hidden
layer, then the ANN cannot reﬂect nonlinearity within the training
data. Conversely, if we consider too many neurons, then the ANN has
an overﬁtting problem, and hence, this leads a lack of generalizability.
In this study, we applied a trial-and-error method, which is known to
be the best method to determine the appropriate number of neurons
and learning rate (Shamseldin, 1997; Hill and Minsker, 2010), and an
early stopping technique to hinder overﬁtting.

Helpful Answer:

Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some commonly used techniques include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets or strata based on certain criteria, such as class labels, and then splitting each stratum separately to maintain the original distribution of classes in both the training and validation datasets. This helps prevent imbalanced classes and ensures that the model is trained and validated on representative samples.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to balance the distribution of classes in the dataset. Oversampling involves duplicating examples from the minority class, while undersampling involves removing examples from the majority class. These techniques can help improve the performance of the model on imbalanced datasets.

Diverse data collection involves collecting data from various sources and domains to ensure that the model is exposed to different types of inputs and scenarios. This can help reduce bias and improve the generalizability of the model.

Again, these techniques are not mentioned specifically in the provided context, but they are commonly used in practice to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
