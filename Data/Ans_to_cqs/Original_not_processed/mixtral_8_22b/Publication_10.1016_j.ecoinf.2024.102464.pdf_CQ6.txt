In  our  study,  we  utilized  data  from  the  third  and  fourth  natural 
environment surveys, incorporating various environmental variables, to 
assess  the  impact  of  urban  development  on  species  distribution.  To 
achieve  this,  we  employed  seven  different  machine  learning  models, 
extracting the Area Under the Curve (AUC) values for each model both 
before and after urban development (Fig. 3). The AUC value, a critical 
measure of model performance, indicated that the Generalized Linear 
Model  (GLM)  and  Random  Forest  (RF)  models  had  the  highest  AUC 
value  of  0.85,  while  the  Classification  and  Regression  Tree  (CART) 
model  had  the  lowest  at  0.79.  On  average,  the  models  demonstrated 
robust performance with an average AUC value of 0.84, underscoring 
their overall effectiveness in species distribution modeling. Despite the 
methodological similarities among the models, their distinct character-

distance to agricultural land, distance to grassland, distance to roads, 
and distance to urban areas) (Kwon, 2014; Song and Kim, 2012). We

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not directly address the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it mentions that a correlation analysis was conducted on the variables before implementing the model to improve its predictive performance and reduce the risk of overfitting. This can be considered a form of feature selection or engineering, which is often part of the preprocessing stage in machine learning and deep learning pipelines. In general, common preprocessing steps for deep learning include data cleaning (removing missing or irrelevant data), normalization (scaling numerical input features to a standard range), and encoding categorical variables into numerical format if necessary. These steps help ensure optimal model performance and prevent issues like overfitting or poor convergence during training.
