required  no further  user input,  pre-  or  post-processing  steps,  and  can 
therefore be seen as more objective, more comparable, and robust across 
time  steps.  Moving  the  input  period  six  months  forward,  backward, 
extending  it  to  three  instead  of  two  years,  and  testing  the  results  for 
correlation  (which  was  high)  all  supported  the  robustness  of  the 
approach.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information on specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge about handling data biases, some common techniques include stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified sampling involves dividing the entire dataset into different subsets or strata, ensuring each subset has roughly equal representation in the final sample. This technique helps maintain the original distribution of the target variable in the training set.

Oversampling and undersampling are methods used to balance datasets with imbalanced class distributions. In oversampling, additional copies of minority class examples are added to the dataset, while in undersampling, majority class examples are removed from the dataset until both classes have similar sizes.

Diverse data collection aims to gather data from various sources, environments, and conditions to ensure the model learns from a wide range of scenarios and reduces potential biases caused by limited data diversity.

Although these techniques are commonly employed to handle data biases, the given context does not confirm their usage in this particular case.
