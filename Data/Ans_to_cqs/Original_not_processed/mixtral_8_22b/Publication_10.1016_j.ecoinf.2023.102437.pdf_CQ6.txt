The  recurrent  neural  network  (RNN)  model  is  an  artificial  model 
used  for  processing  sequential  data.  RNNs  have  been  successfully 
applied  in  areas  such  as  speech  recognition,  language  models,  and 
translation,  where  the  material  is  continuous.  However,  RNN  have 
limitations  in  processing  past  information  if  there  is  a  considerable 
difference  in  time  duration  between  the  initial  and  final  parts  of  the 
data.  LSTM  (Long  Short-Term  Memory)  is  a  type  of  recurrent  neural 
network (RNN) architecture designed to address some of the limitations 
of  traditional  RNNs  when  it  comes  to  handling  long  sequences  and 
capturing long-term dependencies in data. LSTM networks are used in 
machine learning and deep learning for sequential data tasks, such as 
natural language processing, speech recognition, time series forecasting, 
and  more.  Especially,  LSTM  models  possess  the  ability  to  make  pre-

Our  findings  also  revealed  a  significant  reduction  in  computation 
time when ML models, along with preselection, were used. Unlike ex-
pected, pre-selection lowered the accuracy of the results, which likely 
indicates  a  loss  of  information  in  the  database  transformed  using  the 
signature method. As we expected that the Lasso model, in the absence 
of the signature method, would not provide convincing results; there-
fore, we only retained this analysis to maintain consistency in compar-
ison with the ML models. Though it is possible to extract PDPs from RF 
runs  coupled  with  the  signature  method,  their  interpretation  is  not 
possible because of this transformation. The amount of input data, or in 
our case, the size of the time series used during the learning phase of an 
ML  model,  can  have  a  non-negligible  influence  on  predictive  perfor-
mance (Bustillo et al., 2022; Derot et al., 2020b). In other words, a long

As discussed in section 2.4.1, after transformation via the signature 
method, we obtained 1885 terms. The preselection of predictors that are 
used as inputs to an ML model can reduce computation time and the risk 
of overfitting (Chandrashekar and Sahin, 2014). Therefore, we have had

Thereafter, we use the following time indices, whose unit is month: 
ma  is the leading time of prediction relative to the starting time of pre-
diction m, and mb  is the duration of the past time series segment. Also, 
the  time  interval  [m0, m1] means  that  time  runs  m0, m0+1, …, m1.  For 
supervised  learning  in  this  model,  the  object variable  is  the  NINO3.4 
index ym+ma  at time τ = tm+ma , whereas the explanatory variables xm  for 
a time period include the signature for the segment of time series X in 
. The approximation property described in the 
that period 
previous  section  allowed  us  to  express  the  object  variable  as  a  linear 
combination of explanatory variables, as follow: 

[
tm(cid:0) mb+1, tm

]

ym+ma = ym + 〈wm, xm〉 + ϵ

xm := Sn

X[tm(cid:0) mb +1,tm]

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps may be required depending on the nature of the dataset. These steps help improve the performance and efficiency of the model by preparing the data in a suitable format. Some common preprocessing techniques include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing any irrelevant, redundant, or corrupted data points from the dataset. It might also involve handling missing values through imputation methods like mean/median substitution or using machine learning algorithms.

2. Normalization and Scaling: Deep learning models often perform better when all features are within a similar range. Techniques like Min-Max scaling, Z-score normalization, or log transformations can be applied to rescale the feature values.

3. Feature Engineering: This step involves creating new features based on existing ones to capture additional patterns or relationships in the data. Examples include polynomial features, interaction terms, or binning categorical variables.

4. Encoding Categorical Variables: Since most deep learning models work with numerical data, categorical variables need to be converted into numerical form. Common encoding techniques include one-hot encoding, label encoding, or target encoding.

5. Dimensionality Reduction: High dimensional datasets can lead to increased computational complexity and potential overfitting issues. Methods like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), or autoencoders can be employed to reduce the number of dimensions while preserving essential information.

6. Data Augmentation: To increase the diversity of the training set and prevent overfitting, synthetic samples can be generated by applying various transformations to the original data. This technique is particularly useful in image classification tasks.

7. Train-Test Split: Before training the model, the dataset should be divided into separate subsets for training and testing purposes. A typical split ratio is 80% for training and 20% for testing, but this can vary depending on the specific problem requirements.
