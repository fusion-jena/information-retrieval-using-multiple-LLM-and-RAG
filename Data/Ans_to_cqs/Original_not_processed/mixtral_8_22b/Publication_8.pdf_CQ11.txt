This   rising   number   of   digitised   herbarium   sheets   provides   an   opportunity   to   employ
computer-based   image   processing   techniques,   such   as   deep   learning,   to   automatically
identify species and higher taxa (Carranza-Rojas et al. 2017, Younis et al. 2018, Carranza-
Rojas   et   al.   2018)   or   to   extract   other   useful   information   from   the   images,   such   as   the
presence   of   pathogens   (as   done   for   live   plant   photos   by   Mohanty   et   al.   2016).   Deep
learning is a subset of machine learning methods for learning data representation. Deep
learning   techniques   require   huge   amounts   of   training   data   to   learn   the   features   and
representation of those data for the specified task by fine tuning parameters of hundreds or
thousands of neural networks, arranged in multiple layers. Learning the value of these
parameters can take vast computer and time resources, especially on huge datasets.

Marco   Schmidt  is   botanist   at   Senckenberg   Biodiversity   and   Climate   Research   Center
(SBIK-F)   with   a   focus   on   African   savannahs   and   biodiversity   informatics   (e.g.   online
databases like African Plants - a photo guide and West African vegetation) and is working
at Palmengarten’s scientific service, curating living collections and collection databases.
Contributions: concept of study, annotation and verification of herbarium scans, preparation
of the manuscript.

Claus   Weiland  is   theoretical   biologist   at   SBIK-F’s   Data   &   Modelling   Centre   with   main
interests in graph neural networks and bio-ontologies. Contributions: Design of the GPU
platform, data analysis and preparation of the manuscript.

%Query
Query: "What is the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any direct reference to the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in this research article. However, it mentions that the authors are associated with various institutions including the Senckenberg Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre (SBiK-F), the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at Philipps-University Marburg, and the Senckenberg Research Institute and Natural History Museum. It also lists several contributors to the paper, including Marco Schmidt, who works at Palmengarten’s scientific service and curates living collections and collection databases. Given this information, one could potentially search for relevant repositories linked to these individuals or institutions to find the desired data repository link. Unfortunately, without more specific details about the dataset or code used in the deep learning pipeline, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based solely on the given context.
