3.2.2. Retrieval results 

The retrieval experiments ensued the following strategy: every image 
is used as a query image and is matched with every remaining image in 
the database. Tables 6 and 7 present the retrieval performances of all the 
networks in terms of the four considered measures by choosing the top 
100 matches, i.e. Î· = 100, and the two chosen similarity distances.

3.1.2. Seed image retrieval via deep learning 

Beyond  the  classification  task,  we  verified  the  possibility  of  using 
convolutional neural networks for seed image retrieval and evaluated 
their performances. Generally, a content-based image retrieval system 
searches and retrieves images based on the visual contents of the images, 
i.e. features such as colour, texture, shape, and spatial layout. CNNs can 
replace traditional feature extractors since they have a solid ability to 
extract complex features that express the image in much more detail. So,

3. Results and discussion 

We  now  describe  the  experimentation  conducted  in  this  work.  In 
detail, in Section 3.1 we first describe the experimental setup adopted 
for the classification and retrieval tasks. Then, we report the results of 
the  experiments  performed  on  both  datasets  and  tasks  with  SeedNet, 
compared to existing CNNs (Section 3.2). After a further comparison of 
deep  vs  machine  learning methods  in Section  3.3, we  give  a detailed 
discussion of the obtained results in Section 3.4. 

3.1. Setup 

3.1.1. Seed image classification via deep learning

As expected for the retrieval task performed with deep features, the 
similarity  measure  influences  the  retrieval  performances,  and  for  our 
problem, the best one seems to be the Euclidean distance (See Table 6 
and 7). Even a little less effective than for classification, the results can 
be considered satisfying and confirm the potential use of deep learning 
techniques for retrieval tasks. Overall, our proposed model turns out to 
be the most performing among the considered networks.

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that convolutional neural networks were used for seed image retrieval and evaluation of their performance. This implies that the input data format used in the deep learning pipeline was likely image data. Therefore, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data.
