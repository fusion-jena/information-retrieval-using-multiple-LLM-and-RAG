Models were trained and tested by tuning the number of required 
epochs and then inspecting the model outputs and error outcomes for 
signs of overfitting. If the model focuses excessively on data fitting, it 
may imitate insignificant noise rather than the broad properties of in-
terest, resulting in overfitting.

converged to its most accurate state, assessing each image only 10–30 
times  (in  machine  learning  terms,  after  10–30  “training  epochs”), 
whereas the typical duration is between 70 and 250 epochs. Subsequent 
training had no effect or decreased the algorithm’s performance on held- 
out test data, indicating that its long-term behavior resembled memo-
rizing  its  training  set  rather  than  learning  a  generalized  matching 
strategy (this is the machine learning definition of “overfitting”).

cation  studies,  a  lack  of  data  is  the  greatest  challenge  and  limitation 
researchers encounter (Schneider et al., 2019). With the data collection 
compiled  in  this  work,  we  contribute  the  largest  fully  labeled  snow 
leopard dataset for deep learning research. In addition, we anticipate 
that our novel deep learning methods will encourage other academics to 
contribute  more  datasets  to  Whiskerbook.org  for  the  purpose  of 
continuously curating and enhancing the data used to improve the deep 
learning pipeline. Comparing these results to those of an earlier study by 
Johansson et al. (2020) that depended on human manual classification, 
without  AI  or  software,  determined  that  observers  significantly  over-
estimate  the  true  abundance.  AI-based  individual  ID  within  Whiske 
rbook.org  has  demonstrated  the  potential  to  enhance  the  precision 
and  efficiency  of  manual  observers,  approaching  more  accurate  esti-

and left-right mirroring data augmentation techniques, which reduced 
the  issue  of  overfitting,  and  strengthened  the  algorithms  capacity  to 
match individuals based on pelt patterns rather than the background. 
The  snow  leopard  training  pipeline  described  here  may  be  repur-
posed rather quickly to train new models if more users utilize the system 
and  additional  data  is  submitted.  The  existing  model  may  also  help 
bootstrap that data-curation process. There is a considerable possibility 
for  regional  and  global  research  collaborations  with  snow  leopard 
research  institutions  to  curate  and  independently  identify  data  that 
would advance these existing models toward greater sophistication and 
improved performance. Deep learning systems have the ability to sur-
pass humans in the re-identification of animals, even in the absence of 
obvious patterns and markings, if sufficient datasets and collaboration

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization being employed to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, some strategies to mitigate overfitting can still be identified from the text.

One approach mentioned is early stopping, where the model is monitored during training, and once the validation loss stops improving, the training is halted. This prevents the model from memorizing the training data instead of learning a generalized strategy.

Additionally, data augmentation techniques like left-right mirroring were utilized to reduce overfitting. Data augmentation involves creating modified versions of the original images through transformations such as rotation, scaling, flipping, etc. These transformed images provide the model with more varied examples, helping it learn better representations and reducing the risk of overfitting.

While not explicitly stated, another possible method could involve using a smaller network architecture to avoid overparameterization, which might lead to overfitting. A simpler model would have fewer parameters to tune, making it less likely to fit the noise in the training data.

However, without further information, it cannot be confirmed whether any of these methods were specifically chosen as regularization techniques to combat overfitting.
