Fig. 4. UMAP plots for different embedding layers of different embedding
models for AnuraSet. For UMAP generation, we randomly select 5000 samples
and discard all samples that are aligned to more than one class. Colors and
shapes indicate the 10 classes with the highest occurrence frequency. Layers are
numbered according to their distance from the classification layer, e.g. ‘Bird-
Net-1’ is the last layer before the classification layer of the BirdNet model.

evaluation was done on focal and citizen-science datasets. Swaminathan
et al. (2024) extend the observation to attention-based architectures pre-
trained on human speech. Lauha et al. (2022) show that transfer
learning can be helpful also for small networks trained from scratch on
small, targeted datasets gathered from online resources such as Mac-
aulay Library2 (as opposed to foundation models trained on large
datasets). While the works cited above evaluate transfer learning models
based on classification performance, McGinn et al. (2023) take a
different approach and investigate the topology of fine grained, sub-
species sound events in the embedding space afforded by BirdNet;
they find that different call types of a same species (e.g., drumming
versus vocalization) form distinct clusters, and that the vicinity of each

ResNet-50 variant (no transfer learning), and the small size of their
validation set (6.25 h, or 0.003% of the data) precludes comparing
different active learning methods. Similarly, van Osta et al. (2023) use
transfer learning (ResNet seemingly pre-trained on ImageNet) and an
active learning strategy to train a classifier for a single cryptic bird
species, but do not compare different active learning strategies.

both the target modality and the domain, yields the best performance as
a feature embedding model. Using BirdNet-1 as the embedding model,
active learning sample selection strategies significantly reduce the
required for annotation to achieve model
number of
convergence.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipelines mentioned. However, it is common practice in deep learning to use optimization algorithms like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) to minimize the loss function during training. These optimization techniques adjust the weights and biases of the neural network based on the gradient of the loss function with respect to those parameters. Without further details, it cannot be confirmed which specific optimization technique was employed in these studies.

Based on the context, it appears that various deep learning models were utilized, including VGG16, ResNet152V2, BirdNet, and others. These models may have been optimized using popular optimization techniques like SGD or Adam, among other possibilities. To determine the exact optimization techniques used, additional information would be required.
