Helpful Answer:

The article does not explicitly state the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it is common practice in machine learning to use a random stratified sampling method to ensure that each set has roughly the same distribution of classes or labels. This helps prevent overfitting and ensures that the model generalizes well to unseen data. In this work, the authors propose using U-Net to identify Hedychium Coronarium, an invasive vegetation species for the Brazilian natural flora. They divide the article into sections II and III, which explain the data gathering, pre-processing, and the train and test datasets. Section III explores the results of different ways of training the U-Net. Based on positive results by U-Net to identify various objects and plant species, they propose using U-Net to classify images collected by a DJI Phantom 2 drone with a Global Positioning System (GPS). The framework used to develop this work can be seen in Figure 1, which shows three stages: collecting image data of Hedychium Coronarium to classify it, pre-processing the data, and developing the classification method for the collected images. Finally, measuring the results obtained by the classification.
