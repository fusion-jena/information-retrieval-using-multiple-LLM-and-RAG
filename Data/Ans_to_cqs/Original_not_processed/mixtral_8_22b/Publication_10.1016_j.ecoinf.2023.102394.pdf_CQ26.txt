Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide specific information about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge, several techniques can be employed to mitigate data bias. These include stratified sampling, which ensures that each class is represented proportionally in both training and testing datasets. This technique helps maintain the overall distribution of classes in the original dataset. Another approach is oversampling, where samples from minority classes are duplicated or synthesized to match the number of majority class instances. Conversely, undersampling involves removing instances from the majority class until it matches the size of the minority class. Additionally, diverse data collection can help reduce bias by ensuring that the dataset includes examples representative of all possible scenarios. It should be noted that these techniques may have their own limitations and trade-offs, such as potential overfitting with oversampling or loss of valuable information with undersampling. Therefore, careful consideration must be given when choosing the appropriate method(s) to handle data bias in any particular application.
