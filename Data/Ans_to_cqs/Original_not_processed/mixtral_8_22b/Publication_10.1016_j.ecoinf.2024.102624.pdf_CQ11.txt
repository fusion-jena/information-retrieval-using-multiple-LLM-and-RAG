Staiano, 2019). Training data augmentation, which extends the existing 
training  data,  enhances  the  generalization  capabilities  (Lik´o  et  al., 
2023). Post-classification, generally segmentation, and filtering gener-
ally  provide  better  maps  with  a  lower  rate  of  salt-and-pepper  errors 
(Ahmed et al., 2017). We can also deal with the characteristics of the 
geometry of the training data, excluding outliers, refining the training 
samples, or changing the proportion of the training and test data. These 
strategies collectively improve classification accuracy, enabling better 
modelling of the environment.

During  our  work,  we  discovered  several  challenges  in  identifying 
plant  populations  using  remote  sensing  in  the  field.  Moritake  et  al. 
(2024) also faced challenging problems during their studies classifying 
vegetation by human observers versus deep learning classifiers, in our 
results we also highlight the importance of involving machine learning 
techniques to gain better accuracy. While it is not difficult to survey and 
assess populations in deeper oligotrophic lakes in cooler climates, where 
the species and phenology are predominantly monospecific, the situa-
tion is different in shallow and eutrophic water bodies. In these areas, 
the simultaneous presence of several phenophases and numerous other 
plant  species  can result in  large variations  in  plant  populations, even 
within a small area. In their studies Granados et al. (2013) also identified 
different  phenological  stages  of  plant  communities,  however  they

(Conrad et al., 2015). The optimal segment size was chosen based on the 
extent of the patches, without losing any elements of the species pattern. 
The mean values of the segments were used for classification. Segments 
are  optimal  to  avoid  spatial  autocorrelation  when  using  k-fold  cross- 
validation  (KCV)  in  the  model-building  and/or  accuracy  assessment 
phase.

Our findings have significant implications for ecosystem monitoring 
and  management,  as  accurate  classification  of  aquatic  plant  commu-
nities is crucial for assessing ecological health and guiding conservation 
efforts.  Nevertheless,  further  research  is  necessary  to  address  the 
remaining  challenges,  such  as  improving  the  separability  between 
closely related species and refining classification algorithms to accom-
modate diverse plant populations. 

In summary, our study offers valuable insights into the classification 
of  aquatic  plant  communities  using  remote  sensing  techniques,  high-
lighting both successes and areas that require further investigation. By 
utilizing advanced machine learning methods and incorporating multi- 
dimensional  data  sources,  we  can  continue  to  enhance  our  under-
standing  of aquatic ecosystems and  contribute to  their effective man-
agement and conservation.
