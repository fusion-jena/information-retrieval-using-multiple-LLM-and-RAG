4.3. Data processing

4.4. Classification method

The  processing  of  high-resolution  remote  sensing  data,  which  en-
compasses  a  plethora  of  feature  information  (Girshick  et  al.,  2014), 
demands  significant  time  and  costs.  This  presents  considerable  chal-
lenges for many researchers (Modzelewska et al., 2020). Prior to clas-
sification, samples require training. The representativeness and quantity 
of  these  training  samples  significantly  influence  the  accuracy  of  the 
classification  models.  Platinum  (Ting,  2016)  demonstrated  that  when 
the training samples are not sufficiently typical, other categories can be 
easily misclassified into the sampleâ€™s category. If the number of training 
samples is insufficient, network training may not meet the requirements. 
Conversely, an excessive number of training samples can lead to data 
redundancy, reducing the efficiency of model training (Shi, 2018). To 
address  this  issue,  this  study  employed  feature  optimization  tools  to

refine  the  subsequent  classification  process.  Future  research  should 
focus on this issue to yield more reliable results.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given context, there isn't enough information to provide a detailed answer about the specific process used to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that the study employs feature optimization tools to refine the subsequent classification process. It also highlights the importance of having representative and adequate training samples for accurate classification models. But, it doesn't discuss any details regarding the deployment of the trained model such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to this query with the available information.
