different Sika Deer vocalizations (range 2–70%, Enari et al., 2019). A 
recent study using the Red Deer as a study species obtained recall rates 
of  approximately  90%  for  the  five  supervised  machine  learning  algo-
rithms tested, suggesting that the creation of sophisticated models could 
clearly improve the detection of ungulate vocalization.

cation. The precision was estimated by dividing the number of cow calls 
detected by the software by the total number of ROIs within the “Cow” 
cluster (Knight et al., 2017; P´erez-Granados and Schuchmann, 2020a) 
and can be interpreted as an index of the percentage of ROIs correctly 
labeled by Kaleidoscope.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide specific information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some common techniques include stratified splitting, which involves splitting the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes or labels in both sets. Oversampling is another technique where synthetic samples are created from existing minority class examples to balance the dataset. Undersampling, on the other hand, involves removing samples from the majority class to achieve a balanced dataset. Lastly, diverse data collection aims to collect more representative data to reduce bias in the dataset. These techniques help ensure that the model learns from a fair representation of all classes or labels, reducing potential biases in the final predictions.
