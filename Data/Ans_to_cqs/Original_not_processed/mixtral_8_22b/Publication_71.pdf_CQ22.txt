the classification accuracy. Due to memory issues, we could not feed the whole Vasiliko image for training. Instead, we had to divide the training image into four quadrants. The performance metrics were generated by sequentially training the model on each of the four quadrants of the Vasiliko dataset. In order to do this, we trained an initial model on the first quadrant and then updated the weights using the following quadrant. This step was repeated for the final three quadrants of the image. For training the model sequentially, we used a patch size of 7, the learning rate of 0.01, and used all the possible training samples in the quadrant. Table 8 summarizes the results for our sequential approach. We only generated results using the Kimisala-20 test image because Kimisala-10 is very large in size. The average overall accuracy for the CNN model reached 0.8298, which was better than the earlier results in Table 7 in which only 30,000 samples were used to train Remote Sens. 2020,

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific performance metrics used to evaluate the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the average overall accuracy for the CNN model reached 0.8298. Therefore, one metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model is accuracy. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of the total number of instances evaluated. It is calculated as the ratio of true positive and true negative predictions to the total number of cases. Other common evaluation metrics include precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the curve (AUC). Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made by the classifier. Recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positives in the data set. F1 score combines both precision and recall into a single measure, while AUC represents the degree or measure of separability between classes. These metrics help assess the effectiveness of the deep learning model in accurately predicting outcomes based on input features.
