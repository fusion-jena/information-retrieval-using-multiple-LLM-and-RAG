4. Discussion

Knowledge of the soil retention capacity of brown coal post-
industrial heaps is limited. The first study at the spoil heap site related
to soil retention and the outflow of reclamation methods used was
conducted (Hendrychov´a and Bogusch, 2016). The type of vegetation
and type of reclamation has a direct bearing on the water content of the
heap.

Therefore, it seems reasonable to test in the future more advanced
methods of data analysis for estimating soil moisture at the spoil heap. It
would be worthwhile in this context to test various methods of machine
learning or deep neural networks, which would perhaps allow to in-
crease the accuracy of prediction.

5. Conclusion

The study explored development spatial modeling for estimating
VWC on reclaimed spoil heap. This model is an integration of remote
sensing data (PlanetScope satellite imagery) and topographic indices.

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, there isn't any specific information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, some common strategies to manage randomness in deep learning pipelines include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using techniques like cross-validation, bootstrapping, or bagging to reduce variance, and employing ensemble methods to combine multiple models trained with different initializations. These strategies help improve the robustness and reliability of deep learning models when dealing with random factors such as random seed values.
