Collecting  data  on  rare  species  that  occur  over  large  areas  can  be 
logistically difficult and expensive, especially at a population scale. In 
such  circumstances  biologists  often  rely  on  non-invasive  sampling 
techniques  such  as  camera  traps,  acoustic  recorders,  non-invasive  ge-
netic  sampling  (scat,  hair,  urine,  feathers)  or  track  collection.  While 
these  methods  provide  a  cost-effective  option  for  species  detection, 
identifying sex can be challenging. For example, determining sex using 
non-invasive genetic samples can be cost-prohibitive, require access to a 
laboratory  for  analysis,  or  be  limited  by  DNA  quantity  and  quality.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not directly address strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, including managing random seed values. However, I can still provide some general insights into handling randomness in deep learning pipelines.

Randomness in deep learning pipelines can arise from various sources like weight initialization, shuffling datasets, dropout layers, etc. To manage randomness, several strategies can be adopted:

1. Fixed Random Seed: A common approach is setting a fixed random seed value before running any code involving random operations. This ensures consistency across different runs and makes results reproducible.

2. Cross-validation: Using techniques like k-fold cross-validation helps reduce bias and variance caused due to random partitioning of datasets. It also provides a more robust estimate of model performance.

3. Ensemble Methods: Combining multiple models trained with different initializations or hyperparameters can help mitigate the effects of randomness. Techniques like bagging, boosting, or stacking can be used for ensembling.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning: Performing systematic search or optimization algorithms (like grid search, random search, Bayesian Optimization) for finding optimal hyperparameters reduces the impact of randomness during model selection.

5. Repeat Experiments: Running experiments multiple times with different seeds and averaging results can give a better understanding of the overall performance and stability of the model.
