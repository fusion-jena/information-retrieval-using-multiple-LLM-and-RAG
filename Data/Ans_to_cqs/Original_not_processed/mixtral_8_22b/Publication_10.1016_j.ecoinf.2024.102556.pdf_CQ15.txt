to learn features of various sizes, leading to potential matching errors 
when the scale of the target changes. To address these shortcomings, it is 
imperative  to  introduce  a  multiscale  feature-extraction  network 
(MSNet).

Inspired  by  Res2Net,  a  novel  residual  network  structured  with 
Res2Net modules and group convolution was introduced to replace the 
FEN in the Deep SORT algorithm. This enhancement refines the multi-
scale representation in the Deep SORT FEN, achieving a more intricate 
and detailed level of feature-extraction.

In the initial algorithm, MSNet constructs the FEN by stacking rule 
residual blocks to capture the appearance information. However, owing 
to the depth and structure of the network, the original residual network 
can only  extract  shallow  features, and  it  is  challenging  to extract  the 
deeper features of the target. The shallow network is adept at capturing 
the targetâ€™s location and appearance information, but struggles to pro-
vide detailed target information. To address the occlusion challenges in 
MOT scenarios, it is imperative to introduce deeper networks. However, 
the multiple downsampling stages in these deeper networks result in a 
lower resolution for the final feature map layer, which diminishes the 
effectiveness of the information for small targets in the output feature

features  from  images,  comprising  three  convolutional  layers:  Con-
v+BatchNorm+SiLU integration module (CBS), Efficient Layer Aggre-
gation Networks (ELAN), and Hybrid Convolutional (MPConv). As  an 
efficient aggregation network, the ELAN layer is designed with a multi- 
stream  structure  to  learn  various  features  through  different  convolu-
tional  streams. Unlike  the normal  pooling layer,  the  MPConv layer  is 
branched into a CBS layer and a Maxpool layer. Features extracted from 
each layer were fused through the Concat operation, facilitated by the 
aggregated feature pyramid structure. With the SPP pyramid structure, 
the header network is designed for multiple inputs and transferring in-
formation from the bottom to the top. Finally, the RepConv structure is 
utilized to adjust the number of channels for different scaled features.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit details about specific optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) used in the deep learning pipeline. However, there are some implicit indications of optimization strategies employed within the described architecture.

For instance, the use of Batch Normalization (BatchNorm) suggests that this technique is being utilized to improve the speed, performance, and stability of the neural network during training. It helps reduce internal covariate shift, allowing each layer of the network to learn by itself a little more independently of other layers.

Additionally, the mention of SiLU activation function (also known as Swish) implies that this nonlinear function is chosen over others like ReLU due to its superior performance in certain tasks. The choice of activation functions can be considered part of optimizing the overall model performance.

Moreover, the introduction of Res2Net modules and group convolution indicates architectural modifications aimed at improving feature extraction capabilities, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the deep learning model. These modifications could also be seen as forms of optimization, albeit on a structural rather than mathematical level.

However, without direct reference to traditional optimization algorithms like SGD, Adam, RMSprop etc., it cannot be definitively stated what exact optimization techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline based solely on the provided context.
