Data  augmentation  is  another  powerful  method  to  overcome  the 
problem of limited data and improve model performance (Shorten and 
Khoshgoftaar, 2019). Data augmentation can increase the variability of 
audio  data  in  a  training  dataset  by  transforming  the  data,  such  as 
changing  the  frequency,  pitch,  and  volume  of  audio  signals,  shifting, 
rotating  and  zooming  in  the  time  and/or  frequency  domains  of  spec-
trograms, and adding additional noise (Dai et al., 2021; Ferreira et al., 
2020; Kahl et al., 2021; Lasseck, 2019; Nanni et al., 2020b; Ruff et al., 
2021). Since the augmented dataset can better represent the real-world 
data  than  the  original  dataset,  this  approach  can  improve  the  model 
performance trained with a small dataset (Nanni et al., 2020b; Xie et al., 
2019). However, previous studies show that this approach works well 
only  on  relatively  clean  recordings,  not  soundscape  recordings  (Kahl

whole image. Thus, it may minimize the dilution effect and reduce the 
required amount of training data.

Data augmentation is a powerful tool for enriching a limited amount 
of training datasets. Some audio-specific augmentation techniques, such 
as noise mixing and random signal amplitude used in the SILIC, are also 
used and performed well in previous studies (Lasseck, 2019; Nanni et al., 
2020b; Kahl et al., 2021). Techniques such as sound mixing with other 
target  signals  and/or  reverberations  also  have  the  potential  for 
improving  the  model  performance  (Ko  et  al.,  2017;  Lasseck,  2019; 
Richards and Wiley, 1980) and warrant further evaluations.

The mixed audio clips are then converted into spectrograms as input 
images for model training. The clips are transformed by applying the 
short-time Fourier transform (STFT) with a window size of 1600 sam-
ples,  hop  size  of  400  samples  (75%  overlap),  and  240  mel-scale  fre-
quency bins.  Each spectrogram thus  has a height  of 438 pixels  and a 
width of 436 pixels (Appendix S1: Fig. S4a).

Helpful Answer:

While the provided context does not directly mention specific techniques to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, it discusses various methods to enhance and diversify the available data, which could potentially mitigate data bias. These methods include data augmentation techniques applied to audio data, such as changing the frequency, pitch, and volume of audio signals, shifting, rotating, and zooming in the time and/or frequency domains of spectrograms, and adding additional noise. Furthermore, the text mentions audio-specific augmentation techniques like noise mixing and random signal amplitude, as well as sound mixing with other target signals and/or reverberations. Although these techniques primarily aim to increase the variability of audio data and improve model performance, they might indirectly help address data bias by creating more diverse and representative datasets. However, it should be noted that the effectiveness of these techniques in addressing data bias would depend on their implementation and the nature of the underlying biases in the data.
