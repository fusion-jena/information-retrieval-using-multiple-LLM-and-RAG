classification is described as:

= [l1 ∈ l2] for all U⋀LTA (cid:0) LU

(10)

l=1

Where U is the union of l1 and l2 classification, such that the higher-
level classification (l1) with more classes (n = 32) is represented as el-
ements (∈) of the lower-level classification (l2) with fewer classes (n =
6), the nested classification between l1 & l2 is the reclassification of the
thematic spectral classes of l1 into the information classes of l2. Based on

a simple linear regression, the l1 / l2 crosstabulation results proved
insufficient to distinguish between MI and LI LTA-LU shrub community
configurations.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific purpose or type of deep learning model used in the research. However, based on the references cited, it can be inferred that the study involves some form of image processing using deep learning techniques. For instance, Mohedano et al. (2017) discuss object retrieval with deep convolutional neural networks, while Petrovska et al. (2020) focus on deep learning for feature extraction in remote sensing, specifically for aerial scene classification. Therefore, without further details, we cannot definitively state whether the deep learning model was designed for classification, segmentation, detection, or another task.
