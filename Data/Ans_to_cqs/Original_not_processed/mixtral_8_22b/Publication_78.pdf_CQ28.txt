Algorithm 1: k-means Clustering Algorithm.

Input: Features as data points
Let features F = {F1, F2, F2, ..., Fn} is set of data points and C = {C1, C2, C3, ..., Co}
is set of centers.

3.1. Explanation of Steps

Initially, an image is taken with the help of an underwater drone. In the next step,
the image is segmentized and divided into small patches. Features are extracted from
each patch with the help of handcrafted descriptors and D-CNNs. A visual vocabulary

(VV) is created, as shown in Figure 4, this visual vocabulary is the features extracted
from these features, and the training features are passed to classiﬁer i.e., SVM, which
classiﬁes whether the VV-features are of bleached coral or healthy coral. We used different
handcrafted features as well as different D-CNN’s but AlexNet shows the highest accuracy.
We used different classiﬁers i.e., SVM, kNN, and decision tree, but SVM outperforms all
other classiﬁers.

%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The paper does not provide information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, it cannot be determined if platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud were utilized based on the given context.
