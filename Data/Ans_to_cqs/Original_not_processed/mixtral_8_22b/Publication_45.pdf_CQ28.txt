INTRODUCTION

Addressing  current  global  challenges  such  as  biodiversity  loss,  global  change,  and 
increasing  demands  for  ecosystem  services  requires  improved  ecological  prediction. 
Recent increases in data availability, process understanding, and computing power are 
fostering quantitative approaches in ecology. However, flexible methodological frameworks 
are needed to utilize these developments towards improved ecological prediction. Deep 
learning  is  a  rapidly  evolving  branch  of  machine  learning,  yet  has  received  only  little 
attention in ecology to date. It refers to the training of deep neural networks (DNNs), i.e. 
artificial neural networks consisting of many layers and a large number of neurons. We 
here  provide  a  reproducible  example  (including  code  and  data)  of  designing,  training, 
and  applying  DNNs  for  ecological  prediction.  Using  bark  beetle  outbreaks  in  conifer-

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not mention which specific platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or any other platform was utilized based solely on this information.
