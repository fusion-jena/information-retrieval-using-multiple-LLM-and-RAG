Expanding digital data sources, including social media, online news articles and blogs, provide an opportunity to 
understand better the context and intensity of human-nature interactions, such as wildlife exploitation. However, 
online searches encompassing large taxonomic groups can generate vast datasets, which can be overwhelming to 
filter for relevant content without the use of automated tools. The variety of machine learning models available 
to  researchers,  and  the  need  for  manually  labelled  training  data  with  an  even  balance  of  labels,  can  make 
applying  these  tools  challenging.  Here,  we  implement  and  evaluate  a  hierarchical  text  classification  pipeline 
which brings together three binary classification tasks with increasingly specific relevancy criteria. Crucially, the 
hierarchical approach facilitates the filtering and structuring of a large dataset, of which relevant sources make

Since BERT can only accept a maximum of 512 tokens as input, we 
used smaller subsections of the longer web articles as classifier input, an 
approach previously applied to long document classification (Fiok et al., 
2021; Sun et al., 2019). To identify the sections of text most likely to be 
relevant to the classification decision, documents were split into chunks 
of 300 tokens using the NLTK word-tokenizer. Chunks that contained 
any  of  our  original  query  terms  (i.e.  any  bat-related  or  exploitation- 
related  term)  were  retained.  If  more  than  one  chunk  contained  key-
words,  the  first  such  chunk  of  the  document  was  retained  for  use  in 
model training and evaluation. Before being fed into the BERT model, 
texts are tokenized using the BERT tokenizer. Here, we set the maximum 
number of tokens as 400 for social media posts, as most were very short, 
and 512 for web articles, meaning some texts would have been further 
truncated at this step.

ventional  ‘flat’  classification  has  been  previously  demonstrated  as  a 
useful  tool  for  filtering  standardised  datasets,  such  as  academic  ab-
stracts,  data  collection  from  online  platforms  often  generates  large 
volumes of highly variable textual data which, as demonstrated by our 
study,  can  necessitate  using  a  hierarchical  classification  approach. 
Although we focused on collecting social media posts and web articles, 
the models and pipeline developed in this study can be applied to other 
forms of textual data, such as listings from E-commerce platforms.

%Query
Query: "Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if the code repository is hosted on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket based solely on the given information. Further research or additional context may be required to find out where the code repository is located.
