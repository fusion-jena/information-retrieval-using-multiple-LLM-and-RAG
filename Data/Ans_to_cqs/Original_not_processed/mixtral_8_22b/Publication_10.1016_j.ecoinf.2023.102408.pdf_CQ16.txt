The  model  initially  included  all  variables,  acknowledging  the  sig-
nificance  of  identifying  and  selecting  pertinent  variables  for  model 
development. Variable importance measures were employed to evaluate 
their significance, which helped identify the most influential variables 
for  predicting  AGB.  However,  it  is  recognised  that  assessing  model 
performance is essential, particularly when dealing with less important 
variables. A stratified sampling method was applied to all AGB obser-
vations for this evaluation. This technique randomly allocated 70% of 
the samples to the training dataset and the remaining 30% to the vali-
dation  dataset.  Three  error  statistics,  specifically  R2,  mean  absolute 
error  (MAE),  and  RMSE  (as  indicated  in  Eqs.  8,  9,  and  10),  were 
employed to compare the accuracies of the models. The generated ma-
chine learning models were then extrapolated for the entire region. This

The RF algorithm, which has several advantages, was used in this 
study.  It  has  been  noted  in  prior  research  that  RF  outperforms  other 
machine-learning methods, particularly when handling extensive data-
sets (Lourenço et al., 2021). RF provides accurate information regarding 
critical  factors  and  is  less  sensitive  to  parameter  adjustments  (Cutler 
et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2016). This method uses bagging or boosting 
algorithms to randomly select predictors. Despite these advantages, RF 
has certain limitations. Using a large number of predictors can increase 
model  complexity.  It  also  requires  careful  tuning  and  hyper- 
parameterisation  such  as  “mtry”  and  “ntree”,  there  is  a  risk  of  over-
fitting  if  these  parameters  are  not  adjusted  properly.  This  study  sys-
tematically  evaluated  mtry  from  1  to  10,  aiming  to  strike  a  balance 
between  stability  and  minimise  the  Root  Mean  Square Error  (RMSE).

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, the criteria used to determine when training is complete are not explicitly mentioned. However, some common practices in machine learning can be inferred. One possible criterion could be monitoring the performance metrics like R^2, MAE, and RMSE on both the training and validation datasets during the training process. When these metrics stop improving significantly or start deteriorating on the validation set while still improving on the training set, it might indicate that the model is starting to overfit the training data. At this point, the training could be considered complete. Another potential criterion could be observing the validation loss plateau, where the loss function stops decreasing substantially on the validation set. This would suggest that further training may not improve the model's generalization ability. In this study, the authors used a stratified sampling method to allocate 70% of the samples to the training dataset and the remaining 30% to the validation dataset. They likely monitored the performance metrics on both sets to decide when to stop training.
