Random forests have gained its popularity in ecological studies in-
cluding habitat selection and behavioral classiﬁcations of animals
(Cutler et al., 2007; Nathan et al., 2012; Shoemaker et al., 2018). The
random forest algorithm draws a large number of random samples from
the original data, ﬁts CARTs to each of the random samples without
pruning the tree, and then aggregates the “votes” or averages results
the trees to make classiﬁcation or numeric predictions
over all
(Breiman, 2001). Nathan et al. (2012) trained random forests to classify
seven diﬀerent behaviors of free-ranging griﬀon vultures (Gyps fulvus)
using triaxial ACC data and synchronized behavioral observations.
Random forests performed better than support vector machines in
classifying the behaviors of the vulture (Nathan et al., 2012). The
outperformance of random forest is probably because random forests
are an ensemble learning, which uses bagging (bootstrap aggregating)

multiple machine learning algorithms and their ensembles may be
needed in a study for a speciﬁc behavioral category, for which random
forests may have undesired performance.

neural networks, CARTs, linear discriminant analysis, random forests,
and support vector machines, and demonstrated their applications in
the supervised learning of animal behavior based on ACC data.
Brewster et al. (2018) applied six other supervised classiﬁers to classify
the behaviors of lemon sharks (Negaprion brevirostris) at Bimini, Ba-
hamas using ACC data. This study will brieﬂy describe two popular
machine learning algorithms random forests and support vector ma-
chines for the introductory purpose.

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not directly discuss strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it does mention the use of random forests, a type of ensemble learning method, in ecological studies. Random forests work by creating multiple decision trees and combining them to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. Each tree is built using a different subset of the training data, chosen randomly with replacement (bootstrapping), and a random subset of features considered for splitting at each node. This inherently introduces randomness into the model. To manage this randomness, techniques like cross-validation can be used during training to evaluate the model's performance and prevent overfitting. Additionally, setting a fixed random seed value before training can help ensure reproducibility of results across different runs of the same model.
