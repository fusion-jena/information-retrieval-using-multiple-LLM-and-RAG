binary classification problem. Our CNNFULL consisted of three convolution and max pooling
layers, followed by one fully connected layer (see Supplementary Information Methods for fur-
ther details). We halved the size of the input spectrogram to reduce the input dimensionality
to the CNN which resulted in an input array of size of 130 frequency bins by 20 time steps, cor-
responding to a fixed length, detection window size of 23ms. We applied the CNN in a sliding
window fashion, to predict the presence of a search-phase bat call at every instance of time in
the spectrogram (Fig 1D). As passive acoustic monitoring can generate large quantities of data,
we required a detection algorithm that would run faster than real time. While CNNs produce
state of the art results for many tasks, naïve application of them for detection problems at test
time can be extremely computationally inefficient [33]. So, to increase the speed of our system

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given references, it appears that various types of data formats have been utilized in the development of deep learning pipelines. These include:

1. Images: References such as [39] and [42] indicate the use of images in their respective studies. In particular, reference [39] discusses the LifeCLEF Bird Identification task, while reference [42] mentions the Pascal Visual Object Classes challenge, both of which involve image analysis using deep learning techniques.

2. Audio: Several references suggest the use of audio data in deep learning applications. For example, reference [34] focuses on environmental sound classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), while reference [35] explores the use of data augmentation for environmental sound classification. Additionally, reference [37] discusses the use of deep neural networks for acoustic modeling in speech recognition. Furthermore, reference [40] describes a study involving real-time bioacoustic monitoring and automated species identification based on audio recordings.

3. Text: Although not explicitly mentioned in the provided references, text data is commonly used in natural language processing (NLP) applications, where deep learning models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) or Transformers are employed.

4. Other formats: It should also be noted that other data formats may be used depending on the specific application. For instance, reference [61] discusses the assessment of data quality in citizen science projects, which could potentially involve multiple data formats. Similarly, reference [62] presents a method for aggregating opinions from multiple sources, which might require handling diverse data types.

In conclusion, the deep learning pipeline can utilize various data formats, including but not limited to images, audio, and text. The choice of data format depends largely on the nature of the problem being addressed and the available resources.
