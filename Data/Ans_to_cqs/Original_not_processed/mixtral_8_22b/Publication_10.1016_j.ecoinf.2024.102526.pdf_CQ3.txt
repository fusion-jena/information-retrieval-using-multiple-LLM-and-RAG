%Query
Query: "What are the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., bounding box annotation, instance segmentation)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide specific details on the data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it mentions 'image-annotation-QAQC', which suggests that some form of image annotation is performed, possibly for quality assurance and control purposes. To determine the exact data annotation techniques employed, additional information would be required.
