structures (e.g., roads and buildings) and water from slowing down the 
classification processing. This step reduced the average number of pixels 
per scene the classification model had to analyze to 3,757,323 and took, 
on average, 18 s per scene.

Despite its invasive nature, iceplant remains a minority land cover 
class  in  most  NAIP  scenes  in  this  region  compared  to  non-iceplant 
vegetation. Generating training and test data by sampling designs such 
as  random  sampling  or  allocating  samples  in  proportion  to  expected 
class  areas  would  therefore  result  in  a  highly  unbalanced  dataset. 
Training machine learning models with unbalanced sets poses a chal-
lenge to accurately predicting the minority class, often leading to under- 
predicting  it,  and  multiple  methods  exist in  the  literature  to  improve 
balance  in  a  dataset  (He  and  Garcia,  2009).  Due  to  the  high  spatial 
resolution of NAIP and the expanse of the study region, data availability 
for both classes allowed us to create a reasonably balanced final training 
dataset  having  38%  iceplant  points  and  62%  other  vegetation  points 
without having to discard, repeat, or create synthetic data points.

%Query
Query: "What are the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The context does not provide explicit information on how the data was split into training, testing, and validation datasets for the deep learning model. However, based on the given table titled "Training Set" and "Test Set," we can infer that the data was divided into two main categories: Training Set and Test Set. Each set contains two subcategories: veg. and icep., which likely represent different types of vegetation. The total number of instances in each category is also provided. Unfortunately, there is no mention of a separate validation set, but it could be possible that one exists outside of the provided context.
