4.3. Model performance 

All algorithms were evaluated using the same dataset, and five EL 
models were established for both the Chla concentration and turbidity: 
RF,  GBDT,  LightGBM,  XGBoost,  and  CatBoost.  Before  tuning  each 
model, we established a benchmark model with default parameters to 
evaluate  whether  parameter  adjustments  had  a  beneficial  impact  on 
model performance. Hyperparameter optimisation was performed using 

both the random grid search and Bayesian optimisation methods, which 
were  implemented  using  GridSearchCV  from  Scikit-learn  and  the 
Hyperopt  library (version 0.2.7).  We selected the best  parameters  for 
each model and compared the results.

The results for the five models are shown in Fig. 8, the graph within 
the  graph  represents  a  comparison  of  the  measured  and  predicted 
values. First, using 20 spectral bands (Table 2) as training features and 
the Chla concentration as the target, LightGBM and XGBoost achieved 
the best performance. LightGBM achieved the highest R2  (0.8390) and 
Slope (0.8126), while XGBoost had the lowest RMSE (5.0617 μg/L) and 
MAE (3.9776 μg/L), this indicates that the models had the smallest er-
rors  between  their  predicted  values  and  the  measured  values.  Next, 
using 17 spectral bands (Table 2) as training features and turbidity as the 
target, XGBoost achieved the best theoretical generalisation ability in 
five-fold cross-validation (R2 = 0.7927, RMSE = 2.1747 μg/L, Slope =
0.7791, MAE = 1.6791 μg/L). This was slightly better than LightGBM 
(R2 = 0.7915, RMSE = 2.1816 μg/L, Slope = 0.7812, MAE = 1.7091 μg/

3.5. Statistical metrics 

The  coefficient  of  determination  (R2),  root  mean  square  error 
(RMSE),  mean  absolute  error  (MAE),  and  slope  (in  linear  regression)

4.2. Accuracy of input data Rrs 

In water quality remote sensing, the accuracy of the parameter Rrs  is 
of  paramount  importance.  Following  the  method  proposed  by  Wang 
et al. (2016), we used the spectral response functions of Sentinel-2 to 
convert the measured spectra into equivalent bands of Sentinel-2, which 
were  considered  as  true  values.  We  calculated  three  metrics,  MAPE, 
RMSE and MRE, both before and after correction.

Helpful Answer: The performance of the deep learning models in this study was evaluated using several statistical metrics such as the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and slope (in linear regression). These metrics were used to compare the measured and predicted values of chlorophyll-a (Chla) concentration and turbidity. For instance, when using 20 spectral bands as training features and Chla concentration as the target, LightGBM and XGBoost achieved the best performance. LightGBM had the highest R2 (0.8390) and Slope (0.8126), while XGBoost had the lowest RMSE (5.0617 μg/L) and MAE (3.9776 μg/L). Similarly, when using 17 spectral bands as training features and turbidity as the target, XGBoost achieved the best theoretical generalization ability in five-fold cross-validation (R2 = 0.7927, RMSE = 2.1747 μg/L, Slope = 0.7791, MAE = 1.6791 μg/L).
