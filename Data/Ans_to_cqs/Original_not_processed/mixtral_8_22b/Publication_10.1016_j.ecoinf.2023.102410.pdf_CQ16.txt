5. Conclusion

to determine likely tracks by looking at the maximum change in TDOA 
(Nosal, 2013). For example, based on a swimming speed of 10 km/h the 
corresponding  maximum  change  in  TDOA  would  be  0.002  s.  Points 
satisfying the TDOA criteria are chosen as the next point in the track. If 
no points exist satisfying the criteria then the track is terminated (Nosal, 
2013). Similar criteria combined with visual verification of localisation 
estimates have been used by Guazzo et al. (2017) in the distinction of 
localisations for individual animals. In populations where vocal animals 
are generally separated by some distance and have small group sizes, 
this approach can be useful in guiding tracking analysis (Guazzo et al., 
2017). It is likely that advances in future methods of signal analysis and 
localisation will have decreased error and be able to separate individual 
animals with higher certainty.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete or any specific machine learning model being trained. However, common criteria used to determine when training is complete include observing a plateau in the validation loss, monitoring the performance of the model on a held-out test dataset, or setting a predefined number of epochs or iterations. These criteria help ensure that the model has learned from the training data without overfitting and can generalize well to unseen data.
