3.4. Training and testing the models

embedding space between words throughout the training phase.

To train and evaluate the efficiency of each method, the bird song 
dataset was split into a training, validation and testing dataset. For each 
species and country, we randomly selected 70% of the downloaded re-
cordings for the training dataset and kept the remaining 30% for testing. 
Data  augmentation  was  only  applied  to  the  training  dataset,  and  the 
segments obtained were randomly distributed between the training and 
validation sets with a ratio 0.8/0.2. In each case, the model was trained 
for 40 epochs with a batch size of 8 segments and a learning rate of 0.001 
using the Adam optimizer. The training process was performed ten times 
to account for the effect of random weight initialization in neural net-
works. In each execution, we applied the model to the testing dataset 
and recorded the confusion matrix, number of True Positives (TP), False 
Positives (FP), True Negatives (TN) and False Negatives (FN). From that

II:  28  550,  Case  III:  28  556  and  Case  IV:  2  817  286).  However,  they 
cannot classify data without associated metadata and must be retrained 
each time new data or species are added.

Helpful Answer:
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves splitting the bird song dataset into three parts: a training dataset, a validation dataset, and a testing dataset. The training dataset consists of 70% of the recordings for each species and country, while the remaining 30% is used for testing. Data augmentation is applied only to the training dataset, and the resulting segments are randomly distributed between the training and validation sets with a ratio of 0.8/0.2. The model is then trained for 40 epochs using a batch size of 8 segments and a learning rate of 0.001 with the Adam optimizer. This process is repeated ten times to account for the effects of random weight initialization in neural networks. During each execution, the model is applied to the testing dataset, and the confusion matrix, along with the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives, is recorded.
