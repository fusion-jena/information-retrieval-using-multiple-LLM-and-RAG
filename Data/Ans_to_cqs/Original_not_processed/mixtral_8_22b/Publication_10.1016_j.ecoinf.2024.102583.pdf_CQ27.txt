Pourghasemi, 2021), and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) models (F. 
Huang et al., 2022; Y. Huang and Zhao, 2018; Shahzad et al., 2022; Xing 
et al., 2021). These models are flexible and adaptable systems that can 
manage diverse types of data and scenarios for LSM. Another type of 
MLM that has been explored for LSM is the Artificial Neural Network 
(ANN), especially in the Radial Basis Function (RBF) (W. Chen et al., 
2018; Ngo et al., 2021) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) configuration 
(Adnan  et  al.,  2020;  Chang  et  al.,  2022;  Z.  Zhao  et  al.,  2022).  These 
models can learn from data and adjust their parameters to improve their 
performance.

loss function, effectively preventing overfitting and promoting simpler 
models,  utilization  of  a  more  advanced  optimization  approach  that 
combines  first-order  gradients  (loss  function  gradient)  with  second- 
order  gradients  (loss  function  curvature)  which  makes  it  faster  than 
some other models, ability to handle missing data during tree building 
by  employing  weighted  quantile  sketch,  built-in  cross-validation  sup-
port  that  aids  the  model  evaluation  and  hyperparameter  tuning,  and 
imbalanced  data  handling.  Thanks  to  its  exceptional  efficiency  and 
performance and its availability in various programming languages like 
Python, R, and Java, XGBoost has found widespread adoption in land-
slide risk assessment (Akinci et al., 2021; Badola et al., 2023; Can et al., 
2021; Hussain et al., 2022b).
