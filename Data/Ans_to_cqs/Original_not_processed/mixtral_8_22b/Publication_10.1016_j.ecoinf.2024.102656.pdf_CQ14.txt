3.2. Model performance 

The five  component  models (GLM,  MaxEnt,  RF, GBM,  and  MARS) 
demonstrated variable  performance (Table 2).  Notably, the  RF model 
and the GLM model demonstrated the best and worst performance for all 
studied species, respectively (Table 2). 

3.3. Variable contributions to habitat suitability 

In the ensemble habitat suitability model, distance to mining roads, 
distance  to  roads,  distance  to  CAs,  and  distance  to  water  resources 
played  important  roles  in  predicting  habitat  suitability  for  the  three 
species (Table  3). Response curves  detailing the  relationship between 
habitat suitability and environmental variables in the best-performing 
model  (the  RF  model),  are  presented  in  Supplementary  Materials

2.6. Modelling landscape resistance 

To  assess  landscape  resistance  to  species  movement,  we  used  a 
negative  exponential  function  to  convert  the  ensemble  habitat  suit-
ability  raster  for  each  species  into  a  resistance  surface.  The  trans-
formation was executed using the following equation: 

R = 1000

–1×HS 

Where R represents the cost resistance for a cell, and HS represents 
habitat  suitability  (Wan  et  al.,  2019).  To  standardize  the  resistance 
values  within a range of  1 to 100, a linear interpolation method  was 
employed.  This  ensured  that  the  minimum  resistance  (Rmin)  was 
assigned  a  value  of  1  when  HS  was  equal  to  1,  and  the  maximum 
resistance (Rmax) was assigned a value of 100 when HS was equal to 
0 (Wan et al., 2019). This process facilitates a consistent and standard-
ized  representation  of  landscape  resistance,  allowing  for  meaningful 
analysis and interpretation.

To address uncertainties in movement behaviour and dispersal data 
for the three species, we conducted sensitivity analysis. Four distance 
thresholds  were  analysed  (50,000,  70,000,  and  100,000  cost  units), 
representing  50,  70,  and  100  km  of  movement,  respectively,  through 
optimum, low-resistance habitats. This analysis is crucial, considering 
the  significant  influence  of  dispersal  ability  on  predicted  functional 
connectivity, which often surpasses the impact of landscape resistance 
itself (Rezaei et al., 2022a, 2022b). Resistant kernel connectivity maps 
were used to identify core areas for each species. Core habitat patches 
were defined as contiguous areas with resistant kernel values exceeding 
10% of the highest values recorded for the species (Mohammadi et al., 
2022). This approach ensured the identification of critical areas for each 
species  within  the  landscape,  aiding  conservation  planning  and 
management.
