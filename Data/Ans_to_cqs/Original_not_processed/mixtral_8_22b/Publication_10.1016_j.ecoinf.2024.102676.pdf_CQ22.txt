For metric features, the mean value of the corresponding variable is 
computed among the observed components and imputed for the missing 
instances at that variable.

We obtained rank values for the BCR and DER for each species and 
for each fraction p of missing landmarks. This resulted in 30 rankings for 
each method and target metric. We then summed the rankings for both 
the BCR and DER and calculated the average to obtain a final rank-based 
performance evaluation metric with a range of 1–6. Lower numbers on 
this scale indicate the better overall performance of the FIT model. 

2.3. Study design

To  further  enhance  the  Footprint  Identification  Technique  (FIT) 
method,  we  recommend  collecting  imperfect  footprints  when  high- 
quality  footprints  are  insufficient  during  field  surveys.  Instead  of  dis-
carding incomplete prints, we advocate using missing value imputation 
as  part  of  the  data  preprocessing  pipeline.  This  approach  preserves 
valuable data and improves the accuracy of FIT predictions when sub- 
quality footprints are included. Our findings are supported by a study 
using  deep  learning  models  to  classify  three  sympatric  otter  species, 
where a model trained on images of all qualities was only marginally 
outperformed  by  a  model  trained  on  high-quality  prints,  highlighting 
the  potential  of  utilizing  lower  quality  data  effectively  Kistner  et  al.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it mentions that rank values were obtained for the BCR (Base Classifier Rank) and DER (Dissimilarity Error Rate) for each species and fraction of missing landmarks. These rankings were then summed and averaged to calculate a final rank-based performance evaluation metric ranging from 1 to 6. A lower number indicates better overall performance of the FIT model. Therefore, based on this information, it can be inferred that the BCR and DER are two important metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this context.
