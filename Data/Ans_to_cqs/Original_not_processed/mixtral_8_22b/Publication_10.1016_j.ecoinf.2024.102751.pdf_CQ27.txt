• The model suggests that grassland shows exhibits high VWC, con-
firming importance of vegetation cover in water storage capacity.
• The developed model provides a useful foundation for understanding
water retention patterns on the coal mining heap, aiding the recla-
mation planning, and monitoring the success of the restoration.
• Investigating temporal VWC dynamics using time-series satellite
imagery will reveal seasonal and inter-annual variations. The
model’s applicability can be assessed by extending it to other post-
mining sites or regions. Integrating the model into decision support
tools will enable real-time monitoring and management of post-
mining landscapes. Exploring machine learning algorithms could
further improve predictive power and uncover hidden relationships
within the dataset.

2.3. ALS data

ALS point clouds were downloaded through the official website of
the General Office of Geodesy and Cartography (GUGiK), the Geoportal
for Spatial Information Infrastructure (https://www.geoportal.gov.pl;
Table 1). The portal provides free spatial data. Geoportal complies with
the INSPIRE Directive, an initiative to make spatial data available in
Europe, which aims to create a harmonized spatial information system
in the European Union (Directive 2007/2/EC 2007). The parameters of
ALS data are shown in Table 1.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information provided to determine what specific process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The given references and text snippets do not mention any details about the deployment process such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based on the given context.
