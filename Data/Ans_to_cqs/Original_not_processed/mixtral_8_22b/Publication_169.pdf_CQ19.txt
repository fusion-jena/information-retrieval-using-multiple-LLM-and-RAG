Experimental set up 

We  perform  a  complete  experiment  to 
demonstrate the performance of the proposed 
approach.  The  CNN-LSTM  Model  was 
implemented  with  the  python  library,  using 
Theano and Keras. The model parameters are 
optimized  using  gradient  descent  Adam 
algorithm  with  all  parameters  set  to  default 
values.  The system specification details are 
presented in  table 1,  while the detail  of the

Generally, the proposed network system has 
20  layers:  12  convolutional  layers,  five 
pooling  layers,  one  Fully  Connected  layer, 
one LSTM layer, and one output layer with 
the  softmax  function  for  classification.  The 
convolutional  layer  with  a  size  of  3  ×  3 
kernels is used for extracting feature and it is 
activated  by  the  ReLU  function.  The  max-
pooling layer with a size of 2 × 2 kernels is 
applied to reduce the dimensions of an input 
image. In the last part of the architecture, the 
function map is shifted to the LSTM layer to

classification  purpose.  Using  the  reshape 
method,  the  input  size  of  the  LSTM  layer 
becomes (196,512). After analyzing the time 
features,  the  model  sorts  the  plant  species 
images  through  a  fully  connected  layer  to

traditional  feedforward  neural  networks. 
Figure 3 shows the structure of CNN that can 
be  used  in  many  applications.  For  image 
recognition  applications,  several  baseline 
architectures of CNNs have been developed, 
which  have  been  successfully  applied  to 
complicated  tasks  of  visual  imagery.  The 
common CNN architectures that are largely 
used in image data recognition includes: (i) 
AlexNet  (Krizhevsky  et  al.  2012),  (ii) 
PredNet (Banzi et al. 2019), (iii) GoogLeNet 
(Szegedy  et  al.  2015), 
(iv)  Overfeat 
(Sermanet  et  al.  2014),  and  (v)  VGG 
(Simonyan  et  al.  2014).  These  models  and 
their training and testing processes, are freely 
available for transfer learning purpose.
