Despite massive advancements in the field of machine learning (ML)
during the last decade, ML is not yet often used for vegetation studies.
ML models can be used for various tasks, among which are classification,
regression, and image segmentation. In ML, models extract knowledge
from data and use this knowledge to produce an output relevant to the
task at hand. These models use three main learning paradigms: super-
vised learning, unsupervised learning or reinforcement learning. This
study only considers the first paradigm, as we build a regression model.
Within supervised learning, there are a multitude of model types, for
example, support vector machines (Hearst et al., 1998), boosted tree
ensembles (e.g., XGBoost (Chen and Guestrin, 2016) or LightGBM (Ke
et al., 2017)) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) (McCulloch and
Pitts, 1943). This analysis will use ANNs, particularly multilayer per-
ceptrons (MLPs), which are fully connected feedforward neural net-

Question: %INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the provided pieces of context to answer the query in less than 400 words. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

%Query
Query: "Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not explicitly mention where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a direct answer to the query with the given context. It would require additional resources or information to determine the location of the code repository.
