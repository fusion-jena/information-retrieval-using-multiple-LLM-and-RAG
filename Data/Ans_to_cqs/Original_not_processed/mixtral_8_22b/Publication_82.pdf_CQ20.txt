Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

To summarize, we have a total of 60 experimental

conﬁgurations, which vary on the following parameters:

1. Choice of deep learning architecture:

AlexNet,
GoogLeNet.

2. Choice of training mechanism:

Transfer Learning,
Training from Scratch.

3. Choice of dataset type:

Color,
Gray scale,
Leaf Segmented.

4. Choice of training-testing set distribution:

Train: 80%, Test: 20%,
Train: 60%, Test: 40%,
Train: 50%, Test: 50%,
Train: 40%, Test: 60%,
Train: 20%, Test: 80%.

• Momentum: 0.9,
• Weight decay: 0.0005,
• Gamma: 0.1,
• Batch size: 24 (in case of GoogLeNet), 100 (in case of AlexNet).

All the above experiments were conducted using our own fork of
Caﬀe (Jia et al., 2014), which is a fast, open source framework for
deep learning. The basic results, such as the overall accuracy can
also be replicated using a standard instance of caﬀe.

Each of these 60 experiments runs for a total of 30 epochs,
where one epoch is deﬁned as the number of training iterations
in which the particular neural network has completed a full pass
of the whole training set. The choice of 30 epochs was made based
on the empirical observation that in all of these experiments, the
learning always converged well within 30 epochs (as is evident
from the aggregated plots (Figure 3) across all the experiments).
To enable a fair comparison between the results of all the
experimental conﬁgurations, we also tried to standardize the
hyper-parameters across all the experiments, and we used the
following hyper-parameters in all of the experiments:
• Solver type: Stochastic Gradient Descent,
• Base learning rate: 0.005,

• Learning rate policy: Step (decreases by a factor of 10 every
