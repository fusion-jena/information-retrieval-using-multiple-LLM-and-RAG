Bayr, U., Puschmann, O., 2019. Automatic detection of woody vegetation in repeat

and Puschmann (2019) applied a convolutional neural network for the 
automatic  recognition  of  woody  regrowth  vegetation  in  repeat  land-
scape  photographs. By comparing  the changes between repeat  photo-
graphs, planners and designers can identify general trends of landscape 
change.  Although  these  image-based  methods  are  powerful  tools  to 
assess and track landscape visual quality, design projects’ aesthetic and 
scientific meaning may be transformed or lost during the modification 
and  application  process  in  the  widely  used  visualization  tools,  like 
Rhino, Sketchup, and 3D Max (Urech et al., 2020). Moreover, image- 
based  methods  fail  to  capture  or  represent  some  spatial attributes  (e. 
g.,  volumes),  which  is  also  a  key  component  within  the  landscape 
composition. Extracting and representing spatial attributes from the 3D 
models created in widely used visualization tools for landscape planning

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The paper does not provide information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the data will be made available upon request. Additionally, supplementary data related to the article can be found online at <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2023.102436>. Unfortunately, without further details, I cannot provide a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the paper.
