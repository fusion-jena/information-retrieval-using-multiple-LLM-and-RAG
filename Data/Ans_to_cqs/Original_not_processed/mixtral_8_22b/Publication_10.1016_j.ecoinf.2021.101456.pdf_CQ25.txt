dataset  recorded  at  a  different  location  and  was  gradually  expanded 
until  reconstructions  were  sufficiently  good.  In  order  to  visualize  the 
latent  representation,  the  size  of  the  bottleneck  of  the  model  (latent 
dimension) was limited to two. Details of the network architecture are 
reported in Table 1.

Given unlabelled input data consisting of N samples with F features, 
x ∈ ℝN×F,  the  probabilistic  encoder  of  a  VAE  maps  the  input  to  the 
posterior density p(z|x) over the latent variable, z ∈ ℝN×L. In practice, 
L << N and the encoder neural network approximates the true posterior 
density, p(z|x), with a multivariate Gaussian, qθ(z|x) ∼ 𝒩 (μθ, σ2
θ ). The 
decoder of a VAE reconstructs the input data from the latent variable 
and is given by the density function pφ(x|z). The encoder and decoder 
neural networks are parameterised by θ  and φ, respectively. The opti-
mization objective of a VAE consists of two competing terms and it can 
be shown to be (Kingma and Welling, 2014)

All models were implemented in PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2019) and 
trained for 5000 epochs using the Adam optimizer (Kingma et al., 2015) 
(cid:0) 3. The models were trained on Nvidia GTX 
with a learning rate of 10
1050 graphics processing unit with 4 GB memory with a batch size of 
256. A decision to adapt β was taken every fifth epoch to avoid random 
fluctuations. The scaling of the clustering loss, γ, in the semi-supervised 
mode was cycled between 0.01 and 0.2 every 100 epochs. 

4.4. Results 

The clustering performance on the labelled test set for the unsuper-
vised and semi-supervised instances of the dynamic β-VAE is presented 
in Table 2. 

The dynamic β-VAE performs better than the baselines in the ARI- 
and AMI-scores which quantifies the intra-class cohesion and inter-class 
separability. While HCA have been successfully used to identify groups

2.2. VAEs and β-annealing 

Variational  autoencoders  (VAEs)  consist  of  a  regularized  probabi-
listic  encoder-decoder  pair  and  are  some  of  the  most  powerful  repre-
sentation learning methods (Bengio et al., 2013; Kingma and Welling, 
2014). They have seen broad applications in generative modelling and 
unsupervised learning tasks.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the provided information, the purpose of the deep learning model discussed here appears to be related to representation learning and clustering. This is suggested by several points in the text. Firstly, the use of Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) indicates a focus on representation learning, as these models are known for their ability to learn meaningful representations of input data. Secondly, the mention of the optimization objective of the VAE, which includes a term for reconstruction loss and another for regularization, further supports this interpretation. Lastly, the evaluation of the model's performance based on metrics such as Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) and Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI) scores suggests that the model is being used for clustering purposes. These metrics measure how well the model can group similar data together and separate dissimilar data, which is a key aspect of clustering tasks. Therefore, while the exact application or specific task of the model is not explicitly stated, we can infer that its purpose is likely related to representation learning and clustering.
