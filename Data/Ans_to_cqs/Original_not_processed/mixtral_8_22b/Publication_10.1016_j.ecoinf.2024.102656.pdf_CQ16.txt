available in Supplementary text S1). This methodology enhances pre-
dictive  accuracy  by  combining  forecasts  from  multiple  statistical 
models, mitigating the uncertainties and biases inherent in relying on a 
single modelling method (Araújo and New, 2007; Hysen et al., 2022). 
Five  statistical  models  were  used  in  this  ensemble  framework, 
including  generalized  linear  models  (GLM),  maximum  entropy  (Max-
Ent),  random  forest  (RF),  generalized  boosting  model  (GBM),  and 
multivariate  adaptive  regression  lines  (MARS).  To  facilitate  model 
training, we employed a 3:1 train-test split for the occurrence points. 
Additionally, following Barbet-Massin et al. (2012), we generated 1000 
random  pseudo-absence  points  (five  times  the  number  of  occurrence 
points per species) across the study area. These pseudo-absence points 
are crucial for model execution and provide a reference for areas that are 
unlikely to be inhabited by the target species.

The ensemble prediction was generated using a weighted-averaging 
approach,  assigning  weights  to  individual  models  based  on  their  pre-
dictive  accuracy  on  the  test  data  (Thuiller,  2014).  Evaluation  and 
comparative analyses were conducted for both individual models and 
the ensemble model via two widely recognized metrics: the area under 
the curve (AUC) and the true skill statistic (TSS). AUC values exceeding 
0.9 were considered as excellent, 0.9–0.8 as good, 0.8–0.7 as moderate, 
and < 0.7 as poor (Eskildsen et al., 2013). Similarly, TSS values were 
categorized as excellent (>0.75), good (0.75 to 0.4), and poor (<0.4) 
(Eskildsen et al., 2013). This comprehensive assessment ensures a robust 
understanding of model performance and aids in reliable predictions of 

species distribution across the central Iranian plateau.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it can be inferred that the authors use a 3:1 train-test split for the occurrence points and evaluate the predictive accuracy of each model on the test data. The evaluation is done through two widely recognized metrics: the area under the curve (AUC) and the true skill statistic (TSS). The AUC values are categorized as excellent, good, moderate, or poor, while the TSS values are classified as excellent, good, or poor. Therefore, it can be assumed that the completion of training might depend on achieving satisfactory results according to these metrics. Nonetheless, without further details, it cannot be confirmed what exact criteria are used to determine when training is complete.
