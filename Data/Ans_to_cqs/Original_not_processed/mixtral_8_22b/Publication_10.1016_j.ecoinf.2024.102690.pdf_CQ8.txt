Identification of optional ecological sources 

The SOFM is an unsupervised learning neural network approach that 
combines dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis to allocate 
research units into different ES bundles based on spatial similarities. The 
ES bundles were divided using SOFM (using the R package kohonen) 
based on the results of the reconstructed ESV, and the ideal number of 
bundles  was  established  by  calculating  the  Davis-Boldin  Index  (DBI), 
which was used as the basis for identifying ecological sources and setting 
scenarios. Furthermore, this study used hotspot analysis (Getis-Ord G*
i ) 
to  analyze the  spatial clustering of  ESV and  considered  hotspot areas 
with a significance level of 90% or more as optional ecological sources.

source, and patches removed under this threshold had minimal impact 
on  the  overall  landscape  pattern  and  ecological  function.  Using  this 
threshold, we identified 19 ecological sources (Fig. 5). The total area of 
the sources accounted for 37.6% of the study area, including 11 product 
supply sources, 4 water conservation sources, and 4 habitat maintenance 
sources,  with  average  areas  of  156  km2,  11.5  km2,  and  231  km2, 
respectively.

along  river  runoff  corridors  in  Scenario  C.  While  other  disturbance 
points were mostly found in the center of the mountain greenbelt, those 
in  the  southern  section  of  the  region  were  concentrated  around  river 
tributaries and watercourses.
