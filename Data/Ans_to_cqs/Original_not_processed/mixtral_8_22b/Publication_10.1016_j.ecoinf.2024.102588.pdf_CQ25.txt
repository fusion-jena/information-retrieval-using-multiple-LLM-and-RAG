2.4.2. Convolutional neural network 

CNN is a type of deep learning algorithm primarily used for image 
recognition and processing tasks (Chauhan et al., 2018). It’s composed 
of multiple layers, including convolutional layers that apply kernels to 
extract  features  from  input  images,  followed  by  pooling  layers  that 
reduce  the  spatial  dimensions  of  the  features.  CNNs  are  designed  to 
automatically learn hierarchical representations of data, making them 
highly effective for tasks like object detection, image classification, and 
even natural language processing (Khan et al., 2020). That is, the CNN 
architecture  was  designed  to  efficiently  process  complex  datasets 
(Alshehhi et al., 2017). Convolutional layers adopt internal kernel op-
erations that calculate nonlinear features using trainable weights and

Looking beyond these data to improve the extensibility of investigations 
on the health of aquatic ecosystems is necessary (Upadhyay and Khan-
delwal,  2019;  Yuan  et  al.,  2017).  Deep  learning  techniques  have  the 
potential to be used to investigate parts of ecosystems. In this study, the 
TDI, BMI, and FAI were calculated using ecological monitoring data, and 
the status of the aquatic ecosystem was determined. Quantitative and 
qualitative  indices  may  constrain  further  applications,  such  as  grade 
prediction of aquatic ecosystem health. However, we demonstrated that 
the CNN model ensemble with an autoencoder is a potential candidate 
for  estimating  aquatic  ecosystem  health  indices  compared  with  the 
original CNN and conventional machine learning models (Table 3). In 
other  words,  deep  learning  methods  can  be  applied  to  water  quality, 
hydraulic, and hydrological data to reflect the quantitative and quali-

To  determine  the  optimal  data-driven  model,  the  conventional 
model performances were compared with the estimation performances 
of the CNN and the CNN with the autoencoder. The ANN model uses 
hidden nodes in hidden layers with learnable weights to extract input 
data. The principles of feature extraction and model training are similar 
to those of the autoencoder and CNN models. Six hidden layers were 
designed  with  128,  128,  256,  256,  512,  and  512  nodes.  The  output 
layers with three nodes estimated the three indices. The loss function 
and optimizer were set as the mean squared error and Adam optimizer, 
respectively, at a learning rate of 0.001. The SVM regression model was 
designed to estimate TDI, BMI, and FAI. The kernel function, C-param-
eter, and gamma of the SVM were set to radial basis functions of 100 and 
0.1, respectively. The SVM was unable to estimate the indices simulta-
neously. The RF uses an ensemble regressor by applying multiple deci-

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred based on the information provided. The authors use a combination of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and an autoencoder to estimate aquatic ecosystem health indices, namely TDI, BMI, and FAI. This suggests that the primary goal of their deep learning model is to perform regression analysis, which involves predicting continuous values rather than classifying or detecting objects within images.

In general, deep learning models can serve various purposes depending on their design and application. Some common types include:

1. Classification: These models categorize inputs into specific classes or labels. For example, identifying whether an image contains a cat or a dog.

2. Object detection: These models locate and identify objects within an image, often drawing bounding boxes around detected items.

3. Semantic segmentation: These models assign each pixel in an image to a particular class, creating a detailed map of different elements present in the scene.

4. Instance segmentation: Similar to semantic segmentation, instance segmentation identifies individual instances of objects within an image while also distinguishing between overlapping items.

5. Regression: As mentioned earlier, regression models aim to predict continuous values instead of discrete categories. They might be used to forecast temperature changes over time or estimate real estate prices based on various factors.

Given the context provided, it appears that the researchers employed a deep learning model for regression purposes to estimate aquatic ecosystem health indices accurately.
