Advances in computing have led to a dramatic increase in the op-
portunities  to  use  machine  learning  for  bioacoustic  classification 
(Bianco et al., 2019; Mutanu et al., 2022; Stowell, 2022). In particular, 
use of deep neural networks show great promise for large datasets on a 
wide variety of taxa, including marine mammals (Frainer et al., 2023; 
Frasier et al., 2017; Li et al., 2020a; Rom´an Ruiz et  al., 2023; Zhong 
et al., 2020). Neural networks typically require significant sample sizes 
for all classes, although there are increasingly new tools to enhance data 
or combined disparate datasets (Dufourq et al., 2022; Nanni et al., 2020; 
Nolasco et al., 2023; Padovese et al., 2023; Shorten and Khoshgoftaar, 
2019).  There  is  a  significant  learning  curve  to  understand  how  to

properly apply and test neural network classification methods on a novel 
dataset,  although  development  of  more  user  friendly  tools  are  in 
development (Kahl et al., 2021; Kirsebom et al., 2022). Despite the great 
potential for deep learning methods, modification of existing machine 
learning  methods  with  a  lower  barrier  to  entry  may  be  sufficient  for 
many bioacoustic classification tasks.

%Query
Query: "Which hardware resources are used for training the deep learning model (e.g., GPUs, TPUs)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention which specific hardware resources were used for training the deep learning models. However, it can be inferred from the general knowledge about deep learning that GPU (Graphics Processing Units) or TPU (Tensor Processing Units) are commonly used for training such models due to their ability to perform parallel computations efficiently. Therefore, without further information, one could assume that either GPUs or TPUs might have been utilized for training these deep learning models.
