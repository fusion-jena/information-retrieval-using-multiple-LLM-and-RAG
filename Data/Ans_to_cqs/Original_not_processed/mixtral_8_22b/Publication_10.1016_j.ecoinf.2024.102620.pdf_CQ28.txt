The  PLUS  model  consists  of  two  main  modules:  the  transformed 
specification mining framework based on the land expansion analysis 
strategy (LEAS) module and the cellular automata (CA) model based on 
a multi-type random patch seed mechanism (CARS). In the LEAS mod-
ule, the PLUS model employs the random forest algorithm to obtain the 
development probabilities of each land use type based on two periods of 
land use data. This approach is considered superior to the FLUS model, 
which  uses  an  artificial  neural  network  (ANN)  to  determine  develop-
ment  probabilities  based  on  only  one  period  of  land  use  data.  Addi-
tionally,  the  PLUS  model  proposes  a  decreasing  threshold  rule  for 
generating  patch  seeds.  This  gradual  constraint  on  patch  growth  of 
various land use types is achieved through the iterative process. Cells 
with a higher total probability are more likely to change preferentially

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it appears that the deep learning model was not deployed using any specific cloud service provider such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. Instead, the authors utilized Google Earth Engine (GEE), which is a web-based platform for planetary-scale geospatial analysis. The GEE provides access to petabytes of satellite imagery and other datasets, along with tools for processing and analyzing this data. Therefore, it can be assumed that the deep learning model was developed and executed within the GEE environment itself. However, if there were additional details about the deployment of the model, they would need to be explicitly mentioned in order to provide a definitive answer.
