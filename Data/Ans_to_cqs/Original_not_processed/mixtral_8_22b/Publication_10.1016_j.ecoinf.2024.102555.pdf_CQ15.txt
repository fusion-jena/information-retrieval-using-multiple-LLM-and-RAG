beneficial role in enhancing NDVI.

This will deepen people's understanding of the impacts of climatic fac-
tors  and  human  activities  on  NDVI,  and  provide  effective  technical 
recommendations  for  coping  with  vegetation  problems.  From  the 
perspective of natural and financial development, a series of measures 
should be encouraged to increase vegetation cover, including improving 
rainfall utilization efficiency, adopting biotechnology to improve water 
utilization efficiency, prohibiting overgrazing, and returning farmland 
to forest and grassland.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The paper titled "Verification of novel integrations of swarm intelligence algorithms into deep learning neural network for flood susceptibility mapping" discusses the integration of swarm intelligence algorithms into deep learning models. However, it does not explicitly mention any specific optimization technique such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). Therefore, based solely on this information, we cannot determine which optimization techniques were used in their deep learning pipeline. The other papers mentioned do not focus on deep learning pipelines either, so they also do not provide relevant information regarding optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines.
