2.4. Statistical analyses

different Sika Deer vocalizations (range 2–70%, Enari et al., 2019). A 
recent study using the Red Deer as a study species obtained recall rates 
of  approximately  90%  for  the  five  supervised  machine  learning  algo-
rithms tested, suggesting that the creation of sophisticated models could 
clearly improve the detection of ungulate vocalization.

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not directly address the specific strategies used to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it can be inferred from the context that various techniques are employed to improve the accuracy and reliability of results when dealing with complex data analysis tasks like detecting and tracking wildlife sounds or modeling animal behavior patterns.

In general, handling randomness in deep learning pipelines involves setting initial conditions, such as specifying a fixed random seed value, which ensures reproducibility across different runs of the same model. This is crucial for comparing results between experiments and maintaining consistency within research projects. Additionally, techniques like cross-validation, bootstrapping, and ensemble methods help manage variability by averaging out the effects of randomness on model performance.

While these strategies aren't explicitly mentioned in the given context, they are commonly applied in statistical computing environments like R, which is referenced in one of the sources. Furthermore, the use of sophisticated machine learning algorithms and supervised learning approaches, as discussed in the context, also implies the need for careful management of randomness to ensure reliable and accurate results.
