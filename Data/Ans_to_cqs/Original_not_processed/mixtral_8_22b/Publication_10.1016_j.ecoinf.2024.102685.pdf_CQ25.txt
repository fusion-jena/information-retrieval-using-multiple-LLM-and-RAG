2.4.1. Random forest classification

Random  Forest  is  a  machine  learning  method  combining  decision 
trees  and  bootstrapping.  Developed  by  Breiman  (2001),  RF  has  been 
found to be insensitive to overtraining, small or noisy datasets. Every 
decision tree in the implemented RF algorithm is trained with a boot-
strapped sample of the training data and, at every split node, a subset of 
randomly  selected  features  is  utilized.  Then  for  each  pixel,  the  final 
classification  is  obtained  by  a  majority  vote.  RF  has  proven  to  be  an 
effective tool for mapping coastal and seagrass habitats (Fauzan et al., 
2021; Traganos and Reinartz, 2018b; Wicaksono et al., 2019). Two sets 
of RF models were performed using the multispectral images retrieved in 
2010. In the first set, the response variable was the presence/absence of 
the total seagrass meadows (hereafter identified as seagrass meadows), 
where areas with <20% seagrass cover were considered absence (Valle

These datasets were used to further validate the classification per-
formance of the models over the considered time period. For both years, 
a  total  of  155  points  were  randomly  distributed  within  the  lagoon. 
Through  photointerpretation  analysis,  an  ID  corresponding  to  the 
presence/absence of seagrass meadows was assigned to each point. In 
addition,  another  validation  dataset  of  155  field  training  points  was 
available  for  the  year  2019  representing  a  subsample  of  the  data 
collected in 2010 (unpublished data), were species occurrence was also 
recorded (Fig. 1).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, based on the information available, it can be inferred that the Random Forest model, which is a type of machine learning method, is being used for classification purposes. Specifically, this model is employed to classify pixels into either the presence or absence of seagrass meadows. This is evident from the statement, "Two sets of RF models were performed using the multispectral images retrieved in 2010. In the first set, the response variable was the presence/absence of the total seagrass meadows." Therefore, the primary objective of this model appears to be the classification of seagrass meadow coverage.
