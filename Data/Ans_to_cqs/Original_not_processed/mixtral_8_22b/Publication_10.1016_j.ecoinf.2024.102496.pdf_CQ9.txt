Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

filter, WQ inlets, weekly street sweeping, wet pond, and wetland detention. Bars with gray outlines and white filling represent BMPs for which efficiency data was 
not available.

any  coding,  the  entire  geodatabase  is  available  as  a  map  package  to 
download and use on personal computers, especially by researchers and 
spatial analysts who may want to conduct in-depth studies or customize 
the data and visualizations for their specific needs.

Fig.  6  provides  an  overview  of  the  tool,  highlighting  its  various 
features, which are identified by corresponding numbers in the figure. 
These  features  include  1)  zoom  in  and  out,  default  extent,  and  my 
location;  2)  search  bar  to  find  a  place  or  address;  3)  environmental 
justice indices alongside total pollutant loads before and after BMP; 4) 
map legend; 5); filtering metrics based on specific values; 6) addition of 
online  data;  7)  selection  of  different  basemaps;  and  8)  selection  of  a 
specific region, print map and share the tool. Using the drop-down menu 
labeled as #3 in Fig. 6, users can access pollutant loads pre- and post- 
BMP  implementation,  as  well  as  EJ  metrics  and  indices.  All  data  are 
color-coded based on quantile mapping, which means there are equal 
numbers of watersheds or census tracts within each class, representing 
different  tiers  of  pollution  or  social  vulnerability.  Pollutant  loads  are

of locations based on other relevant criteria as needed. In addition to the 
online  tool,  we  also  offer  a  comprehensive  map  package  that  can  be 
downloaded and utilized within a desktop GIS software suite. This map 
package provides complete access to all the layers utilized in the tool, 
allowing users to fully explore and analyze the data offline. The online 
tool serves as a valuable guide for decision-makers seeking to promote 
environmental equity. By identifying areas with existing social vulner-
abilities and high pollution loads, our online tool empowers decision- 
makers  to  strategically  allocate  limited  public  funds  where  they  are 
needed  most.  The  information  on  different  types  of  BMPs  and  their 
removal  efficiencies  offers  decision-makers  a  range  of  options  for 
addressing specific pollutant issues. This approach helps prioritize the 
implementation of the most effective BMPs in regions requiring urgent

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the availability of the deep learning pipeline data repository on platforms such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. However, it mentions that the entire geodatabase is available as a map package to download and use on personal computers, especially for researchers and spatial analysts who may want to conduct in-depth studies or customize the data and visualizations for their specific needs. Additionally, it states that a comprehensive map package can be downloaded and utilized within a desktop GIS software suite, providing complete access to all the layers used in the tool. Therefore, while the exact platform for the deep learning pipeline data repository is unknown, it appears that the data can be accessed through a downloadable map package.
