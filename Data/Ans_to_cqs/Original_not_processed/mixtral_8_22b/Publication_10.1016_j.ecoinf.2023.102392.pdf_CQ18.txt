Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there is no direct mention of any specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it can be assumed that common practices such as cross-validation or tracking metrics like precision, recall, F1 score, overall accuracy (OA), and Kappa were employed for monitoring the model performance during training. The tables show various values for these metrics, which suggests they might have been used for evaluating the model's performance. Nonetheless, without explicit details about the implementation process, one cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the exact strategy used to monitor the model performance during training.
