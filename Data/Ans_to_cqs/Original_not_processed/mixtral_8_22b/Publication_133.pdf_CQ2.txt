Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Machine learning methods are increasingly applied to
biological problems that involve classiﬁcation of images and
extracting information from them. The current leading approach
to such tasks is supervised learning using deep neural networks

(DNNs), and particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs),
which are able to extract abstract high level features from images.
Identifying objects within the image and classifying them may
be treated as separate tasks. Yet, more recent methods, such as
“Faster R-CNN” (Ren et al., 2015), and YOLO (Redmon et al.,
2016) consider both problems at the same time.

images will soon allow many ecological applications that are
now practically impossible. These include early detection of the
arrival of invasive species, disease vectors or crop pests into
new areas; identiﬁcation of insect migration pathways to allow
eﬀective design of ecological corridors; and predicting climate-
change eﬀects by insect densities, activity seasons, body sizes, age
distributions, and sex ratios along climatic gradients.

INTRODUCTION

Question: %INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the provided pieces of context to answer the query in less than 400 words. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

%Query
Query: "What data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., image, audio, video, CSV)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is primarily images. This is evident from several mentions of images throughout the text, including phrases like "classification of images," "identifying objects within the image," and references to specific techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) which are commonly used for image analysis. Additionally, the mention of "annotated images" further supports this conclusion. However, the context does not provide explicit details about other potential data formats such as audio, video, or CSV files being used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, we can only confirm that images are one of the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.
