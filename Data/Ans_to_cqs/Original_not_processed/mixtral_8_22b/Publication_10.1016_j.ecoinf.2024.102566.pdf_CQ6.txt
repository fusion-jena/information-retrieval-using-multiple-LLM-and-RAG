field-collected data and machine learning methods on developing AGB 
models.  Moreover,  the  quality  of  training  samples  and  the  layout  of 
sampling  points  are  crucial  for  constructing  accurate  and  reliable 
models for biomass estimation (Morais et al., 2021). In this study, owing 
to  the  insufficiency  of  high-quality  training  samples,  we  employed  a 
method with low data dependency that integrates forest inventory data 
with remote sensing imagery for biomass estimation.

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not directly discuss the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it is important to note that these preprocessing steps are often necessary when working with datasets to ensure optimal performance of the model. Normalization can help bring all features into the same range, which can be beneficial if the dataset has varying scales. Scaling can also adjust values measured at different scales to a common scale, while cleaning involves removing noise from the data. These techniques can improve the accuracy and efficiency of the model during training.
