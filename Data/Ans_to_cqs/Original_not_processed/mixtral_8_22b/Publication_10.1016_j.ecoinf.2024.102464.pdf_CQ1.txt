In  our  study,  we  utilized  data  from  the  third  and  fourth  natural 
environment surveys, incorporating various environmental variables, to 
assess  the  impact  of  urban  development  on  species  distribution.  To 
achieve  this,  we  employed  seven  different  machine  learning  models, 
extracting the Area Under the Curve (AUC) values for each model both 
before and after urban development (Fig. 3). The AUC value, a critical 
measure of model performance, indicated that the Generalized Linear 
Model  (GLM)  and  Random  Forest  (RF)  models  had  the  highest  AUC 
value  of  0.85,  while  the  Classification  and  Regression  Tree  (CART) 
model  had  the  lowest  at  0.79.  On  average,  the  models  demonstrated 
robust performance with an average AUC value of 0.84, underscoring 
their overall effectiveness in species distribution modeling. Despite the 
methodological similarities among the models, their distinct character-

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the study utilizes data from the third and fourth natural environment surveys. This suggests that one method used for gathering data could be conducting surveys. Additionally, since the study focuses on assessing the impact of urban development on species distribution, it is possible that other sources of data such as satellite imagery or remote sensing might have been used to collect relevant environmental variables. Nevertheless, without further details, it cannot be confirmed which exact methods were employed for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
