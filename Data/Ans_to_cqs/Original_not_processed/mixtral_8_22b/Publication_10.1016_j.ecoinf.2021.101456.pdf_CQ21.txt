dataset  recorded  at  a  different  location  and  was  gradually  expanded 
until  reconstructions  were  sufficiently  good.  In  order  to  visualize  the 
latent  representation,  the  size  of  the  bottleneck  of  the  model  (latent 
dimension) was limited to two. Details of the network architecture are 
reported in Table 1.

Fig. 1, and since a higher β term favours a well generalised latent space 
over good reconstructions, a reduction in clustering performance could 
be expected. Additionally, the non-adaptive VAE was more cumbersome 
to train as the model collapsed frequently during training.

5.6. Exploring the latent space 

Samples  generated  from  the  latent  space  of  the  semi-supervised 
model  are  shown  as  a  latent  space  cart-wheel  in  Fig.  5.  Traversing 
different  lines  in  the  latent  space  results  in  samples  that  smoothly 
transition between different spectra types. As a side note, we point that 
the two latent features do not appear to be entirely disentangled; this is 
manifested as dense islands and sparse spaces of spectra in the latent 
space. For our downstream clustering task, fully disentangled features 
are  not  required.  However,  one  could  introduce  an  additional  loss 
component that enforces orthogonality between the different latent di-
mensions to achieve improved disentanglement.

Including  the  additional  loss  term  scaling  term  γ(t)ℒcls  in  Eq.  (9) 
further  improved  the  clustering  performance  of  the  model.  In  this 
implementation γ  was cycled between 0.01 and 2 in order to keep the 
contribution from ℒcls  in a similar range as ℒrec  and ℒreg. A logical next 
step could be to expand Eq. (4) to include a dynamically adjusted γ(t)ℒcls 
term.  This  would  however  make  the  model  less  generalized  to  other 
tasks.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps after the model training such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices. However, it can be inferred that there might have been some postprocessing steps based on the information given.

For instance, the text mentions exploring the latent space (Section 5.6), which suggests that there may have been some form of analysis or visualization performed on the learned representations. Furthermore, the discussion about selecting the number of clusters (Section 5.4) implies that some sort of clustering algorithm was applied to group the data points in the latent space.

Additionally, the context discusses improving the clustering performance by including an additional loss component (Eq. (9)) and adjusting the contribution from the classification loss (ℒcls). These modifications suggest that the authors evaluated the model using certain metrics related to its clustering performance.

However, without further details regarding the exact postprocessing steps taken, it is difficult to provide a comprehensive list of all the possible techniques used. Therefore, I cannot definitively state what specific postprocessing steps were involved after the model training.
