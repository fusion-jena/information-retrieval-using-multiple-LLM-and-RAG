to get blurred (as information over an increasingly larger receptive
field is mixed through repeated convolutions). We visualize our model
architecture in Fig. 5 and in the following, the data flow in the model
is described in more detail.

As commonly done in deep learning, we iteratively learn the model
parameters with stochastic gradient descend, starting from a random
initialization. In each iteration, we randomly sample a batch of ùêµ = 64
reference data patches of size 15 √ó 15 pixels, where a patch is only
considered for training if the center pixel is forested. We consider a
pixel forested if and only if it contains vegetation points (points with
ùê∑ùëß > 1.3 m, see Section 3.1) and also is considered forested based on
NIBIO‚Äôs Norway-wide timber volume map (Astrup et al., 2019). We use
the latter as an additional precautionary measure to avoid unnecessary
noise from non-forested areas, as we are interested in learning forest
characteristics only. For every reference data patch, we randomly pick
an optical image from the correct year and two SAR images (one as-
cending and one descending orbit) with acquisition dates near the one
of the optical image. Using SAR with both ascending and descending

4.5. Implementation details

We have implemented our models in PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2017).
We trained ùëÄ = 5 models with batch size ùêµ = 64 and a base learning
rate ùõº = 10‚àí4. The learning rate is automatically reduced by a factor
of 0.1 when the validation loss has not improved for 15 consecutive
epochs. We apply weight decay to control the strength of the unit
Gaussian prior, with an empirically chosen magnitude of 10‚àí3 that
is inversely proportional to the hyperparameter ùúÜ from Eq. (1). We
chose ùõΩ1 = 0.9, ùõΩ2 = 0.999 and ùúñ = 10‚àí8 as hyper-parameters for the
Adam optimizer. Each neural network was trained on a single Nvidia
RTX2080Ti GPU for ‚àº14 days.

5. Experimental results and discussion

2.2. Deep learning in remote sensing

In the last decade, deep learning has revolutionized the way infor-
mation is extracted from images. In particular, convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) have achieved unprecedented results in areas like
image classification (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Simonyan and Zisserman,
2015; He et al., 2016), semantic segmentation (Long et al., 2015; Chen
et al., 2016), object detection (Szegedy et al., 2013; Girshick et al.,
2014; Redmon et al., 2016) and further perception tasks.

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, considering the description of the model architecture and the mention of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are often used for tasks such as image classification, semantic segmentation, or object detection, it can be inferred that the model might be designed for similar purposes. Specifically, the model uses a combination of optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images, suggesting its application could involve multi-modal analysis or fusion. Furthermore, the focus on forested areas indicates that the model may be intended for tasks related to land cover classification, change detection, or biomass estimation. Nevertheless, without explicit confirmation, this remains speculative.
