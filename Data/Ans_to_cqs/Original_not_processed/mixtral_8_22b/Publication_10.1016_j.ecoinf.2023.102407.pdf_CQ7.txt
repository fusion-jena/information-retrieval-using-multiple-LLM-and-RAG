Kim et al.

In particular, we construct an ensemble teacher model by grouping 
the ANN, RF, GBM, XGB, and LGBM models, and a student model using 
ANNs that are commonly used in PL approaches (Ali et al., 2022; Asghar 
et al., 2020). We train our SDP-EPL model for up to 400 epochs, incre-
mentally  generating  PL  presence  data  and  PL  absence  data  using  the 
teacher model with K = 200 every 100 epochs. K was selected empiri-
cally based on the AUC of SDP-EPL on the validation set.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, or validation sets. However, it mentions that the SDP-EPL model is trained for up to 400 epochs, incrementally generating pseudo-labeled (PL) presence data and PL absence data using the teacher model with K = 200 every 100 epochs. This suggests that the dataset might be divided into batches or subsets for each epoch during the training process. Additionally, the mention of a validation set implies that some portion of the data is reserved for evaluating the performance of the model during training. Nevertheless, without further details, it is impossible to determine the exact criteria used for splitting the data.
