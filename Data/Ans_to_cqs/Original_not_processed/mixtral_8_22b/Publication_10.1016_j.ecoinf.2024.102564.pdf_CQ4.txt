Machine learning methods: Modeling net growth in the Atlantic Forest 
of Brazil

The trained ANN was the multilayer perceptron, also known as the 
multilayer perceptron (MLP), with a hidden layer. The range of neurons 
in  this  layer  was  defined  by  the  Fletcher-Gloss  method  (Silva  et  al., 
2010): 2 × n0.5 + n2 ≤ n1 ≤ 2 × n + 1; in which: n = number of network 
inputs; n1 = amount of neurons in the hidden layer; and n2 = number of 
neurons  in  the  output  layer.  The  activation  functions  tested  were

exponential, identity, logistic, and hyperbolic tangent. The training al-
gorithms used were resilient propagation (Rprop) and scaled conjugate 
gradient (SCG). The initial ANN weights were randomly generated, and 
the maximum number of iterations was 100 due to the error becoming 
constant before this number. The ANNs were implemented with the MLP 
function of the “RSNNS” Package in R (Bergmeir and Benítez, 2012). The 
svm function of the “e1071” Package on R was used for training SVMs. 
Thus, four configurations were used in the SVR training, represented by 
four kernel functions: Linear, Polynomial, Radial basis and Sigmoid.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no information about data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline within the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate response based solely on the provided text. However, some common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, padding, and zooming. These techniques help increase the size of the dataset and improve model performance.
