To extract the input information, the SRC3 block employs a parallel 
analysis  of  the  input  feature  map  using  two  convolution  kernels.  In 
contrast to the C3 block, the SRC3 block incorporates two convolution 
kernels prior to the input of the bottleneck block. One of the kernels is 
responsible  for  halving  the  dimension  of  the  feature  map,  while  the 
other  maintains  the  dimension  unchanged.  This  approach  allows  for 
more  comprehensive  processing  of  the  input  features,  enabling  the 
model  to  capture  both  high-level  semantic  information  and  preserve 
relevant details during the feature extraction process. The convolution 
kernel size utilized is 3 × 3, which leads to a broader receptive field of 
information and richer characteristics compared to the 1 × 1 convolu-
tion kernel. The output semantic information can be augmented by the 
action of two convolution kernels. The information output from the first

4.4. Data augmentation 

Data augmentation techniques play a crucial role in augmenting the 
training dataset to enhance the learning effect and generalization per-
formance of the network. This experiment uses various data augmen-
tation methods, including HSV adjustment, rotation, scaling, cropping, 
flipping, and mosaicking, to expand the dataset. Random probabilities 
are used to determine whether each image should undergo augmenta-
tion. HSV  adjustment involves modifying  the image's  hue, saturation, 
and value components. And rotation randomly rotates the image within 
a specific range. Moreover, scaling changes the size of the image while 
maintaining its aspect ratio. Cropping randomly crops a portion of the 
image.  Additionally,  Flipping  horizontally  flips  the  image.  Mosaic 
combines  multiple  randomly  cropped,  resized,  and  rotated  images  to

their ability to automatically learn and extract low- and high-level visual 
features  directly  from  the  data.  Traditional  methods  often  require 
manual  feature  engineering,  where  domain-specific  knowledge  and 
expertise are used to design handcrafted features. Deep learning algo-
rithms,  on  the  other  hand,  can  learn  feature  representations  directly 
from the raw input data, eliminating the need for manual feature engi-
neering.  Efficiently  handling  these  multiscale  features  is  crucial  for 
network performance, given their diverse resolutions. Feature pyramid 
networks  (FPNs)  have  made  significant  advancements  by  integrating 
multiscale  features  in  a  top-down  manner.  The  path  aggregation 
network  (PANet)  (Liu  et  al.,  2016)  further  extends  the  FPN  by  intro-
ducing a bottom-up path. Another notable network learning mechanism, 
the bidirectional feature pyramid network (BiFPN) (Tan et al., 2020),

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the experiment uses various data augmentation methods such as HSV adjustment, rotation, scaling, cropping, flipping, and mosaicking to expand the dataset. It also discusses the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and the application of feature pyramid networks (FPNs) and bidirectional feature pyramid networks (BiFPNs) for efficiently handling multiscale features. While these techniques are related to the training and optimization of deep learning models, they do not directly address the topic of data annotation. Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
