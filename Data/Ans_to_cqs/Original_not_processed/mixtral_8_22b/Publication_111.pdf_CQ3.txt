+is paper aims to predict the SST and the SWH for the
Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency dataset.
+e proposed work is motivated by comparing the statistical,
machine learning, and deep learning models to understand
the performance gap of these models. +e results of this
work should provide scientiﬁc evidence on which model ﬁts
better the marine data. To anticipate the marine features
eﬃciently, the employed deep learning model combines the
gated recurrent units (GRU) with the regular neural net-
work. In the proposed architecture, the GRU layer is pre-
ceded by an input layer and followed by a fully connected
layer. As a result, the predicted values can be produced from
the output layer. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst use of a
GRU model architecture for forecasting SST and SWH.
Besides, four diﬀerent ML models have been utilized in the
current study, namely, Linear Regression (LR), Decision
Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random

+e discussion of the existing methods shows that there
is no comparison of the diﬀerent methods (i.e., machine
learning, deep learning, and statistical models) in terms of
prediction accuracy. +us, there is a need to study the
performance gap of these methods for predicting marine
data.

4. Methodology

In this work, we proposed a set of predictive models which
are based on three diﬀerent approaches (i.e., machine
learning, deep learning, and statistical). +e proposed ge-
neric framework is composed of three stages: data gathering,
preprocessing, and machine learning model deployment.
+is system makes use of the Korea Hydrographic and
Oceanographic Agency dataset (available at: https://www.

vital marine features via installed sea sensors. +e obtained
data is preprocessed and ﬁne-tuned for the purpose of

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not mention any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The focus of the text is on predicting Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Significant Wave Height (SWH) using various models including a combination of gated recurrent units (GRU) and regular neural network. Therefore, it cannot be determined what data annotation techniques were used in the deep learning pipeline based solely on the provided information.
