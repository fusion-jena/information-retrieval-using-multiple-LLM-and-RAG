Data availability

over different periods (Huesca et al., 2009). Data mining techniques are 
another empirical model employed to extract valuable information from 
large  datasets,  enabling  the  identification  of  hidden  patterns  and  re-
lationships  between  variables  related  to  forest  fires  (Pourtaghi  et  al., 
2016). Simulation models are used to recreate fire behavior and spread 
under various artificially set conditions. They help researchers and fire 
managers  understand  how  different  factors  influence  fire  dynamics 
(Kanga  and  Singh,  2017).  Recent  advancements  in  machine  learning 
models (MLM) make them capable of handling complex datasets and can 
offer valuable insights into forest fire dynamics. Some of the works, like 
Gaudreau et al. (2016) have taken one step forward by modeling the 
wildfire in future climatic scenarios. They are proven to be reliable and 
efficient  means  of  determining  the  relative  critical  attributes  from

By default, we utilized the recommended parameters for all MLMs, 
except for Random Forest (RF), where we expressly set the number of 
trees to 500 as an additional parameter. A higher number of trees helps 
reduce  the  resulting  model’s  bias.  We  calibrated  and  validated  each 
model after fitting each MLM with optimized parameters using a 10-fold 
cross-validation (CV) design. For each run of the cross-validation pro-
cedure, we reserved 30% of the forest fire occurrence data as a valida-
tion  set,  with  the  remaining  70%  of  the  data  being  used  to  train  the 
model. This rigorous validation methodology was adopted following the 
method explained by Eskandari et al. (2021). The approach generated 
50 resulting models, consisting of 10 models for each machine learning 
algorithm.

Ensemble modeling capitalizes on the strengths of multiple models to 
enhance predictive accuracy, increase stability, improve generalization, 
provide  robustness  against  overfitting,  and  increase  model  interpret-
ability  (Ganaie  et  al.,  2022).  Combining  the  predictions  of  diverse 
models, ensemble modeling achieves more accurate and reliable results 
by  mitigating  the  risks  of  errors  and  biases,  resulting  in  stable  pre-
dictions that generalize well to unseen data (Ganaie et al., 2022). All the 
fitted models obtained from the five ML algorithms exhibited favorable 
performance measures. The AUC for all models surpassed 0.75, while 
the TSS exceeded 0.45. We used these results to build the final ensemble 
model,  employing  the  AUC-weighted  ensemble  method  (Achu  et  al., 
2021;  Tehrany  et  al.,  2019).  This  technique  utilizes  the  performance 
metrics to effectively combine the predictions from all models, ensuring

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the primary objective of the study is not explicitly stated. However, considering the focus on forest fires and the use of machine learning models, it can be inferred that the purpose of the deep learning model is likely to classify, detect, or predict aspects related to forest fires. Specifically, the text mentions the use of data mining techniques to extract valuable information from large datasets and simulation models to recreate fire behavior and spread under various conditions. Additionally, recent advancements in machine learning models are noted to offer valuable insights into forest fire dynamics. Given this emphasis on understanding and analyzing forest fire patterns, it is plausible that the deep learning model aims to contribute to this goal through classification, detection, or prediction tasks. Nevertheless, without explicit mention of the specific purpose of the deep learning model within the provided context, this remains an educated guess.
