include all observations in statistical modeling, rather than excluding observations, an approach which can affect 
the reliability of studies. This study also, to a great extent, explains the poor performance of software attempting 
automated bat ID. Implementing Bayesian algorithms, and thereby allowing users to interact with the software, 
should significantly improve their performance.

in  predicting  means,  SDs  and  finally  population  sizes  based  on  the 
observed data (e.g. Bhattacharya, 1967), thus reducing manual labour to 
a minimum.

When working with multi-genera problems with several predictive 
features, a manual approach would be extremely time consuming and 
not a viable option for most researchers (Russo and Jones, 2002). To 
solve such problems, automation is required. Current algorithms used in 
software  attempting  automated  species  identification  of  bats  assume 
that all study areas are the same in terms of species composition. The 
poor performance of such software (Russo and Voigt, 2016; Rydell et al., 
2017) can probably to a great extent be explained by this feature alone. 
As shown in this study, significant improvements can be made if users 
are  allowed  to  interact  with  algorithms  through  the  introduction  of 
informative priors determined by local conditions. Hence, Bayesian al-
gorithms, with more user control, are likely to significantly increase the 
performance of such software tools in the future. Software could also aid

2022).  The  most  important  feature  of  the  code  is  that  all  parameters 
depend  on  important  local  conditions  which  cannot  be  ignored  (e.g. 
Russo  et  al.,  2018;  Russo  and  Jones,  2002;  Voigt  et  al.,  2021). 
Acknowledging that no study areas are the same would demand more 
from a researcher in terms of understanding the local bat fauna. ABBA 
and the R-code in supplement S1 can be used to prepare data to be used 
in  statistical  modeling,  although  the  researcher  would  have  to 
acknowledge that the species assignments are probabilities and not ab-
solutes.  Manual  species  assignments  may  be  considered  by  many  re-
searchers  as  being  absolute  IDs,  but  the  evidence  suggests  otherwise 
(Rydell  et  al.,  2017,  Montauban  et  al.,  2021,  this  study).  Hence, 
Bayesian  approximation  should  not  be  considered  inferior  to  manual 
analysis in terms of uncertainty.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized using methods like grid search or random search. However, it discusses the use of Bayesian algorithms and informative priors determined by local conditions to improve the performance of automated species identification software for bats. It mentions that implementing these Bayesian algorithms allows users to interact with the software, which should significantly improve its performance. Additionally, the text emphasizes the importance of acknowledging local conditions when preparing data for statistical modeling and recognizing that species assignments are probabilities, not absolutes. Therefore, while the context does not directly address the optimization of hyperparameters, it highlights the significance of incorporating relevant local factors into the analysis process.
