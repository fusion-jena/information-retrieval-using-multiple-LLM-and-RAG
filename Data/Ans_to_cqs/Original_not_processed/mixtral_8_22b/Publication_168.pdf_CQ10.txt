where bi,j is the bias,  Ki-1 is the number of the feature ma 
in (i-1)th layer,  Li and  Mi are the height and width of 2 –D 
f (cid:152) is the 
convolutional kernel in the ith layer respectively,  
ReLU activation function as shown in Eq. (2). 

( )

The pooling layer is mainly applied to compress the input 
data,  which  often  follows  convolutional  layer.  The  max-
pooling strategy is used in SSPCNN.
