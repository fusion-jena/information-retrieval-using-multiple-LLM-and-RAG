More recently, there has been a great effort to automate the process 
of classification/mapping of specific targets using Deep Learning (Lecun 
et al., 2015) algorithms, such as the Deep Neural Network (DNN), which 
includes  a  learning  algorithm  based  on  an  artificial  neural  network 
(Langford et al., 2019). In this study, we developed a semi-automatic 
methodological approach for mapping burned areas in the entire Cer-
rado  biome  in  Brazil  using  Deep  Learning  techniques  available  on 
Google Cloud computing and Landsat 8 imagery, which consist of eleven 
spectral bands with a spatial resolution of 30 meters for bands 1-7 and 9, 
15 meters for band 8, and 100 meters for bands 10 and 11. We did not 
use  Landsat-7  imagery  because  of  the  data  gaps  observed  images  ac-
quired after 2003, which would substantially affect the spatial coverage 
of  our  analysis.  We  assessed  accuracies  and  compared  our  mapping 

2. Material and methods 

2.1. Study region

Since  deep  learning  methods  require  a  powerful  computational 
processing, we conducted our analysis using graphics processing units 
(GPUs)  and  specialized  hardware  components  for  running  parallel 
arithmetic operations (Goodfellow et al., 2016). The access to GPUs in a 
virtual  machine  environment  was  implemented  on  the  Google  Cloud 
suite  of  cloud 
Platform

3.1. Optimal period of burn scar mapping 

The fire hotspot data analysis provided by INPE (http://www.inpe. 
br/queimadas/bdqueimadas)  indicates  that  most  of  the  fire  events  in 
the  Cerrado  biome  occurred  between  May  and  December,  showing  a 
peak in September 2017 (Fig. 4). Based on it, we focused our mapping 
analysis of burn scars on the period between May and December, which 
comprised 98% of fire hotspots detected in 2017 by INPE. 

3.2. Burned areas in 2017

5. Conclusions 

Our  alternative  approach,  based  on  a  semi-automated  technique, 
remotely sensed data, and deep learning algorithm available on Google 
Cloud  Storage  and  Computing,  allowed  us  to  map  burn  scars  in  the 
Cerrado biome in Brazil with high overall accuracy (97%). We achieved 
these results because of the geometrically corrected and preprocessed 
Landsat  data  available  on  Google  Earth  Engine  Platform  and  the  ca-
pacity of Deep Learning techniques to differentiate spectral signatures of 
burned and unburned areas in the study area. 

The high accuracy achieved by our mapping approach demonstrates 
that deep learning algorithms can be successfully applied to the remote 
sensing  field  using  large  remote  sensing  datasets  and  extensions, 
requiring low time and labor demand. Our proposed mapping approach 
created new perspectives on fire scar detection by producing a technique 
that is accurate, promising, and replicable to other regions.

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, the authors used remotely sensed data from Landsat 8 imagery consisting of eleven spectral bands with varying spatial resolutions. They specifically chose Landsat 8 over Landsat-7 due to data gaps observed in images acquired after 2003. Additionally, they accessed graphics processing units (GPUs) and specialized hardware components through the Google Cloud suite of cloud platforms to conduct their analysis. Fire hotspot data was also obtained from the National Institute for Space Research (INPE) website. Therefore, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in this deep learning pipeline include satellite imagery, publicly accessible databases, and cloud computing resources.
