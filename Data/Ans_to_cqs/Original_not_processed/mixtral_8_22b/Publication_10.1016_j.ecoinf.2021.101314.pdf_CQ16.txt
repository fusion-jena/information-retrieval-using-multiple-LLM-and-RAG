Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

The method requires manually setting several parameters, described 
in more details in the user guide.7 In particular, about half a dozen pa-
rameters allow to set thresholds on the size of the support of the output 
redescriptions and to control the length and complexity of their queries. 
We required that at least 1% of localities satisfy both queries (Min-
SuppIn) and that at least 30% of localities satisfy neither of the queries 
(MinSuppOut). In other words, the intersection of the supports of the 
two  queries  (the  support  of  the  redescription)  and  their  union  were 
required to contain at least 1% and at most 70% of all localities. This is 
an inclusive choice, not overly restrictive, that aims at capturing local 
patterns. Increasing the upper threshold further would jeopardize the 
local aspect of the analysis, and would lead to something more akin to 
non-linear regression. For a redescription to be informative, its support

As a practical example, consider the following query over climatic 

variables: 

qC = [19.6 ≤ T + WarmM ≤ ] AND [116 ≤ PWarmQ].

We use the Iverson bracket to specify satisfiability conditions, that is, 
in our case, the ranges in which the numerical variables must take value. 
The query above selects localities where the maximum temperature of 
the warmest month (T
C and the 
precipitation of the warmest quarter (PWarmQ) is greater than 116 mm. 
The support of this query, denoted as supp(qC), is the set of localities 
where  the  specified  temperature  and  precipitation  conditions  are 
satisfied. 

WarmM) is between 19.6 and 38.5

to three dental variables and two climate variables. In the second run, 
we allowed dental queries to involve disjunctions, and climate queries to 
contain up to three variables, but tightened the requirement of accuracy 
gain.  Specifically,  under  this  constraint,  a  candidate  query  can  be 
extended by automatically adding the next variable only if the accuracy, 
as measured by the Jaccard coefficient, increases by a least 0.1. The goal 
is to obtain interpretable, not overly complex (long) queries. This can be 
achieved either explicitly, by limiting the number of variables and the 
operators  used  in  the  queries,  as  in  the  first  run,  or  implicitly,  by 
allowing increased complexity only if it brings substantial improvement 
in terms of accuracy, as in the second run.

We then inspect more closely the top-ten remaining redescriptions 
from both lists. We denote the ten redescriptions produced by the first 
run, i.e. using only conjunctions, and ordered by decreasing accuracy as 
R1.1–R1.10. Similarly, the ten redescriptions produced by the second 
run, i.e. under the stricter improvement requirement, and ordered by 
decreasing  accuracy  are  denoted  as  R2.1–R2.10.  All  the  selected  re-
descriptions have s close to zero, without correction for multiple testing 
which is not yet possible with existing methods. 

In summary, the twenty selected redescriptions were obtained using 
automated processes driven primarily by accuracy with the second run 
yielding more compact but somewhat less accurate redescriptions than 
the first.

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, there is no direct mention of specific criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, we can infer from the text that the process involves selecting individual redescriptions for further analysis based on certain requirements such as accuracy gain and simplicity of queries.

In the first run, the selection was made using only conjunctions, while in the second run, the requirement of accuracy gain was tightened. Under this constraint, a candidate query could be extended by automatically adding the next variable only if the accuracy, as measured by the Jaccard coefficient, increased by at least 0.1. The goal here was to obtain interpretable, not overly complex (long) queries.

From these runs, the top-ten remaining redescriptions were inspected more closely. These were denoted as R1.1–R1.10 for the first run and R2.1–R2.10 for the second run. All the selected redescriptions had s close to zero, without correction for multiple testing which is not yet possible with existing methods.

Therefore, although the exact criteria for determining when training is complete are not mentioned, we can see that the process involves selecting redescriptions based on accuracy and simplicity of queries, aiming to achieve interpretable results.
