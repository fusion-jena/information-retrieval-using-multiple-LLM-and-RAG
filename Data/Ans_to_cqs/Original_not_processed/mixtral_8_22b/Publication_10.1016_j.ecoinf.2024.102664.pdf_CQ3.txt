Although current satellite data cannot fully address these challenges, 
integrating  numerical  model  data  into  deep  learning  models  could 
improve  future  forecasts.  As  machine  learning  models  continue  to 
demonstrate substantial potential across various fields, further refine-
ment  and  optimization  tailored  to  specific  issues  are  necessary  to 
enhance the predictive performance of the Zhoushan fishery algal bloom 
forecasting model. Additionally, exploring the structural details of the 
hybrid CNN-LSTM model to understand why it performs better is crucial 
for  further optimization  and enhancing  interpretability. This  in-depth 
analysis  can  improve  the  model’s  forecasting  accuracy  and  provide 
greater insight into the underlying mechanisms of the problem. These 
pathways  are  essential  for  future  advancements  and  more  accurate 
forecasting capabilities.

In this study, the structure of the CNN model includes an image input 
layer, a convolutional layer with a kernel size of 2 × 2 × 25, a maximum 
pooling layer with a kernel size of 2 × 2, two fully connected layers, and 
a regression output layer (Fig. 2c). The number of nodes in the first fully 
connected layer is 10, and in the second fully connected layer is 1. The 
structure of the LSTM model includes a sequence input layer, an LSTM 
layer with 60 nodes, two fully connected layers, and a regression output 
layer (Fig. 2c). The number of nodes in the first fully connected layer is 
10, and in the second fully connected layer is 1.
