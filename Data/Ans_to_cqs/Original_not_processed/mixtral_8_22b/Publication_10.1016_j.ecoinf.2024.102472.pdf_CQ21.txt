layers. ANNs require a substantial amount of training data to achieve 
effective learning. Among ANN architectures, the multi-layer perceptron 
(MLP) neural network stands out as the most used.

adjusted to optimize the model (Jafarzadeh et al., 2021). Whereas node- 
size  determines  the  smallest  number  of  observations  in  a  tree  subset 
terminal node, and default value is always at 1 (Jafarzadeh et al., 2021; 
Pham et al., 2018). Gradient boosting iteration is a repetition process of 
increasing  or  decreasing  weights  in  a  training  datasets  (Huang  et  al.,

2.5.1. Artificial neural networks

During  the  MLPNN  training  phase,  initial  arbitrary  connection 
weights were assigned. Inputs were forward-fed from the input to the 
hidden  layer.  Hidden  neurons  multiplied  inputs  by  weights,  summed 
products,  and  processed  sums  through  a  transfer  function.  Results 
propagated  to  the  output  layer,  with  output  values  compared  to  ex-
pected  values  for  error  computation.  Iterative  error  back-propagation 
adjusted  connection  weights  until  reaching  a  target  minimal  error. 
The network then accurately estimated carbon stocks for both training 
and new input data without training data. This required tests to deter-
mine optimal learning rate (0.01), momentum (0.18), and training it-
erations  (500).  The  trained  network  was  subsequently  used  for  feed- 
forward predictions on continuous spatial data.

lowest error being chosen. The output layer contained a single neuron 
representing carbon stock outputs.

Helpful Answer:
After the model training, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements and goals of the analysis. Here are some common postprocessing steps:

1. Model Evaluation: After training, evaluating the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC AUC, etc., is essential. These metrics help assess how well the model has learned from the training data and its ability to generalize to unseen data.

2. Hyperparameter Tuning: To improve the model's performance further, hyperparameters like learning rate, momentum, number of iterations, etc., can be adjusted using techniques like Grid Search, Randomized Search, Bayesian Optimization, etc.

3. Prediction: Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data. In this case, the trained network was used for feed-forward predictions on continuous spatial data.

4. Visualizations: Creating visual representations of the results can aid in understanding the model's performance better. For example, confusion matrices can provide insights into the types of errors made by the model, while saliency maps can highlight important features contributing to the prediction.

In summary, postprocessing steps after model training may include model evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, making predictions, and creating visualizations. However, these steps will depend on the specific needs and objectives of the analysis.
