Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

2.6. Performance metrics 

Conventional  metrics  were  used  to  evaluate  the  model’s  perfor-
mance, such as confusion matrices, accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, 
Cohen  Kappa,  and  the  area under  the  ROC curve,  some of  which  are 
defined below (Johnson and Khoshgoftaar, 2019).

2. Methods 

Fig. 2 summarizes a series of processes in designing a deep-learning 
architecture that acts as a toxicovigilance tool. Subsequent sections will 
provide a comprehensive description of each section. 

2.1. Data collection

2.4. Model training and hyperparameters 

The  model’s  weights  were  randomly  initialized  using  a  specific 
integer seed to guarantee consistent reproducibility of results. Further-
more, meticulous manual tuning of hyperparameters was conducted to 
achieve  optimal  model  performance.  The  selected  hyperparameters, 
which yielded the best performance metrics, are presented in Table 1. 

2.5. Model validation 

Two distinct validation methodologies were implemented. The first 
method  involved  partitioning  the dataset into  training and  validation 
sets, with 70% of the data designated for training and 30% for valida-
tion.  This  division  was  performed  through  random  selection  (Dobbin 
and Simon, 2011).

The model was trained using varying disjoint subsets of the dataset in 
order to assess the number of recordings necessary to yield satisfactory 
classification  metrics.  These  subsets  corresponded  to  different  time 
steps, namely 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 days of flight activity recordings. 
Subsequent  experiments  included  training  the  model  with  various 
combinations of datasets: 1, 2, 3, or all four datasets combined. These 
raw  and curated versions of the datasets are  readily accessible in the 
Code and Data Availability section.

Query: "Which hardware resources are used for training the deep learning model (e.g., GPUs, TPUs)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: Unfortunately, there is no information available regarding the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware resources were employed during the training process.
