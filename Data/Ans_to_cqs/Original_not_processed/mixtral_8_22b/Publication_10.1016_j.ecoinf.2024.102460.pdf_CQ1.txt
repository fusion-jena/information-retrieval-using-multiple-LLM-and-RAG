LSTM model were all less than 0.01, and the relative errors for cropland, 
grassland  and  woodland  were  all  less  than  0.001  (Table  10),  with 
smaller  average  relative  errors  than  those  of  the  BP  neural  network 
model.  This  shows  that  the  LSTM  model  has  certain  advantages  in 
forecasting  land  use  demand.  This  approach  can  provide  strong 
modeling support for LUCC research.

4.3.3. LSTM model 

The  long  short-term  memory  (LSTM)  model  is  a  common  deep 
learning model used to solve the prediction problem of time series data 
(Tang  et  al.,  2023).  Compared  with  traditional  machine  learning 
models, the LSTM model has better performance and ability to manage 
the  prediction  problem  of  time  series  data,  especially  the  long-term 
dependency  problem  and  multivariate  time  series  data,  and  has 
obvious  advantages  (Liu  et  al.,  2021;  Tang  et  al.,  2023;  Zhou  et  al., 
2023). Fig. 3 shows the prediction process of the LSTM model and the BP 
model.  This  study  compares  these  two  models  and  the  Markov  chain 
model. 

4.4. FMOP model 

Optimizing land allocation through a multiobjective programming 
(MOP) model combined with uncertainty analysis methods can provide 
a reference for decision makers.
