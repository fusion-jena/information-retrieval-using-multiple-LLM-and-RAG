While building the RF model, the training samples were randomly 
divided  according  to  proportions  of  80%  and  20%  and  used  for  the 
training and test datasets, respectively. The parameters of the RF model, 
number of trees (n_estimators), minimum number of leaves (minleaf), and 
number of randomly selected node-split feature variables (max_features) 
significantly affected  the  accuracy and  complexity  of  the model.  This 
study used a grid search method (GridSearchCV) based on the out-of-bag 
(OOB)  error  and  five-fold  cross-validation  to  search  for  the  optimal 
parameters  of  the  model  (Chang  et  al.,  2023).  The  n_estimators  were 
spaced at 50 intervals, ranging from 100 to 1000. The minleaf is 2, 5, 10, 
20, and 50. The max_features were spaced at intervals of 1, ranging from 
1 to k where k is the number of characteristic variables.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the training samples were divided into two parts using a proportion of 80% for the training dataset and 20% for the test dataset. This division was done randomly to prevent any bias towards specific data points. Secondly, the study utilized a grid search method (GridSearchCV) based on the out-of-bag (OOB) error and five-fold cross-validation to find the optimal parameters of the model. Cross-validation is a powerful preventive measure against overfitting, ensuring that the model can perform well with unseen data. Lastly, the n_estimators, minleaf, and max_features parameters were varied systematically within specified ranges to identify the best combination that would yield high accuracy without increasing the complexity of the model. These steps ensured that the final model was robust and capable of handling diverse datasets.
