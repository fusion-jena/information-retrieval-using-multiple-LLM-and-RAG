All programs use Python 3 and PyTorch (Paszke et al. (2019)) for 
building  and  training  the  networks.  The  Mask  R-CNN  model  is  built 
around  the  PyTorch  detection  model  of  Mask  R-CNN.  For  the  imple-
mentation of FGFA we use the PyTorch models for the backbone, the 
RPN and the head of the implementation of Mask R-CNN model. The 
three ResNet variations are also based on PyTorch detection models. We 
always use the pretrained versions of the detection models. The Mask R- 
CNN  is  pretrained  on  COCO  2017train  dataset.  The  ResNets  are  pre-
trained on Kinetics-400 dataset. We use these PyTorch models because 
they allow more flexibility than other implementations. They are better 
adjusted  to  the  PyTorch  training  functions  and  are  well-arranged. 
Moreover,  the  PyTorch  detection  models  do  not  have  other  de-
pendencies (e.g. special libraries) unlike other implementations.

The three ResNet variants are trained for 40 epochs starting with an 
initial learning rate of 0.001. The learning rate is decreased every 10 
epochs by multiplying it with a Î³ = 0.1. For optimization we utilize the 
Stochastic  Gradient  Descent  (SGD)  with  a  momentum  of  0.9  and  a

3.1.1. Mask R-CNN 

Mask R-CNN consists of three main parts: the backbone, the region 
proposal and the head. The network architecture is illustrated in Fig. 3. 
The  first stage  of  the  backbone is  typically  a  ResNet-50.  After the 
ResNet-50 follows a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN). The outputs of the 
backbone are extracted features that are used to detect the objects in the 
following stages. The FPN takes the features from 4 layers of the ResNet 
and uses a top-down architecture, starting from the smallest feature map 
going up to the largest feature map as it is illustrated in Fig. 3. The FPN is 
important to detect objects at different scales. The FPN upsamples the 
feature maps and uses lateral connections from the ResNet to predict the 
spatial locations of the features more exact. All 5 blocks of the FPN have 
a 256-dimensional output of feature maps.

We use a pretrained backbone for FGFA. The backbone is extracted 
from  a  Mask  R-CNN  network  trained  on  the  segmentation  dataset. 
During the training process FGFA trains only the head and the RPN. We 
implement  the  flow  network  in  the  FGFA  architecture  with  a  SPyNet 
(Ranjan and Black (2017)). Other popular choices are FlowNet (Doso-
vitskiy et al. (2015)) and FlowNet 2.0 (Ilg et al. (2017)). SPyNet is more 
lightweight than the FlowNets. It uses 96% less parameters than Flow-
Net. Therefore it is more efficient in an embedded environment like our 
FGFA architecture. Moreover, the results of SPyNet are more accurate 
than the results of the FlowNets.

Helpful Answer:
The deep learning models mentioned in the given context serve various purposes such as object detection, action recognition, and video frame interpolation.

For instance, the Mask R-CNN model is primarily used for object detection tasks. This model comprises three main components - the backbone, the region proposal, and the head. The backbone is responsible for extracting features from input images using a convolutional neural network (CNN), usually a ResNet-50. These extracted features are then passed through a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) which helps in detecting objects at multiple scales. Finally, the region proposal network (RPN) generates proposals for potential bounding boxes around detected objects, while the head classifies each proposal into specific classes and refines their corresponding bounding box coordinates.

On the other hand, the three ResNet variants are employed for action recognition tasks. These models are trained for 40 epochs with an initial learning rate of 0.001, which is reduced every 10 epochs by a factor of 0.1. Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is utilized for optimization along with a momentum value of 0.9.

Lastly, the FGFA architecture incorporates a flow network implemented using SPyNet for video frame interpolation. This lightweight network requires fewer parameters compared to alternatives like FlowNet or FlowNet 2.0, making it more suitable for embedded environments. Additionally, SPyNet delivers superior accuracy when generating intermediate frames between consecutive video frames.

Overall, these deep learning models cater to diverse applications within computer vision, including object detection, action recognition, and video processing tasks.
