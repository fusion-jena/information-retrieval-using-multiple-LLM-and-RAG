The  results  indicate  that  the  Cascade  RCNN  outperformed  other 
models at each training stage, while the FCOS model and Sparse CNN 
model consistently had lower mAP scores than others. This is consistent 
with  the  findings  of  Section  3.1.  Although  12  epochs  were  a  typical 
number of training times, almost all models reached the maximum mAP 
when the number of epochs reached 10. Therefore, for bird recognition, 
not  all  models  are  better  with  more  training  times,  and  choosing 

appropriate  training  times  for  different  models  is  beneficial  to  save 
computing resources. Specifically, the Cascade RCNN model had almost 
no  increase  in  the  mAP  at  9  epochs,  and  the  Faster  CNN  model  also 
showed a similar trend. However, the ATSS and RepPoint growth curves 
continued to 12 epochs, suggesting they require more training data or a 
longer training schedule to perform better.

The  Faster  RCNN  model  initially  achieved  a  relatively  high  mAP 
score of 0.568 in epoch 7; however, its performance plateaued in sub-
sequent  epochs,  suggesting  that  further  improvements  may  require 
modifications  to  its  architecture  or  hyperparameters.  In  contrast,  the 
Sparse RCNN model showed a slow start, with its mAP score increasing 
from 0 in epoch 1 to 0.324 in epoch 4, but achieved a steady increase in 
performance after that. 

Overall, these results suggest that Cascade RCNN and ATSS are the 
most effective models for object detection on camera trap images, while 
Faster  RCNN,  RetinaNet  and  RepPoints  are  also  viable  options.  How-
ever, FCOS and Sparse RCNN may not be suitable for this task, given 
their slower and less stable convergence and lower mAP scores.

Helpful Answer: The article discusses several deep learning models used for object detection in camera trap images, specifically for bird recognition. These models include Cascade RCNN, FCOS, Sparse CNN, Faster CNN, ATSS, and RepPoint. All of these models fall under the category of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). CNNs are a class of artificial neural networks that have proven very effective in areas such as image recognition and processing. They are designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from tasks with grid-like topology, such as an image.
