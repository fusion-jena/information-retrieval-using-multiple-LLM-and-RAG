These  spectrogram images  are  input  into  the  ResNet-50  deep  (50- 
layer) convolutional neural network (CNN), which was developed and 
pre-trained using millions of label images in over 1000 categories (He 
et  al.,  2015).  Although  ResNet-50  was  not  explicitly  trained  on  spec-
trograms, many studies have shown that CNNs pre-trained for one task 
can  extract  meaningful  features  distant  from  the  original  training 
dataset  (e.g.,  Almabdy  and  Elrefaei,  2019;  Bousetouane  and  Morris, 
2015; Copiaco et al., 2019; Razavian et al., 2014). A suite of features is

Maaten  and Hinton, 2008). Here the  method has been applied to the 
fc1000 activation vectors returned by ResNet-50. 

4.2. Classifier model 

The labeled dataset was split 70/30 into training and testing data-
sets.  For  model  selection  and  parameter  optimization  50%  of  the 
training data were held-out for validation (see Supporting Information). 
The final classification model, a SVM with a cubic polynomial kernel, 
was trained using the ResNet-50 fc1000 activations of the full training 
dataset. A 10-fold cross-validation was then used to define the score-to- 
posterior-probability transformation function (Platt, 2000), which pro-
vides a basis for estimating the posterior probability for new observa-
tions. Fig. 9 shows a confusion matrix for the test data not seen during 
training.

An  850-ms  long  data  segment  (boxes)  is  extracted 
from the unfiltered waveform around each detection 
to  form  a  frequency-reassigned  spectrogram  image. 
These  images  are  fed  into  ResNet-50  CNN,  and  acti-
vations  from  the  fully  connected  layer  (fc1000)  are 
used as a feature vector for each detected signal. The

tections based on the layer activations. Signals in the

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it appears that the study uses a combination of frequency-reassigned spectrogram images and a deep convolutional neural network (ResNet-50) for feature extraction and classification. However, there is no explicit mention of specific data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the data annotation techniques used in this particular deep learning pipeline.
