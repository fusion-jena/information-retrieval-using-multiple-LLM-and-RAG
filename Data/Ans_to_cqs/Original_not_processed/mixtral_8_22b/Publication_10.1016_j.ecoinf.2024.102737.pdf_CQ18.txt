Still there are issues that should be considered before a specific
detailed framework can be designed. In order to decide on a feature
extraction and recognition detailed steps framework,12 initial experi-
ments were performed on the individuals labeled database. Since we
study a task that has not been studied before, we explore different as-
pects and several directions to tackle them, which naturally, most of
them are abandoned after evaluating the results. Nevertheless, these
initial experiments are important as a base case to study the conditions
that improve the performance, which is the focus of this paper. Based on
the literature survey our initial experiments referred to the following
issues to be decided for the chosen framework: architecture, data
augmentation usage, feature extraction enhancement and handling
different poses. The evaluation of the initial experiments results then
guided our design of the follow-up experiments. The initial experiments,

Initial experiments evaluation

We performed initial experiments on several combinations of the
above different experiment layout properties. The precision results of all
our initial experiments were poor â€“ achieving less than 50% in the P6
measure. The precision results of layout combinations which achieved at
least 3% in the P1 measure (i.e, at least 3 out of 99 test images gave the
correct identification) are given in Table 1. In experiments I1, I2 and I3
of Table 1 we only used 19 of the 21 different individuals (classes) of the
training set, since some unclear images (due to the feature extraction
enhancement preprocessing) were removed prior to the training.

Of course, the methods explored in the initial experiments, which did
however not produce fruitful results, support future research by indi-
cating not to repeat these methodologies. Moreover, despite these poor
the initial experiments pointed out some directions for
results,

their evaluation and the deduced follow-up experiments are described in

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not explicitly state the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, based on the tables presented, it appears that the researchers conducted various experiments with different training and testing datasets for upper-, left-, and right-pose models. They also evaluated their models using precision measures such as P1, P3, P5, and P6. These metrics could have been used to track the progress and performance of the models during training. Additionally, they mentioned performing initial experiments to evaluate different aspects and approaches to tackle the problem, which suggests that monitoring the model performance was part of their experimental process.
