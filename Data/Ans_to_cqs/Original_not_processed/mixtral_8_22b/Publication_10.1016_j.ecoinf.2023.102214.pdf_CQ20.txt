cation  studies,  a  lack  of  data  is  the  greatest  challenge  and  limitation 
researchers encounter (Schneider et al., 2019). With the data collection 
compiled  in  this  work,  we  contribute  the  largest  fully  labeled  snow 
leopard dataset for deep learning research. In addition, we anticipate 
that our novel deep learning methods will encourage other academics to 
contribute  more  datasets  to  Whiskerbook.org  for  the  purpose  of 
continuously curating and enhancing the data used to improve the deep 
learning pipeline. Comparing these results to those of an earlier study by 
Johansson et al. (2020) that depended on human manual classification, 
without  AI  or  software,  determined  that  observers  significantly  over-
estimate  the  true  abundance.  AI-based  individual  ID  within  Whiske 
rbook.org  has  demonstrated  the  potential  to  enhance  the  precision 
and  efficiency  of  manual  observers,  approaching  more  accurate  esti-

comprehensive graph matching software within the Wild Me software 
suite for cleaning data at the standard suitable for deep learning algo-
rithms. Two manual observers participated in exhaustive rounds of ID 
decisions in a process called graph matching of the 12,311 annotations, 
whereby  two  images  are  placed  side  by  side,  and  the  observer  de-
termines  whether  the  images  are  the  same  individual  or  different  in-
dividuals (same animal, different animal, cannot tell), and ranks their 
level  of  certainty  (undeniable,  certain,  somewhat  certain,  mostly  un-
certain, completely uncertain). This level of comprehensive individual 
ID enabled the subsets of our dataset to have the highest certainty for 
imagery from a field-based dataset. 

2.4. Min-3/Max-10 

A Min-3/Max-10 data subset is frequently used for training machine 
learning algorithms such as PIE. This data subset comprises individuals

%Query
Query: "Which hardware resources are used for training the deep learning model (e.g., GPUs, TPUs)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. Therefore, I do not know which hardware resources were used for training the deep learning model.
