randomly  selected  half  of  the  pixels  for  the  training  and  testing  split 
(Hudak et al., 2020). This strategic sampling technique was chosen to 
capture  the  full  distribution  of  AGB  values  within  the  LiDAR-derived 
AGB  maps  accurately.  This  stratified  random  sampling  approach  was 
chosen to ensure that the training/testing dataset accurately represented 
the distribution of AGB values within the LiDAR-derived AGB maps. The 
use of this approach was crucial in ensuring that the AGB maps gener-
ated were accurate and representative of the distribution of AGB values 
in the study area.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
After carefully examining the given context, it appears there is no explicit mention of which specific cloud platform or local computing environment was utilized to deploy the deep learning models discussed in these papers. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer based on the information available.
