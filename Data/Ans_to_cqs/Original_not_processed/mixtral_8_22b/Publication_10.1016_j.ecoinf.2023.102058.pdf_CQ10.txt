Other  ML  algorithms,  in  general,  and  deep  learning  algorithms,in 
particular,  can  be  applied  to  hyperspectral  data  to  predict  the  water 
quality parameters with better accuracy and performance using orbital 
hyperspectral data. The number and spatial distribution of the samples, 
and influence of different atmospheric correction algorithms (Vanhel-
lemont and Ruddick, 2021) are among essential parameters that should 
be noticed in  all future studies  to create  a representative dataset and 
make  a  ML-based  model  with  acceptable  generalisation  (Menezes  de

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given information, there is no direct mention or reference to any specific code repository link for a deep learning pipeline related to this topic. Therefore, it would not be possible to provide a precise answer without additional details or resources. However, some of the cited papers might have shared their codes publicly on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. It is recommended to check each paper individually to see if they have made their code available.

For instance, Maier, P.M., Keller, S., Hinz, S., 2021 published a study titled "Deep learning with wasi simulation data for estimating chlorophyll a concentration of inland water bodies" which could potentially contain relevant code. To find out whether they have shared their code, one can search for the authors' names or the article title on popular code hosting platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
