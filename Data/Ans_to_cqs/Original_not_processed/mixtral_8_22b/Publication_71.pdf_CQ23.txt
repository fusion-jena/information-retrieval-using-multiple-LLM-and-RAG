including a NIR band in addition to the RGB bands. This is because in order to build a satisfactory
model, not only a lot of training data are needed that include the NIR band in addition to RGB color
images but also signiﬁcant GPU power that can conduct a proper training with batch sizes larger than 16.
This is because, for eﬃcient model training, larger batch sizes are recommended in DeepLabV3+ [49].
Moreover, the DeepLabV3+ architecture, which is originally designed for three input channels, RGB,
needs to be adjusted accordingly to accommodate four-channel input images. With four-channel input
images, the existing pre-trained models, which are for RGB, cannot be used directly and there is a need
for training a model from scratch or at least modifying the DeepLabV3+ architecture such that only the
weights for the newly added image bands can be learned and the weights of RGB input channels can
be initialized by pre-trained model weights via transfer learning [41].

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information on the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it mentions that a significant amount of training data including the Near Infrared (NIR) band along with Red Green Blue (RGB) color images were used. Additionally, large batch sizes greater than 16 were employed during training due to the recommendation for efficient model training in DeepLabV3+. Furthermore, the DeepLabV3+ architecture, initially designed for three input channels (RGB), had to be modified to accommodate four-channel input images (RGB + NIR). This suggests that efforts were made to incorporate diverse datasets into the training process. Nevertheless, without further details, it remains unclear whether techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting were utilized to enhance the model's generalizability.
