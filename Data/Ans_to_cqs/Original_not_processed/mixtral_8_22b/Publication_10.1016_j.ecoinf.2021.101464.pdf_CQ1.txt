Helpful Answer:
The study utilizes various types of sensors to collect raw data for its deep learning pipeline. These include temperature and humidity sensors (HMP155), wind speed sensors (WindSonic anemometer), atmospheric pressure sensors (AV-410BP), photosynthetically active radiation sensors (LI-190SB), direct radiation sensors (LI-200x), ultraviolet radiation sensors (CUV5), net radiation sensors (CNR4), and particulate matter 2.5 sensors (RR-9421). Additionally, a temperature sensor (model AV-10 T) is used to measure soil temperatures. All these sensors continuously monitor their respective environmental parameters and store the collected data using a CR1000 collector. The sampling frequency is set to 15 seconds per sample, and the data is stored every 10 minutes. Furthermore, the data is automatically transmitted in real-time to a server via a DTU900C GPRS remote transmission module.
