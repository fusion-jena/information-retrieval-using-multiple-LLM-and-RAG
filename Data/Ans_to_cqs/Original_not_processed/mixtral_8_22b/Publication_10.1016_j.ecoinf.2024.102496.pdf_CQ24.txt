Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The research by S. Kamanmalek and N. Alamdari focuses on developing a decision support tool for equitable nutrient reduction, integrating best practices for nutrient removal and environmental justice. However, it does not directly address handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or managing random seed values. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based on the given context.

However, some common strategies used to manage randomness in deep learning pipelines include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using techniques like cross-validation, ensemble methods, and Bayesian optimization to reduce variance, and employing regularization methods such as dropout and weight decay to prevent overfitting due to random fluctuations.
