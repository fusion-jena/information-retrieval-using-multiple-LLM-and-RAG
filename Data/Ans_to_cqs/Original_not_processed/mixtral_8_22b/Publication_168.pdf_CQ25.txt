On the other hand, since the powerful feature extraction 
capabilities, the deep learning methods have succeed in many 
fields,  such  as  computer  vision  and  natural  language 
processing. In recently, the deep learning based methods have 
also  been  used  to  solve  the  HSI  classification  task  and 
achieved remarkable achievements. Among the deep learning 
methods,  the  Convolutional  Neural  Networks  (CNNs)  are 
most widely explored to solve the HSI classification task. Hu 
et  al.  [4]  designed  a  one-dimensional  convolutional  neural 
network(1-D-CNN) for classification according to the spectral 
feature  of  HSI.  Due  to  the  insufficient  training  data,  the 
designed  1-D-CNN  just  includes  a  convolution  operation,  a 
pooling operation and a fully connected operation. Although 
the structure of  designed 1-D-CNN is simple, it achieved a 
satisfactory  classification  performance.  The  classification

The pooling layer is mainly applied to compress the input 
data,  which  often  follows  convolutional  layer.  The  max-
pooling strategy is used in SSPCNN.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in this context is for classification tasks. Specifically, the authors use a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1-D CNN) to classify forest species using hyperspectral images captured by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The goal is to accurately identify different types of trees and plants in the forest environment. This application demonstrates how deep learning can be employed in remote sensing and environmental monitoring scenarios.
