(RF) model, and the results are shown in Fig. 4, which shows that the 
RMSE between the measured and fitting values is 146.202 and 117.430 
ion/cm3, and  the  linear correlation  R2  is  0.275 and  0.980,  indicating 
that the RF model has high prediction accuracy and good fitting effect. 
In addition, to further verify the model’s stability, independent test data 
were used in the RF model for 10-fold cross-validation, and the results 
are shown in Table 5. For that test, the average R2  was 0.931 and the 
average RMSE was 141.124 ion/cm3, reaffirming that the RF model has 
high simulation accuracy and good stability. 

4. Discussion

Future research should consider the changes of predictors at different 
spatial and temporal scales in order to better evaluate the explanatory 
power  of  independent  variables  in  different  climate  regions.  Such 
knowledge could then be applied to other climate region types to un-
derstand the importance level of climate region differences to selected 
variables and the overall prediction ability of the model. In addition, the 
observation  index  can  be  increased,  the  observation  time  can  be 
extended, and the joint observation of multi-region and multi-tree spe-
cies can be strengthened. Big data theory and technology, neural net-
works, structural equations, and other deep-level data mining methods 
are applied to understand the importance level of climate differences on 
selected variables and the overall prediction ability of relevant models, 
so as to comprehensively and systematically understand the influence of 
forest microclimate on NAI.

3.2. Random forest model 

According to the parameter optimization results of the random forest 
(RF)  model,  five  training  samples  were  analyzed,  whose  importance 
scores (VI) were obtained by simulation, and the selected variables were 
sorted according to their scores. The results are shown in Fig. 3, in which 
the VI plots for the five samples are consistent; the scores of the selected 
10 variables were more than 20% VI, and showed a threshold of 30% VI, 
above which the variables assumed higher importance (Fig. 3). In the 
training  and  test  datasets,  the  intermediate  models  established  by  RF 
showed that the proportion of explained variance was between 91% and 
92%  (Table  4).  Further,  the  correlation  coefficients  between  the

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the study utilized diverse datasets, including various spatial and temporal scales, to capture the variability in the predictor variables. This diversity in the dataset helped improve the model's performance across different climate regions. Secondly, the study employed a 10-fold cross-validation technique during the training phase of the Random Forest (RF) model. Cross-validation is a powerful preventive measure against overfitting, where the model learns the noise in the training data instead of the intended underlying pattern. By using this method, the researchers aimed to achieve a balance between bias and variance, ensuring that the model performs well not only on the training set but also on new, unseen data. Lastly, the use of independent test data in the RF model for 10-fold cross-validation further verified the model's stability. These measures collectively contributed to enhancing the robustness and reliability of the deep learning model, making it applicable to a broader range of scenarios and improving its overall prediction ability.
