2.4.2.  Hyperparameters 

Hyperparameter tuning was done manually. As a starting point the 
learning rate was set as low as possible and the number of iterations as 
high as computationally feasible (Hastie et al., 2009). The learning rate, 
which is also called a shrinkage parameter, determines the contribution 
of each tree to the model. The maximum tree depth which reflects the 
degree of interaction in the model is usually low. GBRT performs best 
using fairly shallow trees, so-called tree stumps.

For  the  RI  models  the  same  initial  parameters  were  set  for  the 
analysis of the CS and NW datasets, then a grid search was performed 
on both datasets with a two-part split to give hyperparameters with the 
highest level of accuracy. These were as following: learning rate 0.05 
and maximum tree depth of 4 for both the CS and the NW models. The 
early stopping technique was used to determine when to stop the model 
training  to  avoid  overfitting.  Using  early  stopping  the  number  of 
iterations required until convergence was 120 for CS and 106 for NW. 
Grid search was not required for a three-part splits, and further tuning 
of the parameters was done manually. 

For the RY models, in contrast to the RI models, the best performing 
models (based on MSE) were models with a slow learning rate of 0.005. 
Additionally, the NW model had a very shallow tree (tree depth of 2). 
The number of iterations was kept at 500.

randomly  splitting  all  individual  observations.  This  data  splitting  ap-
proach is generally considered optimum in machine learning as it does 
not  introduce  any  systematic  differences  between  the  test  and  train 
datasets. To perform the RY data splitting, individual observations were 
grouped according to year of capture and years were randomly selected 
for inclusion in the train and test datasets. Although this may produce 
systematic  differences  between  the  test  and  train  datasets,  it  ensures 
that  the  model  is  tested  using  previously  unseen  combinations  of  ex-
planatory  variables  and  is  therefore  a  more  robust  test  of  model  per-
formance in this context.

A potential drawback of the machine learning approach is that after 
the model is built using the training dataset, the parameters are opti-
mised  based  on  how  well  the  model  performs  on  the  test  dataset. 
Therefore,  prediction  accuracy  for  previously  unseen  data  may  be 
overestimated. To perform a more robust test of prediction accuracy a

three way split was also performed. The data were split (using the RI 
splitting approach) into train (50%), test (25%) and validation (25%) 
sets.  The  model  was  built,  tested  and  optimised  using  the  train  and 
validation  sets  and  the  models  performance  was  confirmed  using  the 
test set.

Helpful Answer:

While the given context does not directly discuss preprocessing steps for deep learning models, I can provide some general information about common preprocessing techniques used before training such models. Preprocessing involves preparing raw data into a suitable format for the algorithm to understand and learn from. Some commonly used preprocessing techniques include:

1. Data Cleaning: Removing or correcting erroneous data points, missing values, outliers, or inconsistent entries.

2. Normalization/Standardization: Scaling numeric features to have zero mean and unit variance or transforming them within a specific range (e.g., 0-1 or -1 to 1). This helps prevent certain features from dominating others due to their scale.

3. Feature Engineering: Creating new features by combining existing ones or extracting meaningful attributes from complex data types like text or images.

4. Encoding Categorical Variables: Converting categorical variables into numerical representations, such as one-hot encoding or label encoding.

5. Splitting Dataset: Dividing the dataset into training, testing, and sometimes validation subsets to evaluate model performance and prevent overfitting.
