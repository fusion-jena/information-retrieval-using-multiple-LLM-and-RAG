2.3.  Model training 

2.3.1.  Training data preprocessing 

The  CNN  model  used  in  this  study  requires  equally  sized  input 
images. We chose a time-frequency input window size of 2 s as it is near 
the mean and median template duration across target call types (Fig. 2). 
Most  call  types  have  a  duration  below  1  s,  and  for  those  above  2  s,

To  expand  this  approach  to  the  broader  community,  we  have 
identified three important challenges for future research. First, future 
developments  should  account  for  the  large  variability  in  the  size  of 
target  calls  (i.e.  templates).  Introducing  recurrent  connections  in  the 
CNN, or other architecture modifications could potentially reduce the 
negative  effects  of  window  size.  Second,  previous  studies  have  found 
data  augmentation  to  significantly  improve  performance  (Kahl  et  al., 
2019).  In  these  cases,  training  data  was  mainly  based  on  monodirec-
tional  recordings  of  single  species,  and  data  augmentation  (i.e.  noise 
addition)  apparently  helped  to  emulate  the  conditions  of  soundscape 
recordings.  The  effect  may  be  reduced  for  training  data  collected  di-
rectly from soundscapes, as in this study. Still, data augmentation may

1000 classes (Deng et al., 2009). Although ImageNet does not contain 
spectrograms,  models  pre-trained  with  the  dataset  learn  a  variety  of 
image features that have been successfully tuned to spectrogram clas-
sification  previously  (Lasseck,  2019;  Florentin  et  al.,  2020).  While 
previous  studies  have  found  optimal  performance  using  ensembles  of 
multiple CNN models (Kahl et al., 2017; Lasseck, 2019; Florentin et al., 
2020), in the interest of prediction efficiency and reasonable memory 
requirements, we chose to evaluate a single ResNet50 model.

feature learning in the training process, which eliminates or reduces the 
manual  feature  selection  required.  They  are  also  often  capable  of 
scaling to a high number of classes. For example, in the 2016 BirdCLEF 
challenge,  models  were  trained  to  recognize  999  bird  species  and 
evaluated on both omnidirectional soundscapes (i.e. ambient field re-
cordings) containing multiple species and monodirectional recordings 
targeting  single  species  (Goëau  et  al.,  2016).  CNNs  achieved  a  sig-
nificant  performance  increase  in  the  challenge,  compared  to  other 
methods that were mostly based on nearest neighbors or decision trees 
(Goëau  et  al.,  2016;  Sprengel  et  al.,  2016).  CNNs  are  a  type  of  deep 
neural  network  that  have  achieved  state-of-the-art  performance  on 
many image-recognition tasks (Aloysius and Geetha, 2017). Their net-
work  structure  is  characterized  by  layers  designed  for  spatially-in-

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't any explicit information regarding handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline within the given context. However, some common strategies to manage randomness include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, employing ensemble methods, and utilizing techniques like cross-validation. Setting a fixed seed ensures consistent results during different runs of the same code, while ensemble methods combine predictions from various models trained with different initializations to achieve better generalization. Cross-validation helps assess the model's performance more accurately by averaging scores obtained from multiple train/test splits.
