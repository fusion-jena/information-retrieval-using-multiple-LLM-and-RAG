deeper, its optimization capability can be further improved. How- 
ever, deep CNN networks require very large amounts of training 
data. Table 6 shows examples of existing well-known datasets and 
their size as quantity of images. The biggest plant database that 
we  have  found  is  the  PlantClef2015  dataset  [6]  which  has  only 
around 113,205 number of images. This is still far from matching 
the scale and variety of existing general major datasets for images 
[51,52,55] , videos [53] or languages [54] . In addition, we can see 
that the PlantClef2015 dataset [6] has one of the largest number 
of object categories but the least number of images. For example, 
compared to the ILSVRC 2010 dataset [55] , it has less than 10% of 
their total images but the same number of categories. Hence, to

the parameter setting in training, we employ ﬁxed learning policy. 
We set the learning rate to 10 −3 , and then decrease it by a fac- 
tor of 10 when the validation set accuracy stops improving. The 
momentum is set to 0.9 and weight decay to 10 −4 . In this experi- 
ment, we compute the top-1 classiﬁcation accuracy as described in 
Section 4.3 .

Based on all the facts that support the eﬃciency of leaf fea- 
tures learned using CNN for species identiﬁcation, it now appears 
undeniable  that  CNN  is  a  key  tool  to  assist  researchers  to  dis- 
cover which the leaf features are most effective for plant species 
identiﬁcation. Nevertheless, we come up against a common ques- 
tion that is often arises in the ﬁeld of deep learning: how many 
convolutional layers are required in CNN to achieve the best opti- 
mization ability in modeling plant data? Is using only the AlexNet 
model suﬃcient? Based on numerous publications on object clas- 
siﬁcation  benchmarks,  we  observe  a  dramatic  increase  in  depth 
for CNN in achieving the state-of-the-art result. For example: from 
5 convolutional layers in AlexNet [32] to 16 in VGGNet [48] , 21 
in GoogleNet [49] , and then to 164 in ResNet [50] . This conveys 
the important message that when the network goes deeper and

Helpful Answer:
The text provides information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. The learning rate was initially set to 10^-3, and then decreased by a factor of 10 when the validation set accuracy stopped improving. The momentum was set to 0.9, and the weight decay was set to 10^-4. However, the type of optimizer used is not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
