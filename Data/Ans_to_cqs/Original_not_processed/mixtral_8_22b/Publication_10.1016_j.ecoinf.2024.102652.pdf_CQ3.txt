2.6.3. Training process 

To fit into the network, the training set must have its data normalized 
and standardized. For the training network, the batch size was set to 32. 
The purposes for selecting 32 were to not exceed the memory limit and 
to make full use of computer resources. The optimizer used Adam pro-
cessing, and the learning ratio varied with group based on the cosine 
function’s law, often in the range between 0.0 and 1.0. The 100 epochs 
are used with an early stopping function to halt the learning process if 
there is no improvement in accuracy after 20 epochs. The loss function 
used is the cross-entropy loss function (Abd-Ellah et al., 2024).

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the study uses semantic segmentation as the data annotation technique in their deep learning pipeline. Semantic segmentation involves assigning a category label to each pixel of an image, which is different from other annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.

Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects within images, while instance segmentation involves identifying individual instances of objects within an image by outlining them individually. However, these techniques do not seem to be mentioned in the provided context. Instead, the focus is on applying semantic segmentation through the MU-NET deep learning method to create soil salinity maps. Therefore, we can conclude that the study primarily employs semantic segmentation as its data annotation technique.
