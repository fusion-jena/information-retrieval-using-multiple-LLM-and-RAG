Compared with ViT, CNN has stronger local information extraction 

ability.  In  particular,  the  residual  structure  of  ResNet  connects  the 
different network layers via shortcut, which not only preserves the input 
features  but  also  addresses  the  degradation  problem  of  the  deep 
network, thus mitigating issues such as vanishing or exploding gradi-
ents. The residual structure can help the network to learn the features in 
the input image better, thereby improving the classification effect of the 
network. 

Different classes of objects of the same species have high similarities. 
To better classify objects, CA-Hybrid network is constructed for Cervidae 
classification, based on ResNet and ViT, with the integration of CAM into 
the residual structure of ResNet. The structure of the CA-Hybrid network 
is shown in Fig. 4.

tion and Transformer, effectively extracts richer semantic features (Xie 
et al., 2024). A network based on CNN and ViT modules classified mi-
croorganisms with an accuracy of 67.62% (Dwivedi et al., 2024).

Based on the provided context, we can discuss some aspects of the deep learning models used for object classification. The text mentions two types of neural networks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Vision Transformers (ViT), along with a hybrid model called CA-Hybrid network.

CNNs are known for their strong ability to extract local information from images due to their convolution operations. One popular architecture using CNNs is ResNet, which employs a residual structure connecting different network layers through shortcuts. This design helps preserve input features and address problems like gradient vanishing or explosion in deep networks. As a result, it improves feature learning and overall classification performance.

On the other hand, ViTs use self-attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies between image patches. They can extract richer semantic features compared to traditional CNNs. However, they may struggle with capturing fine-grained details due to their focus on global relationships.

A hybrid approach combining both CNNs and ViTs was proposed for Cervidae classification, named the CA-Hybrid network. This model integrates Class Activation Maps (CAM) into the residual structure of ResNet. By leveraging the strengths of both architectures, the CA-Hybrid network aims to improve classification accuracy by focusing on relevant regions within the input images while still considering global context.
