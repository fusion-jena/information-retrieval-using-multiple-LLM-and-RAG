the weights were obtained from an already trained implementation of 
DeeplabV3+ (https://github.com/zllrunning/deeplab-pytorch-crf) with 
the COCO dataset. COCO is a dataset that has 121,408 images and a total 
of 883,331 object annotations divided in 184 classes. COCO is a widely 
used  dataset  to  train  computer  vision  models  and  sets  a  baseline  to 
benchmark their performance. Since we want to derive common objects 
below the skyline, we inference without training the model directly on 
the landscape photos. A typical example of the masks obtained with such 
a semantic segmentation is provided in Fig. 3.

%Query
Query: "Which hardware resources are used for training the deep learning model (e.g., GPUs, TPUs)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. The text only mentions that the weights were obtained from an already trained implementation of DeeplabV3+ using the COCO dataset but does not specify the hardware used during the training process. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which hardware resources were utilized for training the deep learning model based solely on the provided context.
