Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, several strategies can be employed. One common strategy is fixing the random seed value. By setting a fixed seed value, we ensure that the results are reproducible across different runs of the same model. This is particularly useful when comparing models or debugging code. Another strategy is to use techniques such as cross-validation or bootstrapping to evaluate the performance of the model on multiple datasets. These techniques help reduce the impact of randomness on the final result. Additionally, ensemble methods can also be used to combine the predictions of multiple models trained with different initializations, which helps improve the robustness of the overall prediction. Finally, it is important to carefully tune hyperparameters and perform regularization to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.
