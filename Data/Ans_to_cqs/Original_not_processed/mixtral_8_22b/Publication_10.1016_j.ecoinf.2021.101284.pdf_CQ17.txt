In summary, it should be emphasized that both the environmental 
data, i.e. the information related to population and geographic condi-
tions, and the air pollution data, are of the Big Data type. Its volume is in 
the order of terabytes in size.

6. Discussion

In the case of modelling or prediction of certain issues related to the 
COVID-19  pandemic, the  use  of  modern and  complex  algorithmic  so-
lutions such as neural networks, fuzzy logic or maximum entropy would 
be advisable. However, in this study, our primary goal was to investigate 
the impact of individual factors on the phenomena associated with the 
pandemic, namely, the incidence of new infections and the surplus of 
deaths. We chose to apply the LR method. This is well established in 
literature, and is convergent, fast and, above all, fully interpretable. This 
interpretability allowed us to conduct a full analysis of the considered 
factors.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific details about the regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline for preventing overfitting. However, some commonly used regularization techniques include Dropout and L2 Regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent overfitting by making the model more robust and reducing its dependence on any single feature.

L2 Regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights. This encourages smaller weights, leading to simpler models that generalize better.

Other popular regularization techniques include L1 Regularization, early stopping, and data augmentation. These methods can help improve the performance and generalizability of deep learning models by preventing them from memorizing the training data and becoming too specialized.
