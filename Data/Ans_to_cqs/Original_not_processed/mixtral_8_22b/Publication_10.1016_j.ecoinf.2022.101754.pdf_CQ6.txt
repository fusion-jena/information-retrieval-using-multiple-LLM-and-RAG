Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

2.6. Training and validation set 

The  study  utilized  a  training-and-test  approach  with  stratification 
splitting. For each setting, 100 different splits to the training-and-test set 
were given. Tuning of the hyperparameter on the training set was done 
for  each  set.  This  was  followed  by  model  training  using  an  optimal 
setting of the hyperparameter. 

2.7. Regression models 

Four methods were used to model forest AGB in the study: AdaBoost, 
random  decision  forest  (RF),  multilayer  neural  network  (NET),  and 
Bayesian ridge regression (Bayes).

In  recent  years,  nonparametric  machine  learning  models  have 
become  predominant  for  quantifying  forest  biomass  within  a  space 
based  on  ALS  data  (Ali  et  al.,  2015;  Zhang  et  al.,  2019).  Machine

learning techniques (e.g., random forest [RF], support vector regression 
[SVR], and k-nearest neighbor [kNN]) are capable to reveal complicated 
nonlinear patterns (Fassnacht et al., 2014) and, in addition, to solve data 
dimensional  problems  when  fitting  models  with  a  large  number  of 
predictors (Hudak et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2019). The variety among 
research  sites,  however,  corresponds  to  equal  variety  among  those 
predictors and machine learning methods used. Therefore, there is no 
agreement to  date  on best  practices  for machine  learning methods  to 
estimate AGB from ALS. In a review, Fassnacht et al. (2014) reported 
that RF performed best and stepwise linear models poorest, as judged by 
coefficient  of  determination  (R2)  and  root  mean  square  error  (RMSE) 
under  cross-validation.  Tompalski  et  al.  (2019)  generated  area-based 
models using ordinary least squares regression (OLS), RF, and kNN to

Helpful Answer:
Based on the provided context, it does not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning models. However, common preprocessing steps often involve normalization or standardization of input features, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. These steps help improve the performance and convergence speed of the model during training. It should be noted that these preprocessing steps may vary depending on the nature of the dataset and the requirements of the chosen deep learning algorithm.

Unhelpful Answer:
The context mentions four methods used to model forest AGB: AdaBoost, Random Decision Forest (RF), Multilayer Neural Network (NET), and Bayesian Ridge Regression (Bayes). However, it does not provide information about any preprocessing steps involved before training these models.
