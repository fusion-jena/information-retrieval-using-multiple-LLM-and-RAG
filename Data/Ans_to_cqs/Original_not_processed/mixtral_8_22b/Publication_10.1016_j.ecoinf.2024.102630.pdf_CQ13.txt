Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

posite  data,  the  annual  mean  NDVI  data  (January–December),  the 
growing season mean NDVI data (March–November), the spring mean 
NDVI data (March–May), the summer mean NDVI data (June–August), 
and  the  winter  mean  NDVI  data  (September–November)  were

lower,  demonstrates  a  significantly  greater

NDVIR = MAX(NDVIi)

(2) 

Among them, NDVIR is the monthly (annual) NDVI value, and NDVI i 

is the value before synthesis. 

2.3.3. NDVI classification analysis 

The Jenks natural breaks optimization method is a statistical tech-
nique designed to determine the optimal classification by maximizing 
the variance between classes and minimizing the variance within clas-
ses, thereby identifying natural groupings in the data (Jenks, 1967). The 
Jenks natural breaks optimization method has been widely applied in 
the classification research of vegetation indices, such as NDVI and Soil 
Adjusted  Vegetation  Index  (SAVI)  classification  research  (Anchang 
et al., 2016; Silva Costa et al., 2023). To accurately compare the dif-
ferences in value sizes between different NDVI products, we used the 
Jenks  natural  breaks  optimization  method  to  divide  the  average  or 
maximum values of four NDVI products at different time scales into six

cloud  cover,  and  surface  information  across  NDVI  product  datasets 
result  in  distinct  strengths  and  weaknesses  for  each  product.  Conse-
quently, researchers must carefully select NDVI products to ensure data 
suitability for their specific research needs (Fensholt et al., 2009).
