Separate  two-class  models  were  trained  for  Finnmark  and  Yamal 
using  the  keras  package  in  R  (Allaire  and  Chollet,  2023)  with  a  Ten-
sorFlow  backend (Allaire  and Tang,  2023).  Preliminary trials  showed 
that region-specific models performed better. The ResNet-50 architec-
ture, a convolutional neural network that is 50 layers deep (He et al., 
2015), was used to train the models with 55 epochs (number of times the 
algorithm goes through the entire training data set) and a batch size of 
64  (number  of  samples  to  work  through  before  updating  model  pa-
rameters)  with  a  one-cycle  learning  rate  (hyperparameter  controlling 
model  response  to  estimated  error  each  time  the  model  weights  are 
updated) policy with a minimum of 0.000001 and a maximum of 0.001 
(Smith, 2018).

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it does not explicitly state how the data was split for deep learning model training (i.e., into train, test, or validation sets). However, it can be inferred from common practices in machine learning that some form of splitting would have been applied. Typically, datasets are divided into three parts: training, testing, and validation sets. The training set is used to fit the model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance. The validation set is often used during hyperparameter tuning to prevent overfitting. In this case, the authors mention using a separate dataset for testing the model's performance (Table 5), which suggests they likely followed these standard practices. However, without explicit information about the exact methodology used for splitting the data, we cannot provide a definitive answer.
