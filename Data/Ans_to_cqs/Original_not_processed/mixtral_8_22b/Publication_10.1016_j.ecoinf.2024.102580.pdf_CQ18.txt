To  refine  the  predictions  and  remove  false  detections,  post- 
processing  techniques  using  the  DBSCAN  algorithm  from  the  scikit- 
learn library (v.0.24.2) were applied (Schubert et al., 2017). DBSCAN 
was successful in correcting duplicate DETR predictions, a more detailed 
description can be found in Supplementary S2D. The model underwent 
300 training cycles with a batch size of two. The learning rate for the 
(cid:0) 5 (Carion 
model backbone was set to 10
et  al.,  2020).  The  model  produced  bounding  box  predictions  and  the 
probability that these bounding boxes contained turtles. A confidence 
threshold, determining the optimal model performance, was established 
by plotting Precision and Recall against the threshold on the validation 
set.  The  chosen  threshold  balanced  the  two  metrics,  maximizing  per-
formance  by  detecting  individuals  (Precision)  while  minimizing  false 
detections (Recall).

The ground-truth dataset was divided randomly into training (80%), 
validation (10%), and test (10%) sets (Fig. 1), this division of the im-

training process, each image was subset and cropped into 6 overlapping

Helpful Answer:
A strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves dividing the ground-truth dataset into training (80%), validation (10%), and test (10%) sets. This division allows for a good-sized validation and test dataset for evaluating the model’s accuracy while maximizing the training set. During the training process, each image is subset and cropped into six overlapping patches matching the output size of the network (388 x 388 pixels), resulting in a total training set size of 379 images. Additionally, data augmentation techniques such as random horizontal flips, rotations, zooms, and brightness adjustments are used to increase the diversity of the training set. The model undergoes 300 training cycles with a batch size of two, and the learning rate for the model backbone is set to 10^-5, while the transformer is set to 10^-4. To establish a confidence threshold determining the optimal model performance, Precision and Recall are plotted against the threshold on the validation set. The chosen threshold balances the two metrics, maximizing performance by detecting individuals while minimizing false detections.
