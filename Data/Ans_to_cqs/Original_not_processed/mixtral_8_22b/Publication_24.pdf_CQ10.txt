%Query
Query: "What is the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide the exact code repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in the given context. However, it can be inferred that the pipeline was developed using Python programming language along with libraries such as Theano, Lasagne, and Librosa. It would be best to contact the authors or check their other publications for more specific details about the code repository.
