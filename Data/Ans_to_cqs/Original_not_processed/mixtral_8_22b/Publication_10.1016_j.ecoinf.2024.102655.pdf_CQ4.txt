with the full dataset where significantly higher values for all evaluation
measurements (RMSE, MSE, MAE and R2) were observed. Addionally,
the three models (ANFIS, ANN, and SVM) performed similar evalution
measurements when were trained using the BTS, which also prove that
the selection of most representative and variable scenarios for training is
effective to improve machine learning models performance.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on the specific data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. However, some common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, padding, and adding noise. These techniques help increase the amount of training data available and can improve the model's ability to generalize by introducing variations into the input data. It should be noted that the choice of data augmentation technique depends on the nature of the problem being solved and the characteristics of the input data.
