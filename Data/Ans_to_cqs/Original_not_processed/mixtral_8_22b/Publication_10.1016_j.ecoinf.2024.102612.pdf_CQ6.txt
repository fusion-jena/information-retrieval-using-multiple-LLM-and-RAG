3.2. Fuel model retrieval 

Once the DL model is trained, a few samples of real MS point clouds 
are segmented using the methodology exposed in Section 2.3 to create a 
ground truth. This ground truth was required to validate the classifica-
tions using a DL model trained with synthetic data. As mentioned in the 
previous section, the best classification performance of the SoftGroup 
semantic branch was achieved by the MS input data case; therefore, this 
pretrained  model was  used,  and  its  efficiency was  tested  by  inferring 
these real MS point clouds (Fig. 9). In addition, these inferences on real 
MS point clouds are taken as inputs for the decision tree scheme pre-
sented in Section 2.5, where the final fuel models are retrieved. The final 
fuel model classifications are summarised in Table 3.

and  Mean  IoU  (MIoU).  Notably,  in  addition  to  the  comprehensive 
evaluation  provided  by  the  Overall  Accuracy  and  IoU,  their  mean 
counterparts  (MA  and  MIoU)  consider  the  individual  values  for  each 
class within the dataset and compute their average. This approach en-
hances the reliability of the classification results for imbalanced data. 
Furthermore, the highest MIoU value was employed to determine the 
point at which the DNN attained optimal performance. 

Finally, the selected SoftGroup architecture was trained over 1000 
epochs for each type of input data, and metrics such as MIoU or MA were 
computed after each epoch to analyse the training performance. Once 
trained, the configuration weights that achieved the best classification 
performance were selected to establish the reference trained model and, 
finally, it was used to perform predictions on the real MS point clouds 
collected in Section 2.3, i.e. the ground truth data.

Regardless of the model type employed for semantic classification, 
training  a  DNN  model  from  scratch  requires  a  substantial  number  of 
training samples to grasp a diverse range of features. The lack of liter-
ature on semantic classifications of real LiDAR point clouds being pre-
trained  with  synthetic  data  emphasises  the  importance  of  integrating 
augmented  data  simulations  during  the  training  phase  of  DL  models. 
Data augmentation addresses the requirement for large training datasets 
in DNNs, which can be achieved using an external simulator. Current 
research  on  LiDAR  point-cloud  simulations  predominantly  embraces 
two perspectives: aerial and terrestrial, specifically ALS, Terrestrial, and 
Mobile Laser Scanning (TLS and MLS, respectively) point clouds.

convolutional layers and filters, and each variation is trained using input 
point clouds with different kernel configurations. The best results were 
achieved by the LSSegNet3 configuration with an 80.1% MIoU score, 
which  is  not  significantly  different  from  the  76.7%  achieved  in  this 
study.  However,  this  configuration  only  doubled  the  number  of  con-
volutional layers from the previous variations and increased the number 
of kernels used for the classifications; therefore, all the results can be

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, based on general practices in machine learning and deep learning, common preprocessing techniques include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and augmenting the data. Normalization scales numeric columns to a standard scale without distorting differences in the ranges of values or losing information. Scaling rescales the values into a certain range, often between zero and one. Cleaning involves handling missing values, outliers, and errors in the dataset. Data augmentation generates new instances of data by applying transformations like rotations, translations, flips, etc., to increase the size of the dataset and improve the robustness of the model. These preprocessing steps help in improving the quality of the data, reducing computational complexity, and enhancing the overall performance of the deep learning model.
