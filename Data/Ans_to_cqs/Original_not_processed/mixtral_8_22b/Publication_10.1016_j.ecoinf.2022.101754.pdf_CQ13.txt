In  recent  years,  nonparametric  machine  learning  models  have 
become  predominant  for  quantifying  forest  biomass  within  a  space 
based  on  ALS  data  (Ali  et  al.,  2015;  Zhang  et  al.,  2019).  Machine

2.6. Training and validation set 

The  study  utilized  a  training-and-test  approach  with  stratification 
splitting. For each setting, 100 different splits to the training-and-test set 
were given. Tuning of the hyperparameter on the training set was done 
for  each  set.  This  was  followed  by  model  training  using  an  optimal 
setting of the hyperparameter. 

2.7. Regression models 

Four methods were used to model forest AGB in the study: AdaBoost, 
random  decision  forest  (RF),  multilayer  neural  network  (NET),  and 
Bayesian ridge regression (Bayes).

ACT1 is accuracy with tolerance 15 t/ha ± 10% of AGB [t/ha], 
ACT2 is accuracy with tolerance 10 t/ha ± 5% of AGB [t/ha], 
RMSE is root mean squared error [t/ha] (eq. 3), 
R2 is coefficient of determination (R2; eq. 4), 
Diff_R2 is the difference between R2_test and R2_all, and. 
CV_R2 is cross-validation R2.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, the provided context does not contain specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. However, it mentions that tuning of the hyperparameters was performed on the training set for each split, which suggests that various hyperparameters might have been tested during this process. Common hyperparameters in deep learning include learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, optimizer type, and others. Without more detailed information, it would be impossible to provide exact values or types of hyperparameters used in the mentioned study.
