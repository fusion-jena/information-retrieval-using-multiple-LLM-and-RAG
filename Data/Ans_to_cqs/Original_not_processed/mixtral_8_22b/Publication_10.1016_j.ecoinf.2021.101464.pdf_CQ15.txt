3.2. Random forest model 

According to the parameter optimization results of the random forest 
(RF)  model,  five  training  samples  were  analyzed,  whose  importance 
scores (VI) were obtained by simulation, and the selected variables were 
sorted according to their scores. The results are shown in Fig. 3, in which 
the VI plots for the five samples are consistent; the scores of the selected 
10 variables were more than 20% VI, and showed a threshold of 30% VI, 
above which the variables assumed higher importance (Fig. 3). In the 
training  and  test  datasets,  the  intermediate  models  established  by  RF 
showed that the proportion of explained variance was between 91% and 
92%  (Table  4).  Further,  the  correlation  coefficients  between  the

and random forest model in machine learning were applied to simulate 
the  influence  of  environmental  factors  on  NAI  for  achieving  compre-
hensive analysis from both the linear and nonlinear points of view. We 
discussed the prediction ability of the models and the importance of the 
selected  variables  by  analyzing  and  comparing  the  results  of  the  two 
methods.  Further,  the  most  sensitive  factors  and  common  variables 
affecting  changes  in  NAI  concentration  in  the  two  models  were 
analyzed, and independent sample data were used to verify the relevant 
results, in order to reveal the key environmental factors affecting NAI 
and  the  contribution  potential  of  environmental  factors  on  NAI  more 
comprehensively and objectively, which provides a scientific basis for 
better understanding the NAI’s response mechanism to environmental 
factors  and  parameter  optimization  of  regional  ecosystem  process 
model.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it is not possible to determine what specific optimization techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), since there is no mention of these techniques in the provided information. However, we can see that the paper discusses the use of a Random Forest (RF) model, which is a type of ensemble learning method rather than a deep learning technique. Therefore, it does not directly involve optimization techniques like SGD or Adam. Instead, the RF model uses bootstrap aggregating (bagging) and feature randomness when building each individual decision tree within the forest.
