species on the CES. In contrast, we did not detect a contribution of wild 
bird diversity. Still, we detected that specific wild bird species increase 
the number of views for YouTube videos. Because the YouTube videos 
used covered a wide range of wild bird species richness (from 1 to 106), 
this study provides a comprehensive overview of the contributions of 
biodiversity and specific species to the CES. Our study thus underscores 
that online platforms such as YouTube and Twitter can be a source of big 
data to explore important questions in ecology (Edwards et al., 2022; 
Freund et al., 2021; Jagiello et al., 2019; Jeawak et al., 2020).

number of views increases with time, we recorded the number of views
