was analysed using various evaluation matrices. During model training, 
the input image size was set to 512 × 512 and the maximum batch size 
was limited to 4. To prevent underfitting, all models were ensured to 
follow back-propagation after accumulating the batch size 32 times. The 
models were trained using a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer 
with an initial learning rate of 0.01 and a cycle learning rate of 0.2, with

where,  n  represents  the  input  tensor  with  shape  [batch_size,  height, 
width, channels].  It contains the input  data or feature map  used in a 
neural network, w(n) is a weight tensor derived from n, typically ob-
tained through some form of learned parameters or coefficients, and f (w 
(n), n) represents the process of treating the input feature n. 

The network architecture of the depth-attention YOLOv5 is shown in 
Fig. 10. Unlike other attention mechanisms that are usually introduced 
earlier in the network and trained along with the other layers, the depth- 
attention mechanism was placed after the final processing layers of the 
detection model. It remains unchanged and does not adapt during the 
training  process.  This means that the depth-attention  weights are not 
updated  during  training  and  remain  fixed  throughout  the  learning

Helpful Answer:
To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, several strategies can be employed. One common approach is to use a fixed random seed value across different runs of the same experiment. By setting a specific seed value, we ensure that the results obtained are reproducible and consistent. Another strategy is to perform multiple runs with different random seeds and then average the results. This helps reduce the impact of any single run being influenced by a particularly favorable or unfavorable initialization. Additionally, techniques such as dropout and data augmentation can also help mitigate the effects of randomness by introducing controlled variability into the training process. Dropout randomly drops out neurons during training, which helps prevent overfitting and encourages the network to learn more robust features. Data augmentation involves applying random transformations to the input data, such as rotations, translations, and flips, which increases the diversity of the training data and makes the model more resilient to variations in the input.
