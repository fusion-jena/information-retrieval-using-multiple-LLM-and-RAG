Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

2.2. Split the datasets 

In this research, the datasets were randomly divided into three parts 
for training, validation and testing. Here, 60% of the data was used to 
train the deep learning models, and 20% of them was kept to validate the 
models. The remaining 20% data was used to evaluate the performance 
of the models. Table 1 show the number of data in the dataset and how 
they are separated for training, testing and validation. 

2.3. Deep learning models

diction  of  the  deep  learning  model.  This  dataset  was  taken  to  verify 
whether our proposed approach can handle that issue. The dataset was 
shared  by  Jiang  et  al.  (2020)  through  the  Github  repository: 
https://github.com/zhangchuanyin/weed-datasets.

DenseNets (DenseNet121, DenseNet169, and DenseNet201) promote 
feature  reuse  by  connecting  each  convolutional  layer  to  every  other 
layer in a feed-forward fashion. Compared to other deeper architectures, 
these  memory-efficient  models  achieve  better  performance  on  image 
classification tasks using fewer parameters (JÂ´egou et al., 2017). Finally, 
MobileNetV2  is  chosen  as  a  lightweight  model,  which  is  an  efficient 
architecture for real-time applications. The model balances speed and 
accuracy  well  using  limited  computational  resources  (Wang  et  al., 
2022). 

Several studies used these models on crop-weed datasets and ach-
ieved better performance. For instance, Olsen et al. (2019) used ResNet- 
50 and Inception-V3. Hasan et al. (2023) compared the performance of 
VGG16, ResNet-50, Inception-V3, InceptionResNetV2 and MobileNetV2

%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or any other platform was used for deployment based on the available context.
