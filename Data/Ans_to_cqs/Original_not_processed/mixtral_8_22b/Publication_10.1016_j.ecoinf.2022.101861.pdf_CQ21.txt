(minimum and maximum length, respectively); and a maximum inter-
syllable gap of 4 s. In this step Kaleidoscope automatically extracted all 
sounds  that  satisfied  the  signal  parameters  introduced  and  saved  the 
output.

2.6. Statistical analyses

while recording month and site were introduced as factors. We did not 
include  in  the  analyses  those  months  with  <100  vocalizations  (from 
December to March, see results). We performed Tukey’s post-hoc tests to 
identify  differences  among  levels  of  the  factor  recording  hour  and 
recording month. Statistical analyses were run with R 3.6.2 (R Devel-
opment  Core  Team,  2019). The  package  “multcomp”  (Hothorn  et  al., 
2008) was used for Tukey’s post-hoc tests.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, common postprocessing steps include generating saliency maps to visualize which parts of the input data most influenced the model's predictions, calculating metrics such as accuracy or F1 score to evaluate the performance of the model, and creating confusion matrices to understand how well the model is able to distinguish between different classes. These steps can help researchers better understand their models and improve them if necessary.
