information passes through the end of the network. (1) ResNet-10128 was proposed to address this problem by 
using skip connections that allow useful layer output to pass over groups of layers (or residual blocks) and thus 
penetrate much further into deep networks. (2) Wide-ResNet-10129, on the other hand, is wider but shallower 
than ResNet-101. This difference in architecture allows information to more easily pass through the network 
while providing a greater number of channels to maintain performance. (3)  InceptionV330 has fewer layers but 
achieves  greater  computational  efficiency  by,  for  example,  using  factorized  convolution,  which  breaks  down 
channels into simpler linear sequences while maintaining spatial context within the image. (4) MnasNet-A131 
was designed to be faster for mobile devices and thus has the fewest layers of the models compared here. The

by class sample size. We used the SGD (stochastic gradient descent) optimizer with an initial learning rate of 
0.01 for all models except MansNet, which was initially set at 0.1. The learning rate was reduced by a factor of 
10 after steps of 30 epochs. We used batch normalization and models were trained for 150 epochs using Nvidia 
Tesla K80 or P100 GPUs.

Model improvement.  Further  development  of  our  training  data  set  should  enhance  generalization  and 
model accuracy, especially by prioritizing images of poorly sampled species with higher error rates. However, 
exploring new ways of learning and data generation may further enhance the model. For example, metric learn-
ing could be used to learn similar features between a pair of images, thus enhancing the discriminative power of 
deep  CNNs37. Alternatively, generative adversarial  networks38 may help improve error rates for poorly sampled 
species and low accuracy due to class imbalance by generating synthetic image data when new images are dif-
ficult to acquire.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit details about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that exploring new ways of learning and data generation can enhance the model. One such method mentioned is Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which can potentially improve error rates for poorly sampled species and low accuracy due to class imbalance by generating synthetic image data when new images are difficult to acquire. Although not explicitly stated, this approach could be considered a form of data augmentation aimed at addressing data bias caused by class imbalance. Other common techniques to handle data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, but these methods are not discussed in the given context.
