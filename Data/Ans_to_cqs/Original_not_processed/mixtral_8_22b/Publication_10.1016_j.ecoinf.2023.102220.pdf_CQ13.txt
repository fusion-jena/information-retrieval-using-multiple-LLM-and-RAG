each, all using the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function; for 
the output layer we used the sigmoid activation function. We used the 
LSTM method by adding a long short term memory block on the DNN’s 
architecture  previously  described.  The  implementation  of  the  classifi-
cation methods was carried out in Python using the libraries TensorFlow 
and Scikit-learn (Van Rossum and Drake Jr, 1995). Finally, we obtained 
the accuracy, true positive rate and false positive rate using the afore-
mentioned training-test splits of the time series.

Random Forests. The PBP method yielded a competitive performance associated with higher true-positive rates 
in most comparisons while providing interpretability rather than being a black-box method. It is an improvement 
over current state-of-the-art machine learning tools, especially by non-specialists, such as ecologists aiming to use 
a quantitative approach for pest monitoring. We provide the implemented PBP method in Python through the 
pypbp package.

With  respect  to  interpretability,  when  using  RF,  it  is  possible  to 
obtain variable importance. However in this case, this will tell us which 
previous  steps  were  most  important  when  predicting  outbreaks,  not 
necessarily  how  they  relate  to  its  occurrence.  When  using  LSTM  and 
DNN,  which  are  commonly  referred  to  as  ‘black-box’  methods  (Liang 
et al., 2021), it is even more challenging to find explainable frameworks 
that allow us to study the relationship between the predictors and the 
outbreaks. However, each hyperparameter in the PBP framework pro-
vides a clear interpretation, and we are able to create visual represen-
tations  of  the  patterns  that  occurred  before  the  outbreak  (the  P′
means 
matrix).  For  instance,  Fig.  7  displays  the  three  patterns  in  P′

c. These results reflect the accuracy of 100% obtained for 
some parameter regions in our sensitivity study. The results improved 
dramatically  when  we  fully  optimised  our  choice  for  the  parameter 
values, even when subject to stochastic effects.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. However, it does indicate that the model employed a deep neural network (DNN) architecture with layers containing 11 to 3 neurons, utilizing the ReLU activation function for hidden layers and the sigmoid activation function for the output layer. Additionally, the model incorporated a long short-term memory (LSTM) block into the DNN architecture. The implementation of these classification methods was done in Python using the TensorFlow and Scikit-learn libraries. Despite the lack of explicit information about the hyperparameters, one can infer that common hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and optimizers (such as Adam, SGD, or RMSprop) would have been considered during the development and optimization of the model.
