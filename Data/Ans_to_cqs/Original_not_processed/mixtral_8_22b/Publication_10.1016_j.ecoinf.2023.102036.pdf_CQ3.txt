the growing computing capability of machines and availability of big 
data, making it possible to extract high levels of representation of image 
content  (Hassaballah  and  Hosny,  2019).  This  field  falls  into  artificial 
intelligence  and,  in  particular,  deep  learning,  which  has  recently 
received  large  attention  from  ecologists  (Christin  et  al.,  2019).  Deep 
learning  is  a  sub-field  of  artificial  intelligence  which  focuses  on  a 
learning method based on logical structures that closely resemble the 
architectural  characteristics  of  the  brain  (the  so-called  deep  artificial 
neural networks). It consists of processing units within the global system 
that  specialize  in  detecting certain  hidden  characteristics  in the  data.

fisheries  dates  from  1980s,  which  consisted  in  a  method  for  sorting

Query: "What are the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., bounding box annotation, instance segmentation)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it mentions that the authors aim to address the limitation of small amounts of labeled images in each category using existing deep learning techniques combined with statistical fundamentals. Additionally, they reference a paper titled "Automatic fish species classification in underwater videos" which may involve some form of object detection or classification, but no explicit mention of the annotation technique is made. Therefore, without further context, it cannot be determined what specific data annotation techniques were used in this case.
