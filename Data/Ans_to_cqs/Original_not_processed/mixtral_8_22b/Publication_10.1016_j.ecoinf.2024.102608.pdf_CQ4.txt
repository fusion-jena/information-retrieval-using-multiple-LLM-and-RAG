Owing to their ability to understand complicated patterns in data, 
ANNs have been employed in a broad variety of applications, including 
speech recognition, image recognition, natural language processing, and 
freshwater ecology. To train properly, however, ANNs require copious 
amounts  of  data  and  can  be  computationally  intensive  (Lecun  et  al., 
2015; Rumelhart et al., 1986). 

2.5. Model performance assessment techniques 

The algorithmsâ€™ performance and parameter settings were assessed 
using a training and test set approach. Evaluation of the models involved 
analyzing key metrics such as the coefficient of determination (R2), root- 
mean-square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE), and both 
the training and test datasets.

we selected the set of hyperparameter values that resulted in the mini-
mum  MAE  and  RMSE,  as  well  as  the  highest  R2,  for  each  machine 
learning model. Table 1 presents the resulting hyperparameter values 
for the four machine learning models.

in various scientific domains. Machine learning algorithms can extract 
patterns from datasets with minimal prior knowledge, capture data-rich 
features,  and  establish  relationships.  They  offer  advantages  over 
empirical and semi-analytical algorithms by bypassing errors introduced 
during atmospheric correction and providing universal and optimized 
water  quality  models  based  on  reservoir  datasets  (Li  et  al.,  2021b; 
Pahlevan et al., 2019b). This combination is particularly suited to large- 
scale applications for quantifying and mapping water quality parame-
ters,  such  as  CHL-a,  TSS,  and  SD.  Moreover,  machine  learning  algo-
rithms can handle complex non-linear relationships in multidimensional 
space,  enabling  comprehensive  investigations  and  management  of 
reservoir environments. Several machine learning algorithms, including 
neural  network  (NN)  (Hong  et  al.,  2022;  Reichstein  et  al.,  2019),

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no information about the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, and shifting. These techniques help increase the amount of training data and improve the generalization capabilities of the model. It should also be noted that the choice of data augmentation technique depends on the nature of the problem and the dataset being used.
