In  machine  learning/AI  approaches,  inference  is  typically  drawn 

from prediction (Breiman, 2001, Humphries et al., 2018). In ensemble 
models,  one  obtains  ’a  strong  learner  from  many  weak  learners’  (sensu 
Friedman,  2002).  Synergy  predictors  dominate  in  real-world  ecology

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The article does not provide explicit details about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it mentions using multi-year fieldwork and open access data, which could contribute to a diverse dataset. Additionally, the use of machine learning ensemble models like Random Forest, TreeNet, CART, and MARS suggests some form of cross-validation or bootstrapping might have been employed during training. Nevertheless, without more detailed information, we cannot definitively state what measures were specifically used to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
