other class(es). The network then performs a new round of learning on 
the  mini-batch  of  images—focusing  relatively  more  on  images  with 
higher  loss  scores—and  updates  its  internal  parameters,  before  pro-
ceeding to the next training iteration with a new mini-batch of images. A 
full cycle through the entire set of training images is referred to as an 
‘epoch’,  and  the  number  of  iterations  per  epoch  is  equal  to  the  total 
number of training images divided by the mini-batch size.

The  mini-batch  size  is  user-adjustable  (typically  in  binary-number 
increments,  e.g.  2,  4,  8,  16,  32,  etc.)  depending  on  the  data  set.  Too 
small  a  mini-batch  size  may  provide  insufficient  image  data  for  the 
network  to  meaningfully  learn from  some or  all  of  the  classes  within 
each iteration, while too large a mini-batch size may cause the network 
to  overfit  to  the  training  images.  Because  of  the  high  computational 
complexity  of  the  deep  learning  process,  the  mini-batch  size  is  ulti-
mately limited by the amount of memory available to the GPU (in our 
case 8 GB), factoring in the size of the images (in our case 224 × 224 
pixels × 3 bands) and the number of internal parameters in the network 
(25.6 million in the case of ResNet-50). Thus, we were limited to mini-

By default, ResNet-50 processes three-band (RGB) input images with 
a size of 224 × 224 pixels. Training of the network is performed itera-
tively on small ‘mini-batches’ of the training images. At each iteration, 
the network is shown a new mini-batch of images and starts by classi-
fying them based on its current internal parameters. For each image, the 
network estimates the probability that the image represents each of the 
different user-defined classes, with the probability scores of all classes 
cumulatively adding up to 1. By default, the image is assigned to the 
class with the highest probability score. The network then ascertains the 
actual  class  of  the  training  image  as  per  the  user-provided  label,  and 
computes a ‘loss’ score for the image based on the difference between 
the estimated class probability scores and the actual scores, whereby the 
image should have a score of 1 for its actual class and a score of 0 for the

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, common practices in machine learning include monitoring metrics such as validation loss or accuracy during training. When these metrics reach a plateau or stop improving significantly, it can be considered as an indication that further training might not yield substantial improvements. This concept is often referred to as early stopping. Additionally, another criterion could be reaching a predetermined maximum number of epochs or iterations. It's important to note that these criteria are general guidelines and the optimal point to stop training can vary depending on the specific problem and dataset.
