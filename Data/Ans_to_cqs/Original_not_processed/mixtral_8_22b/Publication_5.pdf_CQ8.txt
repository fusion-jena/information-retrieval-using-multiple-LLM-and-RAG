Korea for model training and testing. TensorFlow (https://tensorflow.org (accessed on 24 June 2021)), which is an end-to-end open source platform for DL, was used to develop our species richness estimation model. In developing DL models, there are several hyperparameters that need to be tuned prior to training the model, but there are common sets of rules or heuristics governing parameter tuning. After iterative grid search parameter tuning, using a small subset of our data, 5 hidden layers (ùêáùëó,ùëó=1,2,‚ãØ,5) were used, and the number of neurons (n) in Remote Sens. 2021, 13, 2490

%Query
Query: "Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information regarding the specific code repository for the deep learning pipeline mentioned in this context is not explicitly stated. Therefore, it cannot be determined where the code repository is available, such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. However, it is mentioned that TensorFlow (<https://tensorflow.org>) was used to develop the species richness estimation model. TensorFlow is an open-source platform for deep learning, so it can be assumed that the code might be available somewhere online, possibly even on one of these platforms. But without further information, the exact location of the code repository remains unknown.
