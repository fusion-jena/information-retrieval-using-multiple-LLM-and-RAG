2.2. CNN Classiﬁcation System

In order to carry out the design of the CNN classiﬁcation system, a set of stages
were followed. These stages are represented in Figure 9 and described in the following
subsections.

Figure 9. Stages in the classiﬁcation system.

Each of the stages was programmed with Python using the Keras library [30] for CNNs.

2.2.1. Data Augmentation

In order to generate a more robust training set, an augmentation process was carried
out using the sound database. When one deals with CNN and images, data augmenta-
tion consists of extending the set of images from their transformations (rotations, size
modiﬁcations, etc.). For the purpose of the present work on sounds, the transformations
must be made on the audios, and later these transformations will be reﬂected in the
mel-spectrogram images.

In this way, for each of the 865 audio samples in the database, 10 additional audios

were generated:

As mentioned in the data augmentation section above, a CNN was ﬁrst trained for
the 4 sound classes covered in the classiﬁcation model developed in previous work [20–23].
Later, a second CNN was trained to expand the classiﬁcation system to the total of the
5 classes detailed in Table 1.

For the ﬁrst network, the best results were obtained with training in only 8 epochs
(number of passes of the entire training dataset) and a batch size (number of samples
utilized in one training iteration) equal to 32. For the second network, the best training was
achieved with 6 epochs and, again, a batch size equal to 32. For both networks, the initial
learning rate [33] with 0.001 and the “adam” optimizer [34] were the parameters used in
the training process.

ﬁlters per convolution layer is 32 for the ﬁrst one, 64 for the second one, and 128 for the
ﬁnal one. A kernel size (height and width of the convolution window) of 3 × 3 is used
on each convolution layer. The fully connected layer (FC) consists of 512 neurons and
the softmax layer with the number of units for classiﬁcation (one for each type of sound).
Figure 11 shows the structure of the CNN.

For network training, 80% of the samples were used as training samples, and 20%
as tests. This strategy is widely used to enhance the generalization of a machine learning
model and prevent overﬁtting. A balanced sampling was carried out for the test set. For
it, one audio sample (with its corresponding data augmentation samples) out of 5 was
selected for each type of anuran call. Thus, 7623 samples were used for training and 1892
for testing.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it mentions a crucial step called data augmentation, which is a technique used to increase the amount of training data by creating modified versions of the existing data. In this case, for each of the 865 audio samples in the database, ten additional audios were generated through various transformations like time stretching, pitch shifting, and adding noise. These transformations were then reflected in the mel-spectrogram images used for training the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Additionally, the text discusses the use of a balanced sampling approach for selecting test sets to improve the generalization of the machine learning model and prevent overfitting.
