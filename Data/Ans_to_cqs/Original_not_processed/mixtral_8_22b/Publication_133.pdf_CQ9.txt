INTRODUCTION

State of the Art: Machine Learning for
Insect Ecoinformatics
Ecologists strive to document and interpret the abundance
and distribution of organisms. Field observations are a major
means to this end, and the observational data that have
accumulated over the decades form a solid basis for our
view of ecosystems. In recent years, technological advances
enabled the solidiﬁcation of observational ecology into a
new scientiﬁc branch, ecoinformatics, which applies big-data
methods to ecological questions (Rosenheim and Gratton, 2017).
Ecoinformatics focuses on curating and mining large databases,
collected over long time periods across multiple locations (see
the GBIF Home Page1). The available data vary in format and
reliability (Gueta and Carmel, 2016) as they originate from
multiple sources, such as long-term ecological monitoring (Lister
and Garcia, 2018), citizen science projects (Hallmann et al., 2017),
or museum catalogs (Short et al., 2018).

FIGURE 4 | Test set precision-recall curves. Top: the model’s success in identifying “Glycaspis” vs. “non-Glycaspis” (left), “Psyllaephagus” vs. “non-Psyllaephagus”
(middle), and “Thaumastocoris” vs. “non-Thaumastocoris” (right). The plots indicate the recall and precision of the model’s predictions as a function of its conﬁdence
threshold (Tcs). The black dotted line depicts 0.7 conﬁdence. Bottom: Recall vs. Precision curves of the three focal species. Asterisks depict a conﬁdence threshold
of 0.7. Note that the recall plots of “Glycaspis” and “Psyllaephagus” do not reach 1, as a few insects were not identiﬁed even with Tcs = 0.1.

%Query
Query: "Where is the data repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The article does not provide information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It mentions that ecoinformatics focuses on curating and mining large databases collected over long time periods across multiple locations, but it does not specify any particular repositories or platforms used for storing or sharing these databases. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available based on the given context.
