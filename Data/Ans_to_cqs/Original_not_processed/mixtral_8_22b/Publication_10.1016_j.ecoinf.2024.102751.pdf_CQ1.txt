This study introduces a novel approach to soil moisture assessment in
reclaimed mining areas by integrating high-resolution topographic data
from airborne laser scanning (ALS) with spectral information from
PlanetScope imagery. We hypothesize that combining topographic
indices, such as slope, aspect, and Topographic Wetness Index (TWI),

4. Discussion

Knowledge of the soil retention capacity of brown coal post-
industrial heaps is limited. The first study at the spoil heap site related
to soil retention and the outflow of reclamation methods used was
conducted (Hendrychov´a and Bogusch, 2016). The type of vegetation
and type of reclamation has a direct bearing on the water content of the
heap.

Helpful Answer:
The research paper primarily focuses on using high-resolution topographic data from airborne laser scanning (ALS) and spectral information from PlanetScope imagery to assess soil moisture in reclaimed mining areas. Therefore, the primary method for collecting raw data in this case involves utilizing remote sensing techniques like ALS and satellite imagery.

Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS): This technique uses LiDAR technology mounted on aircraft or drones to collect highly accurate elevation data. It provides detailed information about terrain features, including slopes, aspects, and vegetation cover. In this study, ALS data were acquired on April 18, 2020, with a mean height error of 0.2 meters and 25 points per square meter.

PlanetScope Imagery: PlanetScope satellites provide daily global coverage of multispectral images with a spatial resolution of around three to five meters. These images can be used to extract various spectral indices related to vegetation health and water content. By combining these spectral indices with topographical data obtained through ALS, researchers aim to enhance the accuracy of volumetric water content predictions in post-mining landscapes.

While not explicitly mentioned in the given context, it should also be noted that additional sources of raw data may include ground truth measurements, weather data, and historical records. Ground truth measurements involve physically measuring variables such as soil moisture levels at specific locations within the study area. Weather data can help account for atmospheric conditions affecting evapotranspiration rates and overall water availability. Historical records might provide insights into past land use practices and their impact on current soil moisture patterns.
