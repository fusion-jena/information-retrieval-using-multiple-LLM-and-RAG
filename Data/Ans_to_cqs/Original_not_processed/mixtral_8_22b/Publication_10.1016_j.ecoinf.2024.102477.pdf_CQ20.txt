5.1. Comparison of SLSTM and SGRU models 

Deep learning methods have accelerated the development of artifi-
cial intelligence and demonstrated potential in various domains (Chen 
et al., 2021). Deep learning architectures simulate neurons in the brain, 
and their ability to learn from complex data renders them the preferred 
choice for time-series prediction (Choi et al., 2021). RNNs are neural 
networks that use backpropagation techniques and short-term memory 
to  enhance  their  time-series  prediction  performance  (Kavitha  et  al., 
2023).

LSTM units are specifically designed to handle the vanishing gradient 
problem, which occurs in RNNs during time-series prediction (Guesbaya 
et al., 2023). For seasonal data, SLSTM models considerably outperform 
LSTM  models  (Bandara  et  al.,  2020).  GRU  models  are  derived  from 
LSTM models by replacing the forget and input gates of LSTM models 
with an update gate. Compared with an LSTM model, a GRU model has 
fewer  parameters  and  thus  lower  computational  complexity.  Conse-
quently, compared with LSTM models, GRU models can be trained faster 
and are less likely to exhibit overfitting (Zhang et al., 2021). Because 
Taiwanese CO data are seasonal, the developed SGRU model exhibited 
an average MAPE value that was 49.46% lower than that of the SLSTM 
model used in the comparison.
