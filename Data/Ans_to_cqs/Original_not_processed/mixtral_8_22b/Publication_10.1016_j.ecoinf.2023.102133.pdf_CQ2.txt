4.1. Feature analysis 

Since ML models usually portray the relationship between input and 
output features, a preliminary feature analysis was performed. Indeed, 
this  analysis  plays  a  key  role  in  reducing  the  dimensionality  of  the 
problem  by  favoring  the  application  of  ML  models  with  a  limited 
number  of  features,  reducing  the  complexity,  implementation  and 
deployment costs in the field.

Overall, the complete dataset has a length of 1430 days and contains 
12 features (U2,Rs,RHmin,RHmax,Tmin,Tmax,ETo,SWC, NDVI, NDWI, DOY, 

The  available  database  includes  weather  data  recorded  by  the 
weather station from January 2018 to November 2021, as well as the 
micro-meteorological data acquired by the EC tower from March 2019 
to  November  2021,  in  both  cases  registered  at  sub-hourly  time-steps. 
The  former  dataset  was  used  to  estimate  ETo,  by  Eq.  (3).  The  latter 
dataset  was  processed, using  a  specific  software  developed  by  Manca 
(2003),  excluding  all  the  records  acquired  in  days  where  the  rainfall 
height was higher than 2.5 mm. The suitability of the records acquired 
by  the  EC  tower  was  assessed  based  on  the  energy  balance  closure

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it is not explicitly mentioned what data format is used in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer that the data might be in a structured format like CSV since the dataset contains numerical values such as weather data and micro-meteorological data. Additionally, the dataset is used to estimate ETo using Eq. (3), which suggests that the data is likely in a numeric format suitable for mathematical calculations. Therefore, it can be assumed that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is most likely CSV or another similar structured format.
