2.2. Data and platforms 

The initial LULC classification was done using Google Earth Engine 
(GEE),  a  cloud  processing  platform  which  provides  a  public  catalog 
containing  petabytes  of  satellite  imagery  and  geospatial  datasets, 
allowing for high performance and rapid planetary scale processing and 
analysis  of  images.  The  platform  allows  for  access,  selection,  and

processing of satellite images in seconds to minutes, compared to hours 
it would take using other conventional non-cloud databases (Gorelick 
et al., 2017).

The model’s flexibility also allows it to be deconstructed for urban 
reclassification  through  its  ability  to  reclassify  misclassified  pixels  in 
urban areas (improving the urban accuracy by 14 percentage points), 
although  this  would  require  some  additional  testing  and  tweaking  of 
parameters.  Additionally,  by  combining  cloud  processing  with  auto-
mated  reclassification,  the  speed  at  which  this  approach  can  classify 
mining is necessary for the future in regions where the scale of mining 
growth ensures that methods need to be not only highly accurate, but 
also easy to reproduce on a large scale.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, the paper titled "Mapping artisanal and small-scale mines at large scale from space with deep learning" by Couttenier et al. (2022) uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for their deep learning model. This information can be derived from the title itself, as it mentions the use of deep learning and specifically refers to mapping artisanal and small-scale mines, which aligns with the purpose of the Gallwey et al. (2020) paper mentioned earlier. However, without explicit confirmation from the text or abstract of the Couttenier et al. (2022) paper, we cannot be absolutely certain about the specific type of deep learning model used.
