2.2. Classification using deep learning models 

Plant  leaf  recognition  has  been  carried  out  using  deep  learning 
models for adaptability to handle many species or classes. Some of the 
investigations in these directions are as discussed.

leaf-based  plant  species  classification.  However,  medicinal  plants  are 
not the primary focus of this work, and also considered high-resolution 
images for classification tasks. In a recent study (Chulif et al., 2023), 
deep  learning  models  are  used  for  detecting  diseases  in  single  crop 
species by considering real-time field challenges during image acquisi-
tion.  In  a  different  work  (Barhate  et  al.,  2023),  VGG-16  and  dimen-
sionality reduction with ESPCA is adapted to classify thirty-two plant 
species  with  hyperparameter  tuned  and  batch  updated  stochastic 
gradient descent technique. Later, (Ganguly et al., 2022), utilized the 
ResNet-50  architecture  to  capture  the  leaf  feature  patterns  via  fusion 
learning  and  is  trained  on  three  benchmark  datasets  to  showcase  the 
effectiveness of the model. The aforementioned studies do not directly 
focus  on  the  classification  of  a  large  group  of  Indian  medicinal  plant

2022) conducted a study that proposed a Convolutional Neural Network 
model  to  identify  the  plant  species.  The  five  medicinal  plants  of  750 
image samples are collected using a box model that is subjected to initial 
preprocessing of resize, segmentation, and augmentation to increase the 
sample size. (Malik et al., 2022) proposed a deep learning-based method 
to automate plant species classification in the Borneo region. The chal-
lenges associated with real-time image acquisition conditions must be 
meticulously addressed to improve the accuracy of the real-time clas-
sification systems. In recognizing multiple disease varieties in a single 
crop,  a  few  significant  contributions  reported  include  deep  learning

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the given context is primarily for classification tasks. These models have been employed for various applications such as plant leaf recognition, identifying plant species, and detecting diseases in crops. For instance, one study uses deep learning models for detecting diseases in single crop species, while another adapts VGG-16 and dimensionality reduction with ESPCA to classify thirty-two plant species. Additionally, ResNet-50 architecture was utilized to capture leaf feature patterns via fusion learning and trained on three benchmark datasets. Another research focused on proposing a Convolutional Neural Network model to identify plant species among five medicinal plants. Furthermore, a deep learning-based method was suggested to automate plant species classification in the Borneo region. Overall, the main objective of these deep learning models is to accurately classify and recognize specific features within images related to plant leaves, species, and diseases.
