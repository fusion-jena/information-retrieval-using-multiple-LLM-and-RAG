Still, identifying how sampling efforts are distributed across space 
and time is a required step to interpret biodiversity patterns and reduce 
biases,  as  understanding  our  biota  distribution  is  critical  for  well- 
designed  protection  efforts.  This  may  be  achieved  through  different 
weighting  schemes  for  records  in  areas  with  sufficient  sampling  that 
provide  a  more  reliable  contribution  compared  to  underrepresented 
regions (Hortal et al., 2008; Phillips et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2013).

scales associated with data collection (Zizka et al., 2020). Due to these 
disparities,  scholars  recommend  a  thorough  examination  and  refine-
ment  of  these  data  repositories  (Bonnet-Lebrunm  et  al.,  2023).  To 
enhance the quality and reliability of the information, a comprehensive 
series  of  filters  has  been  systematically  applied  to  our  analysis.  To 
minimize errors associated with the public usage of GBIF and OBIS re-
positories,  we  curated  the  dataset  following  Zizka  et  al.  (2020)  and 
filtered the dataset by the columns labeled “scientific name”, “family”, 
“year”, “longitude” and “latitude”. We retained all taxonomic informa-
tion down to the species level and removed records with NA in these 
columns. We also removed all duplicate records with identical latitude

The  research  questions  addressed  in  this  study  were  essential  to 
understand  the  prevailing  data  collection  trends  and  to  lay  the 
groundwork  for  potential  corrective  measures  than  can  mitigate  the 
described biases. Our initial inquiry regarding fish body size does not 
imply a straightforward association between larger records and larger

Finally, we also analyzed the potential effect of some attributes on 
the  incidence  of  more  records  in  global  database  repositories.  Specif-
ically, we evaluated three research questions related to how body size, 
habitat depth, and commercial use relate to the representation of marine 
fish occurrences. We ask whether: (i) a better representation in online 
platforms may be due to the oversampling of larger fish, resulting from 
an easier identification; (ii) shallow areas provide easy access to sam-
pling; and (iii) economic and commercial interests have elicited a larger 
representation  of  culturally  relevant  species  in  online  biodiversity 
repositories.

Helpful Answer: The text provides insight into addressing data bias but does not explicitly mention specific techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling. However, it discusses several methods to improve the quality and reliability of the data. These include applying a series of filters to retain only relevant information, removing duplicates, and focusing on species-level taxonomic information. Additionally, the authors consider factors like body size, habitat depth, and commercial use to understand their impact on record representation in databases. While these approaches do not directly correspond to the mentioned techniques, they contribute to reducing bias by ensuring accurate and representative data.
