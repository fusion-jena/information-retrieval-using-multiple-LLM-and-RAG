The model was trained over 200 epochs using the Adam optimizer 
(cid:0) 5. The batch size 
(Kingma and Ba, 2015), with a weight decay of 1 × 10
was fixed at 16, and the loss function was updated as per Eq. (6). The 
learning rate was initially set at 0.001 and was subsequently reduced by 
a  factor  of  0.1  in  a  step-wise  manner  whenever  the  validation  loss 
remained  constant  for  five  epochs.  The  minimum  learning  rate  was 
(cid:0) 5. The hyper-parameter λ in Eq. (4) was set to 0.8, 
established at 1 × 10
Mk  in Eq. (5) was defined as 2k+1(k = 1, 2, …K), and β in Eq. (6) was set 
to 0.4.

The  model’s  performance  was  assessed  using  the  mean  reciprocal 
rank  (MRR),  accuracy  (ACC),  and  hierarchical  distance  of  a  mistake 
(HDM) as metrics. The MRR (Go¨eau et al., 2018), an official evaluation 
metric of the BirdCLEF2018 competition, was employed to assess pro-
cesses that generate a list of potential responses to a sample of queries 
which are ranked by their likelihood of correctness. Accuracy was used 
to determine the proportion of correctly classified items, and an average 
accuracy across all class hierarchies (avg_ACC) was calculated to eval-
uate the efficacy of the hierarchical classification. The HDM (Bertinetto 
et al., 2020) was used to quantify the degree of misclassification when 
only  a  single  class  could  be  predicted.  For  example,  misclassifying 
Garrulax canorus as  Leiothrix lutea may not incur the same penalty as 
misclassifying Garrulax canorus as Caprimulgus jotaka. The mean height

We denote the mean of training the hierarchical framework proposed 
by Wang et al., 2021 using our attention-based Xception backbone as 
“LHT+”,  where  LHT  stands  for  label  hierarchy  transformation.  This 
framework  uses  specific  classification  headings  at  different  levels  to 
distinguish features of varying levels. Finer-level features contribute to 
predicting coarser-level labels through a label hierarchy transformation 
matrix. Our path correction strategy was also incorporated. To ensure a 
fair  comparison,  we  avoided  data  augmentation  in  all  models  and 
maintained consistent hyper-parameters and random seed settings.

Subsequent  tests  involved  the  exclusion  of  hierarchical  attention 
(“w/o  HA”)  and  position  attention  (“w/o  PA”)  mechanisms  from  the 
main block. Table 9 shows that the removal of positional attention from 
the backbone network led to an average 1.5% decrease in classification 
accuracy across all levels. A similar trend was observed when attention 
was removed from the hierarchical modules, resulting in a more pro-
nounced performance drop. This implies that the strategic integration of 
various attention mechanisms within the model can enhance key feature 
extraction  and  improve  the  discriminability  of  different  feature 
categories. 

Finally,  the  effectiveness  of  the  proposed  path  correction  strategy 
was evaluated; the results are reported in Table 9. The omission of this 
step  (denoted  as  “w/o  path_corr”)  also  resulted  in  a  degradation  of

Helpful Answer:
After the model training, several postprocessing steps were mentioned or implied in the given context. These include:

1. Evaluation Metrics Calculation: The model's performance was assessed using various evaluation metrics such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Accuracy (ACC), Hierarchical Distance of a Mistake (HDM), and Average Accuracy across all class hierarchies (avg\_ACC). These metrics help evaluate the model's ability to accurately predict bird species based on audio recordings.
2. Path Correction Strategy: The text mentions incorporating a path correction strategy into the model. However, it does not provide details about what this strategy entails. It is likely a method to refine or adjust the model's predictions based on certain criteria or rules.
3. Exclusion of Attention Mechanisms: Subsequent tests involved removing hierarchical attention ("w/o HA") and position attention ("w/o PA") mechanisms from the main block. This process helps understand the impact of these components on the overall performance of the model.

However, there is no explicit mention of other common postprocessing techniques like saliency maps or confusion matrices in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot confirm if they were part of the postprocessing steps for this particular model.
