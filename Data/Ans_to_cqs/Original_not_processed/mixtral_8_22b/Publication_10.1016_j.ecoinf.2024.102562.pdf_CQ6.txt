include  flip, rotations  and  affine  transformation. We  then  trained the 
same dataset with ResNet-101 network with heavier augmentation for 
500 epochs. It is worth noting that the selection of image augmentations 
is  of  crucial  importance  to  improve  training  performance.  Multiply, 
linear  contrast,  sharpen,  emboss,  flip  in  horizontal  and  vertical  di-
rections,  rotations  and  affine  transformation  were  used  for  heavy 
augmentation.

bacterial  abundance  and  morphology  for  work  carried  out  on  micro-
fluidic platforms. Statistical data of distribution and morphology of live 
microbe in a soil-analogue environment gained from such methods is 
valuable  for  community  characterization  since  phenotypic  traits  of 
living organisms are as important as the commonly used cell biochem-
ical  constituents.  Enormous  efforts  have  been  done  to  promote  deep 
learning-based methods for researchers without coding expertise (Berg 
et al., 2019; G´omez-de Mariscal et al., 2021; In´es et al., 2019; Midtvedt 
et al., 2021; Ouyang et al., 2019; Sys et al., 2022; von Chamier et al., 
2021). Our work showcases that the approach works under significantly 
different conditions, allows quantifying bacterial populations, and de-
tects differences among bacterial communities from different locations.

3.2. Morphology 

The  deep  learning-based  image  analysis  can  instantly  extract 
morphology information such as cross-sectional area and axis length of 
single object. As shown in Fig. 5, a distinct discrepancy of size distri-
bution can be found between three locations. Both the Greenland and 
Swedish soils have a maximum abundance of bacterial cells at 2μm2. The 
Swedish soil has a larger fraction of bacteria with sizes less than 4μm2, 
whereas the Greenland soil/biocrust has a larger subpopulation of large 
bacteria of 4 μm2  to 6.5 μm2  and around 7 μm2  and generally a higher 
variation of cell sizes. In comparison, bacterial size in Kenya peaked at 
3 μm2  and  the  population’s  size  distribution  is  clearly  shifted  to  the 
larger sizes. Mean sizes over each population are 3.32 μm2, 2.50 μm2, and 
3.40 μm2  respectively.

The  deep  learning  model  was  tested  with  image  data  of  varying 
quality, obtained from soil chips inoculated from three contrasting soil/ 
soil-like inocula: a biocrust from Disko research station, Greenland; a 
moraine clay till from Lund, southern Sweden (Daniel et al., 2000); and a 
Lixic  Ferrasol  from  Nyabeda,  Siaya  County,  Western  Kenya  (Omuto, 
2013). All the image acquisition was carried out via optical microscopy 
either in lab or in situ without staining and labeling as a non-destructive 
and label free approach is required for minimal intervention. The images 
of samples from Sweden and Greenland were taken in the lab whereas 
the images of samples from Kenya were taken in situ. The samples from 
Greenland were collected during the summer of 2021 from biological 
soil  crusts  transported  to  Lund,  where  they  were  incubated  as  intact 
crust parts (1 x 5 cm2  dimensions, 1 cm height) on liquid malt-medium

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the authors employed various image augmentation techniques as part of their preprocessing steps before training their deep learning models. These techniques include multiplying, applying linear contrast, sharpening, embossing, flipping horizontally and vertically, rotating, and performing affine transformations. Image augmentation is a strategy that enables practitioners to significantly increase the diversity of data available for training models, without actually collecting new data. This technique helps prevent overfitting when training a deep learning model. However, the context does not provide specific details about other common preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, based solely on this context, we cannot definitively state whether these additional preprocessing steps were also applied.
