then be retrained, or used as-is, to detect the target species of interest. 
Training a CNN for acoustic detection is also becomingly increasingly 
more  accessible  as  researchers  develop  and  publish  their  models,  for

Our ARU DS model was slightly more complex, and consisted of four 
sub-models:  1)  detection  probability  as  a  function  of  peak  power,  2) 
peak power as a function of the distance between calls and ARUs, 3) the 
number of calls for each covey, and 4) the number of coveys. We used 
the linear relationship between peak power and distance (eq. 9) to first 
convert  peak  powers  obtained  from  our  CNN  to  distances  for  each 
detected  or  simulated  covey  call  j.  We  used  a  half  normal  detection 
function to estimate the scale parameter for the ARU data (σARU) and 
model  the probability  of detecting  each  call at  each  ARU using  these 
estimated  distances.  We  used  informative  priors  based  on  the  values 
from Wilhite et al. (2020) (mean, precision) for these parameters:: ao ~ 
Normal (76.45, 10), a1 ~ Normal ((cid:0) 0.147, 1e6), tauj  ~ Exponential (1/ 
5) where ∈j  = pow(tauj, (cid:0) 2) and σ ~ Normal (96, 10).

Nevertheless, an important consideration of the use of ARUs, which 
may limit their use in certain situations for density estimation, is how to 
effectively process the acoustic data collected (Gibb et al., 2019). Our 
custom  convolutional  neural  network  (CNN)  for  covey  call  detection 
proved  here  to  be  an  extremely  useful  tool  for  quick  processing  of 
acoustic data: a one hour .wav file can be processed for detections in 
approximately eight seconds (Nolan et al., 2022). However, the appli-
cation of ARUs to the surveys of other species may be limited by the 
available machine learning methods to process large quantities of data 
as efficiently. Nevertheless, CNNs in ecology are becoming increasingly 
more common, and models for the detection of many species, especially 
avian  species  (for  example  BirdNET  (Kahl  et  al.,  2021)  or  BirdCLEF 
models (Kahl et al., 2020)) are freely available for download. Models can

Recordings were analyzed using a previously developed CNN model 
(Nolan  et  al., 2022)  trained on covey call  spectrogram data collected 
separately to this study from Di-Lane and other sites around Georgia and 
Alabama,  USA.  Our  covey  call  acoustic  CNN  is  trained  to  detect  and 
localize all covey calls per ARU during the recording period and note 
their associated time and peak power (dB). We chose to use a relatively 
conservative  score  threshold  echoing  that  of  other  similar  studies 
ˇ
Sirovi´c, 2021; Ruff et al., 2020), where only calls that 
(Rasmussen and 
received a score of 0.95 or higher were officially classified as a positive 
bobwhite detection. All CNN detections at a 0.95 score threshold from a 
random sample of five one-hour files from each year were then manually 
reviewed to evaluate model accuracy and to calculate a false positive 
rate “i.e. how many calls were incorrectly labelled as bobwhite”. Across
