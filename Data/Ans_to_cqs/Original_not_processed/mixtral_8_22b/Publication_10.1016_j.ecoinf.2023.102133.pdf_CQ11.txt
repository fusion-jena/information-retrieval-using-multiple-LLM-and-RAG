Overall, the complete dataset has a length of 1430 days and contains 
12 features (U2,Rs,RHmin,RHmax,Tmin,Tmax,ETo,SWC, NDVI, NDWI, DOY, 

The  available  database  includes  weather  data  recorded  by  the 
weather station from January 2018 to November 2021, as well as the 
micro-meteorological data acquired by the EC tower from March 2019 
to  November  2021,  in  both  cases  registered  at  sub-hourly  time-steps. 
The  former  dataset  was  used  to  estimate  ETo,  by  Eq.  (3).  The  latter 
dataset  was  processed, using  a  specific  software  developed  by  Manca 
(2003),  excluding  all  the  records  acquired  in  days  where  the  rainfall 
height was higher than 2.5 mm. The suitability of the records acquired 
by  the  EC  tower  was  assessed  based  on  the  energy  balance  closure

In the case of the RF, the hyperparameters include the number of 
decision trees in the forest, the maximum depth of the decision tree, the 
number of features considered by each tree when splitting a node, etc. 
This  set  of  hyperparameters  was  tested  using  the  grid  configuration 
shown below:  

1.  Number of decision trees: from 100 to 1000 (in steps of 100);  
2.  Number of features to consider at every split (max features): auto,

sqrt, log2, None;  

3.  Maximum number of levels in decision tree: None, or from 10 to 100 

(in steps of 10);

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to provide the exact data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the study uses datasets of various sizes related to different types of land covers such as pasture grass, corn, soybeans, potatoes, grasslands, forests, open shrublands, barren vegetation, sawgrass, citrus orchards, and spontaneous flora. These datasets might have been collected from various sources, including weather stations, micro-meteorological data, and other relevant sources. It would be best to refer to the original research papers mentioned in the context, such as Mosre et al. (2021), Granata et al. (2020), Zhang et al. (2021), Wang et al. (2023), Izadifar et al. (2010), and Hao et al. (2022), to find more details about the data repositories used in their respective studies.
