Undocumented farm dams (i.e., false negatives, or omission error) underestimate
the real number of dams in Australia. We estimated the fraction of undocumented dams
in each State and Territory by conducting an independent exploration using our deep
learning CNN to analyse areas supposedly free of dams—following our compiled map
of Australian farm dams (see Table S1). Given that the probability of encountering a dam
by randomly sampling a site across the whole of Australia is very low, we maximised
our sampling efforts by selecting only land types with high dam densities. To do so,
we overlapped our compiled dataset of Australian dams with the 2016 Australian Land Use
and Management Classiﬁcation (version 8) [32] to identify the 33 land types with the highest
dam densities (>2 dams km−2) in Australia (see Figure S2 for the list of these land types).
Then, we randomly sampled locations in each State and Territory and downloaded RGB

Abstract: Farm dams are a ubiquitous limnological feature of agricultural landscapes worldwide.
While their primary function is to capture and store water, they also have disproportionally large
effects on biodiversity and biogeochemical cycling, with important relevance to several Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs). However, the abundance and distribution of farm dams is unknown
in most parts of the world. Therefore, we used artiﬁcial intelligence and remote sensing data to
address this critical global information gap. Speciﬁcally, we trained a deep learning convolutional
neural network (CNN) on high-deﬁnition satellite images to detect farm dams and carry out the
ﬁrst continental-scale assessment on density, distribution and historical trends. We found that in
Australia there are 1.765 million farm dams that occupy an area larger than Rhode Island (4678 km2)
and store over 20 times more water than Sydney Harbour (10,990 GL). The State of New South Wales

2.4. Statistical Analyses

We used Python [35] and fastai [30] for developing the deep learning CNN. We used
R [36] for all statistical analyses, using packages sf [37] and raster [38] for data manipulation;
ggplot2 [39], rasterVis [40] and cowplot [41] for plotting. We also used R for designing
the website AusDams.org, using Shiny [42], Leaﬂet [43], Plotly [44] and using Joe Cheng’s
Superzip template (https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/superzip-example.html).

3. Results
3.1. Reported Farm Dams

There were 1,694,675 farm dams reported by regional and Federal authorities in
Australia. The majority of farm dams were in New South Wales (37%), Victoria (26%),
Queensland (17%) and Western Australia (10%; Table S1). Around three-quarters of Aus-
tralia recorded at least one dam per 2000 km2, but the typical density near urban centres
was 2–5 farm dams per km2 (Figure 2). The average size of a dam was ca. 1000 m2, ranging
from 100 m2 to >105 m2 (Figure 3).

3.2. Data Veriﬁcation

It is increasingly more apparent that the accumulation of farm dams can have in-
tensifying effects on biodiversity [4,5], nutrient cycling [6], soil erosion [7], biological

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit details about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of Python and FastAI for developing the deep learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). In general, when working with deep learning models, techniques such as setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using deterministic algorithms where possible, and averaging results from multiple runs with different initializations can be employed to manage randomness. These methods help ensure consistent results and reduce variability due to random factors like initialization weights and training data order.
