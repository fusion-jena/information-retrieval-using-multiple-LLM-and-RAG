3.2. Random forest model 

According to the parameter optimization results of the random forest 
(RF)  model,  five  training  samples  were  analyzed,  whose  importance 
scores (VI) were obtained by simulation, and the selected variables were 
sorted according to their scores. The results are shown in Fig. 3, in which 
the VI plots for the five samples are consistent; the scores of the selected 
10 variables were more than 20% VI, and showed a threshold of 30% VI, 
above which the variables assumed higher importance (Fig. 3). In the 
training  and  test  datasets,  the  intermediate  models  established  by  RF 
showed that the proportion of explained variance was between 91% and 
92%  (Table  4).  Further,  the  correlation  coefficients  between  the

Helpful Answer:
I am sorry, but I cannot provide information on the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline based on the given context. However, some common data annotation techniques used in deep learning include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangles around objects of interest in images or videos. Semantic segmentation is the process of labeling each pixel in an image with its corresponding class or category. Instance segmentation combines both object detection and semantic segmentation to identify individual instances of objects within an image. These techniques help train machine learning algorithms to recognize patterns and features in large datasets.

Based on the provided context, it appears that the authors used a random forest model for analysis, but there is no mention of any specific data annotation techniques used in this study. Therefore, I do not have enough information to determine what data annotation techniques were used in this particular case.
