Future work will improve the usability of this method. Due to the
pretrained AST model being designed for human-perceivable sounds,
data must currently be downsampled to 16 kHz. This is a limitation
when analysing higher-frequency vocalisations and a common limita-
tion when using pretrained models developed for human-perceivable
hearing ranges. Future work will investigate techniques to extend this

We compare three classification models - ResNet-50 (He et al., 2016),
Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) (Gong et al., 2021) and HuBERT
(Hsu et al., 2021). The classification models compared in Section 4.1
were trained on a dataset containing 3000 5 s segments automatically
generated by the annotator. The dataset includes 1130 possum vocal-
isations and 1870 noise sources. The dataset has an 80/20% training-
validation split which is used to evaluate model performance during
training. Model hyperparameters are implemented based on the
recommendation outlined by the model authors. Each segment has been
manually reviewed by a human. 500 segments are separated into a test
set containing 187 possum vocalisations and 313 noise samples. The
distribution of target features to non-target features is representative of
the true distribution post-segmentation. Both validation and test dataset
performance are reported. Using the test dataset we evaluate the model

samples (red line) compared to randomly ordered samples, no active
learning (blue line), and active learning using high-certainty samples
(yellow line). The baseline accuracy is calculated using a 2-shot, 2-way
test accuracy without fine-tuning (81.4%). The AST feature extraction
model is fine-tuned on a subset of 500 training samples. Model perfor-
mance is re-evaluated on the test set at 10 sample increments using each
of the three sample orderings. Low certainty refers to queries with a
similar Euclidean distance to prototypical embeddings and therefore lie
along decision boundaries. For high-certainty samples, the order is
reversed with query embedding in close proximity to prototypical em-
beddings being prioritised for model fine-tuning.

single-channel images. We evaluate a commonly applied pre-trained
ResNet-50 architecture (He et al., 2016). Dufourq et al. (Dufourq
et al., 2022) also demonstrates strong classification performance and
low data requirements of ResNet-50 when comparing alternative pre-
trained CNN-based models. With the rapid development of transformer-
based models we also evaluate two transformer models Audio Spectro-
gram Transformer (AST) (Gong et al., 2021) which, like ResNet, oper-
ates on the spectrogram. We also evaluate HuBERT (Hsu et al., 2021)
which operates directly on the 1-D waveform. We evaluate the models
using the same feature extractor fθ and user model Uϕ pipeline presented
in Fig. 1 using a two-class binary output. Hence Uϕ is a two layer {100,2}
fully connected network.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning before training the deep learning models. However, it mentions that the audio data needs to be converted into a format suitable for input into these models. Specifically, the audio signals are transformed into single-channel images, either as spectrograms or MFCC representations. These visualizations allow the models to process the audio data more effectively. Additionally, the text indicates that the data must be downsampled to 16 kHz due to limitations in the pretrained AST model, which was originally designed for human-perceivable sounds.
