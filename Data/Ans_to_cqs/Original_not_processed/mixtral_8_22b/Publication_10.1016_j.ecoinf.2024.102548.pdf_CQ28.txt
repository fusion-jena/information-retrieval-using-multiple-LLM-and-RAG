like MobileNet.

Furthermore,  the  proposed  study  offers  significant  ecological  in-
sights, particularly in the context of okra cultivation. Traditionally, the 
detection  of  YVMV  has  relied  on  visual  inspection  and  symptomatic 
analysis  (Venkataravanappa  et  al.,  2011),  methods  that  are  time- 
consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to inaccuracies. In contrast, the 
deep learning approach, exemplified by the proposed hybrid MobileNet 
and GRU model, offers a superior alternative. The proposed model re-
duces  the  need  for  physical  infrastructure  and  specialized  expertise, 
lowering the barriers to adoption for farmers, especially in regions with 
limited resources.
