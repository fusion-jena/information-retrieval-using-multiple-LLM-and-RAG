The model is constructed using the EfficientNet B0 network (Tan and 
Le, 2019) which had been trained for generic image classification. The 
EfficientNet feature extraction layers are frozen (transfer learning) with 
only the weights of the final dense classification layers updated during 
training.  Training  was  conducted  within  the  Google  Collaboratory 
‘Colab’  platform  (Bisong,  2019),  using  the  Tesla  K80  GPU,  accessed 
through  cloud  computing.  An  Adam  optimizer  was  used  to  control 
gradient descent during training (Kingma and Ba, 2014), with parame-
ters set to: learning rate of 0.001, decay factor of 0.75 and a step size of

(Fig.  1),  considering  its  performance  in  the  new  environment  with 
limited re-training. Starting with a pre-trained model (EfficientNet B0, 
Tan and Le, 2019), we freeze the networks original feature extractor. We 
then train fully connected layers, which operate on the output of the 
EfficientNet  B0  network,  to  classify  the  PAM  data  frames  into  the 
specified sound source classes. Audio data is input to the network in a 
novel  spectrogram representation (White  et  al.,  2022). Networks  pre- 
trained on image data have been proven to perform well on classifica-
tion  tasks  using  spectrograms  as  image  input,  transformed  from  raw 
audio data (Allen et al., 2021; Shiu et al., 2020; Stowell, 2022). In this 
work  we fine-tune the  parameters  of the fully connected layers  itera-
tively  on  small  batches  of  training  data  acquired  from  a  new  region. 
Through  an  experimental  approach  to  retraining  we  demonstrate  the

2.2. Model fine-tuning 

To  fine-tune  the  base  model  with  Gulf  of  Mexico  data  the  feature 
extractor remains frozen. Models are trained with the same parameters 
as the base model but we use a cyclical learning rate of 0.0004 and is set 
to run for 50 epochs, with early stopping set to deploy if the validation 
loss does not improve within 10 epochs. A dropout rate of 0.2 is used 
during  fine-tuning,  and  DropConnect  is  employed.  Drop  out  layers 
randomly  discard  the  output  of  the  hidden  nodes  during  training, 
DropConnect randomly discards the input of the hidden layer (Sun et al., 
2022).

model  training  set  (Klinck  et  al.,  2020).  We  found  that  through  fine- 
tuning  with  500  frames  of  ambient  noise  we  can  achieve  similar  re-
sults across all classes as when the model is trained on batches of each 
class. Performance metrics indicate that by using ambient noise data to 
fine-tune the base model we optimise the learned feature representation 
to the local environment, improving performance across all classes after 
only 50 frames per class (2.5 min of data).
