In addition, Luca Ciampi et al. proposed a model-independent deep 
learning-based modular counting pipeline for estimating the number of 
insects present in images of colour-changing sticky traps and performing 
detailed  analysis  of  counting  metrics  (Ciampi  et  al.,  2023),  which  is 
worthy of recognition. However, when using this method, it still needs 
to be combined with other deep learning algorithms, so how to make the 
deep learning algorithm model balance speed, accuracy and lightweight 
performance at the same time is still a major challenge.

Use the provided pieces of context to answer the query in less than 400 words. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

%Query
Query: "Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information regarding the availability or location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context is not explicitly stated. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer about where the code repository can be found. It would be best to refer to the original research article by Luca Ciampi et al. or contact the authors directly for more specific details about the code repository.
