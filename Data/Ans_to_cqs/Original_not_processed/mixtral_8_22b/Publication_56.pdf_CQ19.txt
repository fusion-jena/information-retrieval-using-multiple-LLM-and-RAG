Recently, some approaches have been proposed to evaluate the interpretability of deep learning  models33,34 
including methods based on model decomposition, sensitivity analysis, and feature visualisation. The relevance of 
network inputs can for example be obtained by the gradient-based sensitivity analysis (GBSA), which computes 
the prediction function squared partial derivatives with a standard gradient  backpropagation35. The Layer-wise 
Relevance Propagation (LRP)36 propagates the prediction backward in the neural network using propagation 
rules until the input features are reached. Arras et al.37 proposed a LRP for LSTM networks that provided better 
results than the GBSA on a five-class prediction task. Class activation maps were used to point out the most 
discriminative regions used by a CNN to identify a  class38.

These analyses help to understand the behaviour of deep learning models in agricultural applications. In par-
ticular, in the CAP activities in which payments to farmers must be well-founded, the use of classification models 
providing explainable predictions are of great interest. The conducted work not only confirm well established 
knowledge in remote sensing science but also opens the door to new studies in the field of the comprehensibility 
of deep learning algorithms in agricultural and environmental applications.
