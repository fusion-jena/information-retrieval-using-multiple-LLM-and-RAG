As discussed in section 2.4.1, after transformation via the signature 
method, we obtained 1885 terms. The preselection of predictors that are 
used as inputs to an ML model can reduce computation time and the risk 
of overfitting (Chandrashekar and Sahin, 2014). Therefore, we have had

To  construct  the  LSTM  model,  we  used  KERAS  (version  2.9.0),  a 
Python  package,  and  scaled  the  data  using  “MinMaxScaler()”  in  the 
Python Scikit-Learn package to improve model performance. In partic-
ular, “MinMaxScaler()” usually scales the attributes to a specific range 
[0,1]; therefore, the smallest value was converted to 0 and the largest 
value was 1; thus, all attributes ranged between 0 and 1, which is useful 
for regression analysis. The LSTM models were built with one layer of 65

Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It only mentions that Python packages like Keras and Scikit-learn were used to build and scale the LSTM model. However, it does not specify where or how this model was deployed.
