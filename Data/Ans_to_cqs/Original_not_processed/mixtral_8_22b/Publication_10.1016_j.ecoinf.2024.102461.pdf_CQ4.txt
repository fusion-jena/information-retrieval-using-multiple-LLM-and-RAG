into four classes with different susceptibility classes, namely low, me-
dium,  high,  and  extreme,  using  Jenks'  natural  break  classification 
method  in  ArcGIS  10.6.  The  Jenks  Natural  Breaks  categorization  (or 
optimization) system is a data categorization methodology that aims to 
maximize  the  organization  of  a  given  set  of  values  into  distinct  and 
meaningful classes. A natural class refers to the class range considered 
the  most  ideal  and  is  observed  to  occur  “naturally”  within  a  given 
dataset. A class interval consists of elements exhibiting comparable at-
tributes, constituting an inherent grouping within a given dataset. The 
approach  employed  in  this  study  is  to  minimize  the  variance  within 
classes  while  simultaneously  maximizing  the  variance  across  types 
(Jenks, 1967; Liu and Duan, 2018). Numerous studies have employed 
natural break (Jenks) and quantile approaches to classify fire risk maps
