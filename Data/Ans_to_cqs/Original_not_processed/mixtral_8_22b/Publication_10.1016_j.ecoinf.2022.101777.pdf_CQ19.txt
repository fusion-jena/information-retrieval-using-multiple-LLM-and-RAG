For  the  simulations  the  infiltration  capacity  was  quantified  in  a 
parameter  derived  by  the  Soil  Conservation  Service  (SCS)  called  CN. 
This parameter determines the runoff over an area based on soil type, 
soil cover and the hydrological group of the soil (Cronshey, 1986). The 
figure calculated for sub-basin 1 is 80.1, for sub-basin 2 it is 78.5, for 
sub-basin 3 it is 77.3, for sub-basin 4 it is 74.0, for sub-basin 5 it is 76.1 
and for sub-basin 6 it is 81.0. To better assess the possible effects of using 
NBS,  four  hypothetical  scenarios  were  chosen.  These  scenarios  were 
based on changing the land use from agriculture to forestry. According 
to  PerpiËœna  Castillo  et  al.  (2020),  Galicia  has  one  of  with  the  highest 
percentages of abandoned agricultural land of any region in Spain, with

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about which specific frameworks are used to build the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot determine whether they used TensorFlow, PyTorch, or another framework.
