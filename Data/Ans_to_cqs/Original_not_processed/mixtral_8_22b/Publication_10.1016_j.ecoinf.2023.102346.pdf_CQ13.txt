Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

The prediction power with machine learning algorithms was tested 
with the package “sdm”  (Naimi and Araújo, 2016), “dismo”  (Hijmans 
et al., 2015), “bioclim” (Booth et al., 2014), and the ensemble modeling 
approach  implemented  in  “biomod2”  (Thuiller  et  al.,  2009;  2014). 
Model mean performances for AUC, ROC, TSS, KAPPA, and COR values 
were extracted using “shiny” packages (Chang et al., 2023) in RStudio 
(RStudio Team, 2020).

2.6. Model selection 

Since  performance,  accuracy,  key  parameters,  and  sensitivity  for 
prediction vary depending on which method that is used (Diniz-Filho 
et al., 2009; Elith et al., 2006; Qiao et al., 2015), we tested eight different 
machine  learning  algorithms  to  generate  our  predictive  models.  The 
included  algorithms  were:  Generalized  Linear  Model  (GLM),  Support 
Vector  Machine  (SVM),  Multivariate  Adaptive  Regression  Spline 
(MARS),  Random  Forest  (RF),  Flexible  Discriminant  Analysis  (FDA), 
Classification  and  Regression  Trees  (CART),  Generalized  Boosting 
regression Model (GBM) and Maximum-Entropy learning (MAXENT) for 
habitat suitability prediction (Table S5).

importance,  and  regularized  training  gain  for  each  variable.  Here,  a 
variable  with  highest  regularized  training  gain  is  indicating  that  this 
variable  has  the  most  useful  information  on  its  own  when  used  in 
isolation. Model sensitivity and accuracy for habitat suitability were also 
checked  with  the  AUC  values.  Graphical  representation  of  MAXENT 
models were produced in QGIS Desktop v 3.24.2 (QGIS Development 
Team, 2022).

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no mention of any specific hyperparameters used in a deep learning model within the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information based on the available text. Please provide more details or additional context if possible.

Based on the provided context, it appears that the authors have focused on testing various machine learning algorithms for their predictive models rather than employing deep learning techniques. They mentioned using several machine learning algorithms such as Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS), Random Forest (RF), Flexible Discriminant Analysis (FDA), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Generalized Boosting regression Model (GBM), and Maximum-Entropy learning (MAXENT). However, none of these explicitly refer to deep learning models, nor do they discuss any hyperparameters related to them.
