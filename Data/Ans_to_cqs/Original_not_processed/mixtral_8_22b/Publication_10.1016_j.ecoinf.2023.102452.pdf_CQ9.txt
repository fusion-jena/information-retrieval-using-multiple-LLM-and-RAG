The  accurate  forecasting  of  streamflow  also  has  implications  for 
water  security  in  the  area.  By  providing  reliable  predictions  of  water 
availability  up  to  12  months  in  advance,  decision-makers  can  make 
informed  plans  for  water  allocation,  including  ecological  needs  and 
irrigation  usages.  This  knowledge  enables  the  optimization  of  water 
resources, minimizing the risk of water scarcity and ensuring sustainable 
water  management  practices.  Adequate  water  supply  supports  the 
maintenance of healthy ecosystems, contributing to the conservation of

specified number of iterations. For this study, the Eureka Pro software is 
utilized for GP modeling. This software was developed by Cornell Uni-
versity’s Data Science Order and was released in 2009 (Eureqa, 2009). It 
is crucial to emphasize that GP serves multiple roles in this paper. Once 
GP is employed as the forecasting model, we extract the inputs utilized 
in  the  optimal  GP  tree  and  utilize  them  as  the  optimal  inputs  for 
modeling  with  ANN.  The  primary  reason  for  selecting  GP  as  our  IVS 
technique is its ability to simultaneously select appropriate features and 
perform modeling tasks (Althoey et al., 2023; Hu, 2023).
