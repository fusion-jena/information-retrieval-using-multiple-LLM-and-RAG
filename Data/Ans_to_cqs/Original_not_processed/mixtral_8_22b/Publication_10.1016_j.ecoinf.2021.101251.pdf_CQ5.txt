Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

enables advanced search of data across the data packages in ESS-DIVE 
and  retrieval  of  the  specific  data  found  through  the  user’s  search 
query. The projects listed below are funded under the ESS program, and 
are required to submit data to ESS-DIVE for long-term stewardship.

The most significant challenge in implementing data collections is 
ensuring that the datasets included in a collection receive appropriate 
credit for papers citing the collection (primary  rather than secondary 
citations). Ideally, paper(s) citing the collection should also propagate to 
the citation counts of underlying datasets. There is little or no support 
for data collection creation and usage in the current data repository and 
publisher infrastructure. Other challenges involve deciding authorship 
for a data collection (the collection creators, the authors of the under-
lying  datasets,  both,  or  nobody),  and  ensuring  that  usage  licenses  of 
underlying datasets allow that they be compiled into a collection (e.g. 
compliance with dataset attribution requirements). Potential solutions 
to  the  issue  of  collection  authorship  may  include  implementing  the 
CRediT  (https://casrai.org/credit/)  roles  for  authors  involved  in

Projects like AmeriFlux, WFSFA, and NGEE-Tropics each have many 
different  teams  working  in  the  field  and  producing  large  numbers  of 
high-quality,  multi-disciplinary  data  packages.  Integrating  these 
together as one product can only be achieved if the data usage policies 
are compatible and the data producers can receive appropriate credit for 
their data. For example, when individual network datasets are included 
in the FLUXNET dataset they will be released under a FLUXNET data 
usage policy, the agreed data usage policy is a factor determining which 
regional datasets will be able to be included. When the FLUXNET data 
usage policy is incompatible with the network policy, often data can’t be 
included.  In  cases  where  the  data  are  considered  high-value  the  data 
producers are reluctant to lose the direct credit to their data. In addition, 
new data versions are uploaded regularly due to collection of new data,

important component of the data publication process is specification of 
data usage rights/license by the authors. In this paper, we will refer to a 
published dataset as a data package. A data package contains one or more 
data files and the associated metadata needed to find, interpret, and use 
the data.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it does not provide information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the context discusses the implementation of data collections within the ESS-DIVE project, focusing on the challenges faced during this process. These challenges include ensuring proper citations for datasets, managing authorship for data collections, and dealing with licensing issues related to compiling datasets from various sources. Projects mentioned in the context, such as AmeriFlux, WFSFA, and NGEE-Tropics, contribute to the generation of high-quality, multidisciplinary data packages. However, there is no mention of any specific datasets used in deep learning pipelines.
