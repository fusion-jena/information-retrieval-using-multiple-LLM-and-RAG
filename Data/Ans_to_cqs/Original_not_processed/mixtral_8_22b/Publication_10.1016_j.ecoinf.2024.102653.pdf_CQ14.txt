Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

2.4. Model training and hyperparameters 

The  model’s  weights  were  randomly  initialized  using  a  specific 
integer seed to guarantee consistent reproducibility of results. Further-
more, meticulous manual tuning of hyperparameters was conducted to 
achieve  optimal  model  performance.  The  selected  hyperparameters, 
which yielded the best performance metrics, are presented in Table 1. 

2.5. Model validation 

Two distinct validation methodologies were implemented. The first 
method  involved  partitioning  the dataset into  training and  validation 
sets, with 70% of the data designated for training and 30% for valida-
tion.  This  division  was  performed  through  random  selection  (Dobbin 
and Simon, 2011).

2.6. Performance metrics 

Conventional  metrics  were  used  to  evaluate  the  model’s  perfor-
mance, such as confusion matrices, accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, 
Cohen  Kappa,  and  the  area under  the  ROC curve,  some of  which  are 
defined below (Johnson and Khoshgoftaar, 2019).

Fig. 5. Accuracy of models trained with a maximum of 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 records per bee.  

Fig. 6 shows the confusion matrices for the model predictions using 
all datasets combined, which demonstrates an increased performance of 
the model when larger subsets are used (25 daily records per subset). 
Correct predictions are shown on the main diagonal.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
According to the given information, it is not explicitly mentioned how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, whether by using methods like grid search or random search. However, it does state that "meticulous manual tuning of hyperparameters was conducted" to achieve optimal model performance. Therefore, it can be inferred that the optimization process might have been carried out manually rather than employing automated techniques like grid search or random search.
