Machine-learning models have been democratized in environmental 
science  over  the  past  few  years.  Several  ML-based  models  can  be 
grouped  based  on  their  architecture.  The  topic  of  neural  networks  is 
addressed in the following section. In this section, we focus on a model 
based on a tree structure. The RF model, which is based on tree struc-
ture, has been frequently used for ENSO (Gibson et al., 2021; Pal et al., 
2020). We compared its performance in forecasting ENSO with that of 
the  Lasso  model. The RF  models are  often  associated  with “ensemble 
learning,”  which is derived from the aggregation of tree structures or 
trees created during the learning phase RF models. Notably, the number 
of trees was defined downstream, and all our models were composed of 
200 trees.

using  the  PDP  (see  Section  3.2).  As  discussed  above,  the  size  of  the 
database can have a significant impact on the accuracy of the model. 
Moreover, there appears to be a strong correlation between ENSO cycles 
and  the  proxy  of  the  phytoplankton  biomass  (Park  et  al.,  2018;  Tian 
et  al.,  2021).  Hence, in  future  studies,  these  tests  should  be  repeated 
with  larger  datasets  and/or  with  relevant  biological  data  to  assess 
whether the Lasso model coupled with the signature method still out-
performs the ML models under these conditions.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It discusses various aspects related to machine learning models, such as Random Forest (RF) models, Lasso models, and their applications in environmental science, particularly in forecasting ENSO (El Niño Southern Oscillation). However, it does not mention any specific details regarding the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to this query based on the given context.
