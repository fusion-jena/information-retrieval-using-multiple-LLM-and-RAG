As VGG16 performed the best among the three deep learning algorithms, we employed the
VGG16 network at 140,000 iterations as the classiﬁcation model for tree species prediction accordingly.
All the clipped image patches of the individual trees in the three parts were fed into the trained
VGG16 network at 140,000 iterations for classiﬁcation, the results were obtained, and the tree species
distribution across the three parts is shown in Table 3. This is in line with reality: Area A has a large
proportion of banyan and silk ﬂoss trees, Area B has a large amount of Ceiba speciose, and Area C has
a large amount of longan. Overall, the proportion of all kinds of tree species in Areas A and B is
relatively balanced, while there is an obvious dominant tree species in Area C.

In their review, Ma et al. [26] showed that nearly 200 publications using deep convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) have been published in the ﬁeld of remote sensing by early 2019 of which most
focused on land use land cover (LULC) classiﬁcation [28], urban feature extraction [29–31], and
crop detection [32,33]. Deep learning approaches often require a large amount of training data, and
there are benchmark datasets publicly available for training and testing of deep learning approaches
in the abovementioned remote sensing ﬁelds. Compared with the studies mentioned above, very
few studies using deep learning have focused on trees or forest classiﬁcation [34]. Flood et al. [35]
used a U-net convolutional neural network to extract woody vegetation extent from high-resolution
three-band Earth-I imagery. In their research, a selection of 1 km2 was manually labeled for training.
The ﬁnal results were pixel-wise and only two types (trees and large shrubs) were mapped. If there are

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as the train, test, and validation sets. However, it can be assumed that common practices were followed, such as randomly splitting the dataset into these subsets, typically with around 70-80% of the data allocated for training, 10-15% for validation, and 10-15% for testing. These percentages may vary depending on the size of the dataset and other factors. It would be necessary to refer to additional sources or documentation related to this study to obtain more precise details regarding the data splitting process.
