The root trimmed mean squared prediction error (RTMSPE) is uti-
lized to select the appropriate values for the tuning parameters τ and ϕ, 
removing  the  impact  of  heterogeneous  observations.  The  RTMSPE  is

where species are observed outside of their suitable habitats, such as in 
cultivation or captivity contexts (Botella et al., 2018). These scenarios 
are  common  issues  in  crowdsourcing  data  analysis.  To  remove  such 
heterogeneous  observations,  the  time-consuming  manual  checking  by 
experts  is  required  (Belbin  et  al.,  2013;  Mesibov,  2013).  If  such  pro-
cedure is not fully executed, our proposed method is expected to miti-
gate  the  impact  of  heterogeneous  observations  and  achieve  better 
predictions than ordinary methods.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the authors utilized a technique called Root Trimmed Mean Squared Prediction Error (RTMSPE) to improve the generalizability of their deep learning model. This approach helps in selecting appropriate values for tuning parameters, thereby reducing the impact of heterogeneous observations. By using this method, the authors aimed to minimize the effect of outliers and extreme observations, which can negatively affect the performance of machine learning models. However, the context does not explicitly mention other commonly used techniques like diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Therefore, based solely on the provided information, we cannot confirm if these specific methods were employed to enhance the generalizability of the deep learning model.
