The  model  initially  included  all  variables,  acknowledging  the  sig-
nificance  of  identifying  and  selecting  pertinent  variables  for  model 
development. Variable importance measures were employed to evaluate 
their significance, which helped identify the most influential variables 
for  predicting  AGB.  However,  it  is  recognised  that  assessing  model 
performance is essential, particularly when dealing with less important 
variables. A stratified sampling method was applied to all AGB obser-
vations for this evaluation. This technique randomly allocated 70% of 
the samples to the training dataset and the remaining 30% to the vali-
dation  dataset.  Three  error  statistics,  specifically  R2,  mean  absolute 
error  (MAE),  and  RMSE  (as  indicated  in  Eqs.  8,  9,  and  10),  were 
employed to compare the accuracies of the models. The generated ma-
chine learning models were then extrapolated for the entire region. This

The  variation  in  model  prediction,  which  signifies  the  prediction 
uncertainty, was quantified using the coefficient of variation expressed 
as a percentage. This uncertainty measurement incorporated the error 
propagated  from  the  field  data,  as  per  the  methodology  outlined  by 
Vorster et al. (2020).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Three error statistics are used to evaluate the performance of the machine learning models: R^2, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). These metrics help compare the accuracy of the models. The MAE is calculated using the formula shown in equation 12, where n represents the total number of observations, y_i denotes the actual values, and ^y_i indicates the predicted values.
