3.2. Performance of the models and forecast distribution 

The  mean  accuracies  and  standard  deviations  of  the  5  × 10-fold 
cross-validations  for  each  method  and  species  are  shown  in  Table  4. 
Random Forest is the method that achieves the highest accuracy for all 
the analysed species (0.718 for SKJ, 0.728 for YFT, 0.589 for BET and 
0.842 for FAL). Consequently, this is the method that has been used to 
build the prediction models. 

A  model  has  been  trained  for  each  species,  by  using  the  selected 
variables in Table 3. Then, for each model, the probabilities of finding 
high and low catches and absences of each species in the study area have 
been predicted by using the corresponding predictors given in Table 3. 
The results of the validation of the trained models are shown in Table 5,

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, a diverse dataset was utilized, which included various environmental variables such as temperature, salinity, chlorophyll concentration, sea level anomaly, thermocline intensity, surface oxygen concentration, silicate levels, and more. This diversity in the dataset helped capture different aspects of the environment that could influence tuna catch rates. Secondly, a 5 x 10-fold cross-validation technique was employed during the training phase of the model. Cross-validation is a powerful preventive measure against overfitting, where the model learns the noise in the training data instead of the underlying pattern. By repeatedly partitioning the original sample into a training set to train the model and a test set to evaluate it, cross-validation provides a robust estimate of how well the model will perform on unseen data. Lastly, stratified sampling was likely applied when dividing the dataset into folds for cross-validation. Stratification ensures that each fold is a good representative of the whole dataset, maintaining the same proportions of classes or categories within each fold. These measures combined contribute to building a reliable and accurate deep learning model capable of making predictions about high and low tuna catches and absences in the study area.
