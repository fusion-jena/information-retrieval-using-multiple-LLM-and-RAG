adjusted to optimize the model (Jafarzadeh et al., 2021). Whereas node- 
size  determines  the  smallest  number  of  observations  in  a  tree  subset 
terminal node, and default value is always at 1 (Jafarzadeh et al., 2021; 
Pham et al., 2018). Gradient boosting iteration is a repetition process of 
increasing  or  decreasing  weights  in  a  training  datasets  (Huang  et  al., 
2022). All hyperparameters were tuned with a grid search method. 

2.5.1. Artificial neural networks

Artificial  Neural  Network  (ANN)  algorithms  simulate  human 
learning by establishing and strengthening connections between input 
and  output  data  (Campesato,  2020).  These  connections  enable  data 
linkage without the need for training data (Shen et al., 2021). Notable 
ANN algorithms include Radial Basis Function, Elman Recurrent, and 
Hopfield Neural Networks (Campesato, 2020; Domingues et al., 2020). 
However,  Multilayer  Perceptron  Neural  Networks  (MLPNNs)  using 
backpropagation  have  gained  popularity  and  were  employed  in  this 
study (Günlü and Ercanlı, 2020; Wang and Xing, 2008). MLPNNs consist 
of  input,  hidden,  and  output  layers,  each  with  interconnected  nodes 
(neurons) that transform input into output data (Wang et al., 2017). In 
this study, the input layer had 23 neurons, correlating with predictors. 
The  hidden  layer's  neuron  count  was  determined  using  training  and

During  the  MLPNN  training  phase,  initial  arbitrary  connection 
weights were assigned. Inputs were forward-fed from the input to the 
hidden  layer.  Hidden  neurons  multiplied  inputs  by  weights,  summed 
products,  and  processed  sums  through  a  transfer  function.  Results 
propagated  to  the  output  layer,  with  output  values  compared  to  ex-
pected  values  for  error  computation.  Iterative  error  back-propagation 
adjusted  connection  weights  until  reaching  a  target  minimal  error. 
The network then accurately estimated carbon stocks for both training 
and new input data without training data. This required tests to deter-
mine optimal learning rate (0.01), momentum (0.18), and training it-
erations  (500).  The  trained  network  was  subsequently  used  for  feed- 
forward predictions on continuous spatial data.

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, there isn't any specific information about data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, we can discuss some general aspects related to artificial neural networks (ANNs) and their use in this study.

In this research, the authors utilized Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Networks (MLPNNs) with backpropagation for estimating carbon stocks. The MLPNN consists of three types of layers - input, hidden, and output layers. Each layer has interconnected nodes called neurons which help in transforming input data into output data.

For this particular study, the input layer contained 23 neurons corresponding to the predictors. During the training phase, initial arbitrary connection weights were assigned, and inputs were fed forward from the input layer to the hidden layer. The hidden neurons multiplied inputs by weights, summed products, and passed them through a transfer function. The results propagated to the output layer, where output values were compared to expected values for error computation.

Iterative error backpropagation adjusted connection weights until achieving a minimum target error. Afterward, the trained network could estimate carbon stocks for both training and new input data without requiring additional training data. To determine the optimal learning rate, momentum, and training iterations, several tests were conducted.

Although not directly mentioned in the context, data annotation techniques like bounding box annotation and instance segmentation play crucial roles in other deep learning applications. Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects within images to identify their location and size. Instance segmentation goes one step further by labeling individual pixels belonging to distinct instances of objects within an image. Both these techniques aid in creating labeled datasets essential for training deep learning models effectively.
