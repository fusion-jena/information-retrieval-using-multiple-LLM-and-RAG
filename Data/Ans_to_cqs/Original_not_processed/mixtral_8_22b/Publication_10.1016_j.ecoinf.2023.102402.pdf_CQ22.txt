2.4. Model validation 

The model's performance was  evaluated using the Area Under the 
receiver-operator  Curve  (AUC).  The  AUC  values  range  from  0  to  1, 
where values closer to 1 indicate a higher accuracy of model prediction 
(Fielding and Bell, 1997). In addition to the AUC, the True Skill Statistics 
(TSS) was calculated. TSS values range between (cid:0) 1 and + 1. A TSS value 
of +1 means complete agreement between observed and predicted dis-
tributions, whereas values of ≤0 denote no better than random perfor-
mance  (Allouche  et  al.,  2006).  AUC  and  TSS  are  the  methods  most 
commonly used to assess the model performance in species distribution 
model studies (e.g., Gaier and Resasco, 2023; Mondanaro et al., 2023; 
Song and Estes, 2023).

et  al., 2014). Further details on how to  get our  presence data can be 
found in the Data Availability section. The questionnaire included also 
details  on  sightingh  sites  such  as  habitat  features  and  number  of 
encountered  specimens,  and  percentages  on  the  total  number  of  re-
sponses were computed for each of these values.

goodness-of-fit and complexity. The model with the lowest AICc value (i. 
e. ΔAICc = 0) is considered the best model out of the current suite of 
models;  all  models  with  ΔAICc  <2  are  generally  considered  to  have 
substantial  support  (Muscarella  et  al.,  2014).  The  model  parameter 
settings with the lowest AICc values (ΔAICc = 0) for both H. guttulatus 
and H. hippocampus were chosen to establish the final Maxent models 
(ENMeval outputs in supplementary materials, Appendix 2).

Helpful Answer:

The performance of the deep learning model was evaluated using two main metrics: the Area Under the receiver-operator Curve (AUC) and the True Skill Statistics (TSS). The AUC values range from 0 to 1, where values closer to 1 indicate a higher accuracy of model prediction. On the other hand, the TSS values range between -1 and +1. A TSS value of +1 means complete agreement between observed and predicted distributions, whereas values of ≤0 denote no better than random performance. These two metrics are commonly used to assess the model performance in species distribution model studies. Additionally, the Akaike Information Criterion corrected for small sample sizes (AICc) was used to select the best model among different candidate models based on goodness-of-fit and complexity. The model with the lowest AICc value is considered the best model, while all models with ΔAICc <2 are generally considered to have substantial support.
