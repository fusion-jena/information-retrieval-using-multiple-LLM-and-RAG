We used a GoogLeNet architecture as it was the winner of the 2015
competition imageNet (Szegedy et al., 2015), an identiﬁcation chal-
lenge on 1000 diﬀerent classes. This CNN is composed of 22 layers. It
uses inception modules. Inception modules allow the network to use
convolutions of diﬀerent sizes (1*1, 3*3 and 5*5 pixels) and to weight
each of these convolutions. This network could thus account more or
less strongly for the context of each pixel, which increases the range of
possibilities to improve its performance during the training.

The model was trained using thumbnails of whole ﬁsh, part of ﬁsh species and
environment (T?). Raw outputs were post-processed applying two decision
rules: (r1) keeping most likely ﬁsh class if “environment” was the most likely
class, and (r2) considering “part of species X" equivalent to “species X".

A link to a depository with architecture details is given at the end of
references. We stopped the network training after 70 epochs (i.e. a
complete scope of the dataset where each image is used only once), to
−5, an exponential
prevent overﬁtting. We used a learning rate of 10
learning decay with a Gamma of 0.95, a dropout of 50% and an Adam
Solver type as learning parameters. Those are classic hyper-parameters
for a fast convergence of the network without over-ﬁtting (Srivastava
et al., 2014). The weight initialization is also classic with a random
Gaussian initialization. The training lasted 8 days on our conﬁguration;
we trained and ran our code on a computer with 64GB of RAM, an i7
3.50GHz CPU and a Titan X GPU card for 900,000 images.

We used at least 2200 thumbnails per ﬁsh species class, and batches

Helpful Answer:

The study uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on the GoogLeNet architecture, which won the ImageNet competition in 2015. GoogLeNet is a complex neural network consisting of 22 layers and incorporating inception modules. These modules enable the network to utilize convolutions of different sizes (1x1, 3x3, and 5x5 pixels) and assign weights to each convolution. By doing so, the network can consider varying degrees of context around each pixel, thereby increasing the potential for improved performance during training.
