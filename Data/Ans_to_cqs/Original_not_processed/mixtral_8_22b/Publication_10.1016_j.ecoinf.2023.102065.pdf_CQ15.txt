LeBien et al., 2020; Ruff et al., 2021; Stowell et al., 2019; Zhong et al., 
2020). Tuning of the network hyperparameters and convolutional filters 
provides automated feature learning, thereby removing an obstacle of 
earlier  machine  learning  methods  (Gupta  et  al.,  2021).  Sound  data 
include frequency, amplitude and temporal information, and there are 
different  approaches  to  express  these  data  in  CNN  architectures.  One 
approach is to represent sound data as amplitude-time waveforms, then 
train  1-dimensional  neural  network  architectures,  such  as  Recurrent 
Neural Networks (RNNs) to identify distinct patterns (Sang et al., 2018; 
Weninger and Schuller, 2011; Zhang et al., 2021). Another approach is 
to  train  CNNs  to  classify  2D  image  spectrograms  (Kahl  et  al.,  2021; 
LeBien et al., 2020; Ruff et al., 2021; Stowell et al., 2019; Zhong et al., 
2020).  A  popular  extension  is  to  use  mel-spectrograms  from  human

to ResNet architectures (Table 2). We note that without selecting the 
best CNN-XC model per species, thus removing the influence of difficult 
species  on  statistics,  average  maximum  F0.5  was  the  same  for  all  ar-
chitectures (0.74). Thus, we conclude that MobileNetv2 could be useful 
for applications requiring smaller CNN architectures.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The papers mentioned do not explicitly discuss specific optimization techniques used in their deep learning pipelines, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, it can be assumed that some form of optimization technique would have been employed during training, given that they are essential components of any deep learning process. The choice of optimization algorithm depends on various factors like computational resources available, size of dataset, complexity of the problem etc. Without explicit mention of which optimization techniques were used, one cannot definitively state what was implemented in each case.
