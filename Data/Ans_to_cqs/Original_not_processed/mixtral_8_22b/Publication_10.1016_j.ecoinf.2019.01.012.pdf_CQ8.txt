the training data only.

Although the use of pre-trained models has proven to be advanta-
geous for many image recognition tasks (Weiss et al., 2016), we decided
to train the model from scratch. We recognized that our speciﬁc clas-
siﬁcation problem was too diﬀerent from the pre-trained networks.
Moreover, we considered the number of labeled samples available
(nearly 30,000 per class) as large enough for training our own network.

We trained the CNN using ReLU activation for the convolutional layers
and an exponential linear unit (ELU) activation on the fully connected
layer (Clevert et al., 2015). As optimizer we chose the adaptive ADAM
(Adaptive Moment Estimation) with a learning rate of lr = 0.0001.
Training was performed with a batch size of 256 over 16,290 iterations
(= 90 epochs).

CNNs are composed of three main components: convolutional

Fig. 4. Illustration of the CNN architecture and the classiﬁcation process. The network was trained with manually labeled samples with a tile size of 50 × 50 pixel.
The trained classiﬁer was then applied on whole repeat photographs, which were also split into 50 × 50 pixel tiles. The classiﬁer predicts the output for each single
tile and reassembles them to the original image size.
