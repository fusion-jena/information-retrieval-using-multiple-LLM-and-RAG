Model hyperparameters were tuned for each species-specific model 
using Bayesian optimization focused on reducing the root mean squared 
error (RMSE) of the predictions based on environmental cross-validation 
(Roberts et al., 2017) with ten folds, as implemented in the R package 
“mlr3mbo” (Kotlarski et al., 2014). The search space of optimal hyper-
parameters was defined by the ranges of “mtry”  (number of variables 
randomly sampled as candidates at each split), “min.node.size”  (mini-
mum size of terminal nodes), and “num.trees” (number of trees to grow) 
shown  in  Table  S3  (the  abbreviations  of  the  hyperparameters  used 
correspond to the terminology used in the R package “ranger”).

analytical  methods and  modeling tools  are needed to  deal with  these 
challenges (Tan et al., 2006). Over the past years, the field of artificial 
intelligence and machine learning has enabled significant advances in

We evaluated trained models according to their predictive accuracy 
and ecological interpretation of their predictors. Environmental cross- 
validation with ten folds was performed to represent the new environ-
ment’s  predictive  error  accurately.  Using  Partial  Dependence  Plots 
(PDPs), we uncovered patterns between model predictors and species- 
specific productivity. The resulting PDPs were evaluated using existing 
scientific  knowledge  to  determine  whether  the  patterns  found  were 
ecologically consistent.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, a diverse dataset was utilized, which likely included various types of data related to different species. This is suggested by the mention of'species-specific models', indicating that multiple datasets were used for training individual models for specific species. Secondly, environmental cross-validation with ten folds was employed to accurately represent the predictive error in new environments. Cross-validation is a technique used to assess how well a statistical model will generalize to an independent dataset, thus ensuring its robustness and reliability. Lastly, although not explicitly mentioned, it can be assumed that stratified splitting might have been applied during the creation of the training and validation sets. Stratification ensures that both sets maintain similar distributions of target classes, preventing any class imbalance issues that could negatively impact the model's performance.
