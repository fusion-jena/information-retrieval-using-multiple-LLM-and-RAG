l is the output of the ith node in the lth layer, xi

l is the acti-
where yi
l is the weight of the
vation value of the ith node in the lth layer, wij
connection between the jth node in the l-1th layer and the ith node in
the lth layer, θi
l is the threshold value of the ith node in the lth layer, Nl
is the number of nodes in the lth layer, L is the total number of layers,
and f() is the neuronal activation function.

Because the output error of the neurons in the output layer does not
satisfy the accuracy requirement, the learning process turns into a
backward error propagation process, and the basic model is as follows:

cross validation to optimize the parameters, the model provides shows
that the 2014 total EF of Beijing is predicted to be 8963.3 ten thousand
acres with an error of 1% and a standard deviation of 1.1e-11, com-
pared to the actual value of 8874 ten thousand acres, and the total EF of
Beijing in 2015 is predicted to be 8935.5 ten thousand acres with an
error of 0.64%, a standard deviation of 16 1.5e-11 and a root mean
square error of 71.78, compared to the actual value of 8984 ten 17
thousand acres. (Table 3).

We will examine the validity and accuracy of the PLS-based model.
Table 1 shows the logarithm extraction of the cumulative explanatory
condition during the extraction of 6 components from the model. When
t = 1, 2 … 6, the proposed model achieves a cumulative explanatory
capability of 96%, 98.1%, 99.2%, 99.6%, 99.9% and 99.9% of the in-
dependent variable X, Y, with a cumulative explanatory power of
70.3%, 90.0%, 93.6% 94.4%, 951.1%, 95.6% respectively. As R2 is
adjusted between 0.69 and 0.94, which demonstrates the good perfor-
mance of all the models. Especially when t equals 6, R2 is the maximum
value of 0.94, which provides the best answer for the independent and
dependent variables, remarkable eﬀectiveness of the model, and rea-
sonable PLS linear regression model of EF and driving factors.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The context provided does not explicitly state the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, based on common practices in machine learning, some possible criteria include reaching a predefined number of epochs or iterations, achieving a desired level of performance on a validation set (such as a minimum validation loss), or observing no further improvement in validation loss over several epochs (also known as a validation loss plateau). In this case, it appears that cross-validation was used to optimize the parameters of the model, but there is no explicit mention of how many epochs were trained or what specific stopping criterion was used. Therefore, without additional information, we cannot definitively answer the query.
