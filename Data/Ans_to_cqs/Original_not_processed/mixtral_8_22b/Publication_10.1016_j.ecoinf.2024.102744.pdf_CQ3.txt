overfitting. Additionally, the Global Average Pooling layer summarizes features, generating input 

for the fully connected layer. This layer also facilitates the visualization of regions relied upon by 

the network for predictions. The subsequent three fully connected layers generate the predicted 

class for the original image

Subsequently,  an  object  detection  network  (YOLOv5)  was  trained  on  the  manually 

annotated subset and then applied for detection on the remaining  images. However, due to  the 

small and unbalanced nature of the dataset, the detection of pollen-bearing bees was often missed. 

Consequently, the results underwent manual verification to establish the ground truth bounding 

boxes.  This  iterative  process  yielded  a  dataset  comprising  2,051  images,  encompassing  1,758 

pollen-bearing bees and 59,068 non-pollen-bearing bees.

4.2. Our proposed methods 

When applying two baseline models for pollen-bearing bee detection, the small size of the pollen 

sac presents a challenge, as the external appearance of pollen-bearing and non-pollen-bearing bees 

is  similar.  Consequently,  deep  learning  networks  may  encounter  difficulty  in  distinguishing 

between these two objects. Furthermore, upon observing the image data collected from bee hives, 

it becomes apparent that there is an imbalance in the number of pollen-bearing bees compared to

non-pollen-bearing bees. In light of these challenges, this study introduces three improvements to 

the  two  baseline  models,  namely  YOLOv5  and  Faster  RCNN.  Our  first  improvement  involves 

initially detecting bees from images, wherein the bee class encompasses both pollen-bearing and

CNN architecture but  with  different  filter sizes.  The obtained  results depend on the number of 

hidden layers, filter size, and the number of filters in convolution layers. The higher the number of 

hidden layers, filter size, and filters, the higher the accuracy of classification. In [29], the authors 

proposed  four  different  models  for  bee  image  classification,  serving  different  tasks  in  beehive 

monitoring. All these models were based on different Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) that have 

been  pre-trained  on  the  ImageNet  dataset  [30]  including  AlexNet,  DenseNet-201,  GoogLeNet, 

ResNet-101, ResNet-18, VGG-16, VGG-19. In the first model, the authors used a transfer learning 

method based on these pre-trained DNNs. Meanwhile, in the second, third, and fourth models, the 

authors used the SVM classifier with deep features, shallow features, and deep+shallow features

Helpful Answer:
The text mentions that an object detection network (YOLOv5) was trained on a manually annotated subset of the data. It can be inferred that the annotation technique used here is bounding box annotation since YOLOv5 is a popular object detection algorithm known for its use of bounding boxes around detected objects. After training, this network was applied for detection on the remaining images. However, due to the small and unbalanced nature of the dataset, the detection of pollen-bearing bees was often missed. As a result, the outcomes went through manual verification to establish the ground truth bounding boxes. This iterative process led to a dataset consisting of 2,051 images, which included 1,758 pollen-bearing bees and 59,068 non-pollen-bearing bees. Therefore, it appears that the primary data annotation technique employed in this deep learning pipeline is bounding box annotation.
