1. Introduction

Fig. 10. (a): Salty soils observed in the basin (IWRM, 2016) and (b): affected areas by the saline storm within a radius of 50 to 300 km.

the desiccation of the lake between 1996 and 2016. The drying of the 
lake can create a salty zone (with an area covering approximately 6000 
km2) that has the potential to generate dust and salt storms, polluting 
the air in the basin and its vicinity. The increase in water body since 
2015  showed  that  the  restoration  of  the  lake  is  possible.  Since  2015, 
agricultural activities have been reduced, which can be due to the lack of 
water for irrigation, the increase in soil salinity in the basin, and the 
policies adopted by the government to rehabilitate the lake.

Helpful Answer:
After model training, several postprocessing steps can be taken depending on the specific requirements of the project or task. Here are some common postprocessing steps:

1. Evaluation metrics: Calculating evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, etc., helps assess the performance of the trained model. These metrics provide insights into how well the model performs on unseen data.

2. Confusion Matrix: This is a table used to describe the performance of a classification model. It provides information about actual vs predicted values, true positives, false negatives, false positives, and true negatives.

3. Saliency Maps: These visualize the importance of each input feature towards the final output. They help identify which features contribute most significantly to the predictions made by the model.

4. Hyperparameter tuning: After evaluating the initial results, hyperparameters may need adjustment to improve the model's performance further. Grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and other techniques can be employed for this purpose.

5. Ensemble methods: Combining multiple models using ensemble methods like bagging, boosting, stacking, etc., can often lead to better overall performance compared to individual models.

6. Model interpretation: Explaining the reasoning behind a model's decisions is crucial for understanding its behavior and building trust in its predictions. Techniques like LIME, SHAP, Anchors, etc., can be used for interpreting complex machine learning models.
