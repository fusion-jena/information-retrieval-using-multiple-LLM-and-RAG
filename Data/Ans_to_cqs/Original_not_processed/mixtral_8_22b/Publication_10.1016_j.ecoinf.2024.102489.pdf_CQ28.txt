for the LAI (Yang et al., 2006). The MOD09A1 dataset was synthesised 
by selecting the best quality observation surface reflectance of the Terra 
and Aqua sensors within eight days. The dataset had the same spatial 
and temporal resolution as the MODIS LAI product, without geometric 
errors, and could be excluded from pixels, such as cloud pollution and 
cloud shadows, using QC and state layers. For convenience, the MODIS

2.2. Data and preprocessing 

2.2.1. High spatial resolution satellite image data

For machine learning methods such as RF models, the quality of the 
training samples can seriously affect their prediction results. Although 
this study utilised the pixel quality control metrics of MODIS products to 
eliminate  cloud-contaminated  and  poor-quality  pixels  and  to  remove 
outliers  from  the  training  samples,  the  surface  of  the  study  area  was 
highly heterogeneous compared to that of Zhai et al. (2020). To ensure 
that a sufficient number of LAI training samples could be selected, the 
main  algorithm  saturated  the  pixels  during  the  selection  of  the  LAI 
training  samples,  but  this  increased  the  high-value  LAI  uncertainty 
(Kang  et  al.,  2021).  Jamali  et  al.  (2023)  used  a  variety  of  machine 
learning  algorithms  to  estimate  various  leaf  parameters  for  wheat 
leaves, concluding that deep neural networks were the most capable of 
improving the prediction accuracy of leaf parameters. Therefore, field

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any information about which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. It only mentions the use of different types of satellite imagery and data sources, along with some details on how they were processed and utilized. However, there is no mention of any specific platform or service being used for deployment of the deep learning model.
