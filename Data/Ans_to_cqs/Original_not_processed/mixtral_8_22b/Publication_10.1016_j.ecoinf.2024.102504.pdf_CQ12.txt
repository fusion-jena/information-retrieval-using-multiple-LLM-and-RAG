bias. The framework improved forecasts for daily PM10 levels up to four 
days ahead, suggesting the potential for reliable early-warning systems 
based  on  automated  monitoring  stations  and  real-time  ensemble  pre-
dictions. Gokul et al. (2023) studied PM2.5 prediction for Hyderabad city 
using various machine learning models and found that the LSTM deep 
learning model outperformed others with an R2 value of 0.89 and a MAE

d)  Utilization of ESM: The ESM approach provides an effective method 
for air pollution forecasting based on Sentinel-5P datasets, offering 
flexibility with the dataset’s limited timeframe and providing a novel 
method for predicting future trends in air pollution concentrations 
within industrial clusters.  

e)  Integration  of  RS  Data:  The  integration  of  Copernicus  Sentinel-5 
Precursor vertical column density (VCD) data products with auxil-
iary  datasets  presents  an  innovative  approach  to  analyzing  air 
pollution, contributing to the advancement of air quality monitoring 
methodologies. 

These  contributions  collectively  offer  valuable  insights  into  the 
complex nature of air pollution and its relationship with industrial ac-
tivities, thereby advancing the understanding of air quality dynamics in 
the Tehran province.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The paper titled "Predicting air quality with deep learning LSTM: Towards comprehensive models" by Navares and Aznarte (2020) uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which are a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). This deep learning model is employed in their proposed pipeline for air quality predictions. Additionally, Chianese et al. (2019) use Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) in their study titled "Spatio-temporal learning in predicting ambient particulate matter concentration by multi-layer perceptron." However, it should be noted that MLPs are not considered part of the transformer family but rather belong to the feedforward neural network category.
