conditions, climatic, geographic, and vegetation conditions are specified 
as criterion layers (Jin et al., 2016). Each criterion layer includes specific 
indicators and quantitative methods, as listed in Table 1.

large-scale partitioning (Srivastava and Bhambhu, 2005). However, the 
training efficiency of SVM for large sample datasets is not ideal at pre-
sent (Amarappa and Sathyanarayana, 2024), and further optimization of 
the  training  algorithm  is  an  urgent  problem  that  needs  to  be  solved. 
Simultaneously, the boundaries delineated by SVM are not uniform with 
the  administrative  boundaries,  and  the  zoning  results  will  face  diffi-
culties in real applications, which is also a problem to be addressed in 
the future. Because of the increasing long-distance HAs and the remote 
deployment of material and energy, the ability of remote connectivity 
will  be  an  important  driver  of  future  regional  differentiation  (J.  Jiao 
et al., 2020). Quantifying this ability and incorporating it into HA–NE 
coupled zoning will be a topic addressed in future studies.

In Eq. (4), η(t) is the learning rate, which decreases with time t, and 

Sk(t) is the neighborhood of the output neuron j at time t.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, based on general machine learning practices, some common postprocessing steps include evaluating the performance of the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, or AUC-ROC; creating confusion matrices to visualize the performance of the classifier; generating saliency maps to understand the importance of each feature in the decision-making process; and fine-tuning hyperparameters to improve the model's performance. In the case of Support Vector Machines (SVM), one might calculate the margin width, support vectors, and kernel coefficients as part of the postprocessing analysis. For Self-Organizing Maps (SOM), one could analyze the U-matrix, component planes, and cluster structure. Nevertheless, without more specific details regarding the model used in the study, these suggestions remain speculative.
