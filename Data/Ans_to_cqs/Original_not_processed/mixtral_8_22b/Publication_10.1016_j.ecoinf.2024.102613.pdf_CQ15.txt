2019; Zamora-Izquierdo et al., 2019) and then machine learning and, 
more  recently,  deep  learning  techniques  are  applied  to  analyze  the 
generated data (Perakis et al., 2020; Swain et al., 2020). However, the 
traditional  data  management  systems  are  inadequate  to  handle  the 
volume, velocity, and variety of the generated data by the sensors and 
IoT devices (Wolfert et al., 2017). Hence the advanced data management

analysis techniques such as geospatial analysis, statistical-based models, 
mathematical  models,  deep  learning,  and  machine  learning  when 
designing the smart farming system.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that deep learning techniques are being applied to analyze data generated from various sources like sensors and IoT devices in agriculture. It also highlights that traditional data management systems are insufficient to manage this large volume of diverse data, leading to the use of advanced data management and analysis techniques including deep learning.

While the context doesn't explicitly mention optimization techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), these are commonly used in deep learning pipelines. SGD is a simple yet effective method for optimizing neural networks, while Adam combines the advantages of two other extensions of SGD—AdaGrad and RMSProp—to provide an optimization algorithm that can handle sparse gradients on noisy problems. Other popular optimization techniques include RMSprop, Adagrad, and Nadam. The choice of optimization technique depends on factors such as the complexity of the model, the size of the dataset, and the computational resources available.
