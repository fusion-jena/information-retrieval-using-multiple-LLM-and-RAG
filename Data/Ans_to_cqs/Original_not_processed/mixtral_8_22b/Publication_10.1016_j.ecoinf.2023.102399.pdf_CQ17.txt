There is no doubt that low-quality images will increase the workload 
of  image  processing,  requiring  more  complex  algorithms.  Obtaining 
high-quality  images  through  a  fully  automated  biomass  estimation 
method, without any manual intervention, can significantly reduce the 
workload  for  humans.  To  decrease  the  need  for  manual  intervention, 
Ravanbakhsh et al. (2015) implemented a deep learning technique that 
automatically detected and identified the head and mouth of Southern 
Bluefin tuna that were cultured in deep-sea cages. The head and mouth 
of the fish in specific positions within the underwater stereo images were 
accurately recognized using the Haar classifier. Although this technique 
efficiently  decreases  manual  processes,  achieving  fully  automated 
acquisition  of  biomass  information  is  still  lacking  in  certain  aspects.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Regularization methods are techniques used in machine learning, including deep learning, to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function during training. Two common regularization methods mentioned in the given context are Dropout and L2 Regularization.

Dropout is a regularization method where randomly selected neurons are ignored or "dropped out" during training, which helps prevent overfitting by making the model less dependent on individual neurons. This forces the network to learn redundant representations of features, leading to better generalization.

L2 Regularization, also known as Ridge Regression or Weight Decay, adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights to the loss function. By penalizing large weights, L2 Regularization encourages smaller and more distributed weight values across the network, reducing the risk of overfitting.

Other regularization methods not explicitly mentioned in the given context include L1 Regularization (also known as Lasso Regression), Early Stopping, and Data Augmentation. L1 Regularization adds a penalty term proportional to the absolute value of the weights, encouraging sparse solutions. Early Stopping involves stopping the training process before convergence when validation performance starts degrading. Data Augmentation generates additional training samples by applying transformations such as rotations, translations, or noise addition, helping the model generalize better.
