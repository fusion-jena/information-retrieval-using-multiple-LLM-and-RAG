where AA_SHAPj  is the average of the absolute SHAP values for input 
variable j (i.e., the daily average temperature on day j), ni is the number

et al., 2016), and LightGBM 3.2.1 (Ke et al., 2017) libraries. In building a 
machine  learning  model,  the  structure  and  hyperparameters  of  the 
model must be determined, such as the number of decision trees and the 
depth of trees for RF models and the number of intermediate layers and 
nodes for ANN models. We optimized the structure and hyperparameters 
of the RF and ANN models using Optuna 2.10.0 (Akiba et al., 2019) with 
the  parameters  and  ranges  shown  in  Table  1  as  candidates.  For  the 
LightGBM models, we used Optuna's LightGBM Tuner (optuna.integra-
tion.lightgbm)  for hyperparameter  fitting.  The  performance of  the  al-
gorithms was evaluated by comparing the loss function (mean squared 
error (MSE)) of the optimized models. In addition, the mean absolute 
error (MAE) and the coefficient of determination (R2) were calculated 
for reference.

0.965,  respectively),  followed  by  the  ANN  and  RF  models,  while  the 
differences  were  not  significant.  The  optimized  ANN  models  did  not 
have any intermediate layers, and the model with the input layer fol-
lowed by the output layer was determined to be the best.

First, the SHAP values were calculated for each of the 365 explana-
tory variables for a given response value. A positive SHAP value for a 
given  input  value  indicates  that  the  variable  increased  the  response 
value.  In  contrast,  a  negative  SHAP  value  indicates  that  the  variable 
decreased  the  output  value.  The  absolute  SHAP  value  shows  the 
magnitude of the effect. Next, we calculated the average of the absolute 
SHAP value (AA_SHAP) for each input value using eq. 1 to evaluate the 
magnitude of the effect of an explanatory variable:

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, it mentions that the performance of the algorithms was evaluated by comparing the loss function (mean squared error (MSE)) of the optimized models. This suggests that one possible criterion could be monitoring the validation loss during training and stopping when it reaches a plateau or starts increasing again. Additionally, the use of Optuna for hyperparameter optimization implies that cross-validation may have been employed, which would also involve tracking metrics like validation loss to decide when to stop training. Nevertheless, these details are not explicitly stated in the provided context.
