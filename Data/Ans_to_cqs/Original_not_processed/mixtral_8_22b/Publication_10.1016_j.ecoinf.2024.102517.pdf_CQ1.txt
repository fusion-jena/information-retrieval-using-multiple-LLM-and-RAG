reducing noise, and accordingly, would not be suitable for processing 
large  volumes  of  recorded  data  collected  in  the  field.  Furthermore, 
compared with the bird sound noise reduction network based on deep 
feature loss and the SEGAN algorithm, we found that the noise reduction 
efficiencies of the WebRTC and Wiener Filter algorithms were notably 
higher. This disparity in performance can be attributed to the fact that 
the deep learning model is larger in size and is thus more demanding of 
computational resources. However, it should be noted that the execution 
time of the deep learning models on CPUs is acceptable.

tained  a  dataset  comprising  clean  bird  sounds;  the  spectrograms  are 
shown in Fig. 2. The dataset contained 1568 clean bird sound segments, 
with  the  duration  of  each  ranging  from  4  to  20  s.  Among  these,  we 
randomly selected 68 segments as the clean bird sound test set and used

traditional noise reduction methods that generally tend to be suitable for 
eliminating  smooth  noise.  However,  field  recordings  often  consist  of 
significant  amounts  of  non-smooth  noise,  rendering  traditional  bio-
acoustic  noise  reduction  methods  at  least  partially  ineffective  for 
adaptive noise reduction in field recordings. In this context, relatively 
few  studies  to  date  have  sought  to  assess  the  potential  value  of  deep 
learning for bioacoustic noise reduction. Moreover, the current scarcity 
of  labeled  clean  bioacoustic  recordings  makes  it  challenging  to  train 
deep  learning-based  models  for  bioacoustic  noise  reduction.  Further-
more,  the  application  of  deep  learning  bioacoustic  noise  reduction 
methods for different types of noises and different frequency bands of 
bird species calls has yet to be thoroughly investigated. Given that birds 
are  considered  good  indicators  of  ecological  health  and  that  their

2.3.3. Experimental setting 

In our experiment, a deep learning environment based on Python and 
Tensorflow â€“ GPU as well as CUDA was constructed under the Windows 
operating system. The deep feature loss bird noise reduction network 
model was trained for 50 epochs on an RTX 2080 Ti GPU using the Adam 
(cid:0) 4. In each 
optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014) with a learning rate of 10
epoch, the entire training set was presented in a random order, with one 
noisy bird sound signal per iteration. 

2.4. Comparative algorithms 

Using the same test  set, we compared the  denoising results of the 
deep feature loss-based bird sound noise reduction network with several 
other  bioacoustics  noise  reduction  algorithms,  namely  SEGAN, 
WebRTC, wavelet transform (Priyadarshani et al., 2016), Wiener filter 
(Loizou, 2017), and MMSE STSA (Brown et al., 2017) algorithms.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that a dataset containing clean bird sounds was obtained, which consisted of 1568 clean bird sound segments with durations ranging from 4 to 20 seconds. From this dataset, 68 segments were randomly selected as the clean bird sound test set. It can be inferred that the raw data collection process involved recording bird sounds, but the specific method or source of these recordings is not mentioned. Therefore, it remains unclear whether they were collected through surveys, sensors, public datasets, or other means.
