For each fold, the frames from Trainingclips  were used to train the 
models. The Testingclips were used to assess the robustness of our method 
on short sequences centered around the presence of fish presence. The 
Testingstations, common to all k-fold were used to assess the robustness of 
the method on 1-h videos, corresponding to the real use-case scenarios 
of ecological studies (Supp. Fig. 1).

displayed a slightly higher F-measure standard deviation, ranging from 
0.08 to 0.11 between models. Considering the superior performance of 
the models trained on 27 species (Supp. Table 1), these were selected for 
subsequent analyses.

mechanisms  (Vaswani  et  al.,  2017).  Moreover,  recent  technological 
strides in time series processing offer promising avenues for refinement. 
Techniques such as contrastive representation distillation (Tian et al., 
2020), federated distillation learning (Xing et al., 2021), long short-term 
memory (Sepp and Jurgen, 1997), and temporal feature network (Xiao 
et  al.,  2021)  are  among  the  innovative  approaches  in  this  domain. 
Methodologies such as few-shot/one shot learning and adaptative losses 
may also improve the models. Such methods may be explored to effi-
ciently discriminate fish with few training data, such as the tiger shark 
Galeocerdo cuvier or the silvertip shark Carcharhinus albimarginatus. The 
integration of these methodologies carries the potential to enhance ac-
curacy metrics and better exploit the temporal dimension of videos.

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it can be inferred that the models were evaluated based on their performance using various metrics like precision, recall, and F-measure. Additionally, the context mentions that the models displayed a slight variation in F-measure standard deviation, which could suggest that some form of model stability or convergence was considered during training. Nevertheless, without more detailed information regarding the training process, it cannot be definitively stated what exact criteria were used to determine when training was complete.
