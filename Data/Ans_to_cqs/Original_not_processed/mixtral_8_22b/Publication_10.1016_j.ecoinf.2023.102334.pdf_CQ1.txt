6.1. Vision transformer 

Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), which is a deep neural network 
first created for natural language processing (NLP), was built on a self- 
attention mechanism that makes it possible for noticeably huge recep-
tive  fields.  The Transformer  has become  a  de facto industry  standard 
procedure in NLP because of its remarkable efficiency, and it has also 
motivated  researchers  in  the  field  of  computer  vision  to  investigate 
applications  by  utilizing  the  long-term  relationships  between  pixels 
(Khan et al., 2022).

ViT  is the  first significant effort to employ  a  pure Transformer on 
pictures directly, showing that it can totally replace the conventional 
convolution processes with SOTA performance. The training of the va-
nilla ViT model, however, necessitates high computing costs, according 
to  the  experimental  findings.  As  a  result,  the  utilization  of  a  hybrid 
design  that  couples  the  Transformer  with  a  CNN  backbone  (such  as 
ResNet)  is  advocated  here.  The  Transformer  may  concentrate  on 
modelling global attention using the feature that ResNet extracted. Ac-
cording to the experimental findings, the hybrid approach can deliver 
better performance with comparatively less computing work. The main 
objective of this work was to create a model that accurately identifies 
sika deer using the idea.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, generally speaking, some common methods for gathering raw data include surveys, various types of sensors such as cameras or motion detectors, and publicly available datasets. For instance, in wildlife surveillance, remote sensing technologies like camera traps could be employed to collect images of animals. Additionally, existing databases containing animal photos might serve as valuable resources for acquiring relevant data. Nevertheless, without explicit details from the provided text, these examples should only be considered as potential approaches rather than definitive answers.
