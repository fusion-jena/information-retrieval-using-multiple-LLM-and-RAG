Recently,  Artificial  Intelligence  (AI)  has  been  brought  to  some 
commercial camera traps, such as the Trail-Guard by Resolve, although 
literature around effectiveness for this is lacking. The use of AI “at the 
edge” may be able to overcome some of the issues of traditional camera 
traps, such as a large number of empty images being kept for analysis 
and  later  discarded.  More  specifically,  machine  learning,  especially 
based  on deep  learning techniques, is  being explored by  the research 
community to reduce as much as possible the amount of useless data 
being  collected.  For  example,  Schindler  and  Steinhage  (2021)  use  a 
combination  of  Mask  R-CNN  with  Flow-Guided  Feature  Aggregation 
(Zhu et al., 2017) to optimize instance segmentation of animal species in 
video clips. Their study is applied to data obtained by camera traps with 
PIR,  capturing  at  dusk  and  night,  in  Bavaria,  four  classes  of  animals

7.1.3. Bespoke neural networks for species sets 

While we selected a suitable neural network for species identifica-
tion, we spent little research so far to train this network to sets of user- 
selected  or  prevalent  species  in  the  region  where  the  camera  trap  is 
deployed.  Training  for  a  bespoke  set  of  species  is  both  possible  and 
desirable. Further research is needed to identify and automate a process 
that,  given  a  set  of  species  of  interest,  outputs  a  robust  and  reliable 
neural network model with suitable weights.

Query: "What are the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Fliping, Roating, Scaling)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data augmentation techniques used in image processing include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, translation, and color space transformations. These techniques help increase the size of training datasets and improve the generalization ability of deep learning models. It is likely that similar techniques could have been employed in the studies mentioned in the context, but without explicit information, it cannot be confirmed which specific techniques were used.
