Hyperparameters  are  instrumental  in  shaping  the  architecture  of 
deep  learning  models and  steering  the  learning  process  (Bischl et  al., 
2023).  The  TPEBO  algorithm  stands  out  for  its  strategic  approach  to 
hyperparameter optimization. Beginning with an exploratory phase of 
random  searches  for  feasible  hyperparameter  configurations,  TPEBO 
progressively narrows down its focus to zones within the search space 
where a local optimum is identified, thereby approximating the global 
optimum  with  increasing  precision.  This  methodological  approach  is 
particularly  beneficial  for  fine-tuning  LSTM  models,  known  for  their 
intricate  structures.  By  automating  the  hyperparameter  adjustment 
process,  TPEBO  not  only  enhances  the  model's  efficiency  but  also 
significantly  curtails  the  time  traditionally  spent  on  manual  tuning, 
making the modeling workflow more efficient. The process is succinctly

The hyperparameter optimization process for LSTM neural networks 
is conceptualized as a black-box function where diverse hyperparameter 
combinations are the inputs and the optimization targets are the outputs 
aimed at minimizing the objective metric. This black-box approach fa-
cilitates the establishment of a direct link between hyperparameter sets 
and the network's optimization goals.

various hyperparameter values. Key hyperparameters include: 

Number  of  hidden  layers:  This  hyperparameter  is  crucial  for  the

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it can be inferred from the information given that one strategy used by the TPEBO algorithm is to begin with an exploratory phase of random searches for feasible hyperparameter configurations. This initial step allows the algorithm to consider various possibilities before focusing on specific areas of the search space. Additionally, the use of a black-box function approach enables a direct link between hyperparameter sets and the network's optimization goals, potentially reducing the impact of randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Nonetheless, further research or additional context would be required to provide a definitive answer regarding specific strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
