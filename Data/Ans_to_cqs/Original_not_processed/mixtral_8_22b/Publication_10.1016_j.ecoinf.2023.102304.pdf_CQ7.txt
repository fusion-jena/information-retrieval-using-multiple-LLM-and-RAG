Model Proportion for best fitting. Runge et al. (2022) optimized the LTR

higher  MS is needed to better capture the index response to wildfire. 
Compared to the default parameters, the overall accuracy and kappa of 
optimized  parameters  can  improve  by  up  to  8.4%  and  36.8%, 
respectively.

MS defines the maximum number of segments used for fitting. RT 
(cid:0) 1 in this study) defines the threshold of the fast recovery event. 
(unit: yr
A  simple  disturbance-recovery  pattern  usually  consists  of  four  phases 
(stable-decrease-recovery-stable).  In  that  case,  an  MS  value  of  4  is 
appropriate to describe the temporal pattern and reduce the impact of 
noise in the time series. In a complex recovery situation, more segments 
may be required. RT has a value between 0 and 1. A higher value makes 
the model less likely to miss a fast recovery while more likely to cause a 
false positive error. 

2.2.3. Accuracy evaluation

climate and vegetation cover conditions. By selecting the most appro-
priate  index  for  a  given  region,  the  LTR  algorithm  can  provide  more 
accurate results that are meaningful in the context of the specific climate 
conditions of that region.

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, it discusses the optimization of parameters for the Landscape Temporal Response (LTR) algorithm, which is used to analyze landscape responses to disturbances such as wildfires. The authors use Maximum Segments (MS) and Recovery Threshold (RT) as key parameters for their analysis. They also evaluate the accuracy of their approach using metrics like overall accuracy and Kappa. While these details do not directly address the query about splitting data for deep learning models, they suggest that similar principles could apply when determining how to partition datasets for training, testing, and validation purposes. For instance, one might consider factors such as the complexity of the dataset, desired model performance, and potential sources of noise or bias when deciding on appropriate splits.
