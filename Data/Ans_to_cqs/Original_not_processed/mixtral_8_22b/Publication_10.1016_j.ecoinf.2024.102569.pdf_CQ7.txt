The root trimmed mean squared prediction error (RTMSPE) is uti-
lized to select the appropriate values for the tuning parameters τ and ϕ, 
removing  the  impact  of  heterogeneous  observations.  The  RTMSPE  is

ϕ (k ∕= 0, ϕ ≥ 0) as a constant tuning parameter. The loss function has no 
penalties for the intercept parameter β0 of the intensity function and the 
coefficient  paramter  α  for  the  detection  probability  model.  We  can 
compute the L1  penalized estimates using the gradient ascent method 
(Goeman,  2010).  The  detailed  computation  algorithm  is  provided  in

[n] represent the minimum and maximum values of the 
squared prediction errors across all grid cells, respectively. The value of 
δ  is set to ensure that 1 (cid:0) δ represents the expected proportion of het-
erogeneous observations. In other words, the REMSPE trims the data of 
observations that have squared residuals with magnitudes in the top 1 (cid:0)
δ, because they are considered to have a high possibility of being het-
erogeneous  observations.  It  may  be  recommended  to  perform  cross- 
validation to obtain the RTMSPE or calculate using a validation data-
set which is independent of the training dataset. Due to computational 
cost of cross-validation, the RTMSPE is calculated using the training data 
in this paper.

Helpful Answer:

When splitting data for deep learning model training, there are several common approaches. One popular approach is to divide the data into three subsets: training, testing, and validation sets.

1. Training Set: This subset is used to train the model, i.e., adjust the weights and biases of the neural network based on the input features and corresponding target labels. Typically, around 60-80% of the total available data is allocated to the training set.

2. Testing Set: After training the model, it needs to be evaluated on unseen data to assess its performance and generalization capabilities. The testing set serves this purpose. Usually, about 20-30% of the total data is reserved for the testing set.

3. Validation Set: During the training process, a validation set can help tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. The validation set is typically created from the training set itself, often through techniques like k-fold cross-validation. However, some practitioners prefer setting aside a separate portion of the data exclusively for validation purposes.

The specific proportions of these subsets depend on factors such as the size of the overall dataset, class imbalance, and the complexity of the problem. Cross-validation methods, such as k-fold cross-validation or leave-one-out cross-validation, can also be employed to improve the robustness and reliability of the evaluation results.
