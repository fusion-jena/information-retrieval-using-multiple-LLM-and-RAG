Helpful Answer:
The article does not provide specific information on the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for cloud detection. However, common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, and adding noise or blurring images. These techniques help increase the size and diversity of training datasets, which can improve model performance and generalization. It is likely that some combination of these techniques was employed in this case, but without explicit mention in the source material, it cannot be confirmed.
