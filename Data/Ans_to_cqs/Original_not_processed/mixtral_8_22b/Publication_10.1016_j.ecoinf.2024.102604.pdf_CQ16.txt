on environmental covariates. Essentially, the sampling bias caused by 
the environment (variables) is presented by mapping the environmental 
space to the geographic space. Therefore, this study proposes that cor-
recting sampling bias in environmental spaces is beneficial yet requires 
further testing (El-Gabbas and Dormann, 2018). 

4.3. Method effectiveness

accurately  reflect  the  efficacy  of  bias  correction  (Amaro  et  al.,  2023; 
Redding et al., 2017).

2.4.3. Model evaluation 

Two indicators were used to evaluate the effectiveness of each model 
in correcting the sampling bias. The area under the receiver operating

(GAM)  (Thuiller  et  al.,  2003),  machine  learning  methods  such  as 
Random  Forests  (RF)  (Zhang  et  al.,  2019),  Boosted  Regression  Trees 
(BRT) (Hellegers et al., 2020) and Maximum Entropy (Maxent) (Phillips 
et al., 2006) are gaining popularity. Among these, Maxent, which uses 
only presence data, has become a widely used SDM because of its su-
perior predictive ability (Wisz et al., 2008), particularly given the dif-
ficulty of obtaining reliable absence information.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed for the models mentioned. However, it can be inferred from general machine learning practices that common criteria include reaching a certain number of epochs or iterations, achieving a desired level of accuracy or performance, or observing a plateau in the validation loss. In some cases, early stopping may also be employed based on monitoring metrics like validation loss or accuracy over time. It should be noted that the exact criteria can vary depending on the specific algorithm and problem being addressed.
