Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it can be inferred that the hyperparameters of the model were not explicitly mentioned to have been optimized through methods such as grid search or random search. However, it is stated that the model was initially trained with a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer and a learning rate 10 times smaller than before. This suggests that some form of optimization was performed, possibly through manual tuning or trial and error. Additionally, the model was trained until there was no decrease in loss for more than 10 consecutive epochs, indicating that early stopping was employed as a regularization technique to prevent overfitting. Nevertheless, the specific method used to optimize the hyperparameters remains unclear based solely on the provided context.
