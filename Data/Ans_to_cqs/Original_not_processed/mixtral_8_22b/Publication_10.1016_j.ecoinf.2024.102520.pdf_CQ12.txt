2.3. Image acquisition and processing

The Landsat 8 OLI and TIRS bands (Band 4, 3, and 2) of 30-m reso-
lution and remote sensing image data from Google Earth Engine (GEE), 
which  was accessed on April 21,  2023, were used in this study. Geo-
metric, radiometric and image mosaicking, and cropping are all aspects 
considered  in  the  remote  sensing  image  pre-processing.  The  slope, 
aspect, drainage, and parent material of the topographic variables from 
DEM  were  calculated  using  the  System  for  Automated  Geoscientific 
Analysis (SAGA) GIS. After image processing, the original image's Digital 
Number (Fortuna et al., 2022) provided the measured Surface Reflec-
tance (SR). The TOA and SR picture sets from Google Earth Engine (GEE) 
helped to speed up data processing. The function ee. Image Collection in 
image  preprocessing  used  the  Landsat  8  SR  images  (High  resolution 
satellite  L2)  from  the  GEE  platform.  Only  the  chosen  photos  were

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it does not explicitly state what type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline. However, there is a reference to a paper titled "RCL: Recurrent Continuous Localization for Temporal Action Detection" by Wang et al. (2022). This suggests that the authors may have used a recurrent neural network (RNN) or a variant of it, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks or Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), in their work. Nevertheless, without more specific details about the pipeline mentioned in the context, we cannot definitively determine which type of deep learning model was employed.
