Halgamuge et al. (2020) focused on utilizing deep learning to esti-
mate the best optimizer selection methods for wildfire event predictions 
in Australia. They developed an algorithm to collect the data automat-
ically and analyzed six different optimizer models using deep learning 
technology. They concluded that this approach could predict a natural 
disaster, including wildfire events, by investigating historical environ-
mental  conditions  before  and  after  wildfires  occurred  using  the  deep 
learning methodology. Dowdy (2020) focused on demonstrating a sea-
sonal prediction system for wildfire event prediction in Australia. This 
measured  spatio-temporal  variations  and  seasonality  across  several 
datasets  and  utilized  this  methodology  to  predict  wildfire  events, 
focusing on the seasonal predictions using the 2019â€“2020 wildfire sea-
son  as  an  example  and  measuring  long-term  predictions.  Coen  et  al.

Using  the  Code  Editor  tool,  97  images  were  extracted  from  April 
2013 to July 2021. In total, 9841 areas in the forest were analyzed, and 
NDVI  data  was  extracted.  The  method  involved  using  the  map  func-
tionality of the Code Editor tool and scripting all the required calcula-
tions in JavaScript. Mean NDVI scores were calculated for each one of 
these areas, and the percentage of vegetation in these areas with low 
NDVI scores was recorded. The final dataset included the mean NDVI 
score, month date stamp of the time each image was taken, and forest 
vulnerability  as  the  percentage  of  vegetation  with  low  NDVI  scores. 
Some images had to be excluded due to inappropriate NDVI estimates, 
lack of such estimates, and cloud coverage. The study was also extracted 
data during the main wildfire events that spread through the selected 
forest from September 2019 to January 2020. However, at least 75% of

reports, Royal Commission reports and environmental expert knowledge 
(Bureau of Meteorology, 2022; Royal Commission into National Natural 
Disaster  Arrangements,  2020;  Tasmanian  Fire  Service,  Tasmanian 
Government, 2020).

Helpful Answer:
The papers mentioned in the given context do not explicitly state the specific datasets used in their deep learning pipelines. However, they discuss various approaches to wildfire event prediction in Australia using deep learning technology. Halgamuge et al. (2020) focus on selecting the best optimizers for wildfire event predictions using deep learning, while Dowdy (2020) presents a seasonal prediction system for wildfire events. Both studies use historical environmental conditions and spatial-temporal variations to train their models.

Additionally, the text mentions extracting 97 images from April 2013 to July 2021 using the Code Editor tool. These images were then analyzed to calculate mean NDVI scores and record the percentage of vegetation with low NDVI scores. The resulting dataset includes the mean NDVI score, the month and date when each image was taken, and forest vulnerability as the percentage of vegetation with low NDVI scores. Some images were excluded due to inaccuracies or lack of NDVI estimates and cloud coverage. Data was also collected during major wildfire events between September 2019 and January 2020.

However, it is important to note that none of the information provided specifies the exact datasets used in the deep learning pipelines. Therefore, based on the available context, we cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the datasets used in the deep learning pipelines.
