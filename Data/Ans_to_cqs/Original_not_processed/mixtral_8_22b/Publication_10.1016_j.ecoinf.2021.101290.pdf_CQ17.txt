Leveraging machine learning, computer vision, and artificial intel-
ligence for automated annotation and analysis especially requires high 
quality data (Egnor and Branson, 2016). Although automated annota-
tion is widely applied, it is mostly used offline which has the advantage 
that the researcher can assist the algorithms, fine tune parameters and 
oversee that classifications are correct. However, it also limits the op-
tions for data collection and closed loop experimentation. We instead 
propose  to  automatically  annotate  and  analyse  data  online  while  the

Helpful Answer:
Regularization methods are techniques used in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise along with underlying patterns, resulting in poor generalization performance on unseen data. Two common regularization methods mentioned in the given context are dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a technique introduced by Geoffrey Hinton et al. [1] where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, effectively creating a sparse network. This helps prevent complex co-adaptations between neurons, reducing overfitting. Dropout rates typically range from 0.2 to 0.5, depending on the complexity of the model and dataset.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay or ridge regression, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights. This encourages smaller weights, making the model simpler and less prone to overfitting. The strength of this penalty is controlled by a hyperparameter called the regularization parameter or lambda.

Other regularization methods not explicitly mentioned in the given context include L1 regularization (also known as Lasso regression), early stopping, and data augmentation. L1 regularization adds a penalty term proportional to the absolute value of the weights, encouraging sparse solutions. Early stopping involves halting the training process before convergence based on validation set performance. Data augmentation generates additional training examples through transformations like rotation, scaling, or flipping, helping the model generalize better.
