Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

• No-overfitting. In this setting, the optimization algorithm of CNNs is 
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), with a learning rate of 0.0001 
and a weight decay of 0.5. The batch size is set to 32, the number of 
training epochs to 200 and finally the batch-norm and dropout (0.5) 
are used to reduce the overfitting level.  

• Overfitting.  We  use  the  same  hyperparameters  setting  as  the  no- 
overfitting  but  we  remove  the  use  of  batch-norm,  weight  decay 
and dropout techniques to ensure that the model overfits.

The architecture of VGG16, as depicted in Fig. 5, consists of five sets 
of  convolutional  layers  alternating  with  five  max-pooling  layers,  fol-
lowed by two fully connected layers and an output layer. The initial two 
blocks comprise two convolutional layers each, employing respectively 
64  and  128  filters.  The  subsequent  two  blocks  encompass  three  con-
volutional  layers  with  respectively  256,  512  and  512  filters.  All  con-
volutional filters have a size of 3 × 3 and the max-pooling layers utilize a 
2 × 2 pool size with a stride of 2. During the SNN training process, we 
fine-tuned VGG16 by unfreezing the last two blocks (block 4 and block 
5), ensuring that their weights are updated in each epoch. Finally, ad-
justments were made to the final dense layer in each CNN to account for 
the specific number of classes representing beluga individuals in each 
dataset.  Fine-tuning  of  these  deep  models  was  conducted  using  Sto-

6.2. Model generalization capability

Strengthening the ability of trained models to generalize effectively 
poses  a  significant  challenge  within  the  domain  of  deep  learning. 
Indeed, generalization refers to the variation in a model’s performance 
when applied to data it has been trained on, as opposed to data it en-
counters for the first time during testing. This issue is of fundamental 
importance and has far-reaching implications for applications employ-
ing  deep  neural  networks.  In  particular,  this  challenge  becomes

Helpful Answer:
The pipeline uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Specifically, the VGG16 architecture is employed, which consists of five sets of convolutional layers alternating with five max-pooling layers, followed by two fully connected layers and an output layer. The architecture includes fine-tuning of VGG16 by unfreezing the last two blocks (block 4 and block 5) to update their weights in each epoch. Additionally, adjustments are made to the final dense layer in each CNN to accommodate the specific number of classes representing beluga individuals in each dataset.
