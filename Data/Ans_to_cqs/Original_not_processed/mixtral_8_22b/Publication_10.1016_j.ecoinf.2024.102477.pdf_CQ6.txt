Deep  learning  methods  are  being  widely  applied to  create  models 
directly from large volumes of complex data (Seng et al., 2021). Deep 
learning methods have superior performance for time-series prediction 
than  do  many  other  models  (Li  et  al.,  2019b).  SLSTM  has  been  suc-
cessfully used to predict agricultural product sales (Yoo and Oh, 2020). 
To mitigate the high price volatility of agricultural products, sales vol-
ume can be forecasted before production for reducing production risks 
and  facilitating  agricultural  planning,  ultimately  minimizing  post-
production  price  fluctuations.  In  a  case  study,  an  SLSTM  model  was 
found  to  exhibit  lower  errors  and  considerably  higher  performance 
compared with the ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM models. In another case 
study, an SGRU model was used for successfully predicting the Pacific 
decadal  oscillation  index  at  multiple  time  scales  and  achieved  mean

SVR is a machine learning method known for its superior accuracy 
compared  with  other  machine  learning  methods  and  its  ability  to 
simplify parameters, achieve global optimization, and handle nonlinear 
problems  (Chen  et  al., 2017;  Ji et  al.,  2021). In  this  study, the  expo-
(cid:0) 8–21,  σ  =
nential  parameters  were  set  as  follows:  C  = 20–210,  ε  = 2
(cid:0) 8–21 (Yang et al., 2022). Table 2 presents the training results for the

hyperparameter-optimized  SVR  model.  Parameter  C  controls  error 
tolerance during training and determines the maximum deviation that 
the model permits for any individual training example. A higher C value 
allows for a larger error, which makes the model more likely to fit the 
training  data  but  also  increases  the  risk  of  overfitting.  Conversely,  a 
smaller  C  value  imposes  stricter  constraints  on  the  model,  thereby 
increasing  the  difficultly  of  fitting  the  training  data  but  potentially

5.1. Comparison of SLSTM and SGRU models 

Deep learning methods have accelerated the development of artifi-
cial intelligence and demonstrated potential in various domains (Chen 
et al., 2021). Deep learning architectures simulate neurons in the brain, 
and their ability to learn from complex data renders them the preferred 
choice for time-series prediction (Choi et al., 2021). RNNs are neural 
networks that use backpropagation techniques and short-term memory 
to  enhance  their  time-series  prediction  performance  (Kavitha  et  al., 
2023).

4.3. Analysis of forecasting results 

In this study, an SGRU-based deep learning approach was adopted to 
develop  a  model  for  accurately  predicting  (over  36  months)  the

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to perform these preprocessing steps before training a model. Normalization involves rescaling the input features so they fall within a certain range, typically between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. Scaling refers to adjusting the values of numeric columns in the dataset to a standard scale without distorting differences in the ranges of values or losing information. Cleaning involves handling missing values, outliers, and irrelevant data points in the dataset. These preprocessing steps help improve the performance and efficiency of the deep learning model by ensuring that the input data is consistent and suitable for training.
