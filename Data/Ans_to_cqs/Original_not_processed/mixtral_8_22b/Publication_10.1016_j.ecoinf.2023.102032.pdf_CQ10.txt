Uwimana et al., 2018a) cannot be derived directly with such a remote 
sensing product. However, we contend WUI can serve to rapidly assess 
cumulative  use  pressures  on  wetland  health  to  spatially  guide  where 
such investigations should take place. It can be applied in addition to 
ground-based survey methods and contribute to often neglected follow- 
up studies on the environmental impact of wetland development efforts 
(George et al., 2020), in particular where resources are scarce.

Question: %INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the provided pieces of context to answer the query in less than 400 words. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

%Query
Query: "What is the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not contain information about a specific deep learning pipeline or its corresponding code repository link. The only mentioned repository is related to Sentinel-2 cloud masking using s2cloudless, which can be found at <https://github.com/google/earthengine-community/blob/master/tutorials/sentinel-2-s2cloudless/index.ipynb>. However, this repository is not explicitly linked to a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to provide the requested code repository link.
