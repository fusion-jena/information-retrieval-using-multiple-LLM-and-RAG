The following configuration optimized the performance of the model 
and was accordingly adopted for analysis: Adam solver (Kingma and Ba, 
(cid:0) 4,  constant  learning 
2014),  10 neurons  per  hidden  layer, alpha  = 10
rate, and rectifier activation function, also called Rectified Linear Unit 
(ReLU) activation function, defined as:

In the case of the RF, the hyperparameters include the number of 
decision trees in the forest, the maximum depth of the decision tree, the 
number of features considered by each tree when splitting a node, etc. 
This  set  of  hyperparameters  was  tested  using  the  grid  configuration 
shown below:  

1.  Number of decision trees: from 100 to 1000 (in steps of 100);  
2.  Number of features to consider at every split (max features): auto,

sqrt, log2, None;  

3.  Maximum number of levels in decision tree: None, or from 10 to 100 

(in steps of 10);

models were calibrated under regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) conditions to estimate ETa  and save irrigation 
water. On average up to 38.5% water savings were obtained, compared to full irrigation. Moreover, among the 
different input variables adopted, the soil water content (SWC) feature appears to have a prominent role in the 
prediction of ETa. Indeed, the presented results show that by choosing the appropriate input features, the ac-
curacy  of  the  proposed  machine  learning  models  remains  acceptable  even  when  the  number  of  features  is 
reduced to only 4. The best performance was achieved by the Random Forest method, with seven input features, 
obtaining a root mean square error (RMSE) and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.39 mm/day and 0.84, 
respectively. Finally, the results show that the joint use of SWC, weather and satellite data significantly improves

A  widely  used  feedforward  ANN  is  the  Multi-Layer  Perceptron 
(MLP), constituted by one input layer, one or more hidden layers, and a 
layer of output neurons. The neurons are connected to the ones of the 
next layer with a certain weight and, in each neuron, the weighted sum 
of input variables is transformed into an output value through an acti-
vation function, defined as: 

Y = ψ

( ∑

)
wi*xi + b

where wi is the weight, xi is the neuron input, b is the neuron bias, and ψ 
is the activation function.

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the deep learning model is being used for predicting daily evapotranspiration (ETa). This is supported by the mention of the Random Forest method achieving the best performance in estimating ETa with a root mean square error (RMSE) and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.39 mm/day and 0.84, respectively. Additionally, the context mentions that the model was calibrated under regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) conditions to estimate ETa and save irrigation water. Therefore, it can be concluded that the purpose of the deep learning model is to accurately predict daily evapotranspiration for efficient water management in agriculture.
