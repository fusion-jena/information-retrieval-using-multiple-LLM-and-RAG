Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

ran in approximately 1.2 min for our experiments on the CPU, whilst 
softmax  took  12  min  on  the  GPU  to  complete  the  same  task.  So, 
although, softmax can accomplish our classification task, our proposed 
method has advantages.

of images per species, and a successful trial corresponds to an image in 
the sample having a natural background.

%Query
Query: "How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. Therefore, it cannot be determined from the given information whether grid search, random search, or another method was used for hyperparameter optimization.

Based on the provided context, we only have information about the performance comparison between the proposed method and the softmax function for accomplishing a certain classification task. It is mentioned that the proposed method ran in approximately 1.2 minutes on the CPU while the softmax took around 12 minutes on the GPU to complete the same task. However, there is no specific detail regarding the process of hyperparameter tuning or optimization methods employed in this study.
