pooling to process input images at multiple scales in order to capture multi-scale features
and later fuse the output to produce a feature map [38]. To improve its efﬁciency, an Atrous
convolution operation was introduced. This operation enables the window size of the

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given text does not provide information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It only mentions the use of DeepLabv3+ architecture and its adaptation for herbarium-related studies. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model based on the provided context.
