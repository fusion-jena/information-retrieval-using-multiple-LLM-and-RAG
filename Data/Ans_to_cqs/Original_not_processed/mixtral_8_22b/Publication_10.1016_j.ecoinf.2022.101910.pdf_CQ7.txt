et al., 2021; Stowell et al., 2019). Some of the state-of-the-art techniques 
for  handling  big  datasets,  such  as  deep  learning  and  convolutional 
neural networks (Stowell, 2022; Stowell et al., 2019), can be difficult to 
run for ornithologists, managers, and researchers without bioacoustics 
or  engineering  backgrounds.  However,  user-friendly  and  ready-to-use 
machine  learning  approaches  have  recently  been  developed  and  are 
increasingly accessible to respond to real-life monitoring challenges and 
the general public (Cole et al., 2022). Among these approaches is Bird-
NET, a research project between The Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the 
Chemnitz University of Technology. BirdNET facilitates the automated 
detection and classification of bird vocalizations, through a developed 
deep neural network, from sound recordings (Kahl et al., 2021). Bird-
NET is able to identify over 3000 bird species (Wood et al., 2021) and is

identify which of the candidate sounds are vocalizations of the desired 
species (e.g. Rycyk et al., 2022).

mainly three settings can be adjusted in BirdNET: the detection sensi-
tivity,  overlap  of  prediction  segments,  and  the  minimum  confidence 
threshold (Kahl et al., 2021). We set these values to 1.5 (highest allowed 
value),  1.5  s  of  overlap,  and  0.4,  respectively.  The  low  confidence 
threshold may result in increased recall and false positive rates, but the 
value employed was similar to the one used by Kahl et al. when evalu-
ating BirdNET accuracy on 984 bird species (value of 0.5, Kahl et al., 
2021).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. Typically, this process involves randomly splitting the dataset into three subsets: training, testing, and validation. The training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Finally, the test set is used to evaluate the final performance of the model. However, since the specific criteria used for splitting the data in this case are not mentioned, it cannot be determined with certainty how the data was divided for training, testing, and validation purposes.
