Helpful Answer:
The given context primarily discusses studies related to semantic segmentation using deep learning techniques applied to 2D images. The mentioned papers focus on various aspects such as feature matching, geolocalization, and semantic image segmentation. In particular, the research conducted by Taghanaki et al. (2021) reviews deep semantic segmentation of natural and medical images. Furthermore, the work by Ulku and Akagündüz (2022) provides a survey on deep learning-based architectures for semantic segmentation on 2D images.

Regarding the specific data formats used in these deep learning pipelines, the primary format is evidently 2D images. For instance, the Harmonised LUCAS dataset contains in-situ land cover and use data collected through field surveys between 2006 and 2018 across the European Union (d'Andrimont et al., 2020). Additionally, the Lucas Copernicus 2018 dataset offers earth observation relevant in-situ data on land cover and use throughout the European Union (d'Andrimont et al., 2021). Both datasets provide valuable resources for training and evaluating deep learning models for semantic segmentation tasks involving 2D images.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we can conclude that the main data format employed in this deep learning pipeline is 2D images. However, without further information about the specific implementations of each model discussed in the referenced papers, we cannot definitively state whether additional data formats like audio, video, or CSV files were also utilized.
