The SSA-TPRF model was deployed on the GEE platform, indicating 
that  it  has  good  migration  performance  and  can  be  utilised for  LULC 
mapping,  wetland mapping,  crop mapping,  grassland mapping,  forest 
monitoring,  and  aboveground  biomass  estimation.  The  advent  of  the 
GEE has significantly advanced large-scale scientific research. The GEE, 
a nonprofit cloud-computing platform for geospatial analysis, offers an 
extensive  repository  of  Earth  observation  data,  various  classification 
algorithms, and robust cloud-computing capabilities, thereby providing 
an effective solution for processing RS data (Gorelick et al., 2017). The 
GEE's  user-friendly  programming  interface  empowers  users  to  define, 
create,  and  execute  custom  algorithms  tailored  to  their  analytical  re-
quirements  (Pizarro  et  al.,  2022).  This  feature  enables  researchers  to 
conduct  a  wide  range  of  large-scale  scientific  studies,  such  as  LULC
