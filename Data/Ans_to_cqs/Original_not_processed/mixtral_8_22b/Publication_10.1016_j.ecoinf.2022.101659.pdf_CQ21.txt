These may be inferred by combining more mechanistic models with the 
empirical laboratory experiments (e.g. Guarini et al., 2021). Given the 
availability of sensors and the fast development of technology, having 
big-data on valve gaping from a few sentinel organisms together with 
temperature  and  chlorophyll,  becomes  more  and  more  feasible  these 
days. Having such big-data should improve predictions on productivity, 
and be a major aid for aquaculture decision making, for multiple areas 
and species, especially in the context of ‘precision shellfish farming’.

Various models that relate clearance to environmental variables have 
been  proposed  and  reviewed  (Ehrich  and  Harris,  2015).  Given  the 
increasing emphasis on understanding the ecosystem services provided 
by  bivalves  and  their  potential  role  in  restoration  aquaculture  (e.g. 
nutrient  removal,  carbon  storage.),  it  is  important  for  clearance  and 
respiration to be modelled correctly (Ehrich and Harris, 2015). Ideally, 
gaping  behaviour  should  thus  be  introduced  in  bioenergetic  process- 
based individual models to correctly simulate clearance rate and respi-
ration. As filtration is costly in terms of energy expenditure (Riisgård 
and  Larsen,  2000),  mussels  might  close  their  valves  during  environ-
mental stressful periods or when food concentrations or food quality is 
low (Dolmer, 2000). This may lead to large differences in feeding rates 
as predicted from laboratory experiments and as occurs in situ.

(Jørgensen et al., 1988), changes to gaping can have long term conse-
quences on organisms energetics. Obtaining values of energetic expen-
diture  associated  with  valve  movements  would  be  highly  valuable  to 
gain a deeper understanding and to be able to model the consequences of 
gaping changes, not only in terms of its modulation of energy input, but 
also to account for associated energetic loss. Bioenergetic models can be 
used to inform both aquaculture practices and management measures: e. 
g. allocation of space for aquaculture (Bertolini et al., 2021b; Brigolin 
et  al.,  2017);  quantification  of  ecosystem  functioning  and  services 
associated both with aquaculture (Bertolini et al., 2021a; Brigolin et al., 
2009) and with naturally occurring populations. It would thus be useful 
to  apply  this  clustering  methodology,  which  yielded  some  consistent 
results amongst two species and two areas, to analyse gaping data from

gaping is linked to key metabolic functions like filtering water necessary 
for feeding and respiration.

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not directly address the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, confusion matrices, etc. However, based on general machine learning principles, here are some common postprocessing steps often taken after model training:

1. Model Evaluation: After training a model, evaluating its performance using appropriate evaluation metrics is crucial. These metrics could include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC AUC, etc., depending on the problem type (classification, regression, etc.).

2. Confusion Matrix: In classification tasks, creating a confusion matrix helps visualize the performance of the algorithm. Each row of the matrix represents the instances in an actual class while each column represents the instances in a predicted class.

3. Saliency Maps: For deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks used in image processing tasks, generating saliency maps can help understand what parts of the input images contribute most significantly to the final prediction.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning: Posttraining, hyperparameters can be fine-tuned to further optimize the model’s performance. Techniques like Grid Search, Randomized Search, Bayesian Optimization, etc., can be employed for this purpose.

5. Ensemble Methods: Combining several base models into one ensemble model can sometimes boost overall performance. Common techniques include bagging, boosting, stacking, etc.

6. Interpretability & Explainability: To better understand how the model makes decisions, various methods can be applied, including LIME, SHAP, Anchors, etc.

Please note that the exact postprocessing steps depend heavily on the nature of the task, the chosen algorithms, and the desired outcomes.
