guarantee  water  presence  in  the  lake.  However,  they  are  acting  too 
slowly to meet the change already occurring in the basin. Our results 
constitute the first numeric assessment of the timing and intensity of the 
change, which can be used as a reference for management planning.

4.3.2. Data limitations

Based on the omission rate of the training presence locations, MaxEnt 
also indicates potential thresholds on the probability distribution func-
tion,  over  which  the  cumulative  probability  of  species  presence  is 
sensibly  non-zero.  We  used  the  threshold  corresponding  to  the  value 
over which the model correctly predicted all training presence locations 
as  the  optimal decision  threshold  for dichotomic  classification  of suit-
able/unsuitable locations, in compliance with other studies (Coro, 2020; 
Coro and Trumpy, 2020; Liu et al., 2016; West et al., 2016).

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, based on general machine learning practices, some common postprocessing steps include calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., creating confusion matrices to visualize the performance of the classifier, generating saliency maps or heatmaps to understand the importance of different features, and using optimal decision thresholds for binary classification tasks. In this case, it appears that the authors have used an optimal decision threshold for dichotomous classification of suitable/unsuitable locations, but no further details regarding other postprocessing steps are mentioned.
