those conditions (Gutzwiller and Serno, 2023; Muckley et al., 2023). We 
expected that creating a mask to delineate the “area of applicability” for 
the trained model (Meyer and Pebesma, 2021) would successfully filter 
out a significant portion of regions lacking training data, particularly in

involves the separation of the training and test data beforehand. How-
ever, this approach can introduce bias, particularly when dealing with 
data that contains many zero values. Therefore, we strongly recommend 
that future research efforts adopt spatial cross-validation techniques to 
bolster model robustness. Spatial cross-validation operates by randomly 
selecting blocks of data for training while reserving others for testing. 
This process is repeated multiple times based on the number of specified 
folds. Through this iterative approach, the model refines its estimation 
of prediction errors, consequently enhancing overall model performance 
(Meyer et al., 2019).

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, it mentions the use of spatial cross-validation techniques to enhance model performance. This technique involves separating the training and test data beforehand, which could imply that some form of validation loss or error metric might be monitored during training to decide when to stop. The text also refers to Meyer et al. (2019), who discuss how spatial cross-validation helps refine the estimation of prediction errors through iteration. This suggests that tracking the improvement in prediction accuracy over time may play a role in deciding when to conclude training. Nevertheless, without more detailed information from the authors or additional sources, it is impossible to definitively state what exact criteria they employed to establish the completion of their models' training phase.
