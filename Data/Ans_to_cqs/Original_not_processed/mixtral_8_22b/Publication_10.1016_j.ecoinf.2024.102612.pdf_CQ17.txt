and  Mean  IoU  (MIoU).  Notably,  in  addition  to  the  comprehensive 
evaluation  provided  by  the  Overall  Accuracy  and  IoU,  their  mean 
counterparts  (MA  and  MIoU)  consider  the  individual  values  for  each 
class within the dataset and compute their average. This approach en-
hances the reliability of the classification results for imbalanced data. 
Furthermore, the highest MIoU value was employed to determine the 
point at which the DNN attained optimal performance. 

Finally, the selected SoftGroup architecture was trained over 1000 
epochs for each type of input data, and metrics such as MIoU or MA were 
computed after each epoch to analyse the training performance. Once 
trained, the configuration weights that achieved the best classification 
performance were selected to establish the reference trained model and, 
finally, it was used to perform predictions on the real MS point clouds 
collected in Section 2.3, i.e. the ground truth data.

convolutional layers and filters, and each variation is trained using input 
point clouds with different kernel configurations. The best results were 
achieved by the LSSegNet3 configuration with an 80.1% MIoU score, 
which  is  not  significantly  different  from  the  76.7%  achieved  in  this 
study.  However,  this  configuration  only  doubled  the  number  of  con-
volutional layers from the previous variations and increased the number 
of kernels used for the classifications; therefore, all the results can be

Moreover, enhancements in the classification outcomes of fuel types 
can be achieved using advanced DL classification models that can better 
handle  complex  and  high-dimensional  data  from  MS  geoinformation 
such as LiDAR point clouds or MS imagery. DL is a subfield of machine 
learning that uses Artificial NNs to learn from large datasets and make 
accurate predictions using new data (Sharma et al., 2021). The ability of 
DL models to learn complex patterns and relationships in data makes 
them particularly well-suited for fuel model retrieval, where there are 
often  many  variables  and  relationships  to  consider,  such  as  the  hori-
zontal and vertical continuities of different vegetal species (Skowronski 
et al., 2007). For instance, Kalinaki et al. (2023) used DL models such as 
U-Net  and  Deeplabv3+,  to  semantically  classify  forest  and  non-forest 
features  using  Sentinel-2  MS  imagery.  In  addition,  Marjani  et  al.

3.2. Fuel model retrieval 

Once the DL model is trained, a few samples of real MS point clouds 
are segmented using the methodology exposed in Section 2.3 to create a 
ground truth. This ground truth was required to validate the classifica-
tions using a DL model trained with synthetic data. As mentioned in the 
previous section, the best classification performance of the SoftGroup 
semantic branch was achieved by the MS input data case; therefore, this 
pretrained  model was  used,  and  its  efficiency was  tested  by  inferring 
these real MS point clouds (Fig. 9). In addition, these inferences on real 
MS point clouds are taken as inputs for the decision tree scheme pre-
sented in Section 2.5, where the final fuel models are retrieved. The final 
fuel model classifications are summarised in Table 3.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. Regularization methods like dropout and L2 regularization are commonly used techniques to avoid overfitting in deep learning models. Dropout randomly drops out neurons during training, while L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function to discourage large weights. However, without explicit mention in the provided text, we cannot confirm if these methods were utilized in this particular study.
