4.2.2 Data distribution  

In the machine learning literature, much research has focused on problems with imbalanced data 
(He  &  Garcia,  2009).  Previous  studies  have  noted  that  imbalanced  data  would  make  the 
significant negative impact on CNN models (J. N. Wang et al., 2017). To compare balanced data 
performance with imbalanced data, we used data resampling in training a new model. The new 
model covered six classes, where the classes are evenly distributed. Validation accuracy was only 
94% because the data size has decreased (Masko & Hensman, 2015). The recognition rate for the 
family Hesperiidae increased, and the other rates have changed at the same time (Table 3). 

We used images of six butterfly families to make our dataset because the image size and number 
are similar. The biological classification of these butterflies is recognized by taxonomists (M. Q. 
Zhou et al., 2006), so we can only use these known categories to make labels.

Image  classification  on  the  CNN  architecture  known  as  AlexNet  was  proposed  by  Alex 
Krizhevsky and won the 2012 ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (Krizhevsky 
et al., 2012). There are eight layers in the network, containing five convolutional layers and three 
fully connected layers (Fig. 3). All feature extractors were initialized with white Gaussian noise 
and learned from data, and the resulting feature maps were passed through rectified linear units 
(ReLUs),  a  type  of  non-linearity  unit.  The  model  was  trained  using  stochastic  gradient  descent 
and  the  backpropagation  algorithm  included  in  Caffe  (Jia  et  al.,  2014),  with  the  learning  rate 
policy set to “step”. The learning rate set to 10-2 for all layers initially for the reason of accept the 
newly  defined  last  fully  connected  layer  set  to  10-2.  The  learning  rate  (lr)  was  decreased  by  a

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some implicit strategies can be derived from the text.

Firstly, the context mentions that the experiments were conducted on a small dataset without data augmentation. This implies that one strategy to manage randomness might involve working with smaller datasets or avoiding techniques like data augmentation that introduce variability.

Secondly, the context discusses the importance of choosing proper parameters for the MG and MO models to achieve good training results. This suggests another potential strategy: carefully selecting and tuning hyperparameters to minimize the effects of randomness.

Lastly, the context describes how the model was trained using stochastic gradient descent and the backpropagation algorithm included in Caffe. Stochastic gradient descent itself introduces randomness into the optimization process, but this can be managed by setting appropriate learning rates and employing learning rate policies, as mentioned in the context.

However, it should be noted that these strategies are not explicitly stated as methods for dealing with randomness in the deep learning pipeline. They are merely interpretations based on the available context. For a more comprehensive understanding of managing randomness in deep learning pipelines, additional resources or expert knowledge may be required.
