The supervised learning workflow adheres to the steps outlined in 
Sections 2.3.1–2.3.5. However, as detailed in Section 2.3.2, we deviated 
by not generating 400 random points over the entire boundary. Instead, 
we used the vegetation types described by Gertenbach (1983) to guide 
the placement of our sampling plots, from which we then collected the 
training and validation points (Fig. A.2). The creation of several small 
sampling plots within each vegetation type, instead of using one large 
area, also helped speed up the sampling process. Performing the data 
collection  within  the  sampling  plots  ensured  that  we  had  training/ 
validation  points  that  were  representative  of  the  diverse  vegetation 
within each boundary. To determine the size of the sampling plots, we 
first calculated 5% of the total area covered by the boundary, divided 
that area by the number of vegetation types intersecting the boundary

The results obtained in this study can be used as a baseline for future 
LULC  analysis  performed  with  other  methodologies,  such  as  deep 
learning  CNN  (Jagannathan  and  Divya,  2021).  Going  forward,  the 
analysis  of  aerial  images  of  KNP  taken  about  every  two  years  deep 
learning methods will be most effective and useful to map land cover or 
more specifically woody cover. Integrating large-area historical datasets 
in  land-use  and  land-cover  analysis  can  serve  as  a  resource  to  better 
understanding  long-term  landscape  changes  and  support  ecological 
monitoring programs. The results of studies such as this one can be used 
to  better  protect  and  preserve  our  natural  heritage,  enable  effective 
management  strategies,  and  contribute  to  the  conservation  of  global 
biodiversity.

and then proceeded to label the sampling plots based on vegetation type. 
However, if a vegetation type was too small to accommodate the entire 
sampling plot, we placed the largest area within that vegetation type, 
while  assigning  the  remaining  area  to  the  nearest  largest  vegetation 
type.

Helpful Answer:

In the given context, the authors utilize a specific methodology for collecting raw data in their deep learning pipeline. They do not use traditional methods like surveys or sensors but rather employ a guided approach based on existing knowledge of vegetation types. Specifically, they create several small sampling plots within each vegetation type, as opposed to using one large area. This is done to ensure that the training and validation points collected are representative of the diverse vegetation within each boundary.

To determine the size of these sampling plots, they calculate 5% of the total area covered by the boundary and divide it by the number of vegetation types intersecting the boundary. Furthermore, if a vegetation type is too small to accommodate the entire sampling plot, they place the largest area within that vegetation type while assigning the remaining area to the nearest largest vegetation type.

Therefore, in summary, the authors collect raw data for their deep learning pipeline through the creation of multiple small sampling plots within each vegetation type, ensuring representation of diverse vegetation. The size of these plots is determined by calculating a certain percentage of the total area and dividing it by the number of intersecting vegetation types. In cases where a vegetation type is too small, adjustments are made accordingly.
