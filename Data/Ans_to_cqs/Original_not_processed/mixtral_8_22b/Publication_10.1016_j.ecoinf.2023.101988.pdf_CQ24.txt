Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline include setting a fixed random seed value, which ensures reproducibility of results across different runs or experiments. Another strategy is to use techniques such as cross-validation, bootstrapping, or bagging, which involve training multiple models with different subsets of data and averaging their predictions to reduce variance and improve generalization performance. Additionally, some researchers may choose to use deterministic algorithms instead of stochastic ones, or employ regularization techniques like dropout or weight decay to prevent overfitting and improve model robustness. However, it should be noted that these strategies have trade-offs and may not always lead to optimal solutions, so careful consideration must be given when deciding how best to manage randomness in any particular application.
