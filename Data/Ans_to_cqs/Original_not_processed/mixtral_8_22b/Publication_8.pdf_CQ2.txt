This   rising   number   of   digitised   herbarium   sheets   provides   an   opportunity   to   employ
computer-based   image   processing   techniques,   such   as   deep   learning,   to   automatically
identify species and higher taxa (Carranza-Rojas et al. 2017, Younis et al. 2018, Carranza-
Rojas   et   al.   2018)   or   to   extract   other   useful   information   from   the   images,   such   as   the
presence   of   pathogens   (as   done   for   live   plant   photos   by   Mohanty   et   al.   2016).   Deep
learning is a subset of machine learning methods for learning data representation. Deep
learning   techniques   require   huge   amounts   of   training   data   to   learn   the   features   and
representation of those data for the specified task by fine tuning parameters of hundreds or
thousands of neural networks, arranged in multiple layers. Learning the value of these
parameters can take vast computer and time resources, especially on huge datasets.

The most common type of deep learning network architecture being used for extracting
image   features   is   the   Convolutional   Neural   Network   (CNN)   (LeCun   and   Bengio   1995).
A convolutional neural network extracts the features of an image by passing through a
series of convolutional, non-linear, pooling (image downsampling) layers and passes them
to a fully connected layer to obtain the desired output. Each convolutional layer extracts the
visual features of the image by applying convolution operations to the image with kernels,
using a local receptive field, to produce feature maps and passing it as input to the next
layer. The initial layers in the network compute primitive features on the image, such as
corners   and   edges,   the   deeper   layers   use   these   features   to   compute   more   complex
features consisting  of curves and  basic  shapes  and  the   deepest   layers  combine  these

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images. This is evident from the numerous references to images throughout the text, including phrases like "digitized herbarium sheets," "computer-based image processing techniques," and "Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)," which is specifically designed for processing grid-like topology data such as images. Furthermore, the context mentions studies that have employed deep learning techniques for tasks such as identifying species and higher taxa from images, extracting visual features from images using CNNs, and detecting pathogens in live plant photos. Therefore, it can be concluded that the main data format used in this particular deep learning pipeline is images. However, without additional context, it cannot be determined whether other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV files are also utilized in the overall deep learning process.
