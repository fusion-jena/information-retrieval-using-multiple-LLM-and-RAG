Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

we utilize 2 to 10 clusters to find the appropriate number of freshness 
clusters for each species.

to experiment with the number and range of freshness classes using a 
clustering approach. For each fish, we automatically identify the num-
ber  of  classes  and  their  duration,  evaluating  them  using  the  elbow 
method. The significant prevalence of automatic computing minimizes 
subjectivity, enhancing the objectivity of our findings.

fish.  This  stage  is  also  referred  to  as  the  generation  of  fish  freshness 
report dataset, as presented in Table 2. The freshness inspection data 
indicates that all species received the best and worst scores on days 1 
and 11, respectively, with scores of 9 and 1, respectively. Consequently, 
the freshness data obtained spans 11 days. Each day reflects a gradual 
degradation  in  the  freshness  value  of  fish  in  each  parameter,  though 
each species exhibits a different degradation rate. For example, Oreo-
chromis mossambicus experiences a higher rate of freshness degradation 
than Rastrelliger Faughni.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or any specific strategies related to it, such as managing random seed values. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based on the given context.

Based on general knowledge, some common strategies used to manage randomness in deep learning pipelines include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, employing techniques like cross-validation, averaging results from multiple runs, and using deterministic algorithms where possible. However, these strategies are not mentioned or discussed in the provided context.
