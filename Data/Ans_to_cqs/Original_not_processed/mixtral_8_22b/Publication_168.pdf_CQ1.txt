On the other hand, since the powerful feature extraction 
capabilities, the deep learning methods have succeed in many 
fields,  such  as  computer  vision  and  natural  language 
processing. In recently, the deep learning based methods have 
also  been  used  to  solve  the  HSI  classification  task  and 
achieved remarkable achievements. Among the deep learning 
methods,  the  Convolutional  Neural  Networks  (CNNs)  are 
most widely explored to solve the HSI classification task. Hu 
et  al.  [4]  designed  a  one-dimensional  convolutional  neural 
network(1-D-CNN) for classification according to the spectral 
feature  of  HSI.  Due  to  the  insufficient  training  data,  the 
designed  1-D-CNN  just  includes  a  convolution  operation,  a 
pooling operation and a fully connected operation. Although 
the structure of  designed 1-D-CNN is simple, it achieved a 
satisfactory  classification  performance.  The  classification

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of hyperspectral images (HSIs) for forest species classification tasks. Hyperspectral images can be collected using various remote sensing techniques, including satellite or airborne platforms equipped with specialized cameras or spectrometers. These devices capture detailed spectral signatures across numerous narrow bands, providing rich information for analysis. Additionally, the paper references several studies that utilize HSIs for classification tasks, which may involve publicly available datasets or custom collections depending on the research objectives. Therefore, while the exact methodology for gathering raw data isn't specified here, we can infer that remote sensing technologies play a crucial role in acquiring hyperspectral images for deep learning applications.
