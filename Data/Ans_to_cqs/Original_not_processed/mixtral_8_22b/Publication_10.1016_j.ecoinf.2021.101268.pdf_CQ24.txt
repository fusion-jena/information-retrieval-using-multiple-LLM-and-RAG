Deep Learning (DL) methods are at the top of the state-of-the-art on 
feature representation for different domains; albeit, DL lacks interpret-
ability. According to Doshi-Velez and Kim (2017), interpretability lets 
human specialists understand what a model is learning, making them 
flexible  real-world  solutions.  Given  such  topics,  this  paper  has  three 
significant contributions:  

1.  The  paper  introduces  the  first  Peruvian  Amazon  Forestry  Dataset, 
including  its  detailed  metadata  and  the  acquisition  protocol 
description. The dataset collects 59,441 samples from ten of the most 
profitable  and  endangered species (Finer  et al., 2014; Pinedo-Vas-
quez et al., 1992). Further-more, we employ six different commercial 
cameras  to  ensure  variability  and  to  develop  any  flexible  solution 
with real-world conditions in the future.

model. These methods plot a point cloud, where the density denotes the 
input space relevance. Thus, a higher density in a region suggests that 
the network ponderates it the most when classifying.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, including the use of random seed values. However, some common practices used to manage randomness include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, averaging multiple runs with different initializations, or applying techniques like ensemble learning to combine predictions from various models trained with different random seeds.
