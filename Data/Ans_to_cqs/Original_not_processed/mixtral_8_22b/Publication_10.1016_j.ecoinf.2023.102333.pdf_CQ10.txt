Sustainable natural resources management relies on effective and timely assessment of conservation and land 
management practices. Using satellite imagery for Earth observation has become essential for monitoring land 
cover/land use (LCLU) changes and identifying critical areas for conserving biodiversity. Remote Sensing (RS) 
datasets  are  often  quite  large  and require  tremendous  computing power  to  process.  The  emergence  of  cloud- 
based  computing  techniques  presents  a  powerful  avenue  to  overcome  computing  limitations  by  allowing 
machine-learning algorithms to process and analyze large RS datasets on the cloud. Our study aimed to classify 
LCLU for the Talassemtane National Park (TNP) using a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model incorporating five 
spectral indices to differentiate six land use classes using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Optimization of the DNN
