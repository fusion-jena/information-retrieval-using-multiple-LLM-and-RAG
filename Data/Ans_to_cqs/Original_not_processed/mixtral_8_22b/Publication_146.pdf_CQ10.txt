Due to the lack of existing quality data, we set out to create our own data set for the purpose of
the project. The data set created is, in a deep learning context, still at a relatively small size. However,
testing the model under very diﬃcult circumstances and complex backgrounds still yielded good
detection capabilities, paving the way for future work.

Model training was carried out on a NVIDIA Quadro M4000 GPU with 8 GB of memory,
with a training time of 4.9 min per epoch. With the adaptive learning rate algorithms usually yielding
higher model accuracies than static ones [16], the Adam learning rate optimizer was chosen over the
static stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Both the basic SGD and its further adaptive developments are
popular in neural network applications [17], but given the ﬁndings of [18,19], which proved Adam’s
usefulness on relatively small datasets (less than 1000 images), the Adam optimizer is chosen for
the model of this study. Hyperparameter setting was completed based on studies who successfully
implemented Yolo in remote sensing cases. The author of the Yolo-based “Yolt” model [14] suggests
implementing the same hyperparameters as the Yolo model. The default parameters of YoloV3 are
0.001, 0.9 and 0.0005 for the learning rate momentum and weight decay, respectively, and we decided

The initial objects are outlined as vectors in the given Sentinel-1 images (see Figure 2), and they are
converted into the darknet annotation format with text ﬁles containing information on the label class
of objects and positions in the image. The Sentinel-1 images are cropped into image tiles in the sizes of
640 × 640 pixels, resulting in a total of 1609 images with corresponding label ﬁles. Code for darknet
conversion is available at GitHub (see Supplementary Materials). Out of these images, 20% (322) are
selected as validation data, and the remaining 80% (1288) for model training.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the provided context to directly provide the exact code repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in this project. However, it does mention that the code for darknet conversion is available at GitHub within the supplementary materials. This implies that some parts of the code might be accessible through additional resources related to this research. To find the specific code repository link, one would need more detailed information about the project or access to those supplementary materials.
