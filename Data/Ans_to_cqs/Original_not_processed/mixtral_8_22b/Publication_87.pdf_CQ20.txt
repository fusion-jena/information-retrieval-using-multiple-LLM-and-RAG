Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Then we get the model architecture. For the sake of illustration, we use a resnet18 here, but we used
a resnet50 to get the full results presented in the main text.

learn <- cnn_learner(dls = dls,

arch = resnet18(),
metrics = list(accuracy, error_rate))

Now we are ready to train our model. Again, for the sake of illustration, we use only 2 epochs here,
but used 20 epochs to get the full results presented in the main text. With all pictures and a resnet50,
it took 75 minutes per epoch approximatively on a Mac with a 2.4Ghz processor and 64Go memory,
and less than half an hour on a machine with GPU. On this reduced dataset, it took a bit more than
a minute per epoch on the same Mac. Note that we save the model after each epoch for later use.

one_cycle <- learn %>%

fit_one_cycle(2, cbs = SaveModelCallback(every_epoch = TRUE,

fname = 'model'))

Here, we showcase a full why-what-how workflow in R using a case study on the structure of an
ecological community (a set of co-occurring species) composed of the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx)
and its two main preys. First, we introduce the case study and motivate the need for deep learning.
Second we illustrate deep learning for the identification of animal species in large amounts of images,
including model training and validation with a dataset of labelled images, and prediction with a
new dataset of unlabelled images. Last, we proceed with the quantification of spatial co-occurrence
using statistical models.

2 Collecting images with camera traps

This result calls for further work on the trade-offs between time and resources allocated to train
models with deep learning and our ability to correctly answer key ecological questions with camera-
trap surveys. In other words, while a computer scientist might be keen on spending time training
models to achieve top performances, an ecologist would rather rely on a model showing average
performances and use this time to proceed with statistical analyses if, of course, errors in computer-
annotated images do not make ecological inference flawed. The right balance may be found with
collaborative projects in which scientists from artificial intelligence, statistics and ecology agree on
a common objective, and identify research questions that can pick the interest of all parties.

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not explicitly state whether GPUs were used during the training process. However, there is mention of a significant reduction in training time when using a machine equipped with a GPU compared to one without. This suggests that GPUs were likely utilized for accelerating the training process. Specifically, the passage states that training on a machine with a GPU took less than half an hour per epoch, whereas training on a Mac with a 2.4GHz processor and 64GB of memory took approximately 75 minutes per epoch. Therefore, it can be inferred that GPUs were indeed employed for training the deep learning model.
