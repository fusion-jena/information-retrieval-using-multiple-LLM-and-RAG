layers. ANNs require a substantial amount of training data to achieve 
effective learning. Among ANN architectures, the multi-layer perceptron 
(MLP) neural network stands out as the most used.

During  the  MLPNN  training  phase,  initial  arbitrary  connection 
weights were assigned. Inputs were forward-fed from the input to the 
hidden  layer.  Hidden  neurons  multiplied  inputs  by  weights,  summed 
products,  and  processed  sums  through  a  transfer  function.  Results 
propagated  to  the  output  layer,  with  output  values  compared  to  ex-
pected  values  for  error  computation.  Iterative  error  back-propagation 
adjusted  connection  weights  until  reaching  a  target  minimal  error. 
The network then accurately estimated carbon stocks for both training 
and new input data without training data. This required tests to deter-
mine optimal learning rate (0.01), momentum (0.18), and training it-
erations  (500).  The  trained  network  was  subsequently  used  for  feed- 
forward predictions on continuous spatial data.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, the context does provide information about the use of various types of data in different studies related to environmental change, land cover classification, and biomass estimation.

For instance, the study by Domingues et al. (2020) uses integrated multispectral and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data for high-performance prediction of eucalyptus biomass using artificial neural networks. Similarly, Dube and Mutanga (2015) evaluate the utility of Landsat 8 multispectral sensor in quantifying aboveground biomass in South Africa. Memon et al. (2019) compare the performance of artificial neural networks and XGBoost algorithms for PolSAR image classification.

In addition, Miller (2014) provides a comprehensive overview of 520,000 years of environmental change in West Africa, while Douwes et al. (2015) present findings from the Buffelsdraai Landfill Site Community Reforestation Project. Mngadi et al. (2021a) explore the utility of Sentinel-2 spectral data in quantifying above-ground carbon stock in an urban reforested landscape, and Mngadi et al. (2021b) examine the effectiveness of Sentinel-1 and 2 imagery for commercial forest species mapping.

Overall, while the context does not explicitly state which datasets were used in the deep learning pipeline, it does indicate that various types of remote sensing data, including multispectral, SAR, and satellite imagery, have been employed in similar studies.
