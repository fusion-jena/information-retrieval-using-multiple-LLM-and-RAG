The  PLUS  model  consists  of  two  main  modules:  the  transformed 
specification mining framework based on the land expansion analysis 
strategy (LEAS) module and the cellular automata (CA) model based on 
a multi-type random patch seed mechanism (CARS). In the LEAS mod-
ule, the PLUS model employs the random forest algorithm to obtain the 
development probabilities of each land use type based on two periods of 
land use data. This approach is considered superior to the FLUS model, 
which  uses  an  artificial  neural  network  (ANN)  to  determine  develop-
ment  probabilities  based  on  only  one  period  of  land  use  data.  Addi-
tionally,  the  PLUS  model  proposes  a  decreasing  threshold  rule  for 
generating  patch  seeds.  This  gradual  constraint  on  patch  growth  of 
various land use types is achieved through the iterative process. Cells 
with a higher total probability are more likely to change preferentially

The NDVI data utilized was the MOD13Q1.006 dataset, an L3 image 
product with a spatial resolution of 250 m, updated every 16 days. The 
NDVI value is the monthly maximum value synthesized by the maximum 
value synthesis method. The vegetation type data was reclassified into 
nine  categories:  evergreen  needle-leaved  forest  (ENF),  deciduous 
needle-leaved  forest  (DNF),  deciduous  broadleaved  forest  (DBF), 
mingled  forest  (MF),  shrub,  grassland,  wetland,  arable  land  and  non- 
vegetation.  The  Google  Earth  Engine  (GEE)  platform  was  utilized  to 
obtain and crop the NDVI and vegetation type data. The DEM data was 
obtained from the Resource and Environmental Science and Data Center 
of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, using the SRTM V4.1 dataset after 
resampling.

Query: "What are the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there isn't any explicit mention of how the data was split for deep learning model training (train, test, validation). However, it can be assumed that standard practices were followed such as splitting the data into three sets - training set, testing set, and validation set. Typically, the data is divided randomly where around 60-80% of the data is used for training, 20-30% for testing, and a small portion (around 10%) for validation. These percentages may vary depending upon the size of the dataset and specific requirements of the project.

Unhelpful Answer:
I am not sure about the exact criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training in this case. It would require additional information or assumptions to provide a definitive answer.
