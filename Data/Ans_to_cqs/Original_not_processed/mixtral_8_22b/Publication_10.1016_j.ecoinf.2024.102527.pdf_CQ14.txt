respectively.  N  represented  the  number  of  images  in  the  test  set  or 
validation set. 

2.2.6. Model training and hyper-parameters 

We  trained  models  on  the  training  sets  and  tracked  the  model 
training process on the validation set. The training process was stopped 
when  the  loss  value  of  the  model  on  the  validation  set  no  longer 
decreased. We then tested the model performance on the test set. Our 
computing platform was a Dell PowerEdge C4130 rack server with two 
Tesla  K80  GPUs  and  256  GB  of  memory.  For  the  deep  learning  envi-
ronment,  we  utilized  the  PyTorch  1.7.1  platform.  We  employed  the 
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer with a momentum value of 
μ  = 0.9 to train the model. Other hyper-parameter settings for model 
training were shown in Table S.4 of the Supporting Information.

The main  objective  of  this  experiment  was  to  investigate how  the 
source model affects the performance of the transfer learning model. We 
focused on two key aspects of the source domain training set used to

Regarding source model construction, we suggest that practitioners 
with abundant computational resources should build the source model 
with a larger number of readily available labeled samples. Doing so can 
contribute  to  improved  transfer  learning  performance.  However,  for 
those  with  limited  computational  resources,  it  may  be  necessary  to 
compromise between sample size and computational resources based on 
the potential threshold effect.

S_10_10 dataset to the LSM dataset. (a) Accuracies of models under different transfer strategies. The abscissa represented the training set sample size (in thousands of 
images). (b) The binomial test probability values between the best-performing transfer strategy and other transfer strategies. The TFS meant that the model was 
trained from scratch. The TLS_i (i = 1, 2, …, 5) represented that different layers of the ResNext-101 model were selected for updating. A probability value <0.05 
indicated a significant difference.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about the specific method used for hyperparameter optimization such as grid search or random search. However, it does mention that they employed Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer with a momentum value of μ = 0.9 to train the model. It also states that other hyper-parameter settings for model training were shown in Table S.4 of the Supporting Information. Therefore, without access to the supporting information, it cannot be determined exactly which methods were used for hyperparameter optimization.
