of 16 images to train our network. We ran this architecture on Caﬀe (Jia
et al., 2014). To focus on the impact of the training data, we used the
same CNN architecture for our training and test procedures.

2.3. Building the training datasets

Using the raw training dataset of 20 ﬁsh species (Table S1) we built
4 diﬀerent datasets to assess the inﬂuence of the dataset building on
classiﬁcation results (Table S2).

The ﬁrst training dataset T1 contained raw ﬁsh thumbnails (T0) and

their respective mirror images.

More precisely, we doubled the number of thumbnails per ﬁsh in-
dividual by ﬂipping each thumbnail with respect to the vertical axis.
Such a procedure homogenizes the proportion of left-oriented and
right-oriented individuals in the database and we hypothesize it could
improve the average identiﬁcation rate since ﬁsh individuals are seen in
all positions.

The model was trained using thumbnails of whole ﬁsh, part of ﬁsh species and
environment (T?). Raw outputs were post-processed applying two decision
rules: (r1) keeping most likely ﬁsh class if “environment” was the most likely
class, and (r2) considering “part of species X" equivalent to “species X".

(89.3%). The CNN was also able to identify ﬁsh individuals partially hidden behind corals or behind other ﬁsh
and was more eﬀective than humans to identify ﬁsh on smallest or blurry images while humans were better to
identify ﬁsh individuals in unusual positions (e.g. twisted body). On average, each identiﬁcation by our best CNN
using a common hardware took 0.06 s. Deep Learning methods can thus perform eﬃcient ﬁsh identiﬁcation on
underwater images and oﬀer promises to build-up new video-based protocols for monitoring ﬁsh biodiversity
cheaply and eﬀectively.

Helpful Answer:

In the given context, there is no explicit mention of the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information available, we can infer that underwater images were collected as part of the raw data. These images may have been obtained through various means such as cameras mounted on remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), or even divers equipped with cameras.

The paper mentions the use of a dataset containing 20 fish species, which suggests that the raw data collection involved capturing images of these species in their natural habitat. This could be achieved through dedicated surveys or expeditions aimed at documenting marine life. Additionally, the authors refer to the use of 'thumbnails,' indicating that the raw data might have been preprocessed to extract smaller image samples from larger images or videos.

While the exact methodology for collecting raw data remains unclear, it is evident that the study relied heavily on visual data in the form of underwater images. Further research into the cited papers or related literature would provide more detailed insights into the specific techniques employed for gathering raw data in this particular deep learning application.
