Batch normalization and dropout layers were adopted to assist in the 
feature extraction of the convolutional layers. The feature generalization 
of  the  input  mini-batch  was  performed  by  calculating  the  mean  and 
standard deviation of the batch normalization layer to avoid covariate 
shifts  (Cooijmans  et  al.,  2016).  Overfitting  of  the  CNN  model  was 
reduced  using  a  dropout  layer  that  inactivates  random  nodes  that 
contain learnable weights (Ashiquzzaman et al., 2018). Fully connected 
layers  obtain  processed  features  using  convolutional  operations  for 
classification  or  regression  tasks.  CNN  model  training  adjusts  the 
weights  by  conducting  backpropagation,  whereas  the  loss  function 
minimizes  the  error between  the observed and  estimated results.  The 
gradient  descent  algorithm  iteratively  updates  kernel  weights  by 
calculating the partial derivative of the loss function with respect to each

This  study  adopted  an  autoencoder,  which  is  an  unsupervised 
learning algorithm. It consists of an encoder and a decoder network that 
work together to learn an efficient representation of input data (Badri-
narayanan  et  al.,  2017).  During  training,  the  encoder  compresses  the 
input  data  into  a  lower-dimensional  latent  space,  while  the  decoder 
reconstructs the original input data from this compressed representation 
(Ng, 2011). In particular, effective dimensionality reduction was ach-
ieved using an encoder (Wang et al., 2016). The manifold nodes of the 
encoding layer represent the nonlinear features of the input data (Charte 
et al., 2018; Jia et al., 2015b). Specifically, the encoding layer is utilized 
for  further  application  to  the  input  of  sequential  machine  learning 
models (Ahmadlou et al., 2021; Ju et al., 2015; Shahi et al., 2022). Based 
on the latent information in the encoding layer, the decoder regenerates

To  determine  the  optimal  data-driven  model,  the  conventional 
model performances were compared with the estimation performances 
of the CNN and the CNN with the autoencoder. The ANN model uses 
hidden nodes in hidden layers with learnable weights to extract input 
data. The principles of feature extraction and model training are similar 
to those of the autoencoder and CNN models. Six hidden layers were 
designed  with  128,  128,  256,  256,  512,  and  512  nodes.  The  output 
layers with three nodes estimated the three indices. The loss function 
and optimizer were set as the mean squared error and Adam optimizer, 
respectively, at a learning rate of 0.001. The SVM regression model was 
designed to estimate TDI, BMI, and FAI. The kernel function, C-param-
eter, and gamma of the SVM were set to radial basis functions of 100 and 
0.1, respectively. The SVM was unable to estimate the indices simulta-
neously. The RF uses an ensemble regressor by applying multiple deci-

learning rate was initially set to 0.001; however, this value was auto-
matically adjusted to determine the optimum point, resulting in the best 
performance of the CNN model. The early stopping option stopped the 
model training at a specific epoch where the model validation accuracy 
could not be improved.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit details about the preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning models mentioned. However, it can be inferred that some form of preprocessing was carried out based on the use of certain techniques within the models themselves. For instance, batch normalization was used to perform feature generalization of the input mini-batch by calculating the mean and standard deviation. This process helps in avoiding covariate shifts, suggesting that some sort of normalization might have been applied during preprocessing. Additionally, dropout layers were employed to reduce overfitting by randomly inactivating nodes containing learnable weights. While these techniques do not directly indicate specific preprocessing steps like scaling or cleaning, they imply that measures were taken to ensure the quality and appropriateness of the input data for training the deep learning models.
