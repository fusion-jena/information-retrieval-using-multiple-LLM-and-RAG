To train the EfficientNet, we prepared 4000 images for each category 
using the data augmentation method proposed above. We used 80% of 
the 4000 images for training and the remaining 20% for validation. The 
EfficientNet was trained by the Adagrad in 100 epochs. The dropout rate 
for each task was set at 0.5. The batch size was set at 20. 

All evaluations were performed on the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080Ti 
GPU with 11G memory, and the software was Windows 10, Python 3.7, 
CUDA 10.2. Keras 2.4.3 were used to build all models. 

To compare model results with the test video, we used IoU as the 
threshold  for  positives  or  negatives  based  on  the  object  confidence 
scores estimated by the object detector. IoU was defined as the inter-
section  over  the  union  of  the  two  bounding  boxes,  which  were  the 
ground-truth  bounding  box  and  the  predicted  bounding  box.  In  this 
paper, we set the threshold of IoU at 0.3 to consider correct or incorrect 
detection results.

these methods. By applying random erasing to the training dataset of the 
EfficientNet, performance was also moderately improved (Table 6).

2.3. Data augmentation 

Although  optimizing  many  parameters  of  CNN  based  on  deep 
learning required a large dataset, there were only small datasets for pest 
detection and identification. Existing datasets only had approximately 
100 images for each type (Samanta and Ghosh, 2012; Rustia et al., 2018; 
Xia  et  al.,  2018;  He  et  al.,  2019;  Wang  et  al.,  2012;  Venugoban  and 
Ramanan, 2014; Xie et al., 2018; Deng et al., 2018). To obtain a more 
generalized model, training data should have fine diversity as the ob-
jects varied in size, lighting conditions, and poses. To circumvent the 
limited quantity and diversity of training data, data augmentation was a 
useful technique that could increase the size of the training set without

The  past  development  of  CNN  was  synonymous  to  the  increased 
depth of the network. By increasing the depth and widening the channel 
size, a more complex network achieved a high resolution of the image 
data. In addition, it resulted in more fine-grained characteristics. This 
development in the network size improved the classification accuracy of 
the network, but also led to the problem of the high computational cost 
of the gradient explosion parameter. ResNet (He et al., 2015) proposed 
that skip connection could avoid gradient explosion skillfully. Mobile-
Net (Howard et al., 2017) used pointwise and depthwise convolutions to 
reduce network parameters and improve training efficiency. The SENet 
(Hu et al., 2017) weighted various features by loss of network training in 
order to achieve better results in model training.

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, one regularization method is mentioned to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline - Dropout. The dropout rate for each task was set at 0.5 during the training process of the EfficientNet model. Dropout is a commonly used regularization technique in neural networks where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent overfitting by making the model more robust and reducing its dependency on individual neurons. Other common regularization techniques not explicitly mentioned in the context include L1 and L2 regularizations, early stopping, and weight decay. These methods help control the complexity of the model and reduce overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function or limiting the number of iterations during training.
