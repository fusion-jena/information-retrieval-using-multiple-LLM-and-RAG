3. The study area and data

Table 1 
The list of features. We utilize two feature sets selected through different CV 
processes  in  a  previous  study  (Mechenich  et  al.,  2024),  which  we  name  the 
‘random-CV’ feature set and the ‘spatial-CV’ feature set, respectively. The two 
feature sets share six common features.

Following this, forward feature selection (FFS) was performed. FFS is 
a  common  stepwise  selection  procedure  (Hastie  et  al.,  2020),  which 
begins with an empty model, and iteratively selects the next feature from 
the initial set which most improves model performance. Candidate lo-
gistic  regression  and  random  forest  models  were  evaluated  via  (1) 
random cross-validation (CV) and (2) spatial CV (Roberts et al., 2017), 
in which the full training dataset was partitioned into spatial blocks like 
those shown in Fig. 2. 

Because model performance estimated via spatial CV is dependent on 
the spatial configuration of the CV folds, the procedure was repeated 
over 100 random blocking configurations; those features selected most 

Fig.  2. One  spatial-CV  fold  pattern  used  in  feature  selection.  This  particular 
fold was also utilized when calculating numerical scores for the models.

The  iterative  model  exploration  in  this  work  roughly  follows  the 
Bayesian workflow described by Gelman et al. (Gelman et al., 2020). The 
Bayesian and non-Bayesian model pairs are chosen so that one repre-
sents  a  less  flexible  model  in  terms  of  possible  shapes  of  its  decision 
boundary (Bayesian logistic regression and MLE logistic regression) and 
one  represents  a  more  flexible  model  (Bayesian  GAM  and  random 
forest).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no information about any specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotation, or scaling. Instead, the text discusses the use of two feature sets named 'random-CV' and'spatial-CV', which have been selected using different cross-validation processes. These feature sets include various climate variables obtained from WorldClim and ETCCDI sources. Furthermore, the context mentions the application of forward feature selection (FFS) and evaluation of candidate logistic regression and random forest models using both random cross-validation (CV) and spatial CV methods. However, these procedures do not directly relate to data augmentation techniques typically employed in deep learning pipelines.
