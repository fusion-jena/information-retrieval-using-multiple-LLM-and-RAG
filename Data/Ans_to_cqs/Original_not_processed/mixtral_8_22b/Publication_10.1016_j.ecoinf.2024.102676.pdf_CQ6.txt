To  further  enhance  the  Footprint  Identification  Technique  (FIT) 
method,  we  recommend  collecting  imperfect  footprints  when  high- 
quality  footprints  are  insufficient  during  field  surveys.  Instead  of  dis-
carding incomplete prints, we advocate using missing value imputation 
as  part  of  the  data  preprocessing  pipeline.  This  approach  preserves 
valuable data and improves the accuracy of FIT predictions when sub- 
quality footprints are included. Our findings are supported by a study 
using  deep  learning  models  to  classify  three  sympatric  otter  species, 
where a model trained on images of all qualities was only marginally 
outperformed  by  a  model  trained  on  high-quality  prints,  highlighting 
the  potential  of  utilizing  lower  quality  data  effectively  Kistner  et  al.

approach can transform the ability to use data of lower quality. This is of 
particular  value  for  population  estimate  surveys.  Therefore,  our  pro-
posed approach could widen the range of FIT and we encourage future 
development of new species algorithms for which the number of high- 
quality prints in a trail found in situ is usually lower.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about specific preprocessing steps used before training a deep learning model. However, it mentions one important step - missing value imputation. Missing value imputation is a method used to fill in missing values in a dataset with substituted values. It is often performed prior to applying machine learning techniques such as deep learning. Other common preprocessing steps include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization rescales features so they have similar magnitudes, while scaling adjusts the range of feature values. Cleaning involves removing or correcting erroneous data points. These steps help improve the performance and efficiency of deep learning models.
