Recent  research  has  demonstrated  the  effectiveness  of  leveraging 
single-algorithm ensemble methods to improve the predictability of ML- 
based  LSM.  Notable  algorithms  in  this  category  include  the  Random 
Forest  (RF)  model  as  demonstrated  by  studies  such  as  (Achour  and 
Pourghasemi,  2020;  Adnan  et  al.,  2020;  Akinci  et  al.,  2021;  Kalantar 
et al., 2020; Youssef and Pourghasemi, 2021). Additionally, the XGBoost 
model  as  indicated  by  (Badola  et  al.,  2023)  and  (Can  et  al.,  2021), 
LightGBM (Ye et al., 2022), and AdaBoost (Gupta and Shukla, 2023; Nhu 
et al., 2020) have been recognized for their ability to improve the ac-
curacy  of  ML-based  LSM  (Adnan  et  al.,  2020).  In  addition  to  single- 
algorithm  ensembles,  mixed-based  algorithm  ensembles,  which 
combine different models, have also shown promise in improving LSM 
performance. These ensemble techniques, such as stacking (Fang et al.,

loss function, effectively preventing overfitting and promoting simpler 
models,  utilization  of  a  more  advanced  optimization  approach  that 
combines  first-order  gradients  (loss  function  gradient)  with  second- 
order  gradients  (loss  function  curvature)  which  makes  it  faster  than 
some other models, ability to handle missing data during tree building 
by  employing  weighted  quantile  sketch,  built-in  cross-validation  sup-
port  that  aids  the  model  evaluation  and  hyperparameter  tuning,  and 
imbalanced  data  handling.  Thanks  to  its  exceptional  efficiency  and 
performance and its availability in various programming languages like 
Python, R, and Java, XGBoost has found widespread adoption in land-
slide risk assessment (Akinci et al., 2021; Badola et al., 2023; Can et al., 
2021; Hussain et al., 2022b).

Huang et al., 2022; Y. Huang and Zhao, 2018; Shahzad et al., 2022; Xing 
et al., 2021). These models are flexible and adaptable systems that can 
manage diverse types of data and scenarios for LSM. Another type of 
MLM that has been explored for LSM is the Artificial Neural Network 
(ANN), especially in the Radial Basis Function (RBF) (W. Chen et al., 
2018; Ngo et al., 2021) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) configuration 
(Adnan  et  al.,  2020;  Chang  et  al.,  2022;  Z.  Zhao  et  al.,  2022).  These 
models can learn from data and adjust their parameters to improve their 
performance.

2.2.6. Heterogenous ensemble techniques 

Heterogeneous ensemble learning is the practice of combining pre-
dictions of multiple models that are different in terms of their underlying 
algorithms  or  architectures  to  improve  overall  performance.  Utilizing 
heterogeneous ensemble techniques can address biases and improve the 
implemented  two

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide explicit information on the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into sets such as train, test, and validation. However, common practices in machine learning involve splitting the dataset into these subsets using random sampling or stratified sampling techniques. Typically, the dataset is divided into three parts: training set, validation set, and testing set. The training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set helps tune the model's hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Lastly, the testing set evaluates the final model's performance. Common ratios for splitting datasets are 70/15/15 or 80/10/10 for training, validation, and testing respectively.
