The  algorithm  includes  two  steps:  training  and  prediction.  In  the 
training phase, the following parameters where defined, based on tests: 
the  learning  rate  (0.001),  the  batch  size  (1,000),  the  number  of  in-
teractions  (7,000),  and  the  inputs  for  classification  were  the  spectral 
data acquired from the training samples of spectral bands defined based 
on the burned and non-burned areas. The following Lansat-8 spectral 
bands were used for the classification model of burned areas: red (RED - 
0.65 μm), near-infrared (NIR - 0.86 μm), and shortwave infrared (SWIR 
1 - 1.6 μm and SWIR 2 - 2.2 μm). In addition to those selected spectral 
bands, Landsat bands 2 to 7, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation 
Index), NBR, and delta NBR (Difference Normalizes Burned Index) were 
tested. The Landsat spectral bands were chosen because of their sensi-
tiveness to fire events. The input of the training data was split into two

sets; 70% of the samples were used for training and 30% for testing, to 
estimate the ability of the DNN algorithm to map burned areas in the 
study  area.  In  this  step,  an  accuracy  is  generated  for  each  algorithm 
applied, however, it is biased because it uses the same sample sets to test 
the model. So, an additional accuracy assessment using those validation 
points was conducted in our analysis.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
After the model training, there are several postprocessing steps involved. One such step is calculating metrics to evaluate the performance of the trained model. These metrics can include overall accuracy, producer's accuracy, user's accuracy, and total accuracy. Another important postprocessing step is creating a confusion matrix, which provides a summary of the predictions made by the classifier compared to the actual values. It shows the number of correct and incorrect predictions broken down by each category. Additionally, saliency maps can be created to visualize the importance of different features in making predictions. However, the specific postprocessing steps may vary depending on the type of machine learning task and the requirements of the project.

In the given context, the authors mention conducting an additional accuracy assessment using validation points to estimate the ability of the DNN algorithm to map burned areas in the study area. They also provide a confusion matrix between reference (sample points) and estimated burned area (MODIS Burned Area MCD64A1) to compare the predicted results with the actual values. Therefore, we can infer that the postprocessing steps involved in this study included calculating metrics such as overall accuracy, producer's accuracy, user's accuracy, and total accuracy, as well as generating a confusion matrix.
