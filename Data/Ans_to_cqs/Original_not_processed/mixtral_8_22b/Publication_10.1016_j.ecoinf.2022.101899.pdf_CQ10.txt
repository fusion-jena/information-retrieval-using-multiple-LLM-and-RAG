Using  the  Code  Editor  tool,  97  images  were  extracted  from  April 
2013 to July 2021. In total, 9841 areas in the forest were analyzed, and 
NDVI  data  was  extracted.  The  method  involved  using  the  map  func-
tionality of the Code Editor tool and scripting all the required calcula-
tions in JavaScript. Mean NDVI scores were calculated for each one of 
these areas, and the percentage of vegetation in these areas with low 
NDVI scores was recorded. The final dataset included the mean NDVI 
score, month date stamp of the time each image was taken, and forest 
vulnerability  as  the  percentage  of  vegetation  with  low  NDVI  scores. 
Some images had to be excluded due to inappropriate NDVI estimates, 
lack of such estimates, and cloud coverage. The study was also extracted 
data during the main wildfire events that spread through the selected 
forest from September 2019 to January 2020. However, at least 75% of
