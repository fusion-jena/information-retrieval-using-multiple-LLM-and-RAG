that  it  is  feasible  to  use  a  small  amount  of  data  to  train  deep  learning  models,  which  could  have  wide 
applicability in the image recognition field.

Image  classification  on  the  CNN  architecture  known  as  AlexNet  was  proposed  by  Alex 
Krizhevsky and won the 2012 ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (Krizhevsky 
et al., 2012). There are eight layers in the network, containing five convolutional layers and three 
fully connected layers (Fig. 3). All feature extractors were initialized with white Gaussian noise 
and learned from data, and the resulting feature maps were passed through rectified linear units 
(ReLUs),  a  type  of  non-linearity  unit.  The  model  was  trained  using  stochastic  gradient  descent 
and  the  backpropagation  algorithm  included  in  Caffe  (Jia  et  al.,  2014),  with  the  learning  rate 
policy set to “step”. The learning rate set to 10-2 for all layers initially for the reason of accept the

%Query
Query: "What data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., image, audio, video, CSV)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, we can infer that images are used in the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, the context discusses the application of deep learning in image recognition, focusing on the CNN architecture called AlexNet. This architecture was used to win the 2012 ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge. Therefore, it can be concluded that one of the data formats used in this deep learning pipeline is images. However, the context does not provide information about other possible data formats such as audio, video, or CSV files.
