When training a deep convolutional neural network, it is important to split the data
into a training set, a validation set, and a test set. The training set is used for optimizing the
parameters of the network, while the validation set is used for monitoring the performance
of the network during training and for comparing the performance of different networks
with, for example, different hyperparameters or network structures. The test set acts as a
ﬁnal evaluation of a network. To ensure a proper evaluation on both the validation set and
the test set, samples in each set must be independent and have similar class distributions.
The full data set can be split in various ways. The naïve approach is to randomly
sample images from the full data set. However, due to the images being captured in
close proximity and potentially having overlapping ﬁelds of views, information may leak
between the data sets when using the naïve approach. Another approach would be to

the collected data. Finally, the deep learning algorithms are evaluated and the challenges
of monitoring IAPS are discussed.

All networks were trained on the training set for 100 epochs, using the Adam opti-
mizer [27] with a learning rate of 0.001 and cross-entropy loss. The image batch size varied
from 1 to 32 images, depending on the input image resolution with larger batch sizes
for smaller image sizes. After each epoch, the network was evaluated on the validation
set. The epoch model with the highest accuracy on the validation set during training was
saved for further analysis. Before training the networks, the training set was balanced by
upsampling the images from the underrepresented classes through repetition to match the
number of images of the most represented class, “No species”.

5.1.1. Network Training Procedure

In both network structures, the ﬁnal classiﬁcation layer was adapted to match the
seven classes (six IAPS and “no species” (Table 2)). The input image size affects the
processing time of each image, but can also impact the classiﬁcation accuracy. Therefore,
the network models were trained on ﬁve different image sizes: 96 × 128 px, 192 × 256 px,
384 × 512 px, 768 × 1024 px, and 1536 × 2048 px (see Supplementary Materials for a visual
comparison of the image sizes). For each image size, a network was trained using either
random weights or weights pre-trained on ImageNet and with global max pooling or
global average pooling before the ﬁnal classiﬁcation layers.

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, based on the information provided, we can infer that the deep learning model is likely used for multi-class image classification. This is suggested by the mention of adapting the final classification layer to match seven classes, which includes six invasive alien plant species (IAPS) and one additional class labeled as "no species." Furthermore, the use of cross-entropy loss during training is commonly employed for multi-class classification tasks.
