of length 2048. Model and code was run in Python version 3.10 based on 
the code and methods presented in: https://github.com/kahst/BirdNET 
-Analyzer.

The second approach we used to extract embeddings was from the 
pre-trained  BirdNET  model.  The  original  version  of  the  model  was

embeddings  from  the  BirdNET  algorithm  performed  comparably  to  MFCCs  for  calls  recorded  at  closer  distances,  whereas  embeddings  from  the  VGGish  model, 
Wav2Vec2 model, and the acoustic indices performed worse. The lack of visible confidence intervals for some points indicates a very narrow confidence interval. 

Fig. 5. Mean and 95% confidence intervals of Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) for the five feature types as a function of distance for affinity propagation 
clustering (A) and HDBSCAN (B). The lack of visible confidence intervals for some points indicates a very narrow confidence interval. 

Successful clustering was obtained through the use of MFCCs as a feature 
extraction technique, and HDBSCAN for unsupervised classification at 
distances â‰¤150 m (Fig. 6).

capable of identifying 984 North American and European bird species by 
sound (Kahl et al., 2021). BirdNET was trained using a dataset derived 
from  three  primary  sources:  eBird,  Xeno-canto,  and  the  Macaulay  Li-
brary  of  Natural  Sounds.  We  used  BirdNET  version  2.4  which  was 
trained on over 6000 bird and non-bird species (https://github.com/kah 
st/BirdNET-Analyzer). The task-specific model architecture of BirdNET 
was derived from the family of residual networks (ResNets) (Kiyokawa 
et al., 2019), that consists of 157 layers with >27 million parameters, 
and was trained using extensive data pre-processing, augmentation, and 
mixup. BirdNET creates a mel-scale spectrogram between 150 Hz and 
15 kHz and returns 1024 embeddings per 3-s of audio sample. As with 
the VGGish model, we took the mean and standard deviation for em-
beddings over the entire duration of the call, resulting in a feature vector

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no information provided about how the hyperparameters of the BirdNET model were optimized. The given context only mentions that the model was trained using extensive data pre-processing, augmentation, and mixup, but it does not specify any details regarding the optimization process or techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to this query based on the available information.
