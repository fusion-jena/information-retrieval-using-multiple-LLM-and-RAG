4.2.2. Validation and cross-comparison 

The  absence  of  high-resolution  biomass  density  grid  data  poses 
challenges in validating the accuracy of the downscaling results at the 
pixel level. Consequently, the study relied on field-measured data from 
published literature to compute relative errors and assess the accuracy of 
the estimated results (see Table 2). Generally, the relative errors (RE) 
between the downscaled results and the existing sample point data are 
found to be <20% (Xu et al., 2018b), with an average relative error of 
8%. It is important to note that differences in research methods, reso-
lution, and data sources across studies can result in significant variations 
in outcomes. Therefore, the relative errors between the results obtained 
in this study and those from previous studies are deemed reasonable.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. However, some common regularization techniques include Dropout, which randomly sets a fraction rate of input units to 0 during training time, helping reduce overfitting by providing a way of approximately combining exponentially many different neural network architectures efficiently; and L2 Regularization, also known as weight decay, where the weights are penalized based on their size, discouraging large weights and thus preventing overfitting. Other methods include early stopping, data augmentation, and batch normalization.

Based on the provided context, it appears that the study focused on estimating forest biomass using small footprint LiDAR data and an individual tree-based approach that incorporated training data. The authors utilized various references related to spatial distribution and validation of the results but did not mention any specific regularization methods used in their methodology.
