racy assessment requires these parameters to calculate the total number of 
training samples required for the image classified using Eq. 1.

infrastructure and natural water retention measures, such as land use 
conversion through afforestation to improve evapotranspiration, infil-
tration  and  retention  of  water,  land  management  practices  that  help 
increase  the  water  holding  capacity  of  soils  and  the  reconnection  of 
floodplains or ponds to rivers (Collentine and Futter, 2018).

Images were then classified out via Random Forest (RF). This is a 
specific  machine  learning  technique  based  on  the  iterative,  random 
creation  of  decision  trees.  First,  the  input  features  and  classes  were 
defined. RF calculates several random decision trees based on (1) the 
number of training samples and (2) the number of trees. The more trees 
there are, the more accurate the model is, but the longer the calculation 
time is. RF creates several decision trees randomly using the Gini coef-
ficient to split them. A model based on the decision trees is thus created 
and used to classify all the pixels. A pixel is classified according to the 
majority vote of the decision trees. The number of training samples was 
5000 and the number of trees was 500.

Acquiring large-scale training data to train the RF classifier in the 
classification  of  complex  regions  with  a  great  many  categories  is  a 
laborious  task  that  requires  hours  of  processing.  Thus,  in  the  present 
study we assumed that training samples should represent approximately 
0.25% of the total study area used by the RF classifier for large-scale 
classification  (Colditz,  2015;  Deng  and  Wu,  2013;  Du  et  al.,  2015). 
Once these errors in classification have been identified, it is useful to 
carry out work with more training areas that include this category of 
“new  vineyard”,  since  its  spectral signature  after 5 years of  growth is 
totally different from what it looks like in the year of planting. Consid-
ering the study area and the strong influence of the wine sector in it, this 
is an issue that can be improved in future studies.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that images were classified using the Random Forest (RF) method, which is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm. In order to train the RF classifier, labeled training data would need to be generated. While the exact methods used for labeling the training data are not specified, common techniques for image classification tasks could include assigning categorical labels to entire images or individual pixels within the images. It also mentions that acquiring large-scale training data is laborious and time-consuming, suggesting that manual annotation may have been involved. Additionally, the mention of identifying errors in classification and carrying out further work with additional training areas suggests that active learning or other forms of semi-supervised learning may have been employed.
