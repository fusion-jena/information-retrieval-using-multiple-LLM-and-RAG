Water quality parameters

refine modeling approaches to better capture the complexities associ-
ated with water quality assessments. Hence, cloud computing platforms 
such as GEE that can process real-time satellite imagery with machine 
learning algorithms can benefit water quality estimation.

%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information on which specific cloud computing platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the study uses the Google Earth Engine (GEE), a cloud computing platform developed by Google for processing geospatial datasets. Therefore, it is possible that the deep learning model was deployed on the Google Cloud Platform, but this cannot be confirmed based solely on the given information.
