the output of Layer4 and is upsampled by a factor of 2 denoted by D5. 
The output of Layer3 undergoes a 1 × 1 convolutional layer to reduce its 
channel dimensions to be same with C5  denoted by E4. By element-wise 
addition, M4  is generated and satisfies with the equation of M4 = D5 +
E4.  Then,  by  a  3 × 3  convolutional  operation,  the  feature  map  P4  is 
created. Then, M4  is downsampled by a factor of 2 to be D4. The output 
of  Layer2  undergoes  a  1 × 1  convolutional  layer  to  generate  E3.  By 
element-wise addition, M3 is generated and satisfies with the equation of 
M3 = D4 + E3. Similarly, M2  and M1  can be generated and satisfy the 
following equations: M2 = D3 + E2  and M1 = D2 + E1. Subsequently, by 
3 × 3 convolutional operations, M1, M2, M3, and M4 are used to generate 
four feature maps denoted by P1, P2, P3, and P4. Finally, P5  is generated 
by  downsampling  P4.  Five  feature  maps  are  resulted  and  denoted  as

hard negative mining, which focuses on challenging negative examples 
during the training process. By selectively mining hard negative exam-
ples,  the  model  can  learn  to  better  distinguish  between  objects  and 
background regions, leading to improved overall performance.

The family of residual neural networks includes ResNet18, ResNet34, 
ResNet50, ResNet101, and ResNet152 according to their number of CNN 
layers.  “Stage”  is  an  important term  in  the  context of  residual neural 
networks, which refers to a specific set of convolution layers that output 
feature maps with different resolutions. Take ResNet152 as an example 
in (Fig. 4), it consists of five stages (Conv1, Layer1, Layer2, Layer3, and 
Layer4) and each stage can produce a feature map. The spatial resolution 
of each feature map is progressively reduced by a factor of 2, while the 
number of bands is simutanously increased by a factor of 2. Usually, the 
traditional FPN neglects the feature maps from Conv1, Layer1 and Layer 
2 and only incorporates the two feature maps from Layer 3 and Layer 4. 
For  the  detection  of  large  objects  from  high-resolution  true-color  im-
ages, this may work well. However, for the small objects in UAV thermal

Helpful Answer:
After the model training, there are several postprocessing steps that can be performed depending on the requirements of the task. Some common postprocessing steps include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, and creating confusion matrices.

Saliency maps are visualizations that highlight the areas of an image that contribute most significantly to the model's prediction. They can help identify which parts of the input data were most influential in making a particular decision. To create a saliency map, one approach is to compute the gradient of the class score with respect to the input image pixels. This provides information about how much changing each pixel would affect the final classification result.

Calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score can provide insights into the performance of the trained model. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of all predictions made. Precision indicates the fraction of relevant instances among the retrieved instances, while recall shows the ratio of relevant instances that were successfully retrieved. The F1-score combines both precision and recall into a single metric. These metrics can be calculated using libraries like Scikit-learn or TensorFlow.

A confusion matrix is another useful tool for evaluating the performance of a machine learning model. It summarizes the predicted and actual classes in a tabular format, allowing easy identification of false positives and negatives. Each row represents the instances in an actual class, while each column corresponds to the instances in a predicted class. The diagonal elements represent correctly classified samples, whereas off-diagonal elements indicate misclassifications.

In summary, some possible postprocessing steps after model training include generating saliency maps, calculating various evaluation metrics, and constructing confusion matrices. These techniques enable a deeper understanding of the model's behavior and facilitate informed decisions regarding further improvements or applications.
