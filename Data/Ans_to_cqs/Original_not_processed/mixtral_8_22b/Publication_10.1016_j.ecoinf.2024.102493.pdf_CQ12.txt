time variable, and kNDVIj represents the maximum kNDVI value in the 
jth  year.  A  positive  slope  denotes  a  vegetation  improvement  trend 
(kNDVI greening), while a negative slope indicates a degradation trend 
in  vegetation  (kNDVI  browning).  The  significance  of  the  trends  was 
evaluated using the F test. Following the criteria outlined in Table 3 and 
derived from prior studies(Lai et al., 2023; Ren et al., 2023b), the kNDVI 
trends were categorized into four types.

Slope < 0&P > 0.05 
Slope > 0&P > 0.05

%Query
Query: "What type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not explicitly mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it mentions the use of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks for time series NDVI prediction in one of the cited papers (Guo et al., 2023b). Therefore, it can be inferred that the pipeline might involve the use of LSTMs, which are a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).
