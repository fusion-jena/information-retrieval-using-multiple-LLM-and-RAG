(Phillips et al., 2006). To ensure the processing of both continuous and 
categorical  discrete  values  in  the  metadata,  selected  algorithms  with 
regression and classification prediction tasks were used. Mapping fore-
casts of different algorithms in the ensemble approach were evaluated 
by assessing the accuracy and performance of the final models.

2.4. Extraction of taxa records and metadata 

Occurrence records of selected denitrifiers reported for years 2018 to 
2022 (Appendix A), and marked as ‘Present’ in GBIF (accessed on 2022- 
08-06),  were  downloaded  using  “rgbif”  package  (Chamberlain  et  al., 
2023;  Chamberlain  and  Boettiger,  2017)  in  the  RStudio  environment 
(RStudio Team, 2020). 

Searching protocol for occurrence records in the database was per-
formed by a search filter for scientific names using the genus and species 
for  each  selected  taxon.  Search  filters  were  also  applied  by  entering 
multiple  species  names  belonging  to  the  same  genus  (e.g.  Shewanella 
putrefaciens, S. frigidimarina, S. oneidensis, or S. denitrificans) or entering 
the taxon and its closest phylogenetic relative (e.g. Alteromonas elyakovii

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the data might include categorical and continuous discrete values based on the use of regression and classification prediction tasks. Additionally, the use of QGIS suggests geospatial data may be involved. Without more explicit information about the data types, it is difficult to definitively state what data formats are being used.
