The dataset is then divided into training sets, which comprise 80% of 
the  data,  and  a  test  set  representing  the  remaining  20%,  in  order  to 
maximise model training while maintaining a sufficient amount of data 
for robust model validation (Adjuik and Davis, 2022; Fern´andez-L´opez 
et al., 2020). This division is done by random sampling to ensure that 
both subsets are representative of the overall dataset and minimise the 
risk  of  bias.  Randomisation  helps  to  preserve  the  distribution  of  key 
features  and  target  variables  across  both  training  and  test  sets, 
enhancing the generalisability of the model. We leverage the scikit-learn 
function GridSearchCV to meticulously fine-tune the hyperparameters of 
each model within the confines of the training set, aiming to enhance 
their predictive performance. A five-fold cross-validation is used and the 
negative mean square error is set as the target measure. Following this

hyperparameter optimisation process, the performance metrics detailed 
in Section 2.5 are meticulously evaluated using the designated test set. 
Subsequently, based on the performance metrics obtained, we discern 
and  select  the  most  effective  models  for  each  target  variable.  For  an 
illustrative overview of this model selection process, kindly refer to the 
visual representation provided in Fig. 4.

%Query
Query: "What process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model (e.g., Model serialization, Platform selection)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine what process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection.
