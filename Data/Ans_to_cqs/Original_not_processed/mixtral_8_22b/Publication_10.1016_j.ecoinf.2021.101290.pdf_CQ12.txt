The tools and methods available for event-stream processing are not 
the focus of this paper but they are increasingly many. Most have been 
developed  for  e-commerce,  monitoring  of  financial  markets  and  IT 
system monitoring but could as well be applied in biology. AWS kinesis 
(Amazon, 2011) and Apache Kibana (Elastic, 2016) give access to state 
of the art machine learning methods for event-stream processing at a 
click  and  mature  querying  languages,  such  as  elasticsearch  (Elastic, 
2012) make advanced data mining available to a much broader group of 
users.

Leveraging machine learning, computer vision, and artificial intel-
ligence for automated annotation and analysis especially requires high 
quality data (Egnor and Branson, 2016). Although automated annota-
tion is widely applied, it is mostly used offline which has the advantage 
that the researcher can assist the algorithms, fine tune parameters and 
oversee that classifications are correct. However, it also limits the op-
tions for data collection and closed loop experimentation. We instead 
propose  to  automatically  annotate  and  analyse  data  online  while  the

In summary, we want to take advantage of the rapid development in 
machine  learning  without  having  to  constrain  the  environment  too 
much.  We  want  to  enable  re-use  of  developed  components  in  other 
experimental  setups  to  improve  standardisation  and  convergence  of 
methods. Further, we want to base the solution on mature well-known 
technologies and off-the-shelf hardware to keep it easy to maintain. 

We  therefore  propose  an  architecture,  based  on  modern  IT  infra-
structure,  that  delivers  on  those  requirements.  In  the  following,  we 
describe the architecture and explain why we think the solution should 
build on IT infrastructure.

Query: "What type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to determine what specific type of deep learning model is being used in the proposed pipeline. While the text does mention deep learning, it doesn't provide any details about the particular models or architectures employed. Therefore, I cannot definitively answer whether the pipeline uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Transformers, or another type of deep learning model.
