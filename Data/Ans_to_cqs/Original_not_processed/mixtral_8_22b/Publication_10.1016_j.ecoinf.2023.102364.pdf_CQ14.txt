3.3. Model assessment

2.3.4. RandomForest (bagging) 

We performed a RandomForest analysis using 200 trees and balanced 
weights. Similar to CART Ensembles and Bagger, RandomForest belongs 
to the tree algorithm family, but then is enhanced via ‘bagging’ (Brei-
man, 2001). Prior studies have shown RandomForest to be a superior 
choice  for  predictive  accuracy  in  classification  problems  (Mi  et  al., 
2017) and inference (Breiman, 2001).

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, it mentions that a RandomForest analysis was performed using 200 trees and balanced weights. This suggests that some form of parameter tuning or optimization might have been applied, although the specific method used (grid search, random search, etc.) is not mentioned. It also states that prior studies have shown RandomForest to be a superior choice for predictive accuracy in classification problems and inference, which could imply that the chosen parameters were selected based on previous research findings rather than extensive hyperparameter tuning. Nonetheless, without more detailed information, we cannot definitively determine the exact method used for hyperparameter optimization in this case.
