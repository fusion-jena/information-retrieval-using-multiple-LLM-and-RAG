combined with labeled data in a semi-supervised framework (sensu [14]), which may improve deep
learning on limited training data by providing neural networks the opportunity to learn generalized
features on a wider array of training examples, followed by retraining on a smaller number of high
quality annotations [16]. It is unknown whether moderate to low quality annotations can be used
to generate trees for initial model training, given the imperfect nature of existing unsupervised tree
delimitation approaches.

improve with a combination of better validation data and more hand-annotated training samples.

samples will be needed to customize the model to a local geographic area. In addition, the availability
of hyperspectral data could assist in dividing the ‘tree’ class into multiple species labels. This would
yield additional insights into the economic value, ecological habitat, and carbon storage capacity for
large geographic areas [39]. While further work is needed to understand the best way to combine data
among scales and sensors, we show that deep learning-based approaches hold the potential for large
scale actionable information on natural systems to be derived from remote sensing data.

The challenge for applying deep learning to natural systems is the need for large training datasets.
A lack of training data is a pervasive problem in remote sensing due to the cost of data collection
and annotation [13]. In addition, the spatial extent of training data often prohibits the ﬁeld-based
veriﬁcation of annotated objects. For tree detection, the high variation in tree crown appearance, due
to taxonomy, health status, and human management, increases the risk of overﬁtting when using small
amounts of training data [10]. One approach to addressing the data limitation in deep learning is
“self-supervised learning” (sensus [14]), which uses unsupervised methods to generate training data
that is used to train supervised models [15]. This approach has recently been applied to remote sensing
for hyperspectral image classiﬁcation [9]. Self-supervision, which only relies on unlabeled data, can be

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide explicit details about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it mentions several strategies that could potentially address this issue. These include combining labeled and unlabeled data in a semi-supervised framework, which might enhance the model's ability to learn generalized features even with limited training data. Additionally, the use of self-supervised learning, which employs unsupervised methods to create training data for supervised models, was mentioned as a possible solution to overcome data limitations in deep learning applications. Furthermore, the text suggests that improving the model might require a combination of better validation data and more hand-annotated training samples, particularly for customizing the model to local geographical areas. Lastly, the integration of hyperspectral data could aid in subdividing the 'tree' class into various species labels, offering extra insights into aspects like economic value or carbon storage capacity across extensive geographical regions. Despite these suggestions, the text emphasizes that further research is necessary to determine the optimal method for integrating data among different scales and sensors.
