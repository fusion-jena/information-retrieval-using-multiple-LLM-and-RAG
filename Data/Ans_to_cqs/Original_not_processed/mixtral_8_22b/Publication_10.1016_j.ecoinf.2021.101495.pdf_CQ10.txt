2.3. Fish classification by species 

A classifier based on deep neural networks was also used for this task. 
In this case, the chosen architecture is a residual neural network, whose 
main characteristic is that it can skip some of its layers (He et al., 2016). 
In particular, the implementation of ResNet50V2 model in TensorFlow

how the model is able to learn in fewer steps and with better accuracy if 
data augmentation is used.

Question: %INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the provided pieces of context to answer the query in less than 400 words. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

%Query
Query: "What is the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide an accurate answer to the query.
