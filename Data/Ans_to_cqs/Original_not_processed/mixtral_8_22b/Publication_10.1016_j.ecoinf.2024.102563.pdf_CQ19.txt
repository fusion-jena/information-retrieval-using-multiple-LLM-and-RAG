%Query
Query: "Which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about which specific frameworks were used to build the deep learning models mentioned in the papers. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other framework was used.
