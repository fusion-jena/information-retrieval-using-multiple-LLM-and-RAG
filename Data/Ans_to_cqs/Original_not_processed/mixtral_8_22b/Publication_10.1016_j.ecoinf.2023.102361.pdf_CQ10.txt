Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

VGG16 and VGG19 are classical architectures that are well known 
for  simplicity  and  uniformity.  These  models  are  suitable  for  smaller 
datasets and can provide better accuracy by fine-tuning the pre-trained 
network (Sukegawa et al., 2020). The models have several drawbacks, 
such  as  vanishing  gradient  problems  and  loss  of  fine-grained  spatial 
information (Pan et al., 2020). On the other hand, ResNet-50 contains 
residual  connections,  which  can  overcome  the  vanishing  gradient 
problem and enable training very deep networks. The model performs 
well on both large and small datasets (Al-Masni et al., 2020).

diction  of  the  deep  learning  model.  This  dataset  was  taken  to  verify 
whether our proposed approach can handle that issue. The dataset was 
shared  by  Jiang  et  al.  (2020)  through  the  Github  repository: 
https://github.com/zhangchuanyin/weed-datasets.

2.2. Split the datasets 

In this research, the datasets were randomly divided into three parts 
for training, validation and testing. Here, 60% of the data was used to 
train the deep learning models, and 20% of them was kept to validate the 
models. The remaining 20% data was used to evaluate the performance 
of the models. Table 1 show the number of data in the dataset and how 
they are separated for training, testing and validation. 

2.3. Deep learning models

accuracy of most deep learning models was below 70% on the Cotton 
weed  dataset  using  low-resolution  (256  Ã— 256)  images.  The  perfor-
mance was improved significantly by increasing the image size.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions a dataset shared via a GitHub repository (<https://github.com/zhangchuanyin/weed-datasets>), which might be related to the project or study. Unfortunately, without additional information, I cannot determine if this repository also includes the deep learning pipeline code.
