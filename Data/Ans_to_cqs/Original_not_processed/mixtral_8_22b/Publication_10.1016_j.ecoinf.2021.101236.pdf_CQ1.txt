overall process mostly followed current best practices in deep learning 
which are well summarized in (Chollet, 2017).

followed  the  original  Wide  ResNet  design.  Our  downsampling  blocks 
employed the changes suggested in (Xie et al., 2018). The third and final 
component, the classification block, was derived from (Schlüter, 2018) 
and resulted in probability predictions for all 987 classes per second (i. 
e., three predictions per 3-s input spectrogram) followed by global log- 
mean-exponential  pooling  and  sigmoid  activation.  Most  convolutions 
use 3 × 3 kernels with padding and are succeeded by batch normali-
zation  (Ioffe  and  Szegedy,  2015)  and  ReLU  activation  (if  not  noted 
differently).  Because  we  treated  spectrograms  as  monochrome  input 
images, the input was a single channel mel spectrogram of size 64 × 384, 
visualizing three seconds of audio at a sampling rate of 48 kHz. 

2.5. Training

diversify  the  training  data,  and  the  3-s  window  length  enables  the 
implementation of this data augmentation method.

Here  we  present  a  new  algorithm,  called  BirdNET,  that  builds  on 
these previous successes using CNNs and spectrogram data to classify 
984  bird  species.  We  discuss  the  necessary  steps  required  to  develop 
such a system and provide insights into our training and testing work-
flow of a deep artificial neural network. Finally, we give an outlook on 
how  this  technology  can  support  ornithologists  and  conservation  bi-
ologists in their work to identify and address the environmental chal-
lenges of our time.

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that the input data consists of single-channel mel spectrograms of size 64 x 384, visualizing three seconds of audio at a sampling rate of 48 kHz. This suggests that the raw data collected might be audio recordings of birds, which are then converted into mel spectrograms for further processing in the deep learning pipeline. Additionally, the context mentions that the 3-second window length allows for implementing data augmentation methods, indicating that the raw data may have been manipulated during preprocessing to diversify the training data. Unfortunately, without more explicit information about the data collection methods, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the exact methods used for gathering raw data.
