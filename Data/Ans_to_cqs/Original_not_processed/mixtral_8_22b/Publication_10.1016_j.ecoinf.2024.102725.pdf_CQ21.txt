The MAE is used to evaluate the average magnitude of the errors
between the fused results and observed values, which is also referred to
as the L1 loss. The MAE has a range of [0, +∞], where a value closer to
0 indicates a closer match between the fused results and observed
values. The formula used is as follows:

MAE = 1

ERGAS calculates the quality of the fused image as the normalized
average error of the fused image bands, which can be used to assess the
accuracy of image reconstruction and the smoothness in preserving the
spatial resolution. The ERGAS ranges from 0 to infinity, with lower
values indicating a higher similarity between the two images. The
calculation formula is as follows:

ERGAS = 100

Helpful Answer:
After completing the model training process, several postprocessing steps may be performed depending on the specific application or requirements. Here are some common postprocessing steps:

1. Model evaluation metrics: Calculate various performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Coefficient of Determination (R^2), and Erreur Relative Globale Adimensionnelle de Synthese (ERGAS). These metrics help quantify the accuracy and reliability of the predictions made by the trained models.

2. Visualization techniques: Utilize visualization tools like saliency maps, confusion matrices, or receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC curves) to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of the trained models. For example, saliency maps highlight important features contributing to the final output, while confusion matrices provide insights into misclassifications.

3. Ensemble methods: Combine multiple trained models using ensemble learning techniques to improve overall predictive performance. This involves averaging outputs from different models or applying more complex weighted voting schemes.

4. Hyperparameter tuning: Fine-tune hyperparameters of the trained models to optimize their performance further. This often requires cross-validation techniques to avoid overfitting.

5. Model interpretation: Analyze feature importance, partial dependence plots, or other interpretability measures to gain insight into how the trained models arrive at their decisions.

These postprocessing steps aim to enhance the understanding, robustness, and applicability of the trained models in real-world scenarios.
