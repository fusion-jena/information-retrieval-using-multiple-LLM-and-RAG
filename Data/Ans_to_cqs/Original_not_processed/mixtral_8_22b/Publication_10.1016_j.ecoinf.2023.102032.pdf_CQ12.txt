can be described as representative of land use classes in the study area. 
An overview of the plot locations is presented in Fig. 4.

the comparison of WUI between time steps to measure trends and shifts 
as  well  as  across  regions,  other  wetland  management  categories,  and 
between specific agricultural use practices.

%Query
Query: "What type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline for improving cloud detection with machine learning. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer model was employed. Further research would be required to ascertain this information.
