This study has certain limitations. Since the amount of data publicly 
provided  by  the HWSD  was small, and  the fact  that the  geographical 
detector required a large size of geographic samples (Feng et al., 2021). 
In future research on soil degradation, data from the Basic Soil Property 
Dataset  of  High-resolution  China  Soil  Information  Grids  (Feng  and 
Ganlin, 2021) and HWSD should be processed jointly to improve tem-
poral and spatial accuracy. Moreover, vegetation degradation (Wu et al., 
2022) and soil degradation research should be combined to establish a 
long-term land resource evaluation system for different land-use types in 
HN.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
After model training, several postprocessing steps can be taken depending on the specific requirements of the project. Here are some common postprocessing steps:

1. Model Evaluation: This involves calculating various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curves, etc., to evaluate the performance of the trained model. These metrics help in understanding how well the model is performing and where it needs improvement.

2. Confusion Matrix: It is a table used to describe the performance of a classification model. Each row of the matrix represents the instances in an actual class while each column represents the instances in a predicted class. The confusion matrix helps in identifying the false positives and false negatives made by the model.

3. Saliency Maps: They are visualizations that highlight the pixels in an input image that contribute most strongly to the output of a convolutional neural network. Saliency maps help in understanding which parts of the input image were important for making predictions.

4. Feature Importance: In case of tree-based models like Random Forests and Gradient Boosting Machines, feature importance can be calculated to understand which features had the highest impact on the final prediction.

5. Hyperparameter Tuning: After evaluating the initial model, hyperparameters can be tuned to further improve its performance. Techniques like Grid Search, Randomized Search, Bayesian Optimization, etc., can be used for this purpose.

6. Ensemble Methods: Multiple models can be ensembled together using techniques like bagging, boosting, stacking, etc., to improve overall performance.

These postprocessing steps help in improving the interpretability and reliability of machine learning models. However, not all these steps may be necessary for every project, and the choice of postprocessing steps depends on the specific use case and requirements.
