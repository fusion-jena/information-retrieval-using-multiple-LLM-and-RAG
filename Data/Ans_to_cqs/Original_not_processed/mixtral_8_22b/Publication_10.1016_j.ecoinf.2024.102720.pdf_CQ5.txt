With the rapid development of multi-scale data and multi-method
coupling research, scholars have started to base their research on
qualitative (Chen, 2020), quantitative (Liao et al., 2021; Mu et al.,
2019), frequency (Lu et al., 2021), probabilistic (Zhao and Xu, 2020),
temporal (Shen et al., 2019), spatial (Zhao et al., 2022) and other multi-
scale data. Improvements in random forest (Jiang et al., 2021; Lian et al.,
2022), support vector machines (Hong et al., 2018), deep learning (Ren
et al., 2021; Wu, 2022), Bayesian networks (Che et al., 2019), and mixed
effects (Yu et al., 2021a) models for improved fusion, e.g., Gu et al. (Gu
et al., 2024) fused optimal parametric geoprobes with partial least
squares structural equations to analyze the effects of topography,
climate, and human activities on the spatial pattern of kNDVI. Research
in natural areas such as agro-land ecology has been performed in the
exploration of influencing factors of land use and agricultural systems

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information about the datasets used in any deep learning pipelines. However, it mentions several studies using deep learning algorithms for various purposes like strategic planning, assessing the role of settlement in environmental challenges, analyzing the effects of topography, climate, and human activities on the spatial pattern of kNDVI, etc. These studies might be using different types of datasets depending upon their objectives and requirements. Some commonly used datasets in deep learning include MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet, COCO, etc., but without more specific details, we cannot determine which dataset was used in these studies.
