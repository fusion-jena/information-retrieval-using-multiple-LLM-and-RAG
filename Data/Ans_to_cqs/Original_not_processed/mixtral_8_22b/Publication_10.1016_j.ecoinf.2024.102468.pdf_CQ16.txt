Furthermore,  the  comparison  between  recording  months  provides 
valuable insights into the tradeoffs  associated with dataset size  selec-
tion. The superior performance of the WT-HMM in the 8 to 20-h dataset 
size  range  for  both  months  suggests  the  most  suitable  range  for 
achieving  high  accuracy.  This  finding  resonates  with  studies  empha-
sizing the importance of selecting appropriate sample sizes for effective 
model training (Kahl et al., 2021).

techniques may enhance classification performance.

Typically,  a  higher  F1-score  (score  close  to  1)  indicates  a  better 
model performance, as it signifies a better balance between precision 
and recall. A low F1-score (score close to 0) suggests that the model may 
struggle  to  accurately  classify  positive  instances  and/or  may  miss  a 
significant  number of  positive instances.  Since the  classification algo-
rithm involves an element of randomness, such as random initialization 
of weights in ANN or random sampling during training. The experiments 
are performed over different runs to help capture the variability intro-
duced by these random factors.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed, such as a validation loss plateau. However, based on the context, we can infer that the authors use multiple runs of their models to account for any variability introduced by random factors like weight initialization or random sampling during training. This implies that they might have used some form of early stopping or convergence criterion to ensure that the models do not overfit or underfit the data. Additionally, since the context mentions the F1-score as a measure of model performance, it could be assumed that this metric was also considered while determining the completion of training. Nonetheless, without further details from the original source, one cannot definitively state the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete.
