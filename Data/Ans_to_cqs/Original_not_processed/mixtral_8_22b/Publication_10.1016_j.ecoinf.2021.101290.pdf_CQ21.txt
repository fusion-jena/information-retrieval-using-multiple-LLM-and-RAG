The tools and methods available for event-stream processing are not 
the focus of this paper but they are increasingly many. Most have been 
developed  for  e-commerce,  monitoring  of  financial  markets  and  IT 
system monitoring but could as well be applied in biology. AWS kinesis 
(Amazon, 2011) and Apache Kibana (Elastic, 2016) give access to state 
of the art machine learning methods for event-stream processing at a 
click  and  mature  querying  languages,  such  as  elasticsearch  (Elastic, 
2012) make advanced data mining available to a much broader group of 
users.

Leveraging machine learning, computer vision, and artificial intel-
ligence for automated annotation and analysis especially requires high 
quality data (Egnor and Branson, 2016). Although automated annota-
tion is widely applied, it is mostly used offline which has the advantage 
that the researcher can assist the algorithms, fine tune parameters and 
oversee that classifications are correct. However, it also limits the op-
tions for data collection and closed loop experimentation. We instead 
propose  to  automatically  annotate  and  analyse  data  online  while  the

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't specific information about the postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, generally speaking, some common postprocessing steps include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, creating confusion matrices, and visualizing results.

Saliency maps help identify important features or regions in input data that contribute significantly to the output predictions made by the model. They provide insights into how the model makes decisions and what parts of the input data are most relevant.

Calculating various performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., helps evaluate the effectiveness of the trained model. These metrics offer valuable feedback regarding the strengths and weaknesses of the model and guide further improvements.

Confusion matrices present a summary of prediction outcomes, including true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. This visual representation allows researchers to quickly assess the overall performance of their models and understand where misclassification occurs.

Visualizations play a crucial role in interpreting and communicating the results obtained from the trained model. By plotting graphs, charts, or other types of diagrams, researchers can effectively convey complex findings and patterns discovered during the modeling process.
