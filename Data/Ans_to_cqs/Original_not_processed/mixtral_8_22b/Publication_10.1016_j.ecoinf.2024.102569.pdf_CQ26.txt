In the data analysis of the PO data, it is necessary to be aware of 
biases due to some factors. Various methods have been discussed to deal 
with the sampling bias because PO data usually suffer from the sampling 
bias  due  to  heterogeneity  in  sampling  efforts.  These  methods  involve 
identifying  and  estimating  the  effect  of  bias  on  presence  and  then 
thinning  or  eliminating  it  (Dudík  et  al.,  2005;  Fithian  et  al.,  2015; 
Komori  et  al.,  2020).  The  present  paper  focuses  on  the  thinned  PPP 
model introduced in the next section.

The proposed method can be used in combination with some other 
useful statistical methods. Methods for mitigating sampling bias through 
dataset filtering, such as the target-group background method (Phillips 
et al., 2009) and the spatial thinning (Veloz, 2009) employed in Section 
5,  can  be  simultaneously  applied.  In  cases  of  spatial  dependence  or 
autocorrelation in species distribution (Dormann, 2007), the proposed 
estimator can be used to train spatial dependence models such as the 
area-interaction  process  (Baddeley  and  van  Lieshout,  1995).  Further 
research  is  needed  to  develop  a  robust  estimation method  for mixed- 
effects models such as the Cox process (Møller et al., 1998).

cultivation or captivity contexts (Botella et al., 2018). These scenarios 
are  common  issues  in  crowdsourcing  data  analysis.  To  remove  such 
heterogeneous  observations,  the  time-consuming  manual  checking  by 
experts  is  required  (Belbin  et  al.,  2013;  Mesibov,  2013).  If  such  pro-
cedure is not fully executed, our proposed method is expected to miti-
gate  the  impact  of  heterogeneous  observations  and  achieve  better 
predictions than ordinary methods.

Helpful Answer:

To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques are commonly used. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same proportion of classes in each set. This ensures that the model learns from a representative sample of all classes, reducing any potential bias towards one class over another.

Oversampling is a technique used when dealing with imbalanced datasets where one class has significantly fewer samples than others. It involves duplicating examples from the minority class until both classes have roughly equal representation. This helps prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.

Undersampling, conversely, reduces the number of examples in the majority class so that both classes have approximately equal representation. While this may result in losing valuable information, it can help reduce bias towards the majority class.

Diverse data collection aims to gather data from various sources and environments to ensure that the model generalizes well across different conditions. By collecting diverse data, we can minimize any potential bias caused by using only specific types of data.

In addition to these techniques, the given context mentions methods for mitigating sampling bias through dataset filtering, such as the target-group background method (Phillips et al., 2009) and spatial thinning (Veloz, 2009). These methods can be applied simultaneously to further improve the quality of the dataset. Furthermore, the proposed method in the context can be combined with other useful statistical methods to handle spatial dependence or autocorrelation in species distribution.
