the ensemble results. All CNNs were trained using the TensorFlow backend on a Tesla
M100 graphic processing unit.

There are numerous aspects to consider for enhancing the deep-learning classiﬁer,
speciﬁcally regarding the input image size; network conﬁguration, depth, and width; and
training strategy. In initial experimentation, several standard forms of deep-learning CNN
architectures were tested based largely on ResNet [46] and Inception [63], but these did
not perform well due to the range of image objects size/scales encountered. To account
for objects represented as a single pixel up to larger assemblages extending beyond the
32 by 32 pixel input image, the ensemble with varying input image sizes was selected.
Segmentation-based approaches were also considered as an alternative, but sufﬁcient
quality training data for segmentation was a limitation.

Figure 3. Schematic of the CNN used in the study. Input image size was 32 by 32 pixels shown as the
large grey square. Numbers represent the number of features output from a convolution or dense
layer, except for the cropping layers where the crop dimension is shown.

For training, the Adam optimizer was used with 500 epochs and categorical-cross
entropy loss function. Batch size was set to 64. Data augmentation was applied to enhance
sample variation and included rotation, reﬂectance bias of ±10%, and random noise of
±10% reﬂectance for 15% of the input image. To determine training convergence, we
monitored the validation data across training epochs and the network weights with the
best performance were kept. Early stopping criteria was applied if no improvement was
found in 50 epochs. For CNNs, weight initialization and random selection for batch
training can lead to variability in the results. Thus, an ensemble of three models were
generated and the average of the ﬁnal output layer taken. Max pooling was used for two
models in the ensemble and average pooling for one. In initial tests using max or average
pooling showed that both provided improvement in some cases and thus could enhance

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the dataset consists of satellite imagery, which suggests that remote sensing technology such as satellites might have been employed to gather this data. Additionally, the text discusses various techniques used to improve the performance of the deep learning model, including adjustments to input image size, network configuration, depth, and width, as well as different training strategies. It also describes the use of the Adam optimizer, categorical cross-entropy loss function, and data augmentation techniques like rotation, reflectance bias, and random noise. Lastly, the context explains how multiple models were generated and their outputs averaged to create an ensemble, along with the application of early stopping criteria during training.
