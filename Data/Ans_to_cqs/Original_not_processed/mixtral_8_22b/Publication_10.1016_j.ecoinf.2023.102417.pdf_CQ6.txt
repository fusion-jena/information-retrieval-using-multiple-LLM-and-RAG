function to ignore a certain class. These annotations are made manually, 
using special software, and consume large amounts of time. For model 
development  there  are  many  well  established  collections  of  image 
datasets for the training and evaluation of the models, such as ImageNet

Neural  networks  can  be  trained  in  a  supervised,  semi-supervised 
(Chen  et  al.,  2021;  Zhao  et  al.,  2020)  or  unsupervised  (Harb  and 
Kn¨obelreiter, 2021; Ji et al., 2019) way. When it comes to supervised 
learning (Deng et al., 2009; Minaee et al., 2021), the models are typi-
cally  trained with a  huge amount of  training data. This  training  data 
consist of input and target image pairs, where the input image describes 
the image that is supposed to be classified and the target image describes 
the  corresponding  classes  (labels).  For  semantic  image  segmentation, 
the  target  image  consists  of  a  fully  labeled  image,  which  means  that 
every single pixel of the training image is assigned to a certain class. In 
some cases, parts of the image that have no influence on the specific task 
can  be  ignore  by  the  model  (overexposed,  underexposed  or  blurred 
parts, unimportant parts etc.). This can be done by adjusting the loss

When  it  comes  to  the  application  of  deep  learning  models,  it  is 
mandatory to train the model on training data that resemble the data, on 
which  the model will be applied  later. If the  model is  applied over  a 
longer period of time (as it can be the case in long term biomonitoring), 
the training dataset and the dataset, on which the model is applied can 
have  different  data  distributions  due  to  some  reasons,  like  different 
recording  conditions  (brightness,  scale)  or  recording  devices/sensors 
(contrast,  resolution).  This  is  a  well-known  phenomenon  called  data 
drift  or  domain  drift  (Farahani  et  al.,  2020).  Thus,  it  is  necessary  to 
create specific datasets tailored to the desired application. The field of 
machine learning that is dealing with this discrepancy across domain 
distributions, is called domain adaption, with the aim of increasing the 
transferability of models to datasets with similar statistical properties.

To  investigate  the  applicability  of  Semantic  Segmentation  on  bio-
crust  imagery,  the  images  were  classified  using  the  well-established 
Semantic  Segmentation  Model  Unet  (Ronneberger  et  al.,  2015).The 
encoder weights of the model were pretrained on the ImageNet dataset 
(Deng et al., 2009) before training the model on our labeled datasets. 
The pretraining reached an accuracy of 78,57% on the ImageNet Dataset 
(He  et  al.,  2019).  Pretraining  is  well  recommended  in  Deep  learning 
methods,  especially  when  algorithms  are  trained,  based  on  small 
training datasets, as in our case (He et al., 2019). The pretrained model 
weights are made available by the used framework PyTorch and can be 
directly loaded when the model is initialized (Paszke et al., 2019). The 
training  on  our  data  was  performed  for  1000  epochs  on  randomly 
cropped images of size 512 × 512 with a learning rate of 0.0001 and an

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps may be involved depending on the nature of the data and the requirements of the model. However, the given context does not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps. Nevertheless, from general knowledge about deep learning, common preprocessing techniques include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization involves rescaling the values of features so they fall within a specific range, often between 0 and 1. Scaling refers to transforming the feature values into a standard scale, such as mean=0 and variance=1. Cleaning involves removing noise, outliers, or irrelevant information from the data. Additionally, for image data, other preprocessing steps might include resizing images, converting them to grayscale, or augmenting the dataset through rotation, flipping, or cropping. However, these specific details are not mentioned in the provided context.
