On the other hand, since the powerful feature extraction 
capabilities, the deep learning methods have succeed in many 
fields,  such  as  computer  vision  and  natural  language 
processing. In recently, the deep learning based methods have 
also  been  used  to  solve  the  HSI  classification  task  and 
achieved remarkable achievements. Among the deep learning 
methods,  the  Convolutional  Neural  Networks  (CNNs)  are 
most widely explored to solve the HSI classification task. Hu 
et  al.  [4]  designed  a  one-dimensional  convolutional  neural 
network(1-D-CNN) for classification according to the spectral 
feature  of  HSI.  Due  to  the  insufficient  training  data,  the 
designed  1-D-CNN  just  includes  a  convolution  operation,  a 
pooling operation and a fully connected operation. Although 
the structure of  designed 1-D-CNN is simple, it achieved a 
satisfactory  classification  performance.  The  classification

architecture,  the  multiscale  CNN  is  utilized  to  extract 
multiscale spatial features, and the LSTM is used to extract 
spectral 
residual  network 
including residual blocks  of spectral and spatial based on the 
3-D convolutional kernel have also been proposed to solve the
HSI classification task and achieved the highest classification
accuracy on three data sets [8]. Roy et al. [9] designed a novel
CNN architecture for HSI classification, which firstly use the
3-D convolutional to extract the joint spatial–spectral features
and  then  use  the  2-D  convolutional  to  learn  more  abstract-
level spatial representation.

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipelines mentioned. However, it mentions that the designed 1-D-CNN achieved satisfactory classification performance despite having a simple structure due to insufficient training data. Additionally, it states that the spectral-spatial residual network achieved the highest classification accuracy on three data sets, without specifying what those data sets were. Similarly, the HybridSN architecture was tested on three data sets, but their names are not mentioned. Lastly, the DCNN proposed by Zhang et al. achieved the best classification performances on two data sets compared to other methods, but again, no details about these data sets are given. Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot determine the exact datasets used in the deep learning pipelines discussed.
