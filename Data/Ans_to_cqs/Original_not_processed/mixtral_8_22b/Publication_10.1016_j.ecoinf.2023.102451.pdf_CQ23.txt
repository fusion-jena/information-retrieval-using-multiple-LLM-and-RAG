for  different  deep 

While test accuracy for all the considered networks DenseNet 121, Alex 
Net, ViT, ResNet50, Xception Net, VGG19, InceptionV3 and VGG16 are 
33.77%,  35.87%,  37.65%,  41.58%,  44.76%,  48.57%,  48.88%,  and 
50.15% respectively. It has been observed that on the test set the per-
formance of every model was lower than the validation set performance, 
While the performance of the model on the test set demonstrates how 
well the model can generalize. After seeing these results, it would be 
worth  noting  that  the  proposed  transformer-based  neural  network 
EMViT-Net achieves the highest classification accuracy with a validation 
accuracy of 71.17% and test accuracy of 67.62% while requiring lesser 
training time and performing faster than the other models. 

3.5.2. Performance comparison of EMViT with other models after 
augmentation

To further validate the performance of the proposed model EMViT- 
Net,  the  acquired  findings  were  compared  with  other  state-of-the-art 
models. The performance measures used to compare the performance 
of  EMViT-Net  with  other  deep  learning  models  are  evaluated  on  the 
validation set and test set of the considered dataset EMDS-6. The com-
parison of the classification results achieved by other pre-trained deep 
learning models is given in Table 4 and Table 5 which illustrates the 
finding on each set validation set and test set respectively by calculating 
the  average  value  of  precision,  recall  and  f1-score  for  all  categories 
which are named as Avg_Precision, Avg_Recall and Avg_F1-score. The 
detailed analysis of the proposed network EMViT-Net and other deep 
learning models with specific configurations on unseen test sets is out-
lined  here  which  shows  that  the  EMViT-Net  outperforms  precision,

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does indicate that the performance of the model was tested on both a validation set and a separate test set. This approach helps to evaluate the ability of the model to perform well on new, unseen data, thereby ensuring its generalizability. Additionally, the use of augmentation techniques could also contribute to improving the model's robustness and generalization capabilities.
