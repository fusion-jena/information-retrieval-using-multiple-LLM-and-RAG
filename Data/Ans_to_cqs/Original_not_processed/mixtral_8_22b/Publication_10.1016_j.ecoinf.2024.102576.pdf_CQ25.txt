the satellite. The labeling part determines the labeling methodology for 
training  the  deep  learning  model.  In  the  classification  part,  a  deep 
learning model was trained based on the results of previous steps. The 
target PSI, which has the same format as the trained PSI, can be classi-
fied using the trained model. Here, the format refers to the spatial res-
olution and spectral band used, interval in PSI, and chronological order 
of  each  band.  If  satellite  imagery  accumulates  owing  to  continuous 
satellite observations, the PSI can also be continuously generated, and 
classification can be continued using the model. This enables PCF land 
monitoring.

The use of deep learning models has become prevalent across various 
scientific  fields.  Specifically,  these  models  have  demonstrated  excep-
tional  performance  in  image  classification.  Consequently,  numerous 
researchers are employing these models for land-cover classification and 
extraction of ecological information (Capinha et al., 2021; Jagannathan 
and Divya, 2021; Kırbas¸ and Çifci, 2022; Passah and Kandar, 2023). The 
U-Net model, a type of convolutional neural network (CNN), is a deep 
learning  algorithm  that  performs  classification  through  supervised 
learning  (Ulmas  and  Liiv,  2020).  The  model  was  trained  using  both 
training and validation data, and classification was performed based on 
these data (Kattenborn et al., 2021). Consequently, the availability of 
labeling data is crucial for U-Net model applications. However, in North 
Korea, there is no official land-cover map based on national-scale field

the  research conducted  by Kim et  al. (2021a).  Therefore, even in the 
absence of specific classes, using phenological characteristics, elements 
can still be classified on the basis of using classes that are most relevant. 
As  suggested  by  Kim  et  al.  (2021a),  the  classification  accuracy  and 
performance improved as data increased during the training of a deep 
learning  model  using  satellite  imageries  over  multiple  periods,  (Kim 
et al., 2021b). Therefore, the characteristics of a deep-learning model 
can be used effectively. As a result, by employing PCF with DA, we could

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in this context is primarily for image classification. More specifically, it is employed for land-cover classification and extraction of ecological information. The model used here is the U-Net model, a type of convolutional neural network (CNN), which performs classification through supervised learning. The model is trained using both training and validation data, and classification is then carried out based on these data. It is important to note that the availability of labeled data is crucial for the application of the U-Net model. In this case, the lack of an official land-cover map in North Korea necessitated the use of phenological characteristics to classify elements based on the most relevant classes.
