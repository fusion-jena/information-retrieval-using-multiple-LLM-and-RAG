NN, a powerful and widely utilized machine learning model, excels 
in tasks such as classification and regression (Arbib, 2003; Niroumand- 
Jadidi  et  al.,  2022).  Comprising  interconnected  nodes  (neurons)  ar-
ranged  in  layers,  NN  processes  and  transforms  input  data  to  produce 
desired  outputs  (Goodfellow  et  al.,  2016;  Niroumand-Jadidi  et  al., 
2022). The fundamental structure encompasses an input layer, one or 
more hidden layers, and an output layer (Hardesty, 2017). The number 
of  neurons  in  the  input  layer  aligns  with  the  count  of  input  features, 
whereas  in  this study, only  wind  speed  is  considered. The number of 
neurons  in  the  output  layer  corresponds  to  the  number  of  outputs  or 
classes  (Hardesty,  2017).  An  essential  consideration  of  NN  design

involves  determining  the  number  of  neurons  in  the  hidden  layers 
(Goodfellow  et  al.,  2016).  While  a  one-size-fits-all  approach  does  not 
exist, a commonly employed rule, as shown in Eq. (5), suggests, that H 
denotes the number of neurons in each hidden layer and N represents the 
number of input features (Goodfellow et al., 2016; Hardesty, 2017). 

H = 2 × N + 1

In  crafting  and  assessing  the  models,  MATLAB  programming  soft-
ware (MathWorks, 2021) served as the primary tool. Fig. 3 illustrates the 
architectural details of these algorithms. The objective was to pinpoint 
the most effective algorithm tailored for this particular application by 
scrutinizing each model’s capability to predict TSM concentration solely 
based on wind speed data.

During the validation phase of the machine learning algorithms, a K- 
fold cross-validation technique was implemented. Additionally, a four- 
fold  cross-validation  was  conducted  on  the  training  dataset,  as  illus-
trated in Fig. 4. The dataset was initially extracted, and the feature set 
was randomly divided into four mutually exclusive folds through strat-
ified sampling (Guo et al., 2021; Psychalas et al., 2023). Each fold served 
as  the  validation  set,  while  the  remaining  three  folds  constituted  the 
training set for model training. To address imbalances, random under 
sampling (RUS) was applied to the training set, while the validation set 
remained unchanged. The model underwent training using the balanced 
three-fold  training  dataset  for  a  specified  number  of  epochs  and  was 
subsequently  tested  on  the  validation  fold to  generate  predictions for 
that specific fold. This process iterated four times with distinct valida-

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is not explicitly stated as either classification, segmentation, or detection. However, it can be inferred from the given information that the model is used for regression purposes. The text mentions that the neural network (a type of deep learning model) is used for tasks such as classification and regression. Furthermore, it states that the number of neurons in the output layer corresponds to the number of outputs or classes. Since the study aims to predict Total Suspended Matter (TSM) concentration based on wind speed data, we can infer that the deep learning model is being used for regression rather than classification, segmentation, or detection. Therefore, the purpose of the deep learning model in this context is to perform regression analysis to predict TSM concentrations based on wind speed data.
