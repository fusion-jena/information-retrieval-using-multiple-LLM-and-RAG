We illustrate the value of GEE_xtract with a complex case concerning the seasonal distribution of a threatened 
elusive  bird  and  highlight  its  broad  application  to  a  myriad  of  ecological  phenomena.  Being  user-friendly 
designed and implemented in a widely used cloud platform (GEE), we believe our approach provides a major 
contribution  to  effectively  extracting  high-quality  data  that  can  be  quickly  computed  for  metrics  time  series, 
converted at any scale, and extracted from ground information. Additionally, the framework was prepared to 
facilitate comparative research initiatives and data-fusion approaches in ecological research.

%Query
Query: "What is the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the specific link to platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket based on the available text.
