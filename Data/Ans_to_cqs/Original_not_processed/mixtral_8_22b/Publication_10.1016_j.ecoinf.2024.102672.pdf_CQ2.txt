Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Data-driven models are an alternative type of models, among which 
machine learning and deep learning (ML and DL) models stand out in 
recent years. According to Lee et al. (2023) data-driven models applied 
to freshwater ecosystems have been mainly focused on phytoplankton, 
while there is a lack of research in modelling future changes, such as 
climate change and subsequent changes in habitat conditions. A good 
example of a data-driven model focused on algal blooms prediction is 
that  presented  by  Miura  et  al.  (2023).  Nonetheless,  there  are  several 
examples in the scientific literature about ML or DL models designed to 
predict the temperature profile in water masses. Liu and Chen (2012) 
developed ML models based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) using 
as inputs meteorological conditions to predict the temperature in the 3

known Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) was used, except in the output layer 
of the ANN for classification, which uses the sigmoid function with a 
threshold of 0.5. This means that the outputs with a value lower than 0.5 
belong to one of the classes of the binary classification, while the outputs 
with a value equal or higher than 0.5 belong to the other class. In this 
work, ANN were implemented using the keras library.

The result of this process was added to the dataset as a new cate-
gorical binary variable that stored the existence of stratification or not 
(took the value of 0 when the reservoir was not stratified and 1 when it 
was stratified).

2.3. Data analysis framework 

Data  analysis  was  performed  using  open  source  libraries  and 
frameworks for the Python 3 programming language. The main libraries 
that  were  used  and  their  versions  are:  NumPy  1.23.5,  SciPy  1.9.1, 
Pandas  1.4.4,  Scikit-Learn  1.02,  Keras  2.12.0  and  Shap  0.42.1.  The 
specific  functions  used  are  indicated  in  the  text  where  relevant.  This 
Python-based environment was chosen due to its growing usage trend 
for data analytics, being also suitable as a general-purpose programming 
language (Nguyen et al., 2019). 

2.4. Data pre-processing 

The first step consisted of a preliminary screening of the data in order 
to  check  the  general  quality,  which  was  appropriate  enough  for  this 
work  as  the  data  are  supervised  by  the  CHE  before  their  publication 
though the SAICA and the SAIH. It is worth mentioning that the data 
from April 2020 were not available, presumably due to the lockdown

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, the specific format of the input data used in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned. However, we can infer from the context that the data might be in a structured format like CSV since the work involves data analysis using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn. These libraries are commonly used for handling tabular data. Additionally, the use of Keras, a popular deep learning library, suggests that the data could potentially be transformed into numerical arrays to train neural networks. Nevertheless, without explicit confirmation, it remains uncertain whether the data includes formats like images, audio, or video.
