Second,  a  species  distribution  model  was  constructed  using  seven 
machine-learning  techniques.  This  model  leveraged  environmental 
variables  and  species  data  to  generate  model  input  variables  and  a 
landscape matrix for landscape connectivity. An ensemble model was 
employed to minimize the uncertainty in species occurrence, which is 
essential for implementing the IFM-LCONS. Third, we extracted map-
ping results and AUC values from the ensemble model. The results of the 
species distribution models were then used as input data for the IFM- 
LCONS, considering any grid with a value above the threshold of 0.74 
as  an  input  variable  (number  of  species  observations).  Fourth,  we 
calculated the least-cost distance using the habitat suitability map for 
landscape connectivity analysis. Finally, the IFM-LCONS was developed,

In  our  study,  we  utilized  data  from  the  third  and  fourth  natural 
environment surveys, incorporating various environmental variables, to 
assess  the  impact  of  urban  development  on  species  distribution.  To 
achieve  this,  we  employed  seven  different  machine  learning  models, 
extracting the Area Under the Curve (AUC) values for each model both 
before and after urban development (Fig. 3). The AUC value, a critical 
measure of model performance, indicated that the Generalized Linear 
Model  (GLM)  and  Random  Forest  (RF)  models  had  the  highest  AUC 
value  of  0.85,  while  the  Classification  and  Regression  Tree  (CART) 
model  had  the  lowest  at  0.79.  On  average,  the  models  demonstrated 
robust performance with an average AUC value of 0.84, underscoring 
their overall effectiveness in species distribution modeling. Despite the 
methodological similarities among the models, their distinct character-

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or managing random seed values. However, some common strategies to manage randomness include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, employing multiple runs with different seeds to understand variability, and using techniques like cross-validation and bootstrapping to reduce overfitting and improve generalization.

This helpful answer provides a concise response based on the available context, acknowledges the lack of direct information, and offers relevant strategies related to managing randomness in deep learning pipelines.
