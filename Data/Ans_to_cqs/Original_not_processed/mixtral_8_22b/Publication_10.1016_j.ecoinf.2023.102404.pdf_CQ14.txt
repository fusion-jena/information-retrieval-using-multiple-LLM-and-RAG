3.4. RF model 

In  our  study,  we  adopted  a  grid  search  approach  to  optimize  the

reproducibility, and we evaluated multiple seeds to select the one that 
provides  the  most  stable  and  reliable  results.  To  carry  out  the  grid 
search, we defined a range of potential values for each parameter based 
on  prior  knowledge  and  literature  review.  The  grid  search  then 
exhaustively tested all possible combinations of these values and eval-
uated the model’s  performance using cross-validation techniques. For 
each  combination,  we  utilized  the  RMSE  as  the  evaluation  metric, 
aiming to minimize the RMSE to achieve the most accurate predictions. 
By employing the grid search method, we aimed to optimize the model’s 
hyperparameters and enhance its ability to generalize well to new, un-
seen data, making it a robust and effective tool for our regression task. 
The  winning  parameters  are  as  follows:  numberOfTrees:  150,  min-
LeafPopulation: 3, bagFraction: 1, and seed: 123.

parameters of our machine learning model. Specifically, we focused on 
tuning  several  critical  parameters,  namely  ‘numberOfTrees’,  ‘min-
LeafPopulation’, ‘bagFraction’, and ‘seed’. The ‘numberOfTrees’ repre-
sents the number of decision trees in the ensemble, and through the grid 
search, we explored different values to determine the ideal number of 
trees  that  balances  model  complexity  and  predictive  performance. 
Similarly, ‘minLeafPopulation’  refers to the minimum number of sam-
ples required to form a leaf node in each tree. We experimented with 
various values to find the optimal setting that prevents overfitting while 
capturing meaningful patterns in the data. The ‘bagFraction’  indicates 
the proportion of the training dataset used to train each individual tree, 
and  we  searched  for  the  best  value  to  enhance  model  diversity  and 
generalization. Lastly, ‘seed’  is a random number seed used to ensure

randomly  selected  half  of  the  pixels  for  the  training  and  testing  split 
(Hudak et al., 2020). This strategic sampling technique was chosen to 
capture  the  full  distribution  of  AGB  values  within  the  LiDAR-derived 
AGB  maps  accurately.  This  stratified  random  sampling  approach  was 
chosen to ensure that the training/testing dataset accurately represented 
the distribution of AGB values within the LiDAR-derived AGB maps. The 
use of this approach was crucial in ensuring that the AGB maps gener-
ated were accurate and representative of the distribution of AGB values 
in the study area.

Helpful Answer: In the given context, the authors have employed a grid search approach to optimize the reproducibility of their Random Forest (RF) model. Grid search is a type of exhaustive search algorithm where every possible combination of hyperparameter values is tried out. It involves defining a set of potential values for each parameter based on prior knowledge and literature review. Then, the grid search tests all possible combinations of these values and evaluates the model's performance using cross-validation techniques.

For each combination, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is used as the evaluation metric, aiming to minimize the RMSE to achieve the most accurate predictions. By utilizing the grid search method, the goal is to optimize the model's hyperparameters and improve its ability to generalize well to new, unseen data. This makes it a robust and effective tool for the regression task at hand.

Specifically, the authors focus on tuning four critical parameters: 'numberOfTrees','minLeafPopulation', 'bagFraction', and'seed'. These parameters correspond to the number of decision trees in the ensemble, the minimum number of samples required to form a leaf node in each tree, the proportion of the training dataset used to train each individual tree, and a random number seed, respectively. Through the grid search process, they explore various values for each parameter to identify the ideal settings that balance model complexity and predictive performance, prevent overfitting, and capture meaningful patterns in the data.
