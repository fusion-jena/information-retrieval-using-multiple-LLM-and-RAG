Tweets are usually short texts with such characteristics as sparsity, 
real-time nature, and irregularity. These features increase the difficulty 
of text processing (Edwards et al., 2022; Garg and Kumar, 2018; Sun 
et al., 2021) and require data cleaning to support subsequent analyses. 
Data cleaning includes text filtering and Chinese text segmentation. The 
former was used to filter out unnecessary symbols and noise, such as 
notes, advertisements, useless numbers, punctuation marks, stop words, 
and repeated texts on websites. User-generated text that deviated from 
the  theme  was  also  filtered  out  through  a  manual  review.  The  latter 
involved dividing the natural language composed of Chinese text into 
meaningful  words,  which  is  a  key  technology  in  text  analyses  (Tian 
et al., 2021). We used Python’s Jieba Library for Chinese text segmen-
tation and a lexical analysis and included location, time, and organiza-
tional nouns. 

2.2. Theme perception technology

Machine learning methods require text preprocessing, such as word 
segmentation and stop word removal, followed by the selection of a text 
portion to manually annotate emotions for accuracy verification. Among 
machine  learning  models,  the  enhanced  representation  through 
knowledge  integration  (ERNIE)  model  achieved  significant  results  in 
previous studies by learning prior semantic relationships and word order 
features from massive amounts of data (Sun et al., 2019). The ERNIE 
model  directly  models  prior  semantic  knowledge  units,  thereby 
enhancing model semantic representation (Wang et al., 2020). Test re-
sults for various Chinese tasks showed that the model performed better 
than  the  bidirectional  encoder  representations  from  the  transformer 
model proposed by Google AI (Sun et al., 2019). At the International 
Workshop on Semantic Evaluation 2020, the ERNIE model earned first 
place  for  a  mixed-language  emotional  analysis  task.  Detailed  de-

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions some general steps involved in data cleaning and preprocessing, including text filtering, Chinese text segmentation, word segmentation, and stop word removal. It also discusses the use of machine learning models like the Enhanced Representation through Knowledge Integration (ERNIE) model for emotion analysis tasks. But there is no mention of any techniques specifically aimed at addressing data bias, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot provide a helpful answer to this query.
