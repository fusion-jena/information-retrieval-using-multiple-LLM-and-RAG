The  entries  of  the  database  are  subsequently  ordered  from  the 
smaller to the higher sum of the residual values. This operation ends the 
first  step  of  the  LS  algorithm  and  leads  to  the  second  part,  hereafter 
defined  as  the  genetic  algorithm.  This  is  in  turn  based  on  an  iterative 
optimization, and its purpose is to partially optimize the results of the 
estimation and to better explore the space of the parameters. This part of 
the  process  is  analogous  to  the  previously  described  step:  the  first 
quarter  of  the  best  fit  parameter  values  stored  in  the  database  is 
considered as input for the process.

From each combination of values belonging to the first quarter of 
values stored in the Python dictionary, the GA generates four random 
combinations of initial values considered as input for the LS procedure 
previously described. Each best fit value stored in a single row of the 
dictionary is considered as an expected value of a Gaussian distribution, 
μ, while the associated variance is still considered as σ2  = (zμ)2. Each 
new combination of best fit values calculated during the iterations of the 
genetic algorithm is again stored in the database together with all the 
previously estimated sets of values. 

At the end of a genetic algorithm cycle, the rows of the database are 
again ordered according to the values of the sum of the residual. The 
genetic algorithm can be repeated an arbitrary number of times, but for 
simplicity we considered a nGAC = 2, that leads to a total number of nTGA 
= 2nGAC+1 ⋅ nLSF = 1536 LS fit evaluations.

2.3.2. The Metropolis-Hastings-like macro step 

The  Metropolis-Hastings-like  macro  step  has  the  final  aim  of 
improving the estimation of the parameters (in particular of their dis-
tribution) provided by the GA. For this purpose, it uses the best-fit values 
estimated through the LS method, previously stored in a database, and 
ordered by the sum of the residuals. By assumption, the GA is supposed 
to  provide  a  preliminary  optimization  of  the  parameters,  so  that  the 
MCMC  algorithm  can  consider,  as  input,  only  a  restricted  part  of  the 
values stored and ordered in the database. Depending on the number of 
iterations  carried  out  during  the  genetic  algorithm,  nTGA,  the  MCMC 
algorithm takes into consideration only the first nMCMC = nTGA/nLSF rows 
of the database that, in our case, is set to 8.

the set of associated parameters values. 

In this study, a total number of 20,000 iterations for each trace is 
considered, but in the end, only the values from the 101st to 20,000th 
iterations  are  saved.  The  choice  of  “burning”  the  first  100  sets  of 
parameter values estimated in each chain is related to the higher fluc-
tuation of the values during the first iterations. It is however supposed 
that the LS macro step via GA already provided a first optimization, so 
that after the first 100 iterations the MCMC-like algorithm is supposed to 
have reached a more stable convergence, providing final values with a 
lower uncertainty associated.

Helpful Answer:

The given context does not directly discuss regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, I will briefly explain these techniques for your understanding.

Regularization methods help reduce overfitting in machine learning models, including deep learning pipelines. Two common regularization techniques are Dropout and L2 Regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent complex co-adaptations on training data. In other words, dropout temporarily removes some units along with their connections from the neural network during training, forcing the model to learn redundant representations of features.

L2 Regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights. This encourages smaller weights, leading to simpler models and reducing overfitting.

These regularization methods are often employed when building deep learning models to improve generalization performance and avoid overfitting.
