EXtreme  gradient  boosting  (XGBoost)  is  an  improved  stacking 
approach based on the Gradient Intensifier (Friedman, 2001, 2002). The 
key  principle  behind  this  technique  is  that  instead  of  creating  a  pre-
dictive  model  with  relative  accuracy,  we  create  several  models  with 
lesser accuracy when used separately but provide high accuracy when 
combined. The final model is the consequence of including many func-
tionalities  from  the  beginning.  An  XGBoost  learning  model  may  be 
expressed as follows (Dubossarsky et al., 2016):

(q : Rm)→T; x is an n-dimensional array input 
where Y =
vector; y is the prediction function; w is the weight of the ith node; q is 
the structure of a tree, mapping the data sample to the corresponding 
node;  T  is  the  number  of  nodes  in  the  tree;  f  is  the  structure  of  the 
model’s independent n-trees; and m is the number of features.

inference system with ABC optimization technique to enhance the pre-
diction model’s performance. In a prior study conducted by Pham et al. 
(2023), the ACO-NFS model was utilized to estimate the extent of forest 
fire in the Bo Trach district, Quang Binh province. However, the authors 
of that study solely focused on one specific type of forest cover without 
addressing  the  susceptibility  of  different  forest  types  to  wildfires. 
Considering these limitations, our experiment aims to integrate a hybrid 
model  for  predicting  forest  fires  vulnerability  with  a  deep  learning 
model-based approach for forests classification.

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it can be inferred that the researchers have employed some form of data preprocessing since they have used Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for land use/land cover classification and forest types identification.

Data preprocessing is crucial before applying machine learning algorithms like XGBoost to ensure accurate results. Techniques such as stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and collecting diverse datasets can help mitigate data biases. These methods aim to balance class distribution, reduce overfitting, improve generalizability, and increase overall model performance.

Stratified sampling involves dividing the dataset into subsets based on target variables, ensuring each subset has roughly equal representation. Oversampling increases minority class samples, while undersampling reduces majority class samples to achieve balanced classes. Collecting diverse datasets helps capture various scenarios and patterns, reducing potential biases caused by limited data sources.

Although not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, these techniques could potentially be applied during the preprocessing stage of the deep learning pipeline to address data bias. It would depend on the nature of the dataset and the specific requirements of the research project.
