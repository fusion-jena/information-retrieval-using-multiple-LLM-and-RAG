structure as the one present in the encoder 

For more details on the theory of the elements discussed we refer the 
reader to the reference book (Goodfellow et al., 2016). This architecture 
involves  a  large  number  of  hyperparameters  related  to  the  different 
types of layers (convolutional or recurrent) and therefore a large number 
of  parameters.  As  a  reminder,  a  parameter  is  internal  to  the  neural 
network.  It  will  evolve  during  the  whole  training  process  A  hyper-
parameter is external to the training process, it defines the properties of 
the network. It remains static during the training process. 

The  HyperBand  algorithm  is  proposed  for  optimisation  and  is 

described in the next section.

hyperparameters for model architectures.  

2.  Partial training: Models are partially trained (on a small fraction of 
the data) to quickly eliminate underperforming configurations.  
3.  Successive Halving: The remaining configurations are grouped into 
sets of different sizes, and the associated models are trained further. 
The best-performing configurations in each set are promoted to the 
next  stage,  while 
the  under-performing  configurations  are 
eliminated. 

4. Repeat: Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until only one configuration re-
mains, which is then considered the best configuration found.

encoder and the decoder:  

• hidden  layers  (nbr-layers-RHN)  ∈ [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].  The  hidden  layers 
allow the neural network to model non-linear relationships between 
inputs  and  outputs.  Each  hidden  layer  in  a  deep  neural  network 
computes a non-linear transformation of the previous layer's outputs, 
allowing  the  network  to  learn  increasingly  abstract  and  complex 
features as information is propagated through the network.  

• dimension of hidden state (dim-RHN) ∈ [8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72 
, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112, 120, 128].The  dimension  of  the  hidden  state 
determines the size of the hidden state vectors that are calculated at 
each time step of the model. A higher dimension of the hidden state 
can allow the model to capture more complex and subtle information 
in the data, but it can also make the model slower to train and require 
more training data.

–  Attention  mechanism  (Bahdanau  et  al.,  2014):  is  a  neural  layer 
allowing the model to learn to weight the information provided by 
the encoder according to their importance at a given time in relation 
to the decoding of the target series. The model learns to focus on the 
most relevant elements in the input sequence for the prediction task.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific purpose of the deep learning model being used. However, based on the context, we can infer that this model involves both an encoder and a decoder structure, suggesting that it might be employed for tasks such as sequence-to-sequence modeling, autoencoding, or machine translation. These types of models often involve encoding input sequences into a latent representation using an encoder, followed by generating output sequences from this representation using a decoder.

Additionally, the presence of convolutional or recurrent layers indicates that the model could potentially handle spatial or temporal dependencies within the input data. Convolutional layers are commonly used for image processing tasks like object recognition or semantic segmentation, while recurrent layers are typically utilized for sequential data analysis, including natural language processing or speech recognition.

Furthermore, the use of attention mechanisms suggests that the model aims to selectively attend to certain parts of the input when producing its output. This technique has been widely adopted in various applications, such as machine translation, summarization, and visual question answering.

Overall, without additional context, it is challenging to pinpoint the exact purpose of the deep learning model described here. Nevertheless, based on the available information, we can speculate that it may be designed for handling sequential or spatial data, possibly involving tasks like sequence generation, translation, or feature extraction.
