Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

5.5. Relevance for policy and management

3.10. Drought characteristics (severity, duration, and intensity) 

The regions  experiencing drought,  RED (measured in  percentage), 

were combined using drought indices for every timeframe and step.

where  RED  represents  regions  experiencing  a  drought  with  time  t,  D 
represents drought (in the form of 0 or 1), R represents region, and g 
represents grid. Eq. 2 provides the percentage of regions experiencing 
drought, which determines the impact of drought in terms of its extent 
or  land  areas  affected  (in  percentage)  (e.g.,  Ndehedehe  et  al.,  2021; 
Wang et al., 2018). Drought severity, DS is evaluated for each drought 
event with t time, starting from ts and ending with te given in Eq. 3 (e.g., 
Diaz et al., 2019).

lies  in  exploring the  potential of  deep  learning and  machine  learning 
algorithms  for  enhancing  groundwater-climate  interactions  under-
standing and investigating the climatic hotspots implications within the 
sub-basins of the GAB region.

GWS variation with drought indices (i.e., SPEI) at different scales of 3- 
months,  6-months  and  12-months  was  investigated  using  Pearson's 
correlation.  The  climate  influence  on  GWS  variations  were  evaluated 
using SPEI and climate teleconnections data. Prior to correlation anal-
ysis, it was ensured that SPEI and GRACE-TWS were consistent in terms 
of grid size. We also used Pearson's correlation to evaluate relationships 
between GWS and climate teleconnection indices for the GAB region.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no information available regarding how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The provided context does not mention any specific methods such as grid search or random search for hyperparameter optimization. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate response based on the given context.
