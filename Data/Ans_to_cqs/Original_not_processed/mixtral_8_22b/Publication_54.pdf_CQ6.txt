IV. EXPERIMENTAL SETTINGS
To extract the relevant features of birds, we randomly split
the endemic bird data into 3,132 images for training and
760 images for testing. To allow the deep networks to con-
verge and improve the ability of the model to generalize
adeptly, we augmented the training dataset 10 times, resulting
in a total of 31,320 images. Then, 25,056 (80%) images were
used for training and 6,264 (20%) were used for validation.
The Inception-ResNet-v2 model was trained using the mini-
batch gradient descent algorithm with the batch size set to
32 and the learning rate maintained at 0.0001. The Adam
optimizer was used to ﬁne-tune the model with the following
parameters:

• Exponential decay rate of ﬁrst-moment estimation

of 0.9.

The structure of this paper is organized as follows.
Section II describes data acquisition and preprocessing of
acquired dataset to overcome imbalanced and data overﬁt-
ting. Section III focuses on the deep learning models and
enhancement of ﬁne grained feature extraction accuracy by
swapping the misclassiﬁed data between the training and
validation datasets. Section IV illustrates the experimental
setting and the hardware requirements. Section V endorses
the proof of concept and validation of the purposed method-
ology. Section VI emphasizes the signiﬁcances of endemic
birds and its habitation. Finally, Section VII summarizes the
impact of the purposed model and presents directions for
future study.

The model is then iteratively trained and validated on these
different sets. The training set is used to ﬁt the parameters of
the classiﬁer, whereas the validation set provides an unbiased
evaluation of the model ﬁt on the training set while tuning
model hyperparameters, such as the network layer size, ﬁnd-
ing the optimal number of hidden units, and regularizing the
model. Models with few hyperparameters are easy to validate
and tune, but if the model has many hyperparameters, a larger
validation dataset is required. In some cases, the evaluation
is biased when a validation dataset is not incorporated into
the model conﬁguration because the model may perfectly ﬁt
the training data with high accuracy but may fail to ﬁt the
test or validation data. In such cases, k-fold cross-validation,
which is a resampling technique, is used to avoid overﬁtting;
the training set is generated with different combinations of k
groups (say 5 or 10, depending on the size of the dataset) as

FIGURE 4. Flowchart for model validation.

• Train the Inception-ResNet-v2 architecture on data aug-

mented from original images.

• Test the validation dataset and determine the misclassi-

ﬁed images.

• Randomly interchange the same amount of misclassiﬁed
validation images with the training images and retrain
the model again.

• Repeat this process until the classiﬁer adapts to the

speciﬁc target task.

• Fit the model to evaluate the test set.
In this way, the algorithm can tune itself and improve the
generalizability of spatial features to the previously unseen
domains present in the image.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that there isn't explicit information about specific preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, the text does mention that the endemic bird data was acquired and preprocessed to overcome imbalance and data overfitting. This could imply various techniques such as data augmentation, which is mentioned later in the context. Data augmentation involves creating new samples by applying random transformations to the existing data, thus increasing the diversity of the dataset and reducing overfitting. Additionally, the context mentions splitting the data into training and testing sets, which is also a common step in preparing data for machine learning tasks. It's important to note that preprocessing steps can vary greatly depending on the nature of the data and the specific requirements of the model being used. Therefore, without more detailed information, it's difficult to provide a comprehensive list of preprocessing steps involved in this particular case.
