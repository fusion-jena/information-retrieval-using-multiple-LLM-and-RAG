both training and testing. A critical point to highlight is that models are 
retrained  for  each  fold,  preventing  previous  fold’s  information  from 
being transferred. We utilized the pretrained ResNet-34 (Which consists 
of  a  34-layer  convolutional  neural  network)  architecture  which  is  a 
variant of the ResNet (Residual Network) family, widely used for deep 
learning tasks, particularly in computer vision (He et al., 2016). ResNet- 
34 was used inside the fast.ai framework (Howard and Gugger, 2020) to 
leverage  existing  knowledge,  this  is  particularly  useful  in  our  dataset 
since its small size. Transfer learning generally consists in using a model 
pre-trained  on  broad  datasets,  like  ImageNet  (Deng  et  al.,  2009),  to 
specialized tasks with more limited data. As part of the cross-validation 
of the Leave-One-Group-Out approach, the test directory containing the 
multitemporal transect was temporarily moved to test, and DataLoaders

To expand our dataset, we tripled the image pool for each transect by 
incorporating multi-temporal data. By drawing data from a three-month 
span (March, September and October 2015) across three environments, 
we could more effectively train and test deep learning models, which 
inherently  demand  many  images  to  learn  effectively,  however,

The Convolutional Autoencoder and its variations extracts the most 
critical features and minimizes noise within the training data (Kingma 
and Welling, 2019, Zhao et al., 2019, Bank et al., 2023). This process 
results  in  a  compact  and  informative  feature  matrix,  which  is  subse-
quently fed into the PLSR or any regression model. PLSR is particularly 
suitable  for  datasets  that have  undergone  Convolutional Autoencoder 
processing,  where  the  output  is  a  flattened  vector  representing  each 
image, and each vector element is a variable in a tabular form. PLSR 
excels in these scenarios with numerous correlated variables (Carrascal 
et al., 2009). In our case the final matrix is transformed into a vector that 
represents each image with a vector with over 8000 values, each one 
representing one variable as a tabular form. The image dataset is orga-
nized into 18 folders, one for each of the 450 m transects (150 m *3). The

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, it appears that the authors utilized the pretrained ResNet-34 architecture, which is a variant of the ResNet family, widely used for deep learning tasks, particularly in computer vision. They leveraged existing knowledge from the ResNet-34 model trained on the ImageNet dataset. To improve their dataset, they incorporated multi-temporal data from March, September, and October 2015 across three environments. However, the specific names of the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline were not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, based on the available information, it can be concluded that the primary dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is ImageNet, along with additional unnamed multi-temporal datasets.
