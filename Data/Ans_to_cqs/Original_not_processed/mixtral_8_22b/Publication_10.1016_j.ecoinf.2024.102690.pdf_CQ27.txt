ecological leisure corridors, 6 along species migration corridors, and 2 
along  river  runoff  corridors  in  Scenario  C.  While  other  disturbance 
points were mostly found in the center of the mountain greenbelt, those 
in  the  southern  section  of  the  region  were  concentrated  around  river 
tributaries and watercourses.

2)  Three  scenarios  were  established  based  on  identifying  service 
bundles: product supply, water conservation, and habitat maintenance. 
The  number  of  sources  was  11,  4,  and  4  for  each  type,  respectively, 
accounting for 37.6% of the total area of the region. Under these three 
scenarios, 30, 36, and 36 ecological corridors were identified and clas-
sified into five categories. 

3) In Guangzhou, the minimum area threshold for ecological sources 
is 10 km2. The CWD values for identifying ecological pinch points were 
20,000,  62,000,  and  93,000  for  the  three  scenarios,  while  the  search 
radii for ecological barriers were 320, 200, and 500 m.

Identification of optional ecological sources 

The SOFM is an unsupervised learning neural network approach that 
combines dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis to allocate 
research units into different ES bundles based on spatial similarities. The 
ES bundles were divided using SOFM (using the R package kohonen) 
based on the results of the reconstructed ESV, and the ideal number of 
bundles  was  established  by  calculating  the  Davis-Boldin  Index  (DBI), 
which was used as the basis for identifying ecological sources and setting 
scenarios. Furthermore, this study used hotspot analysis (Getis-Ord G*
i ) 
to  analyze the  spatial clustering of  ESV and  considered  hotspot areas 
with a significance level of 90% or more as optional ecological sources.
