directly affect the performance of the models.

Random Forest Regressor exhibits the longest training time. However, 
the potential improvement in performance may warrant the investment 
of additional effort. Performance of Linear Regression, Lasso, and Ridge 
models is deemed unsatisfactory despite their efficient training times.

the  previous  step,  and  outputs  length  and  width  in  centimeters.  Fish 
biomass depends on factors such as fish length, width, and turbidity of 
water. The final model tries to establish a relationship between these 
factors. The last model, the tilapia weight estimator, takes the length and 
width in centimeters and turbidity as the input and gives the estimated 
biomass as output. There are many regression models available. To find 
the one that best suits each step, grid search (Rao and Vinod, 2019) is 
employed.  It  uses  hyperparameter  tuning  to  find  the  best  regression 
technique for each. Finally, the biomass is fed to a feed estimator, which 
outputs the amount of feed required since the amount of feed depends on 
the biomass of the fish.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a three-phase grid search. Grid search is a technique used in machine learning to tune the parameters of a model by trying all possible combinations of parameter values from a given set. This methodical approach ensures that the optimal combination of hyperparameters is found, resulting in improved model performance. In this case, the grid search was employed to find the best regression technique for each step of the process, ultimately leading to the selection of specific models like Gradient Boosting Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and others mentioned in Table 8.
