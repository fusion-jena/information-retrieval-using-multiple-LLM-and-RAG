%Query
Query: "Which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The article does not provide information about which specific framework was used to build the deep learning model. However, common frameworks used for building deep learning models include TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, and others. Without additional context or information from the authors, it is impossible to determine which framework was used in this case.
