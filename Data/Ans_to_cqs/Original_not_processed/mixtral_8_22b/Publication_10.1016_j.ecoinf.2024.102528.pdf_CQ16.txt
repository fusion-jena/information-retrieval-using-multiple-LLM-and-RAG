2.4. The monitoring framework 

The first step in our pipeline was to divide the acoustic signals from 
the long recordings (typically of 30 min each) into 3-s segments, with no 
overlap. For each segment, we used the BirdNET-Analyzer (https://gith 
ub.com/kahst/BirdNET-Analyzer)  to  identify  the  species  present, 
extracting the top three species with the highest confidence scores. We 
applied threshold values of fixed 0.35, 0.25 and 0.15 for the first, second 
and third species in the list, respectively, to filter out predictions with 
lower  confidence  scores,  as  they  might  be  erroneous.  Usually,  in  our 
dataset, BirdNET identification confidence scores lower than 0.15 are 
false  positives. In  addition, we used  a species  specific  thresholds (see 
above). Next, we summed the number of vocalizations for each species

We  examined species  specific  thresholds, computed  the recall  and 
precision  for  various  thresholds  and  demonstrate  the  species  specific

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any direct information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete or if validation loss plateaus were considered. However, it can be inferred that the authors use BirdNET-Analyzer for identifying bird species based on their acoustic signals. They apply threshold values of fixed 0.35, 0.25, and 0.15 for the first, second, and third species in the list, respectively, to filter out predictions with lower confidence scores. This suggests that the authors may consider reaching these threshold values as an indication of successful training completion. Additionally, the authors mention examining species-specific thresholds, computing recall and precision for various thresholds, and demonstrating species-specific results. These steps indicate that the authors evaluate the performance of their model using metrics such as recall and precision, which could also serve as indicators for determining when training is complete.
