(3) Deeplabv3þ. In the encoding stage of Deeplabv3+ model, the 
backbone  network  is  replaced  with  Mobilenetv2  featuring  expanded 
convolution (Fig. 5). Mobilenetv2 network ensures higher accuracy and 
enhances  the  model’s  lightweight  nature  compared  to  the  originally 
used  Xception+ network  (Fu  et  al.,  2022),  significantly  reducing  the 
model weights file size and accelerating model prediction speed. Addi-
tionally,  the  semantic  segmentation  task  involves  incorporating  ASPP 
module into the encoder-decoder network (Chen et al., 2018b). Five sets 
of feature maps are obtained by utilizing four atrous convolution blocks 
with varied dilation rates (including convolution, batch normalization, 
and activation layers) and a global average pooling block. These feature 
maps are concatenated, then passed through a 1 × 1 convolution block, 
and  ultimately  inputted  into  the  Decoder  module.  ASPP  method  in-

(1)  Unet.  By  incorporating  an  encoder-decoder  structure  that  es-
tablishes shortcut connections, Unet model extended upon FCN’s end-to- 
end concept (Ronneberger et al., 2015). The input to the network is a 
512  × 512  pixels  image  (Fig.  3).  The  encoder  (left  dashed  square) 
downsamples the input tensor and encodes it into a vector with reduced 
dimensions. It consists of multiple convolutional blocks, each including 
a  3  × 3  convolutional  kernel  layer,  batch  normalization,  and  an

2023; Yuan et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2023c). The model’s initial learning 
rate was set to 0.01, further refined via iterative testing. The number of 
iterations was 150, with a batch size of 4, downsampling multiplier set 
at 8, and utilized SGD optimizer, ReLu activation function, and Dice loss 
function.

%Query
Query: "What process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model (e.g., Model serialization, Platform selection)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, we can infer from the given context that the model was likely serialized after training due to its use in subsequent stages. This is evident from the mention of the model weights file size being significantly reduced, which suggests that the model was saved or serialized post-training. As for platform selection, no specific details were mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the exact process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
