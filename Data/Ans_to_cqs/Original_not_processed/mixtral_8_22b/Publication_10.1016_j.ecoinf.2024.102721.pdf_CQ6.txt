2.3.3. LSTM model

The LSTM model is a type of machine learning model that is derived
from recurrent neural networks (RNN). Its special memory unit effec-
tively addresses the issue of gradient vanishing and explosion in RNN for
long-term sequences. The structure of the model is illustrated in Fig. 3.
The LSTM memory unit comprises a forget gate, input gate, output gate,
and hidden layer. Signals are transmitted between different units
through three control gates in the hidden layer, determining which in-
formation should be stored, read, and written. Because of the precise
control of information by gate structures, LSTM can effectively learn in
long time sequences and is well-suited for time series prediction.

Where Φi is the SHAP value of feature i. The larger the SHAP value,
the greater contribution of the feature to the prediction; S is the set of
features; (S ⊆ N\i)denotes the subset that excludes feature i; N is the set
of all features; f is the prediction function of the model; f(S) is the pre-
diction result of the model on the set of features S; |S| denotes the
number of elements in set S.

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), several preprocessing steps may be required depending on the nature of the data. These steps help improve the performance and accuracy of the model. Some common preprocessing techniques include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing or correcting any inconsistencies, errors, or missing values within the dataset. It ensures that only high-quality data is used for training the model.

2. Normalization: Normalizing the data scales the input variables to a similar range, typically between 0 and 1. This helps prevent any single variable from dominating the learning process due to its scale. Common normalization techniques include Min-Max Scaling and Z-score normalization.

3. Feature Selection: Selecting relevant features from the dataset can significantly impact the model's performance. Irrelevant features might introduce noise into the model, leading to poor predictions. Techniques like correlation matrix analysis, backward elimination, or forward selection can be employed for this purpose.

4. Encoding Categorical Variables: Deep learning models require numerical inputs. Therefore, categorical variables must be converted into numerical form using encoding techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding.

5. Splitting Dataset: Before training the model, it is essential to split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets. Typically, the dataset is divided into 70-80% for training, 10-15% for validation, and 10-15% for testing.

These preprocessing steps ensure that the deep learning model receives clean, normalized, and relevant data, ultimately improving its predictive capabilities. However, not every step mentioned above will always be necessary, and the specific requirements depend on the characteristics of the dataset and the problem being addressed.
