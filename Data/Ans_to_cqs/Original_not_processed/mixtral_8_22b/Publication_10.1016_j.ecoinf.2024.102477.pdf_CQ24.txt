Deep  learning  methods  are  being  widely  applied to  create  models 
directly from large volumes of complex data (Seng et al., 2021). Deep 
learning methods have superior performance for time-series prediction 
than  do  many  other  models  (Li  et  al.,  2019b).  SLSTM  has  been  suc-
cessfully used to predict agricultural product sales (Yoo and Oh, 2020). 
To mitigate the high price volatility of agricultural products, sales vol-
ume can be forecasted before production for reducing production risks 
and  facilitating  agricultural  planning,  ultimately  minimizing  post-
production  price  fluctuations.  In  a  case  study,  an  SLSTM  model  was 
found  to  exhibit  lower  errors  and  considerably  higher  performance 
compared with the ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM models. In another case 
study, an SGRU model was used for successfully predicting the Pacific 
decadal  oscillation  index  at  multiple  time  scales  and  achieved  mean

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not directly address the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it is important to note that handling randomness is crucial in ensuring reproducibility and consistency in machine learning experiments. Some common strategies include setting fixed seeds for various libraries like NumPy or TensorFlow, which ensures consistent results across different runs. Additionally, techniques like cross-validation, bootstrapping, and bagging can help manage variability due to random sampling. Lastly, employing deterministic algorithms instead of stochastic ones can also reduce the impact of randomness.
