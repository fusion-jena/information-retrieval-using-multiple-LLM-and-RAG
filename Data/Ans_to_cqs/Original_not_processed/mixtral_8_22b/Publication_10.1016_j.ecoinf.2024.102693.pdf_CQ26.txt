Yuan et al. (2022) claimed that the superior performance of a ViT can 
primarily be attributed to extensive pre-training data. If a ViT is trained 
from  scratch  on  a  medium-sized  dataset,  its  performance  lags  behind 
that of a CNN model with comparable parameter sizes. To address this 
limitation, they proposed Volo with the novel Outlook Attention as the 
token mixer module, which enabled fine-grained token representation 
and the aggregation of global information. 

2.3. MLP-like model

2.2. Transformer-like model 

Transformer  was  proposed  by  Vaswani  et  al.  (2017)  and  initially 
designed for Seq2Seq tasks, replacing long short-term memory (LSTM) 
with a full-attention structure. It was primarily applied in NLP, and both 
the  transformer  and  its  subsequent  iterations  demonstrated  excellent 
performance in a wide range of downstream tasks. With the success of 
the transformer in NLP, researchers have begun to explore its applica-
tion in CV. 

The core structure of the transformer-like visual model is an encoder 
module, which comprises several stacked blocks. Each block consists of 
two  components:  a  token  mixer  module  (Yu  et  al.,  2022)  for  fusing 
spatial information and an MLP module for fusing channel information. 
The main distinction among the different transformer-like visual models 
lies in the variations in the token mixer module. For example, the token 
mixer in a ViT (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) is a self-attention module.

The basic models were trained using a deep transfer-learning strat-
egy based on fine-tuning. The model parameters were initialized using a 
pre-trained model. The final classification layer was then replaced by a 
fully connected layer, aligning its output dimension with the number of 
classes  in  the  target  dataset.  Subsequently,  all  parameters  across  the 
layers were fine-tuned on the target dataset. The basic models in all the 

The  performances  of  the  four  basic  models  and  two  proposed 
ensemble  methods  on  the  IP102  dataset  are  lised  in  Table  2.  The 
parameter  sizes  of  the  four  basic  models  were  comparable,  with 
approximately 24 M parameters for each model. However, there was a 
significant variation in the performances of the basic models, as shown 
in Table 2. ViP-Small/7 exhibited the lowest performance, whereas the 
two  transformer-like  models  demonstrated  better  performance,  with 
Volo-d1 achieving the highest performance.

We compared the performance of our method with those of previous 
studies using the IP102 dataset, as shown in Table 3. This table presentes 
the  results  of  both  the  single  models  and  ensemble  methods.  By 
comparing the four basic models in Table 2 with the single models in 
Table  3,  it  is  evident  that  our  trained  basic  models  demonstrated 
impressive performances on the IP102 dataset. For example, our trained 
ResNet-50 exhibited a remarkable improvement of approximately 20% 
in accuracy compared to the results reported by Wu et al. (2019), and 
our  trained  ViT-S/16  outperformed  the  larger-scale  AA-Trans  (Wang 
et al., 2023). This notable enhancement can be primarily attributed to 
the implementation of advanced deep transfer-learning strategies and 
the incorporation of multiple data augmentation techniques. Moreover, 
the performance of Volo-d1 exceeded that of some larger-scale single 
models  and  ensemble  methods.  This  observation  highlights  the

Helpful Answer:

The given context does not provide specific details about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, I can share general techniques used to handle data bias, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same class distribution in both sets. This technique ensures that the model learns from a representative sample of the entire dataset.

Oversampling is a technique where the minority class samples are duplicated or synthesized to balance the class distribution. This helps prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class. Undersampling, on the other hand, involves removing samples from the majority class to achieve a balanced class distribution. Both oversampling and undersampling aim to mitigate the impact of imbalanced datasets on model performance.

Diverse data collection refers to collecting data from various sources, demographics, or environments to ensure that the dataset represents real-world scenarios accurately. This technique reduces the risk of overfitting and improves the model's ability to generalize to new data.

In summary, these techniques help address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline by ensuring that the dataset is representative, balanced, and diverse.
