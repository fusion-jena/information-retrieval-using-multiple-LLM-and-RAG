5.2. Ablation studies 

Data  requirements  are  a  key  consideration  for  many  monitoring 
applications  given  the  lack  of  existing  datasets.  Audio  enhancement 
models  require  training  data  for  fine-tuning.  Fine-tuning  does  not 
necessarily require large datasets. Section 4.1.2 demonstrate that similar 
performance could be achieved using a subset of 100 training examples. 
Data  augmentation  techniques  such  as  superimposing  noise  samples 
should  also  be  considered  as  bioacoustics  applications  typically  have 
abundant  noise  features.  Both  WPD  and  spectral  subtraction  do  not 
require training data.

training  deep  noise  reduction  techniques.  There  are  also  challenges 
when generating training data for fine-tuning. Generally, clean data is 
collected, and noise profiles are superimposed to provide both the input 
data  and  a  “denoised”  ground  truth.  Collecting  clean  recordings  is 
infeasible  in  many  cases  or  requires  the  recording  of  captive  animals 
which  may  not  be  representative  of  the  wider  population.  Adjacent 
fields can generate human speech or music as required but this is not an 
option for many bioacoustics applications.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not explicitly mention any specific criteria for determining when training is complete. However, it does discuss the use of training data for fine-tuning audio enhancement models. In general, common practices for determining when training is complete include observing the performance of the model on a separate validation set and stopping training once the validation loss plateaus or starts increasing, indicating overfitting. Additionally, early stopping can be employed to halt training if no improvement is seen after a certain number of epochs. These principles would likely apply to the fine-tuning process mentioned in the text, although the exact criteria might vary depending on the specific application and model architecture.
