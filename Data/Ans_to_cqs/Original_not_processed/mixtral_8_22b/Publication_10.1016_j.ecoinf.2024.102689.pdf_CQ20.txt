GPU  and  utilizes  CUDA  version  11.4.  Python  3.6  serves  as  the  pro-
gramming language, and Pytorch version 1.8.0 is used in conjunction 
with  the  virtual  environment  function  of  Anaconda3.  Optimization  is 
carried out using the Adam optimizer with a Momentum of 0.9 and a 
Batch size of 16. Images are processed at a resolution of 1024 × 1024, 
with an initial learning rate set at 0.001 and a minimum learning rate of 
0.0001. The descent mode is step, and training spans 300 epochs.

0.3 FPS. The primary reason for this discrepancy lies in the intricate and 
resource-intensive  nature  of  our  model’s  network  architecture.  In 
contrast,  the  LFGT  algorithm  achieves  a  more  streamlined  and  light-
weight design by segmenting its model into global and local branches. 
During the prediction phase, LFGT relies solely on the global branch for 
individual recognition. While our algorithm’s average processing time 
for  individual  data  stands  at  a  mere  0.05  s,  satisfying  real-time  re-
quirements, there is ample potential for enhancing its efficiency through 
further  lightweighting.  We  recognize  that  there  is  much  room  for 
improvement in this aspect of our methodology.

Helpful Answer:
The deep learning model was trained using GPU resources. Specifically, it utilized CUDA version 11.4. The programming language used was Python 3.6, and PyTorch version 1.8.0 was employed within the virtual environment function of Anaconda3. The optimization process was carried out using the Adam optimizer with a momentum of 0.9 and a batch size of 16. Images were processed at a resolution of 1024 x 1024, with an initial learning rate set at 0.001 and a minimum learning rate of 0.0001. Training spanned 300 epochs.
