prevent  potential  performance  degradation  of  the  model  and  avoids 
overfitting, which can limit the ability to make good extrapolations to 
unseen regions (Duque-Lazo et al., 2016). In this study, we employed 
two common variable elimination techniques for random forests: 1) RFE 
(Recursive  Feature  Elimination,  Khun,  2022)  and  2)VSURF  (Variable 
Selection Using Random Forests; Genuer et al., 2022). In RFE, the user 
defines a termination condition for model performance, and the algo-
rithm  iteratively  removes  one  variable  at  a  time  while  evaluating  its 
impact  on  the  modelâ€™s  performance.  This  process  continues  until  the 
algorithm reaches the best predefined level of model performance. In 
this study, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was used as the termination 
condition. As a result, RFE retained all variables whose removal led to a 
deterioration in the best RMSE value. VSURF follows a three-step pro-

4. Discussion 

The  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  evaluate  how  well  a 
classical random forest machine learning model together with satellite- 
based environmental estimates can predict relative tsetse abundance in 
all of Kenya using a spatially limited set of tsetse trapping data. Based on 
our results, in this section we also pinpoint areas of improvement and 
opportunities to enhance the precision and reliability of predictions of 
tsetse fly relative densities within Kenya. 

4.1. National scale tsetse mapping with spatially limited data

Among the many machine learning techniques, here we selected the 
classical random forest method due to its well-documented success in 
predicting the abundance of other disease vectors, such as mosquitoes. 
To enhance the precision of our method, we implemented two feature 
elimination  techniques  namely,  Recursive  Feature  Elimination  (RFE;

Darst et al., 2018; Khun, 2022) and Variable Selection Using Random 
Forests (VSURF; Genuer et al., 2022; Speiser, 2021; Speiser et al., 2019). 
RFE  retains  variables  based  on  their  importance  in  explaining  the 
response variable (Khun, 2022), while the VSURF method goes a step 
further  by  assessing  how  these  important  variables  contribute to  pre-
dicting  the  response  variable  and  retains  only  those  that  lead  to  a 
reduction in prediction error (Genuer et al., 2022). To the best of our 
knowledge, there have been no previous attempts to develop random 
forest models for predicting relative tsetse fly numbers by integrating in- 
situ  tsetse  catches  with  satellite-based  variables.  Furthermore,  the 
impact of different feature elimination techniques on tsetse predictions 
has not been assessed previously.

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not directly address the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it discusses methods used to prevent potential performance degradation and overfitting in a classical random forest machine learning model applied to predict relative tsetse abundance in Kenya. Two common variable elimination techniques were employed: Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Variable Selection Using Random Forests (VSURF). These techniques help improve the model's performance and generalization capabilities by removing irrelevant or redundant features from the dataset. While these methods do not specifically target handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, they contribute to building more robust and reliable machine learning models.
