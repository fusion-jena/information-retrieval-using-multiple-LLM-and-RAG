filter, WQ inlets, weekly street sweeping, wet pond, and wetland detention. Bars with gray outlines and white filling represent BMPs for which efficiency data was 
not available.

Fig.  6  provides  an  overview  of  the  tool,  highlighting  its  various 
features, which are identified by corresponding numbers in the figure. 
These  features  include  1)  zoom  in  and  out,  default  extent,  and  my 
location;  2)  search  bar  to  find  a  place  or  address;  3)  environmental 
justice indices alongside total pollutant loads before and after BMP; 4) 
map legend; 5); filtering metrics based on specific values; 6) addition of 
online  data;  7)  selection  of  different  basemaps;  and  8)  selection  of  a 
specific region, print map and share the tool. Using the drop-down menu 
labeled as #3 in Fig. 6, users can access pollutant loads pre- and post- 
BMP  implementation,  as  well  as  EJ  metrics  and  indices.  All  data  are 
color-coded based on quantile mapping, which means there are equal 
numbers of watersheds or census tracts within each class, representing 
different  tiers  of  pollution  or  social  vulnerability.  Pollutant  loads  are

devices, extended wet detention, and LID/dry well with 83%, 72%, and 
70% BOD removal efficiency. In this case, infiltration devices can lower 
the median BOD from 28,301 to 4811 kg/year (see Fig. 4c). TSS removal 
efficiency of alum treatment, infiltration devices, and porous pavement

Fig. 6b illustrates an example wherein the tool identifies locations 
characterized by higher TN loads and the least favorable conditions of 
the social vulnerability index (group 4), which are visually represented 
as darker purple areas. By selecting any of these prioritized locations (i. 
e., the darker purple polygons where BMP implementation is crucial), 
users  can  access  comprehensive  information  about  the  corresponding 
census tract and watershed attributes including all environmental jus-
tice metrics and pollutant loads (as depicted in Fig. 6b). In this particular 
scenario,  these  locations  represent  areas  with  higher  TN  values  and 
higher social vulnerability status; however, users have the flexibility to 
choose alternative metrics such as TP, TSS, and BOD, alongside specific 
indices related to racial/ethnicity or socioeconomic factors or individual 
environmental justice metrics. This selection enables the identification

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide explicit information regarding the use of optimization techniques in a deep learning pipeline. However, common optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). These methods help minimize the loss function during training, enabling the model to learn effectively from the input data. Other popular optimization techniques include RMSprop, AdaGrad, and Nadam. Each technique has its strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different types of problems and datasets.

The given context focuses primarily on the application of Best Management Practices (BMPs) for water quality improvement and the use of a tool to identify priority locations for implementing these practices. It discusses various features of the tool, such as searching for places or addresses, displaying pollutant loads before and after BMP implementation, and providing environmental justice indices. Additionally, it mentions the removal efficiencies of certain BMPs for Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Total Suspended Solids (TSS). Unfortunately, none of this information directly relates to optimization techniques employed in deep learning pipelines.
