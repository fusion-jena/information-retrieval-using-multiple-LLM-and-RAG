(Zhang and Benveniste, 1992), Bayesian learning machine (Xu, 1997),
and so on. Researchers have extended the application and improve the
algorithms based on classical neural network models afterwards. Since
2006 deep learning started to boom in academia and industry. The deep
learning algorithm broke the limitation of the traditional neural net-
work on the number of layers. According to demands of designers, the
number of network layers was chosen and trained by large-scale data to
obtain deeply hidden characteristic information and features which is
beyond imagination before (Hinton and Salakhutdinov, 2006).

model which is widely used in the neural network and the SVM model
which can make up for the shortage of the neural network is conducted
to seek a more suitable prediction model for the EF by taking the ad-
vantages of both.

experimental process map is randomly selected in Matlab (Fig. 6).

Data from 2014 and 2015 are used as the test dataset. The network
ﬁnally converges after 50–100 iterations (repeated experiments) using
5-time cross-validation to optimize the parameters. The results predict
the 2014 total EF of Beijing to be 8726 ten thousand acres with an error
of 2% and a standard deviation of 1082, compared to the actual value of

8874 ten thousand acres. The 2015 value is predicted to be 8743 ten
thousand acres with an error of 3%, a standard deviation of 1193 and a
root mean square error (RMSE) of 121.65, compared to the actual value
of 8984 ten thousand acres. (Table 2).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, a diverse dataset was utilized, consisting of data from 1996 to 2015. This wide range of data helps prevent overfitting and ensures that the model can perform well on unseen data. Secondly, cross-validation was employed to optimize the parameters of the model. Specifically, 5-time cross-validation was used, which involves dividing the dataset into five subsets and training the model on four while testing it on the remaining one. This process is repeated until each subset has been used as the test set once. Cross-validation helps reduce bias and variance, leading to better performance on new data. Lastly, stratified splitting may also have been used, although it is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. However, considering best practices in machine learning, it is likely that the dataset was split into training and validation sets in such a way that the distribution of classes or labels remained consistent across both sets. Overall, these measures help ensure that the deep learning model can accurately predict ecological footprints even when presented with new data.
