The standard deviation values for each performance indicator were 
compared  to  determine  the  optimal  configuration  (Table  4).  Configu-
ration 8 was determined as the ideal parameter (number of bands: 60, 
number of frames: 40, hop length: 256, and length of the FFT window: 
1024)  owing  to  its  reduced  standard  deviation  value.  The  feature 
extraction parameters that yielded the best performance were employed 
during the feature extraction phase in the optimization process of the 
CNN  deep  learning  model.  The  model  optimization  outcomes  were 
derived  using  performance  criteria  identical  to  those  employed  to 
optimize  feature  extraction  parameters.  Fig.  9  illustrates  the  perfor-
mance evaluation of each model. Additionally, Model 1 exhibited the 
most favorable average performance outcome, with an 89.43% accuracy 
rate, 91.38% precision, 95.52% recall, and 0.816 F1-Score. The obtained

The structure of a deep learning algorithm or simple neural network 
comprises  an  input  layer,  several  hidden  layers,  and  an  output  layer 
(Fig. 2). Each neuron within these layers has its own weight and bias 
coupled with an activation function to introduce nonlinearity. During 
the  forward  and  backward  propagation  phases,  the  values  of  these 
weights and biases are iteratively adjusted. The initial data or input must 
be  converted  into  matrix  format  and  processed  by  the  network.  Each 
matrix element is subsequently manipulated according to the weights 
and biases of the neural network. In this context, we used a robust deep 
learning framework available in Python, which is known for its efficacy 
in handling complex calculations.

In a CNN, a convolution layer performs convolution operations be-
tween the pixels on the input and several kernels or filters. The math-
ematical equation of the convolution process is as follows, where f is the 
input data and h is the kernel size. 

G[m, n] = (f *h)[m, n] =

h[j, k]f [m (cid:0)
