2.2. Transformer-like model 

Transformer  was  proposed  by  Vaswani  et  al.  (2017)  and  initially 
designed for Seq2Seq tasks, replacing long short-term memory (LSTM) 
with a full-attention structure. It was primarily applied in NLP, and both 
the  transformer  and  its  subsequent  iterations  demonstrated  excellent 
performance in a wide range of downstream tasks. With the success of 
the transformer in NLP, researchers have begun to explore its applica-
tion in CV. 

The core structure of the transformer-like visual model is an encoder 
module, which comprises several stacked blocks. Each block consists of 
two  components:  a  token  mixer  module  (Yu  et  al.,  2022)  for  fusing 
spatial information and an MLP module for fusing channel information. 
The main distinction among the different transformer-like visual models 
lies in the variations in the token mixer module. For example, the token 
mixer in a ViT (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) is a self-attention module.

The  selected  CNN-like  model  was  ResNet-50  (He  et  al.,  2016),  as 
shown in Fig. 2(a). It comprises four stages, each containing three, four, 
six, and three blocks, with each block consisting of three convolutional 
layers. In addition, there is an independent convolutional layer at the 
start of the network and a fully connected layer at the end for classifi-
cation, resulting in 50 layers.

Yuan et al. (2022) claimed that the superior performance of a ViT can 
primarily be attributed to extensive pre-training data. If a ViT is trained 
from  scratch  on  a  medium-sized  dataset,  its  performance  lags  behind 
that of a CNN model with comparable parameter sizes. To address this 
limitation, they proposed Volo with the novel Outlook Attention as the 
token mixer module, which enabled fine-grained token representation 
and the aggregation of global information. 

2.3. MLP-like model

2.1. CNN-like model 

CNN is a classical model in CV, renowned for its robust translational 
invariance and ability to extract high-level semantic features. ResNet, 
proposed by He et al. (2016), is a well-known CNN model with a core 
structure of residual units. This innovative design addresses the issue of 
gradient disappearance as the number of layers increases. This allows for 
a  greater  depth  in  the  network,  leading  to  the  extraction  of  more 
expressive  features.  ResNet  has  exhibited  superior  performance 
compared with previous models in various downstream recognition and 
detection tasks.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The pipeline uses a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models. Specifically, it employs ResNet-50, a popular CNN architecture known for its robustness and effectiveness in image classification tasks. Additionally, the pipeline utilizes Vision Transformers (ViTs), which are based on the original Transformer architecture but adapted for computer vision tasks. These models have shown exceptional performance in various natural language processing tasks and have been successfully applied to computer vision problems. However, one limitation of ViTs is their reliance on large amounts of pre-training data. To overcome this, the authors propose Volo, a variant of ViT with a novel Outlook Attention mechanism designed to improve fine-grained token representations and aggregate global information.
