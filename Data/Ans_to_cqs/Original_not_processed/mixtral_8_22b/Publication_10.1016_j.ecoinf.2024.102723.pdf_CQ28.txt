The Neural Networks were built from scratch, implemented using
TensorFlow (tf) (Abadi et al., 2015) and Keras (Chollet et al., 2015).
Coupled with TensorFlow, an open-source framework developed by
Google, Keras serves as a high-level Neural Networks API, offering a
seamless and user-friendly approach to building, training, and deploying
deep learning models. The MCD layers consist of a modification of the
Keras Dropout class, while the layers based on the VBI method derive
from the TensorFlow Probability (tfp) module (in particular, we used the
DenseVariational type of layers). These two architectures have the same
input and output layers, they differ for the structure of the hidden layers.
The size of the input layer depends on the problem we are facing: it has
two nodes, one for DOY and the other for GDD. As our focus will be on
dealing with regression problems, the output layer is actually a combi-
nation of a fully-connected layer (or Dense layer) with two nodes and a

Fig. 4. Neural networks architecture consists of: an input layer with two nodes, one for DOY and the other for GDD; two hidden layers with 32 nodes each, Dense
layers with Monte Carlo Dropout in the MCD approach, DenseVariational layers in the VBI approach; an output layer which is the combination of a Dense layer with
two nodes and a DistributionLambda layer that maps the values of these two nodes into the parameters of a Gaussian distribution, used to predict the BBCH value.

siderations made earlier, a Bayesian Deep Learning model, if properly
configured and trained, can return satisfactory results even with limited
datasets, which is the scenario studied in the present work.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to determine which specific platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. While it is mentioned that TensorFlow and Keras were utilized to build the neural networks, no explicit reference is made to any cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) being employed for deployment purposes. Therefore, without further details regarding the deployment process, it remains unclear which platform was chosen for this task.
