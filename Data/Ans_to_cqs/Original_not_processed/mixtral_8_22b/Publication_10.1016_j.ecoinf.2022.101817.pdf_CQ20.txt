Power consumption measurements were performed using software- 
based  monitoring,  when  the  system  supported  it.  Only  MediaTek 
Pumpkin i500 power consumption was measured using a high-precision 
external power meter.

price at the Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) was consid-
ered, as the total system cost can vary significantly due to the selection 
of other components. The system's power consumption was measured 
during video processing. It plays a crucial role when deploying a battery- 
powered  embedded  system  if  access  to  a  continuous  power  source  is 
unavailable. The feasibility was described as the ratio of the processing 
efficiency and the power consumption:

The feasibility of the entire system is evaluated based on the cost and 
energy consumption. The unit cost must be considered, especially for 
large-scale deployments. Considering the HDP hardware, only the CPU

Recall calculates the amount of correctly predicted out of all possible 
positives. The opposite of this measure is called the “recall specificity”, 
which provides the number of false predictions from all possible nega-
tives. The recall is calculated as:

Our  final  evaluation  parameter  is  the  F1  score,  which  provides  a 
measure between precision and recall, calculated as the harmonic mean 
of the two metrics. The F1 score was evaluated as:

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. However, we do have details about various hardware platforms like AMD Ryzen, Intel Core i7, Cortex-A57, Raspberry Pi 4, and MediaTek Pumpkin i500, along with their respective performance metrics. These hardware platforms could potentially be used for training deep learning models depending on their capabilities and requirements. To determine the exact hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, additional information would be needed.
