The study employs the HRNet model due to its high accuracy and 
stability. HRNet effectively performs semantic segmentation by simul-
taneously  merging  high-resolution  and  low-resolution  convolution 
computations (Sun et al., 2019). By using HRNet to model social media 
image data in PyCharm software for semantic segmentation processing, 
in combination with graphics processing software for proofreading, the 
greenness, blueness, and sky openness index can be derived using the 
formulas described by Wu et al. (2023). G indicates the level of greenery 
in  the  panoramic  image;  PGreenness  is  the  total  number  and  amount  of 
pixels  corresponding  to  vegetative  and  green  spaces  identified  in  the 
semantic segmentation process; PTotal  represents the overall number of 
pixels specified in the image; O represents the level of openness in the 
panoramic image; PSky denotes the percentage of identified sky elements

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it cannot be determined which data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling were applied in this particular study.

However, data augmentation techniques are commonly employed in deep learning pipelines to increase the size of training datasets and improve the performance of models. These techniques include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, zooming, and more. The choice of technique depends on the nature of the dataset and the problem being addressed.

In conclusion, without further information from the authors or additional context, we cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the use of specific data augmentation techniques in this study.
