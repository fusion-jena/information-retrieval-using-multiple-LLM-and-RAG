A quantitative analysis of this dataset is given in Table 5, confirming 
our  model's  effectiveness.  Our  method  has  achieved  a  UIQM  score  of 
3.26 and an NIQE score of 5.39, followed by the Funie-GAN in terms of 
UIQM with a score of 3.21 and Fusion in terms of NIQE with a score of 
5.40. While measuring the UCIQE score, IBLA achieved a score of 0.626, 
although their resultant images are just color deviations from the orig-
inal images. However, since UCIQE measures a linear combination of 
chroma, saturation, and contrast, a higher value can be expected just by 
having a change in colors (even if they are not desirable).

highly  competitive  option  for  deployment  in  real-time  processing  ap-
plications. With its high-performance speed, our model is well-suited for 
real-time applications. 

9. Discussion 

Applications:  The  proposed  underwater  image  enhancement  ar-
chitecture  holds  significant  implications  across  various  domains. 
Enhanced  image  quality  enables  more  precise  visualization  of  under-
water  environments,  facilitating  better  analysis  and  understanding  in 
fields like marine biology, underwater archaeology, and environmental 
monitoring.  Moreover,  the  proposed  algorithm  is  robust,  which

%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not include details about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the model was deployed on platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform based solely on the available data.
