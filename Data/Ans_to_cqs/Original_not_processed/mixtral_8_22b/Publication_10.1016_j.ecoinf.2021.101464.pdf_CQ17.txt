3.2. Random forest model 

According to the parameter optimization results of the random forest 
(RF)  model,  five  training  samples  were  analyzed,  whose  importance 
scores (VI) were obtained by simulation, and the selected variables were 
sorted according to their scores. The results are shown in Fig. 3, in which 
the VI plots for the five samples are consistent; the scores of the selected 
10 variables were more than 20% VI, and showed a threshold of 30% VI, 
above which the variables assumed higher importance (Fig. 3). In the 
training  and  test  datasets,  the  intermediate  models  established  by  RF 
showed that the proportion of explained variance was between 91% and 
92%  (Table  4).  Further,  the  correlation  coefficients  between  the

the values of M (the number of input variables is 1–11) until M corre-
sponds to the smallest model error. Fig. 1a shows that when M was 7, the 
model  error  reached  the  minimum.  Further,  the  Nt  in  the  RF  model 
avoided potential overfitting as follows. First, Nt was set to 500, and the 
operation results are shown in Fig. 1b, which shows that the model error 
tended to be stable after Nt reached 200. Therefore, the final M and Nt 
were 7 and 200, respectively. (See Fig. 2.)

and random forest model in machine learning were applied to simulate 
the  influence  of  environmental  factors  on  NAI  for  achieving  compre-
hensive analysis from both the linear and nonlinear points of view. We 
discussed the prediction ability of the models and the importance of the 
selected  variables  by  analyzing  and  comparing  the  results  of  the  two 
methods.  Further,  the  most  sensitive  factors  and  common  variables 
affecting  changes  in  NAI  concentration  in  the  two  models  were 
analyzed, and independent sample data were used to verify the relevant 
results, in order to reveal the key environmental factors affecting NAI 
and  the  contribution  potential  of  environmental  factors  on  NAI  more 
comprehensively and objectively, which provides a scientific basis for 
better understanding the NAI’s response mechanism to environmental 
factors  and  parameter  optimization  of  regional  ecosystem  process

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, there is no direct mention or discussion about the use of regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. However, we can still discuss these techniques briefly.

Regularization methods are commonly employed in machine learning and deep learning pipelines to avoid overfitting and improve generalization performance. Two popular regularization techniques are Dropout and L2 Regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent complex co-adaptations on training data. This forces the network to learn redundant representations and makes it robust against noise and perturbation. During testing, all neurons are considered without any dropout, but their weights are scaled down to account for the missing neurons during training.

L2 Regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights. By adding this penalty, the optimizer tries to minimize not only the original loss function but also the sum of squared weights. As a result, the learned weights tend to be smaller, reducing the complexity of the model and preventing overfitting.

These regularization methods help control the capacity of the neural networks, making them simpler and improving their ability to generalize well to unseen data.
