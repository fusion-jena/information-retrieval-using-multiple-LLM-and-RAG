Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from some references that various methods might have been employed. For instance, Tan et al.'s work (2017) discusses pre-infestation of tomato plants by aphids, which could suggest the use of manual or automated observation methods. Similarly, Kamilaris et al.'s research (2016) focuses on IoT-enabled smart farming applications, implying the potential usage of sensor networks for data collection. Additionally, Kasinathan et al.'s study (2021) mentions insect classification and detection in field crops using modern machine learning techniques, indicating possible utilization of image or video capturing devices. Lastly, Khalid et al.'s paper (2023) explores small pests detection in field crops using deep learning object detection, further suggesting the application of visual data acquisition tools. Nonetheless, without explicit information regarding the data collection methods, these assumptions remain speculative.
