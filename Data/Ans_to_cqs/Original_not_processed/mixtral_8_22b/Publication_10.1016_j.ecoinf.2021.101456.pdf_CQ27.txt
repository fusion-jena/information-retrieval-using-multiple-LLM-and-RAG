dataset  recorded  at  a  different  location  and  was  gradually  expanded 
until  reconstructions  were  sufficiently  good.  In  order  to  visualize  the 
latent  representation,  the  size  of  the  bottleneck  of  the  model  (latent 
dimension) was limited to two. Details of the network architecture are 
reported in Table 1.

All models were implemented in PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2019) and 
trained for 5000 epochs using the Adam optimizer (Kingma et al., 2015) 
(cid:0) 3. The models were trained on Nvidia GTX 
with a learning rate of 10
1050 graphics processing unit with 4 GB memory with a batch size of 
256. A decision to adapt Œ≤ was taken every fifth epoch to avoid random 
fluctuations. The scaling of the clustering loss, Œ≥, in the semi-supervised 
mode was cycled between 0.01 and 0.2 every 100 epochs. 

4.4. Results 

The clustering performance on the labelled test set for the unsuper-
vised and semi-supervised instances of the dynamic Œ≤-VAE is presented 
in Table 2. 

The dynamic Œ≤-VAE performs better than the baselines in the ARI- 
and AMI-scores which quantifies the intra-class cohesion and inter-class 
separability. While HCA have been successfully used to identify groups

Fig. 1, and since a higher Œ≤ term favours a well generalised latent space 
over good reconstructions, a reduction in clustering performance could 
be expected. Additionally, the non-adaptive VAE was more cumbersome 
to train as the model collapsed frequently during training. 

5.4. Selection of number of clusters

Given unlabelled input data consisting of N samples with F features, 
x ‚àà ‚ÑùN√óF,  the  probabilistic  encoder  of  a  VAE  maps  the  input  to  the 
posterior density p(z|x) over the latent variable, z ‚àà ‚ÑùN√óL. In practice, 
L << N and the encoder neural network approximates the true posterior 
density, p(z|x), with a multivariate Gaussian, qŒ∏(z|x) ‚àº ùí© (ŒºŒ∏, œÉ2
Œ∏ ). The 
decoder of a VAE reconstructs the input data from the latent variable 
and is given by the density function pœÜ(x|z). The encoder and decoder 
neural networks are parameterised by Œ∏  and œÜ, respectively. The opti-
mization objective of a VAE consists of two competing terms and it can 
be shown to be (Kingma and Welling, 2014)
