predicted variables, as well as assist in combining multiple data sources 
to improve overall prediction accuracy (Deb et al., 2017). In practice, 
ANN models have often outperformed other conventional methods with 
respect  to  prediction  accuracy,  processing  rapidity,  and  nonlinear 
problem-solving capacity (Tiryaki and Aydın, 2014; Yang et al., 2018). 
Conversely, the accuracy of ANN’s training process relies on the quality 
and quantity of the sample dataset (Yang et al., 2018). Moreover, the 
optimal  numbers  of  hidden  layers  of  an  ANN  model  depend  on  the 
problem itself and the over-fitting problem can occur at any instance 
(Tiryaki and Aydın, 2014). Therefore, repeated training and testing are 
necessary  to  develop  an  optimal  neural  network  and  attain  highly

the  loss  function.  Moreover,  as  a  supervised  model,  it  operates  by 
modifying the weights and biases of the network’s neurons in order to 
minimize the gap between the anticipated output and the actual target 
values (Tiryaki and Aydın, 2014). The BP-ANN used here entailed an 
input layer with n co-variates, two hidden layers consisting of p hidden 
neurons, and one output layer having one output neuron. The selection 
of hidden layers and neurons was determined through a process of trial 
and error, aiming to optimize the network’s structure (Supplementary 
material 1). The ‘neuralnet’ package of R 4.1.2 software, mostly applied 
for training multi-layer perceptrons in regression analyses, was consid-
ered here for developing a BP-ANN model (Yang et al., 2018).

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the use of a specific deep learning model such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers. However, it mentions the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in modeling grassland above-ground biomass. ANNs are a subset of machine learning algorithms inspired by biological neural networks and are commonly used for various tasks like pattern recognition, classification, and forecasting. Although they share some similarities with deep learning models, ANNs are generally considered distinct from them due to differences in architecture and complexity. Therefore, based on the given context, we cannot definitively state which type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline.
