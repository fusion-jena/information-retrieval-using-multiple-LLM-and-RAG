Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

IF (DistMr is UP) OR (DistSr is UP) OR (DistMWr is UP) OR (DistOWr 

is UP) THEN (DistSuit is UP). 

IF (DistMr is AP) OR (DistSr is AP) OR (DistMWr is AP) OR (DistOWr 

is AP) THEN (DistSuit is AP). 

The effective solution of our tree-based FIS in Apis-FIS, the last node 
of  our  architecture  with  two  input  Prox-FIS  and  LCWT-FIS.  For  the 
output  of  Apis-FIS,  we  used  triangular  and  trapezoidal  membership 
function  with  five  fuzzy  sets  for  the  output  with:  “very  low  suitable” 
(VLS), “low suitable” (LS), “moderate suitable” (MS), “suitable” (S) and 
“highly suitable” (HS) for linguistic variables appear in Fig. 10.

landscapes  unit  provision  based  on  expert  data  from  the  literature 
against  those  from  a  field  survey.  Both  models  used  the  Nova  Scotia 
Forest  Ecosystem  Classification  at  10  m  resolution.  The  main  result 
highlighted that the output map informed with field data was 8% more

Based on this evaluation, we performed a cross-comparison based on 
our ApisFis model and validation data. Fig. 17 presents the result of the 
matching comparison for the 12 sites. For each, the field estimations are 
close to the outcome of our model. For sites 2 & 4 & 6 & 8 and 12 the 
outcome  of  the  field  campaign  is,  respectively,  low,  moderate,  and 
suitable. Our model yields very similar results to the field estimations for 
these sites. However, for some sites, the field estimations were higher 
than our model prediction (Sites 1 &  3 and 7) and for other sites, the 
field estimations were lower than the Apis-FIS model outcomes (Sites 5 
& 9 & 10 & 11).

The rules for this Apis-FIS subsystem are: 
IF (LCWTSuit is VL) THEN (ApisSuit is VLS). 
IF (LCWTSuit is L) OR (DistSuit is UP) THEN (ApisSuit is LS). 
IF (LCWTSuit is M) THEN (ApisSuit is MS). 
IF (LCWTSuit is H) OR (DistSuit is AP) THEN (ApisSuit is HS). 
IF (LCWTSuit is HS) THEN (ApisSuit is HS). 
To  implement  our  FIS  models,  we  use  the  fuzzy  logic  toolbox  of 
Matlab 2023b. This toolbox provides large capabilities to choose several 
membership functions and to build any desired set of inference rules.

Helpful Answer:

Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to determine which specific optimization techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context. The text discusses a tree-based FIS (fuzzy inference system) called Apis-FIS, but it does not provide details about any deep learning pipelines or optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
