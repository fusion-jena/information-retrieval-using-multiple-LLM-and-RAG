Following 

The experiment utilized the pre-trained “ERNIE” model (https://gith 
ub.com/PaddlePaddle/LARK/tree/develop/ERNIE). 
a 
comparative  analysis  of  the  accuracy  of  Rostcm  6.0,  Simple  Bayesian 
Networks,  Long  Short-Term  Memory  networks  (LSTM),  and  Convolu-
tional  Neural  Networks  (CNN)  in  pre-tests,  the  decision  was  made  to 
employ the combined LSTM-CNN-based sentiment analysis framework 
for  determining  the  sentiment  index.  The  LSTM-CNN  model  out-
performed the other models in sentiment task analysis (Sosa, 2017). This 
model leverages the long-term memory capability of LSTM and the local 
feature  extraction  capability  of  CNN  to  process  text  data,  harnessing 
their unique strengths for enhanced model performance.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model used in this research. However, some common methods to improve the generalizability of deep learning models include using diverse datasets, employing cross-validation techniques, or performing stratified splitting during training and testing phases.

In the context provided, it appears that the researchers employed a comparative analysis of various machine learning models such as Rostcm 6.0, Simple Bayesian Networks, Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) before deciding to use the combined LSTM-CNN-based sentiment analysis framework. While this does not directly address the issue of generalizability, it suggests that the researchers considered multiple approaches to find the most suitable model for their purposes.

Additionally, the fact that they chose to utilize the pre-trained ERNIE model might imply that they aimed to leverage existing knowledge from a more extensive dataset to enhance the robustness and applicability of their model. Nonetheless, without further information regarding the validation strategies adopted by the authors, we cannot definitively state what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
