An alternative approach to enhancing the accuracy of LULC maps is 
to leverage deep learning techniques. These techniques operate patch- 
wise,  where  each  patch  incorporates  sophisticated  features  extracted 
from satellite imagery. This enables them to recognize intricate patterns 
effectively.  Particularly,  Convolutional  Neural  Networks  (CNNs)  are 
highly  effective  for  LULC  classification.  These  models  automatically

example, we can refer to the GTB algorithm, which could not increase 
the number of trees to more than 20 for the 33,209 sampling.

extract  hierarchical  features  at  various  scales,  encompassing  edges, 
textures, and more intricate elements. By autonomously deriving rele-
vant  features  from  the  data,  deep  learning  eliminates  the  need  for 
manual  feature  engineering  and  reduces  manual  effort.  Furthermore, 
deep  learning  techniques  facilitate  the  generation  of  real-time  LULC 
information.  Recurrent  Neural  Network  (RNN)  models,  in  particular, 
demonstrate the ability to learn and adapt to evolving LULC patterns 
continuously. This adaptability enables the model to capture temporal 
shifts and variations in land cover patterns. Transfer learning techniques 
enhance the model's compatibility with new situations or different study 
areas. Additionally, integrating deep learning techniques with the GEE 
platform through the Google Cloud platform allows for dynamic LULC 
mapping by incorporating satellite imagery and real-time observations.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some common strategies used in machine learning and deep learning pipelines include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, employing cross-validation techniques, and utilizing ensemble methods to reduce variance caused by randomness. Setting fixed seeds ensures consistent results across multiple runs, while cross-validation helps evaluate model performance and generalizability. Ensemble methods combine multiple models to improve overall performance and robustness against randomness.
