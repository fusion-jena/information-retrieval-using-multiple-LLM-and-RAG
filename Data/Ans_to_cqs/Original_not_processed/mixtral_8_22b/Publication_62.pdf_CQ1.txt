Deep learning can greatly surpass conventional machine learning by incorporating multi-
layered neural networks capable of processing natural data in their raw form (LeCun et al.
2015).   Deep   convolutional   neural   networks   (CNNs)   are   especially   well   suited   to   image
classiﬁcation and may even achieve superhuman performance (He et al. 2015). Already,
CNNs are playing important roles in healthcare, speech recognition, and driverless cars.
Natural history collections (NHCs) also beneﬁt society in numerous ways, most notably
supporting   public   health,   safety,   and   agriculture   (Suarez   and   Tsutsui   2004).   NHCs   are
likewise fundamental to understanding biodiversity and they underlie studies of evolution,
habitat loss, biological invasion, and climate change. The billions of specimens in NHCs
could   undoubtedly   provide   even   greater   social   and   scientiﬁc   insight,   but   their   data   are

typically accessible only to researchers who can physically visit repositories. Digitization
eﬀorts obviate the need for many types of in-person data gathering (Beaman and Cellinese
2012)   and   remarkable   progress   is   now   being   made   in   compiling   specimen   data   and
images   (Barkworth   and   Murrell   2012).   Coupling   these   data   with   the   classiﬁcation
capabilities of CNNs will unlock more of the rich potential of NHCs.

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the use of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks, particularly in the field of natural history collections (NHCs). In this case, the raw data would likely be images of specimens from various NHCs. These images could potentially come from a variety of sources such as digital cameras or scanners used during the digitization process of physical specimens. Additionally, the authors mention that remarkable progress has been made in compiling specimen data and images, which suggests that existing databases or public datasets might have been used as part of the data collection process. Nevertheless, without further information, we cannot definitively state what specific methods were employed for collecting raw data in this particular study.
