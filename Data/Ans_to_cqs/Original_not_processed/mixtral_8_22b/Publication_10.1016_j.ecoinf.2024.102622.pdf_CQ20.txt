4.1. Rice LCC and rice canopy coverage estimation

The extraction of crop-growing areas is a prerequisite for estimating 
the  crop  chlorophyll  content  in  the  field  scale.  Zhang  et  al.  (2020) 
pointed out that the end of July in Northeast China is the peak growth 
period of different crops, during which the physiological parameters of 
crops are at their peak (e.g., greenness and water content), which is the 
best  time  window  for  crop  classification.  In  addition,  classification 
methods, this study verifies the optimality of random forest classifica-
tion  by  comparing  multiple  mainstream  machine  learning  methods 
(including random forest classification, support vector machine classi-
fication, decision tree classification) (You et al., 2021). Therefore, for 
the Sentinel-2 images from 21 July 2022, we selected the random forest 
classification  method  to  extract  the  rice-growing  area  of  Qian  Gorlos 
County with a classification accuracy of over 90% (Fig. 1). Because rice
