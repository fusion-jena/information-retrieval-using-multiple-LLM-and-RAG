Initially, we assess our modified BEiT model’s performance against
existing deep learning and base ViT models under both noise-added and
noise-free situations. The results obtained from the PlantVillage are
presented dataset in Tables 6 and 7, The results reveal that the proposed
BEiT (12 M) achieves an outstanding accuracy of 97.33% with the least
loss. It outperforms in AUC, CK, precision, recall, and F1 scores in both
noisy and noiseless conditions. Similarly, the Dhan-Shomadhan dataset
in Tables 8 and 9, the low parameterized BEiT (12 M) model maintains
its lead he highest accuracy (96.22% and 97.50%) and least loss (0.131
and 0.121). It achieves reliable metrics in AUC (0.962), CK (0.88),
precision (0.97), recall (0.96), and F1 score (0.96). Other models also
perform well but continually fall below BEiT (12 M)’s specifications
across both noisy and noiseless situations. These results underline BEiT
(12 M)’s better performance and reliability in leaf disease classification

Additionally, S. P. Sankareshwaran et al. proposed the CAHA-
AXRNet approach, a novel rice plant disease detection method opti-
mizing hyperparameters through the crossover-boosted artificial hum-
mingbird algorithm. This approach achieved an accuracy rate of 98.1%
when evaluating three types of disease detection datasets, namely the
rice plant dataset, rice leaf dataset, and rice disease dataset (Sankar-
eshwaran et al., 2023). M. Sharma et al. introduced a novel structure
called DeepBatch, which utilized deep learning-based segmentation
with bitwise logical and operation to diagnose rice-infected leaves. This
approach demonstrated a substantial enhancement in performance
when compared to traditional methods, particularly in the identification
of rice diseases (Sharma et al., 2023b).

H. Yang et al. proposed the dense higher-level composition detection
transformer (DHLC-DETR) specifically for identifying rice diseases. The

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it discusses various approaches used in deep learning for tasks like plant disease detection and classification. For instance, the BEiT (12 M) model is mentioned as achieving high accuracy and minimal loss in classifying leaf diseases. Additionally, other studies have proposed different methods, including optimizing hyperparameters using the crossover-boosted artificial hummingbird algorithm or employing deep learning-based segmentation with bitwise logical operations. While these strategies do not address the issue of randomness in the deep learning pipeline, they demonstrate the application of deep learning techniques in agriculture. To manage randomness in deep learning pipelines, common practices include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using cross-validation techniques, and applying ensemble methods to reduce variance caused by random initialization.
