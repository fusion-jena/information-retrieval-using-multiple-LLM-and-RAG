the  loss  function.  Moreover,  as  a  supervised  model,  it  operates  by 
modifying the weights and biases of the network’s neurons in order to 
minimize the gap between the anticipated output and the actual target 
values (Tiryaki and Aydın, 2014). The BP-ANN used here entailed an 
input layer with n co-variates, two hidden layers consisting of p hidden 
neurons, and one output layer having one output neuron. The selection 
of hidden layers and neurons was determined through a process of trial 
and error, aiming to optimize the network’s structure (Supplementary 
material 1). The ‘neuralnet’ package of R 4.1.2 software, mostly applied 
for training multi-layer perceptrons in regression analyses, was consid-
ered here for developing a BP-ANN model (Yang et al., 2018).

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not explicitly mention which specific deep learning framework is being used to build the model. However, it mentions that the 'neuralnet' package of R 4.1.2 software is considered for developing a Backpropagation Artificial Neural Network (BP-ANN) model. Therefore, we can infer that the authors might be using the R programming language and its libraries or packages such as 'neuralnet' to develop their deep learning models. Unfortunately, without more explicit information, we cannot definitively state whether they use other popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
