Training data were generated as batches of size (m, 256, 256, 3), where m is the batch size (m =
20 in our experiments). The batches consisted of sub-images of size 256 × 256 that were randomly
cropped out from the original satellite images presented in Table 1. We had a stream (internally, a
Python generator) of almost never repeated sub-images; these sub-images were combined into batches
and used for the neural network training. Satellite images for sites #1, #3, #5, #7–10 were used for
training and #2, #4, #6 for validation. Corresponding batches of mask data had shape (20, 256, 256, 1).
The network training assessment was performed on sub-images generated from image #2 (Table 1).
Images #4 and #6 were used for visualization and demonstration of the algorithm eﬃcacy.

science and forestry, the deep learning approach has high potential and is only at the beginning of its

Helpful Answer:
In this study, the authors utilize satellite images for their deep learning pipeline. They generate batches of size (m, 256, 256, 3) with a batch size of 20, which consist of sub-images of size 256 x 256 cropped randomly from the original satellite images. These sub-images are then combined into batches and used for training the neural network. The corresponding masks have a shape of (20, 256, 256, 1). The satellite images used for training come from sites #1, #3, #5, #7-10, while those used for validation come from sites #2, #4, #6. The network training assessment is performed on sub-images generated from image #2, and images #4 and #6 are used for visualization and demonstration of the algorithm's efficacy. Therefore, it can be concluded that the method utilized for collecting raw data in this deep learning pipeline is through the use of satellite imagery.
