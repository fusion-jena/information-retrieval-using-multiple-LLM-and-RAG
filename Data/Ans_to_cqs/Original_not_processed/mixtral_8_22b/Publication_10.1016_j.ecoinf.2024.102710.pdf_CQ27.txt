Fig. 4. UMAP plots for different embedding layers of different embedding
models for AnuraSet. For UMAP generation, we randomly select 5000 samples
and discard all samples that are aligned to more than one class. Colors and
shapes indicate the 10 classes with the highest occurrence frequency. Layers are
numbered according to their distance from the classification layer, e.g. ‘Bird-
Net-1’ is the last layer before the classification layer of the BirdNet model.

The active learning experiments are carried out in the embedding
space of the selected transfer learning model (BirdNet-1, see Section
3.1). We explore a range of sampling strategies: uncertainty and di-
versity based, myopic (greedy) and adaptive (batch mode), and com-
binations thereof. Fig. 2 provides a schematic overview of the pure
families of sampling strategies: Random sampling selects samples arbi-
trarily, uncertainty sampling targets samples near the decision bound-
ary, and diversity sampling focuses on samples that span the entire data
space. In all cases, 5% of the samples are selected at random. Class labels
are available for all samples used in this study, and an active learning
scenario is emulated by hiding all labels from the classifier at first and
incrementally revealing the ones for each batch of samples queried by
the sampling methods. We use a batch size of 20 samples. The classifier
heads are identical to those from the transfer learning training process.

et al. (2024) extend the observation to attention-based architectures pre-
trained on human speech. Lauha et al. (2022) show that transfer
learning can be helpful also for small networks trained from scratch on
small, targeted datasets gathered from online resources such as Mac-
aulay Library2 (as opposed to foundation models trained on large
datasets). While the works cited above evaluate transfer learning models
based on classification performance, McGinn et al. (2023) take a
different approach and investigate the topology of fine grained, sub-
species sound events in the embedding space afforded by BirdNet;
they find that different call types of a same species (e.g., drumming
versus vocalization) form distinct clusters, and that the vicinity of each

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the authors have not explicitly mentioned the specific process they followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, some clues can be found regarding the possible deployment steps taken during the experiment.

For instance, the authors mention using a classifier head identical to the one used during the transfer learning training process. This suggests that the authors might have serialized or saved the trained model weights after completing the training phase. They could then load these saved weights when deploying the model for prediction tasks.

Additionally, the authors discuss evaluating the transfer learning models based on classification performance. This implies that the deployed model should include both the embedding model (such as BirdNet-1) and the classifier head. Therefore, the authors may have combined the embedding model and the classifier head into a single deployable model architecture.

However, without explicit information about the platform selection or other details related to the deployment process, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer. It would be necessary to refer to additional sources or contact the authors directly for further clarification.
