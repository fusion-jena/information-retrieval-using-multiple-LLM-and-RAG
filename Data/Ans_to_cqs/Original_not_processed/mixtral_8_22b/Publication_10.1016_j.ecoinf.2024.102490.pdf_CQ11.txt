records were initially subjected to manual filtering (to remove points 
with missing information, typing errors, located in the middle of the city 
or with evidence of being cultivated plants), followed by spatial filtering 
(to retain only one record per ~5 km2) using the Raster package (Hij-
mans, 2015) in R (R Core Team, 2021) to avoid biases caused by auto-
correlation. Records comprising material deposited in herbaria up to the

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The data used in this study was obtained from several sources including SpeciesLink (<https://specieslink.net/>), Reflora-Virtual Herbarium (<http://reflora.jbrj.gov.br/reflora/herbarioVirtual/>), and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) system (<http://www.gbif.org>). However, there is no specific mention of a deep learning pipeline or its corresponding data repository link in the given context. Therefore, it cannot be determined based solely on the provided information.
