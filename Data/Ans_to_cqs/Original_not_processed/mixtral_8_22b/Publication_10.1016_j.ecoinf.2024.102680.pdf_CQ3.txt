Owing to the insufficient clarity of underwater optical images, gen-
eral deep learning networks have difficulty capturing accurate feature 
information and cannot detect objects correctly. The original YOLOv8 
network  uses  the  C2f  module  for  feature  extraction.  However,  this 
module employs an split  operation on features after convolution. This 
operation divides the input data into two non-overlapping parts, making 
it  difficult  to  obtain  comprehensive  and  rich  feature  information 
through half of the channel’s features. Specifically, the shape of features 
F obtained after convolution is ℝN×H×W×C, where N represents the batch 
size, C represents the channel number, and H and W denote the height 
and width, respectively. The split  operation evenly divides F  into two 
parts on the channel dimension with shapes of ℝN×H×W×0.5C, and these 
two parts do not overlap. The original YOLOv8 convolves only half of

enriching  the  semantic  representation  of  underwater  objects.  DP- 
FishNet  (Liu  et  al.,  2024b)  combines  the  strengths  of  pyramid  vision 
transformers  and  CNNs  in a  dual-path  approach to  effectively extract 
both global and local features from underwater images, which signifi-
cantly  improves  the  network  performance.  However,  these  methods 
generally  require  a  significant  amount  of  underwater  image  data  for 
training and have high computational costs, thus demanding substantial 
computational resources.

However,  using  large  kernel  convolutions  usually  leads  to  over-
whelming computational complexity, resulting in a sharp increase in the 
number  of  network  parameters  and  network  computational  load.  To 
overcome this issue, we used dilated convolution (Yu and Koltun, 2016) 
and depthwise separable convolution to reduce computations. Dilated 
convolution can increase the receptive field of the convolution kernel by 
inserting “holes”  without adding parameters or increasing the compu-
tational load. The equation for calculating the receptive field of dilated 
convolution  is  shown  in  Eq.  (4),  where  n  represents  the  size  of  the 
receptive field and d represents the dilation rate.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that general deep learning networks have difficulty accurately capturing feature information and detecting objects correctly due to insufficient clarity of underwater optical images. It also discusses improvements made to the original YOLOv8 network for better feature extraction and object detection. These improvements include using dilated convolution and depthwise separable convolution to reduce computations while maintaining accuracy. Additionally, the text mentions combining the strengths of pyramid vision transformers and CNNs in a dual-path approach to effectively extract both global and local features from underwater images. While these techniques improve network performance, they generally require a significant amount of underwater image data for training and demand substantial computational resources.

Regarding data annotation techniques, common approaches in deep learning pipelines include bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangles around objects of interest within an image, while instance segmentation requires outlining individual instances of objects. Semantic segmentation involves labeling each pixel in an image according to its class or category. Depending on the specific application and dataset, different annotation techniques may be more appropriate. For example, bounding box annotation might be sufficient for simple object detection tasks, whereas instance segmentation could be necessary for more complex applications requiring precise delineation of individual objects.
