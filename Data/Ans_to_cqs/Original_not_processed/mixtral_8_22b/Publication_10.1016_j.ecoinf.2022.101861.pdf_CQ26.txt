recorded (c. 6000 recording hours). Kaleidoscope Pro ability to detect 
the Band-tailed Nighthawk in a different area may be slightly different 
owing  to  geographical  song  variations  since  the  signal  parameters 
introduced  in  our  study  were  extracted  from  recordings  collected  at 
different sites of the state of Mato Grosso and based on a reduced sample 
size (eight recordings). The creation of more advanced classifiers using 
machine learning or convolutional neural networks might be useful in 
future  studies  aiming  to  reduce  the  number  of  sounds  misclassified

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the study uses Kaleidoscope Pro software for sound extraction with certain signal parameters such as minimum and maximum lengths and a maximum inter-syllable gap. It also suggests that creating more advanced classifiers using machine learning or convolutional neural networks could help reduce the number of misclassifications in future studies.

While the text does not directly discuss stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, these techniques can generally be applied to address data bias in deep learning pipelines. Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes within each set. Oversampling increases the representation of minority classes by duplicating samples, while undersampling decreases the representation of majority classes by removing samples. Diverse data collection aims to gather a wide range of examples representing various scenarios, conditions, and populations to improve model performance and generalization.
