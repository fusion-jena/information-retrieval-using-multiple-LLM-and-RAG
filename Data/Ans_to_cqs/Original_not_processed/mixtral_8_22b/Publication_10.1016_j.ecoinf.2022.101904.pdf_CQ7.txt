3.4. Impact of data split 

This  section  illustrates  the  impact  of  the  data  split  (i.e.,  test  and 
training data ratio) on the final accuracy of wetland mapping. By eval-
uating  the  classification  results  of  the  proposed  model  with  different 
training data, we will better understand the required amount of data to 
reach  an  acceptable  wetland  accuracy  level.  This  is  significant  when 
there is a limited number of reference data in a project. We utilized a 

different ratio of training data from reference data. The training ratio 
started from 10% to 90%, increasing by 10%. Based on the results, as the 
amount of data gradually increased, the classification accuracy of our 
method was improved. This improvement was substantial for increasing 
the  training  ratio  from  10%  to  30%  (average  accuracy  improved  by 
17.47%).  However,  average  accuracy  just  increased  by  7.01%  by 
increasing the training ratio from 30% to 90% (see Fig. 10).

Many  ecosystems,  particularly  wetlands,  are  significantly  degraded  or  lost  as  a  result  of  climate  change  and 
anthropogenic  activities.  Simultaneously,  developments  in  machine  learning,  particularly  deep  learning 
methods, have greatly improved wetland mapping, which is a critical step in ecosystem monitoring. Yet, present 
deep  and  very deep  models necessitate  a greater  number  of  training data, which  are costly,  logistically  chal-
lenging,  and  time-consuming  to  acquire.  Thus,  we  explore  and  address  the  potential  and  possible  limitations 
caused  by  the  availability  of  limited  ground-truth  data  for  large-scale  wetland  mapping.  To  overcome  this 
persistent  problem  for  remote  sensing  data  classification  using  deep  learning  models,  we  propose  3D  UNet 
Generative Adversarial Network Swin Transformer (3DUNetGSFormer) to adaptively synthesize wetland training

Where γm presents the number of training samples belonging to the 
wetland class with the highest number of training samples and γi shows 
the number of training data of other wetland classes. The 3D patches of 
Sentinel-1/2 imagery with the dimension of γi × S × S × B, as well as the 
output of the conditional map unit, are employed in each of Ui. Next is to 
transform the output of the conditional unit map (intermediate feature 
expressed by If) to a feature with the length of γi. It should be noted that S 
and B present image patch size (i.e., 8) and the number of utilized bands 
(i.e., 18). In the GAN network, a dense layer is employed first, followed 
by  a  softmax  layer.  For  the  generation  of  the  class-specific  random 
feature (Im) with the dimension of n × γ, the feature vector n = S × S × B 
times is repeated. The 3D Sentinel-1/2 image patches with the dimen-
sion  of  γi  × S  × S  × B  are  then  converted  into  a  matrix  (Pm)  with  a

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, it mentions that the study evaluates the classification results of the proposed model with different training data ratios, starting from 10% to 90%, increasing by 10%. This suggests that the authors might have used a simple random sampling approach to divide the dataset into training and testing sets based on varying percentages. Nevertheless, without further details, it cannot be confirmed if any specific criteria were applied during the splitting process.
