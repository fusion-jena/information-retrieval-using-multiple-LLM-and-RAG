The last step in configuring the model involves feeding in predictors 
that  the  advanced  deep  learning  algorithm  feeds  by  the  decomposed 
components  resulting  from  the  previous  steps.  The  primary  model  is 
CNN-BiGRU  with  three  comparative  ML  methods  (KELM,  RVFL  and 
CNN-BiRNN),  which  provide  four  complementary  models  including 
MVMD-CNN-BiGRU,  MVMD-RVFL,  MVMD-KELM  and  MVMD-CNN- 
BiRNN.  These  models  are  used  to  create  the  multi-temporal  fore-
casting model of daily streamflow (Qflow). Setting hyperparameters and 
their structural architecture is the most important aspect of executing 
ML-based  predictive  models  (Jamei  et  al.,  2023b).  Based  on  recent 
research, the main approaches to tuning parameters are algorithms of 
metaheuristic optimization, schemes of cross-validation schemes (Nes-
ted/rolling  basis  cross-validation)  (Huyghues-Beaufond  et  al.,  2020),

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
In this pipeline, a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) is used for creating the primary model, referred to as CNN-BiGRU. This model is compared with other Machine Learning (ML) methods such as Kernel Extreme Learning Machines (KELM), Random Vector Functional Link (RVFL), and another variant of the CNN model combined with Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network (CNN-BiRNN). These comparisons result in four complementary models: MVMD-CNN-BiGRU, MVMD-RVFL, MVMD-KELM, and MVMD-CNN-BiRNN. Therefore, the types of deep learning models employed in this pipeline include CNN and GRU (a variant of RNN).
