over which the quality measures and results fail to continue improving. 
Benkendorf and Hawkins (2020), analyzing the effect of sample size on 
deep neural networks, similarly concluded that by increasing the num-
ber of hidden layers, which can be interpreted as adding more training 
recordings in our software, the neural network can largely improve the 
performance of the model.

To compare the performances of the software and the similarity of 
the results produced by them with a varying number of records in the 
training set, we followed the standard processes of optimization for each 
software  (see  below)  with  six  different  training  sets  named  after  the 
number  of  positively  manually  validated  recordings  they  contained 
(Table  1):  training  15  (T15),  training  25  (T25),  training  50  (T50), 
training  100  (T100),  training  150  (T150),  and  training  200  (T200). 
Therefore,  for  each  software,  we  created  12  recognizers,  six  for  each 
song (Tables S1 and S2). All presences and absences were always vali-
dated  both  visually  and  acoustically  by  the  same  researcher  (MGU) 
using Arbimon, due to its user-friendly interface. In total, we created 36 
different recognizers, 12 per software (2 songs with 6 different training 
sets each).

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is common practice in deep learning to use techniques such as dropout and L2 regularization to mitigate overfitting. Dropout involves randomly dropping out neurons during training, while L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function based on the sum of squares of weights. These methods help reduce complexity and improve generalization of models. It should also be noted that Benkendorf and Hawkins (2020) analyzed the effect of sample size and network depth on deep learning approaches, suggesting that increasing the number of hidden layers or training recordings could potentially improve model performance without causing overfitting.
