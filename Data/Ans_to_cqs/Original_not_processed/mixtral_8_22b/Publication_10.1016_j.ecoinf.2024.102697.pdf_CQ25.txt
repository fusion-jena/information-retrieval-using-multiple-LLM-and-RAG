Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

In  the  subsequent  sections,  we  assess  model  performance  in  the 
context of model complexity and explainability, crop specific training 
against  generalized  training,  and  contrast  remote  sensing  and  meteo-
rological measurements to provide predictive performance for several 
potential use cases. 

3.1. Model complexity 

The management of model complexity is an important consideration 
in  data-driven  model  development (Jolliffe,  1986; Wang  et  al.,  2017; 
Yates  et  al.,  2021).  In  this  study  we  define  model  complexity  as  the 
number of variables included in the predictor set. Proper selection of 
variables, i.e. feature selection, can minimize training costs, measure-
ment  requirements,  and  decrease  the  likelihood  of  overfitting  (Banks 
and Fienberg, 2003; Cawley and Talbot, 2010).

2.5. Machine learning methods

Among  machine  learning  techniques,  random  forest  models  have 
been found to be particularly effective and are used here due to their 
demonstrated robust performance for a wide range of contexts. The use 
of  random  forests  in  a  variety  of  areas  of  remote  sensing  is  well- 
documented  (Baret and  Buis, 2008; Bonsoms  and  Boulet, 2022; Chan 
and Paelinckx, 2008; Maxwell et al., 2018; Zheng and Jia, 2022) and 
motivated by flexibility in hyperparameter selection, input dimension-
ality, and data volume. Random forest models are a class of machine 
learning methods referred to as ensemble learning, an architecture that 
operates by generating many randomized decision trees based on sub-
sets of the input features (Breiman, 2001). By averaging the results from 
each tree, the model produces a more reliable result than any one tree 
could produce. The number of trees, leaves, and clustering methods are

the  primary  hyperparameters  required  for  application  of  the  random 
forest method. Here, hyperparameter optimization was performed using 
Bayesian  Optimization  to  minimize  a  5  k-fold  cross-validation  loss 
during model development (Section 2.7).

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the study employs a type of machine learning technique called random forest models. However, there is no explicit mention of a deep learning model being used in the text. Therefore, I cannot definitively state the purpose of a deep learning model within this context.

Random forest models are a popular choice among machine learning techniques due to their demonstrated robust performance across various applications. They belong to a category of machine learning methods known as ensemble learning, which operates by creating numerous randomized decision trees based on subsets of the input features. By averaging the outcomes from each tree, the model generates a more dependable result compared to what a single tree could achieve.

In this particular study, the authors focus on managing model complexity, defined as the number of variables included in the predictor set. This approach aims to minimize training costs, measurement requirements, and reduce the risk of overfitting. Hyperparameter optimization was carried out using Bayesian Optimization to minimize a 5k-fold cross-validation loss during model development.

While the information does not directly address the purpose of a deep learning model, it provides valuable insights into the objectives and methods employed in this research regarding machine learning techniques.
