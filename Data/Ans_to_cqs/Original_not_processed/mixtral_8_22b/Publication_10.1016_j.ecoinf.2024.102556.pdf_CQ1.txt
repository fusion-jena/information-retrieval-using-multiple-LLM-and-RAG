Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Inspired  by  Res2Net,  a  novel  residual  network  structured  with 
Res2Net modules and group convolution was introduced to replace the 
FEN in the Deep SORT algorithm. This enhancement refines the multi-
scale representation in the Deep SORT FEN, achieving a more intricate 
and detailed level of feature-extraction.

features  from  images,  comprising  three  convolutional  layers:  Con-
v+BatchNorm+SiLU integration module (CBS), Efficient Layer Aggre-
gation Networks (ELAN), and Hybrid Convolutional (MPConv). As  an 
efficient aggregation network, the ELAN layer is designed with a multi- 
stream  structure  to  learn  various  features  through  different  convolu-
tional  streams. Unlike  the normal  pooling layer,  the  MPConv layer  is 
branched into a CBS layer and a Maxpool layer. Features extracted from 
each layer were fused through the Concat operation, facilitated by the 
aggregated feature pyramid structure. With the SPP pyramid structure, 
the header network is designed for multiple inputs and transferring in-
formation from the bottom to the top. Finally, the RepConv structure is 
utilized to adjust the number of channels for different scaled features.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets. However, there are some clues about the type of data being processed. For instance, the text mentions "images" which suggests that image data might be one of the types of input used in this particular deep learning application. Additionally, the paper titled "Estimating the population size of migrating Tibetan antelopes Pantholops hodgsonii with unmanned aerial vehicles" implies that drone footage could potentially be another source of data collection. Nevertheless, without further information, we cannot definitively state what methods are specifically employed for gathering raw data in this case.
