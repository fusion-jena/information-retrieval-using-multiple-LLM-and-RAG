Helpful Answer:
The authors do not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps for training a deep learning model in this given context. However, generally speaking, some common preprocessing steps often used before training a deep learning model include data cleaning, normalization, and scaling.

Data cleaning involves removing or correcting erroneous data points, such as missing values, outliers, or inconsistent entries. Normalization is the process of rescaling numeric variables so they have the same range, typically between 0 and 1. This can be done using techniques like Min-Max scaling or z-score standardization. Scaling ensures that all features contribute equally during the training phase, preventing those with larger magnitudes from dominating the learning process.

Additionally, other preprocessing steps may involve encoding categorical variables into numerical form, handling imbalanced datasets through oversampling, undersampling, or synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE), and feature engineering to create new relevant features from existing ones.

In summary, while the authors did not provide explicit information on preprocessing steps for training a deep learning model, commonly employed methods include data cleaning, normalization, scaling, encoding categorical variables, addressing class imbalance, and feature engineering.
