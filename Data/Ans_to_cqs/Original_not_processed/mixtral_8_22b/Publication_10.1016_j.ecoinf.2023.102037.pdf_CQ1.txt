2021a; Wang et al., 2020c). Wang et al. (2020a, 2020b, 2020c) obtained 
a mean Average Precision (mAP) score of 63.54% using YOLOv3 (Red-
mon  and  Farhadi,  2018)  while  detecting  and  classifying  pest  species 
from  the  images  in  their  “Pest24”  dataset.  The  dataset  consisted  of 
25,378  annotated  images  coming  from  24  pest  species  that  were  all 
collected by an automatic imaging trap. Rustia et al. (2021) designed a 
multi-stage deep learning method including object detection, insect vs. 
non-insect  separation  and  a  multi-class  insect  classification  for  insect 
identification. Data were acquired by multiple wireless imaging devices 
installed  in  greenhouses  –  under  varying  lighting environments  -  and 
their classification model reached average F1-scores of up to 0.92. Hong

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The authors have not explicitly mentioned the specific methods used for collecting raw data in their study. However, they do reference other studies that provide insights into this topic. For instance, Wang et al. (2020a, 2020b, 2020c) collected data from an automated imaging trap containing 24 different pest species. Additionally, Rustia et al. (2021) gathered data using multiple wireless imaging devices installed in greenhouses under various lighting conditions. These examples suggest that both automated traps and remote sensing devices could be employed for gathering raw data in deep learning pipelines related to pest identification and monitoring. Public datasets may also be available for use, such as the Pest24 dataset referenced in the paper. Nonetheless, it is essential to consider factors like data quality, relevance, and ethical implications when selecting or creating datasets for deep learning applications.
