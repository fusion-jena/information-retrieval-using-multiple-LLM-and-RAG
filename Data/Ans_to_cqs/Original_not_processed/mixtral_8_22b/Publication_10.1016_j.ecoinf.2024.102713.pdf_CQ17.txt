Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

The relational schema of CASE’s database is shown in Fig. A.18. CASE is based on a concept of Task, i.e., a questionnaire that must be fulfilled by a 
User (i.e., an on-field operator). Each task is composed by a set of Questions, categorized in different types (e.g., multiple answers, date picker) each 
composed by a set of predefined Answers (one of which could be an open answer, defined by the user when selecting the Given answer). The 
dynamic aspect of CASE’s questionnaires lies in the association of each possible answer with a different one to be shown next. Thus, users fulfilling the 
same task may follow different paths of questions depending on the given answers. This enables a customized and efficient user experience, as detailed 
questions on a given topic may be asked only if such a topic has been mentioned by the user. Instances of tasks (i.e., Task on geo-object) are

For  these  reasons,  a  validation  process  is  needed  to  ensure  that 
analytical  activities  are  carried  out  on  clean  and  consistent  data.  In 
particular, we validate H. halys captures as follows.  

• Traps with at least 10 consecutive weeks of non-entered data or with 
at least 5 registered malfunctioning were reported as “invalid” and 
not used in the data analysis.

Query: "What are the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., dropout, L2 regularization)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the provided information, there is no mention of any specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline for this particular case study. Therefore, it cannot be determined what regularization methods are being used without further context or information.
