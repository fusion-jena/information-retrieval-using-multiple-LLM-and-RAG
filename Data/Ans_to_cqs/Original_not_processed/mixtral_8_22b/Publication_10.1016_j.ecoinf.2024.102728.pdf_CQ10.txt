The geology layer is based on the 1:50000 scale Bet Guvrin (I.G.S.,
2016) and Qiryat Gat sheets (I.G.S., 2010) that were georeferenced,
concatenated, and digitized in QGIS (2023) and TerrSet (2017) GIS
software. The soil layer was digitized from a georeferenced 1:250000

garrigue sub-shrub species, and soil. The shrub class is only perennial phaner-
ophyte shrubs.

%Query
Query: "What is the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no information available regarding the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in this study. It appears that the authors did not provide any links or references to their specific implementation of the deep learning model used for object retrieval and aerial scene classification. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact location of the code repository for this particular project.
