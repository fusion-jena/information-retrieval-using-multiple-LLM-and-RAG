(e.g.,  eBird  for  species  distribution  modeling  and  Xeno-canto  for 
creating an algorithm). The searches on Google Scholar, eBird and Xeno- 
canto were carried out on 3 July 2022. The total number of scientific 
articles  in  Google  Scholar,  observations  uploaded  to  eBird  and  re-
cordings stored in Xeno-canto for each species considered can be found 
in  Table  1.  The  combined  index  was  obtained  by  averaging  the  rank 
position  of  every  species  on  the  three  considered  categories,  which 
identified the Band-tailed Nighthawk (Nyctiprogne leucopyga, Nighthawk 
hereinafter) as the nightjar with the least information available among 
those inhabiting the Brazilian Pantanal (Table 1).

species (BirdLife International, 2016, see also Table 1). Among the most 
pressing research priorities identified by the IUCN, there is the very little 
information on the reproductive biology, territoriality, and dispersal of 
the species (BirdLife International, 2016). For example, in Brazil we are 
only  aware  of  one  Nighthawk  egg  collected  in  northern  Brazil  in 
September (Snethlage 1935 in Yoon, 2020) with no more information 
available. Moreover, there is no information regarding the incubation, 
parental care, or nestling development of the species (Cleere and Nur-
ney, 1998; Yoon, 2020).

checklists of birds they have identified, which can be used for research 
purposes (e.g., Dansereau et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2022), and as of May 
2021 over one billion of observations had been recorded in eBird.

Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not mention any specific platform used to deploy a deep learning model such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which platform was used based solely on this information.
