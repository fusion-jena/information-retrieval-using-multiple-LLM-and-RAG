Among  machine  learning  techniques,  random  forest  models  have 
been found to be particularly effective and are used here due to their 
demonstrated robust performance for a wide range of contexts. The use 
of  random  forests  in  a  variety  of  areas  of  remote  sensing  is  well- 
documented  (Baret and  Buis, 2008; Bonsoms  and  Boulet, 2022; Chan 
and Paelinckx, 2008; Maxwell et al., 2018; Zheng and Jia, 2022) and 
motivated by flexibility in hyperparameter selection, input dimension-
ality, and data volume. Random forest models are a class of machine 
learning methods referred to as ensemble learning, an architecture that 
operates by generating many randomized decision trees based on sub-
sets of the input features (Breiman, 2001). By averaging the results from 
each tree, the model produces a more reliable result than any one tree 
could produce. The number of trees, leaves, and clustering methods are

While  machine  learning  methods  have  been  demonstrated  to  be 
flexible predictive tools capable of integrating diverse data streams, they 
present significant challenges in terms of interpretability and general-
izability (Reichstein et al., 2019). This is especially true in the context of 
ecohydrological or biophysical systems, where the objective is often to 
develop  a  better  understanding  of  the  underlying  system  rather  than 
exclusively  improve  predictive  performance  (Drewry  et  al.,  2010a, 
2010b).  There  is  a  growing  recognition  that  interpretability,  physical 
consistency, and data complexity are key challenges in the successful 
adoption of machine learning methodologies (Baptista et al., 2022; Hu 
et al., 2021). One proposed approach is the concept of parsimony which 
seeks to use the simplest set of explanatory variables to reach a target 
performance threshold (de Silva et al., 2020). Parsimony is founded on

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the studies mentioned in the context likely involve various types of data formats depending on the nature of the research. For instance, the study by Zhang et al. (2023) focuses on detecting time-delay water quality indicators of wastewater treatment plant influents, suggesting that the data format could include time series data, possibly in CSV or similar formats. On the other hand, the study by Zheng and Jia (2022) evaluates different methods for soil heat flux estimation at large scales using remote sensing observations, implying that satellite imagery or geospatial data might be involved.

Random Forest models, which are employed in these studies, are versatile and can handle various data formats such as numerical, categorical, textual, and even images when combined with appropriate preprocessing steps. Nonetheless, without explicit information about the exact data formats used in each study, we cannot provide a definitive answer.
