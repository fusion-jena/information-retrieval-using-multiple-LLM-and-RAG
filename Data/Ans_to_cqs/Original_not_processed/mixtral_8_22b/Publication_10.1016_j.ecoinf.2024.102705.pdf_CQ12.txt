The term “deep learning” refers to the utilization of neural networks, 
a statistical model for data representation in solving complex problems 
(LeCun  et  al.,  2015;  Christopher  and  Hugh,  2024).  These  neural  net-
works are constructed through training, involving a large set of inputs 
and  labeled outputs. Comprising layered nonlinear transformations, a 
neural  network  contains  numerous  adjustable  parameters.  Training  a 
neural network requires multiple iterations, during which the network 
may produce incorrect results. The discrepancy between the current and 
expected outputs is calculated as loss values. Optimization algorithms 
such as Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) (Herbert and Sutton, 1951), 
Adaptive Gradient (AdaGrad) (Duchi et al., 2011), Root Mean Square 
Prop (RMSProp) (Tieleman and Hinton, 2012), and Adam (Kingma and 
Ba, 2014) are then employed to assess each parameter’s contribution to

feature representations, which are crucial for predicting the threshold of 
image  processing  algorithms  (Wang  et  al.,  2018).  In  this  study,  we 
propose a compact network incorporating a non-local layer capable of 
extracting  long-distance  features  to  predict  parameters  for  the  image 
processing module. Additionally, we introduce a joint training approach 
for image adaptive enhancement modules and deep learning models to 
ensure  that  the  image  processing  results  contribute  to  improved  per-
formance  of  the  deep  learning  model.  The  proposed  method  demon-
strates superior performance across a diverse range of environments. it 
enables  expedited  transitions  from  field  surveys  to  reporting,  even  in 
challenging circumstances, thereby facilitating efficient data collection 
and analysis on a larger scale.

Deep  learning,  on  the  other  hand,  replaces  manual  filters  with 
feature extractors trained on extensive datasets, mitigating the influence 
of external noise. Leveraging this advantage, deep learning has achieved 
remarkable  advancements  in  various  domains,  including  machine 
translation  (Vaswani  et  al.,  2017),  speech  recognition  (Dong  et  al., 
2018),  and  computer  vision  (He  et  al.,  2016).  Deep  Convolutional 
Neural  Networks  (DCNN)  represent  a  classic  deep  learning  model 
extensively  utilized  for  image  processing  (Krizhevsky  et  al.,  2017). 
Extensive research has demonstrated that DCNN can effectively extract 
ecological information from camera trap images, including species la-
bels, counts, and behaviors (Borowiec et al., 2022; Frank and Volker, 
2021; Manuel et al., 2021). While deep learning has proven successful in 
extracting  information  from  camera  trap  images,  the  inherent

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly mentioned. However, there is a reference to Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) being extensively utilized for image processing. This suggests that the pipeline might be using a form of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for its operations. It's important to note that while the text mentions DCNN, without further specific details about the architecture or implementation, we cannot definitively state that a DCNN is the exact model used in the pipeline.
