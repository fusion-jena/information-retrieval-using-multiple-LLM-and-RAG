Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not include a specific link to a code repository for a deep learning pipeline. The links mentioned are related to data sources such as NDVI, vegetation type data, DEM, temperature, precipitation, radiation, road data, GDP data, and population data. These links lead to resources like Google Earth Engine, National Climatic Data Center, Copernicus Climate Change Service, OpenStreetMap, and China Resource and Environmental Science Data Center. However, there is no explicit mention or link to a deep learning pipeline code repository.
