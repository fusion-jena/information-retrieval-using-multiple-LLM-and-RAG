stability within each ecological carbon sink risk zone.

harmonizing  the  enhancement  of  carbon  sinks  with  ecological  risk 
reduction to ensure the prolonged stability of carbon sink ecosystems. 
On the one hand, optimizing carbon sinks is pivotal not only for climate 
change mitigation but also as a foundation for biodiversity protection 
and the sustenance of ecosystem services (Adelisardou et al., 2021; Piao 
et al., 2019). Regions with significant carbon stocks often coincide with 
biodiversity hotspots, making their protection vital for ecosystem health

%Query
Query: "Where is the data repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The data repositories mentioned in the given context are Resource Environment Science and Data Research Center Data Center (<https://www.resdc.cn/>), OpenStreetMap (<https://www.openstreetmap.org>), Geospatial Data Cloud (<http://www.gscloud.cn/>), National Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Scientific (<http://data.tpdc.ac.cn>), Chinese Research Data Services Platform (<http://www.cnrds.com>). However, it is unclear if these resources contain the specific data related to the deep learning pipeline or if they are used as sources for other types of data in this study. Therefore, without additional information, it cannot be determined where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
