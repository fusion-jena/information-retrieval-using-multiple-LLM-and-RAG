On the same dataset, Wang et al. (Wang et al., 2020a) developed an 
encoder–decoder  based  deep-learning  model  to  estimate  seagrass 
coverage and achieved an mIoU of 90.66%. Perez et al. (Perez et al., 
2020) mapped seagrass distribution by applying a deep capsule network 
(DCN) and a deep CNN from the ‘WorldView-2’ satellite images at three 
different coastal locations in Florida. They showed that DCN and CNN 
models  performed  similarly.  They  also  demonstrated  that  these  two 
models performed significantly better than linear regression and support 
vector  machine-based  models.  Also,  in  2020,  Antoni  Burguera  (Bur-
guera,  2020)  mapped  Posidonia  oceanica  seagrass  by  developing  two 
neural networks (NNs); a convolutional layer based NN model achieved 
a precision of 97%, a recall of 95.4% and an accuracy of 95.5% on their 
dataset.  Burguera  (Long  et  al.,  2015)  visualised  the  patches  of

0.3464  on  the  ECUHO-1  and  ECUHO-2  datasets  respectively.  More 
recently, Noman et al. (Noman et al., 2021b) proposed using Faster R- 
CNN with the NASNet model and achieved the highest mAP of 0.291 and 
0.412 on these H. ovalis datasets respectively.

image,  and  the  produced  feature  maps  are  cropped  upon  the  object 
proposal. An RoI pooling layer is applied to extract a fixed length vector. 
This  feature  vector  is  processed  through  fully  connected  networks  to 
predict class probabilities and refine the bounding boxes. Faster R-CNN 
(Ren et al., 2015) is the most popular object detection algorithm. In the 
Faster R-CNN model, the input images are fed into a CNN, which pro-
duces feature maps from the input images. A different neural network, 
RPN, is applied to predict the candidate bounding boxes. RoI pooling 
layers are applied to reshape the inputs. These properties render these 
two-stage  detectors  superior  to  one-stage  detectors.  Among  the  two- 
stage  detector,  EfficientDet  (Tan  et  al.,  2020)  architecture  is  gaining 
popularity owing to its excellent detection performance as  well as its 
relatively lower FLOPS (floating point operations per second) than in 
other object detection models.

Helpful Answer:
The papers mentioned in the given context primarily use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as the main deep learning model in their pipelines. For instance, Wang et al. (2020a) developed an encoder-decoder-based deep learning model to estimate seagrass coverage, achieving an mIoU of 90.66%. This suggests that they employed a CNN-based approach. Similarly, Perez et al. (2020) utilized both a Deep Capsule Network (DCN) and a Deep CNN to map seagrass distributions, demonstrating comparable performances between the two models. Furthermore, Antoni Burguera (Burguera, 2020) created a convolutional layer-based Neural Network (NN) model to map Posidonia oceanica seagrass, resulting in high precision, recall, and accuracy scores. Lastly, Noman et al. (2021b) proposed using Faster R-CNN with the NASNet model, achieving impressive mean Average Precision (mAP) values on specific datasets. Overall, it appears that CNNs are the predominant choice among researchers when dealing with tasks related to image analysis or pattern recognition in this domain.
