The  memory  access  amount  of  the  model  refers  to  the  byte  size 
required  to  access  the  storage  units  during  the  computation  of  the 
feature maps of each layer, thereby reflecting the model's demand for 
storage  unit  bandwidth.  In  addition  to  the  impact  of  floating-point 
computations,  the  inference  speed  of  a  model  on  specific  hardware 
also requires a comprehensive evaluation that considers both hardware 
characteristics and the amount of memory access. Memory access, which 
is  often  overlooked,  plays  a  significant  role  in  model  performance 
assessment. Within the model architecture, the conventional combina-
tion of convolution (Conv), batch normalisation (BN), and ReLU forms 
>80% of the model structure (Guo et al., 2023). The convolution and BN 
layers require bidirectional data and exhibit complex data dependencies 
during computation, resulting in memory access energy costs that are

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it can be inferred that various types of data formats have been utilized in the deep learning pipelines mentioned in these studies. However, the majority of them focus on visual data such as images or videos. For instance, Durve et al. (2022) use YOLOv5 and DeepSORT for microfluidic applications, while Palmer (n.d.) employs deep learning for high-resolution monitoring of fish length and catch numbers from landings. Similarly, Qin et al. (2022) propose a fish detection method based on multi-enhancement and output fusion of fuzzy underwater images. Furthermore, Rani et al. (2024) present a novel automated approach for fish biomass estimation in turbid environments through deep learning, object detection, and regression. Lastly, Zhang et al. (2024) introduce a fully automatic system for fish biomass estimation based on deep neural networks. These examples suggest that images and videos are commonly used data formats in the deep learning pipelines discussed in this context.
