During training, the diffusion model is provided with a dataset
comprising trajectories of fixed length. Determining the appropriate
length of these trajectories is a non-trivial task, as it can significantly
impact the performance of the final model. To address this, we initially
plotted the histogram of the original trajectory lengths and extracted
statistics including the minimum, maximum, average, and median
lengths. The analysis revealed that the majority of trajectories have a
length of 13. Consequently, we established a standard trajectory length
of 13 for our model. After segmenting the trajectories into fixed lengths
of 13, we discard segments shorter than 6 detections. For segments with
6 to 12 detections, we replicate their data points until they reach the
required length of 13. Finally, we scale each coordinate of the fish
detection within the range of [(cid:0) 1,1].

During the training of the MLP, Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba,
2015) is used, as well as the scheduler which adjusts the learning rate
when the network reaches a plateau. For the training, various parameter
values and different regularization techniques were explored, with the
option of using either Cross-Entropy or Focal Loss (Lin et al., 2017). In
detail, the learning rate was set to 0.00001 and 0.0001, batch sizes of 8,
16, 32, and 64 were tested, and weight decay was varied between
0.0001 and 0.001 with a dropout of 0.1. Additionally, Focal Loss (Lin
et al., 2017) introduce additional parameters to investigate: α and γ. The
former serves as a balancing factor, either as a fixed value for all classes
or as the inverse of each class frequency. The latter regulates the impact
of the scaling factor; specifically, when set to zero, Focal Loss is equiv-
alent to Cross-Entropy Loss. We experimented with α set as the inverse of

Various parameter values, including learning rate (i.e., 0.0001, 0.001,
0.01, and 0.1), batch size (i.e., 32, 64, 128, 256, and 512), and latent
dimension (i.e., 128, 256, 512, 2048), have been explored and
evaluated.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: During the training process, several strategies are employed to monitor the performance of the model. Firstly, the Adam optimizer is utilized, which adapts the learning rate based on the estimated moments of the gradients. This helps in achieving faster convergence and better generalization. Secondly, a scheduler is incorporated to adjust the learning rate when the network encounters a plateau, preventing overfitting and improving the overall performance. Thirdly, both Cross-Entropy and Focal Loss functions are considered for optimization. Cross-Entropy loss is commonly used for multi-class classification tasks, while Focal Loss addresses the issue of class imbalance by assigning more weights to misclassified examples. Lastly, various hyperparameters such as learning rates, batch sizes, weight decays, and dropouts are investigated to find the optimal combination for the best performance.
