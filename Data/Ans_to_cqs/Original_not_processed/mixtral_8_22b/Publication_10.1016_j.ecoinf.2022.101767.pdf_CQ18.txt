3. Results 

We  recorded  322  wild  bird  species  across  the  videos,  including 
subspecies (Table S2). Those that could not be identified at the species 
level  were  six  species  at  the  family  level:  Corvidae  sp.,  Ardeidae  sp., 
Acrocephalidae sp., Anatidae sp., Scolopacidae sp., and Phylloscopidae 
sp. Random forest analysis with the feature selection algorithm identi-
fied  significant  explanatory  factors  for  the  number  of  views  for  the 
video, including the number of days since uploading, length of the video, 
the number of uploaded videos in each channel, the presence of objects 
and text within the thumbnail information, and the presence of six wild 
bird  species  including  Anas  crecca,  Troglodytes  troglodytes,  Otus  sunia, 
Cuculus poliocephalus, Streptopelia orientalis, Larvivora cyane (Fig. 1). The 
number  of  days  since  uploading  was  selected  as  the  most  important 
explanatory factor.

from online shared videos that contain a wide range of species richness 
(from 1 to 106 wild bird species in the videos used in this study).

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any direct information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it can be inferred that the researchers might have used techniques such as cross-validation, early stopping, learning curves, or confusion matrices to evaluate their models. These methods are commonly employed to assess the performance of machine learning algorithms during training. Cross-validation involves splitting the dataset into multiple subsets and using them to validate the model's accuracy. Early stopping helps prevent overfitting by halting the training process when the validation error starts increasing. Learning curves display the relationship between the size of the training set and the model's performance, while confusion matrices summarize the predictions made by the classifier. Nevertheless, without explicit details regarding the specific methodology utilized in this research, these assumptions remain speculative.
