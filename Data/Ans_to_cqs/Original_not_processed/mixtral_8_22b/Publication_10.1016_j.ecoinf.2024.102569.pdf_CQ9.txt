Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

such as eBird, Pl@ntNet, iNaturalist, and Observation.org, available on 
the  Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), are accessible  for 
use. However, the analysis of PO data from such sources requires special 
attention, compared to PA data obtained through designed surveys, due 
to the potential for issues such as species identification errors and local 
over-aggregation of records.

where species are observed outside of their suitable habitats, such as in 
cultivation or captivity contexts (Botella et al., 2018). These scenarios 
are  common  issues  in  crowdsourcing  data  analysis.  To  remove  such 
heterogeneous  observations,  the  time-consuming  manual  checking  by 
experts  is  required  (Belbin  et  al.,  2013;  Mesibov,  2013).  If  such  pro-
cedure is not fully executed, our proposed method is expected to miti-
gate  the  impact  of  heterogeneous  observations  and  achieve  better 
predictions than ordinary methods. 

In  the  understanding  of  ecological  processes,  there  are  situations

Query: "Where is the data repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The data repository of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. However, it does mention that platforms like eBird, Pl@ntNet, iNaturalist, and Observation.org are available on the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). Therefore, one could infer that these platforms might be used as part of a deep learning pipeline, but this is speculative without further information. It would be best to refer directly to the source material for accurate details about the specific data repositories used in the deep learning pipeline.
