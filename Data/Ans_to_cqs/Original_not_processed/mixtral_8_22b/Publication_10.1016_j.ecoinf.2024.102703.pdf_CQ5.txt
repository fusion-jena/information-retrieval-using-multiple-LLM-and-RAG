Build a three-layer back propagation (BP) artificial neural network 
using MATLAB R2014b (Lin et al., 2021). The first layer (i.e. the input 
layer) corresponded to the aCDOM(254) and Fn(355) respectively. The 
intermediate layer (i.e. hidden layers) and the last layer (i.e. the output 
layer)  comprised  a  single  neuron,  that  corresponded  to  the  predictor 
(TSI). Set the maximum training times to 10,000 and the training error 
to 0.001. 64 water samples were utilized for model calibration, with the 
remaining  used  for  validation.  Validation  accuracy  was  assessed  by 
calculating the coefficient of determination (R2) and root-mean-square 
error (RMSE) between the measured and predicted TSI. The RMSE was 
determined using Eq. (6).

Helpful Answer:

In this case, the dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that the dataset consists of water samples with features such as aCDOM(254), Fn(355), pH, water temperature, NH4-N, NO3-N, TN, TP, Chl-a, DOC, and TSI. These features are used to build a three-layer backpropagation artificial neural network using MATLAB R2014b. The aim is to predict the TSI based on the other features. A total of 64 water samples were used for model calibration, while the remaining samples were used for validation. The performance of the model was evaluated using metrics such as the coefficient of determination (R2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) between the measured and predicted TSI. Therefore, although the name of the dataset is not specified, we can infer that it is a custom dataset consisting of water sample measurements.
