While  the  ensemble  size  for  bagging  is  not  particularly  critical, 
provided it is sufficiently large (500 is a widely used default value), it 
does  matter  for boosting.  In  XGBoost, large  ensemble  sizes  can  cause 
over-fitting because the gradient technique focuses on the most difficult 
cases,  which  can  be  due  to  noise.  To  avoid  the  over-fitting  issue  in 
XGBoost, we use a nested k-fold cross-validation scheme. We split each 
dataset into 3 subsets: the tuning set (k-2 folds), validation set (1-fold), 
and test set (1-fold). For each choice of number of iterations and each 
fold, we train the model on the tuning set and monitor the performance 
on the validation set by calculating the out-of-sample prediction accu-
racy and taking the median of k-1 folds. This gives us k medians for each 
number of iterations, as explained in Algorithm 1 and shown in Fig. S2 in 
Supplement A.3.

5.2. Real-life datasets 

5.2.1. Sparrow population dataset

the  RBF-GFR  and  GFR  models  with  CART  methods  and,  as  a  further 
extension,  we  use  ensemble  approaches,  random  forests  (RF)  and 
extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). Ignoring structure dependence in 
data increases the susceptibility to overfitting and causes autocorrela-
tions and non-independence of model residuals (Roberts et al., 2017). 
The  block  cross-validation  approach  addresses  the  autocorrelation  of 
dataset structures (Roberts et al., 2017). We have implemented the block 
cross-validation  approach  to  account  for  autocorrelation  of  dataset 
structures.  The  simulated  dataset  in  Matthiopoulos  et  al.  (2015)  was 
simulated from multiple instances where each instance consisted of 500 
observations representing a sub-population in a different landscape. The 
dataset has a spatial structure based on these scenarios. We have used 
these scenarios as dataset blocks when we applied the models. We have

regularisation, confirming similar findings in Machine Learning litera-
ture (Sollich and Krogh, 1996). The combination of the proposed RBF- 
GFR  model  with  random  forests  (RBF-GFR-RF)  produced  the  best 
model  overall,  consistently  achieving  a  place  in  the  top  three  perfor-
mance rankings. An important additional finding was that almost all the 
methods proposed in this study outperform the original GFR model from 
Matthiopoulos et al. (2011), which was the initial aim motivating the 
present work. As shown in Fig. 2, the GFR model never achieves a rank 
better than 6. R2
DEV  in Eq. (18) is generally a better behaved measure-
ment than R2  in Eq. (17) for count data as described in Section 4.2. We 
used R2
DEV to calculate the out-of-sample predictive performance in these 
datasets  as  shown  in  Fig. S9  in  Supplement A.9.  However,  the  overall 
ranks using R2
DEV  are not different from the overall ranks using R2  in Eq.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it mentions several real-life datasets used in ecology studies, including the sparrow population dataset and two simulated datasets from Matthiopoulos et al. (2015) and Matthiopoulos et al. (2011). These datasets were used to evaluate the performance of various machine learning models, including Random Forests (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost).
