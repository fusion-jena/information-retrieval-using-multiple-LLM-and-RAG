2019; Zamora-Izquierdo et al., 2019) and then machine learning and, 
more  recently,  deep  learning  techniques  are  applied  to  analyze  the 
generated data (Perakis et al., 2020; Swain et al., 2020). However, the 
traditional  data  management  systems  are  inadequate  to  handle  the 
volume, velocity, and variety of the generated data by the sensors and 
IoT devices (Wolfert et al., 2017). Hence the advanced data management

analysis techniques such as geospatial analysis, statistical-based models, 
mathematical  models,  deep  learning,  and  machine  learning  when 
designing the smart farming system.

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide specific information about the hyperparameters used in any particular deep learning model. However, it mentions that deep learning techniques have been applied to analyze data in smart farming systems. Common hyperparameters used in deep learning models include learning rate, optimizer, batch size, number of epochs, and regularization parameters like dropout rate or weight decay. Learning rate determines how much the weights should be updated during training, while the optimizer specifies the optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function. Popular choices for optimizers include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop. Batch size refers to the number of samples processed before updating the internal model parameters, and the number of epochs represents the total number of iterations through the entire dataset. Regularization parameters help prevent overfitting by adding constraints to the model complexity. Without further details about the specific deep learning model mentioned in the context, we cannot determine the exact hyperparameters used.
