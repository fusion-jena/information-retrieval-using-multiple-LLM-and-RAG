Data-driven models depend on a number of parameters, known as 
hyperparameters,  which  are  employed  to  enhance  and  regulate  the 
learning  procedure.  Optimal  hyperparameter  selection 
leads  to 
improved model accuracy and enhanced prediction performance (Aze-
dou et al., 2023). To fine-tune hyperparameters in data-driven models, 
the development dataset (comprising all data records except the evalu-
ation data records) is divided into two categories: the training dataset 
and the tuning dataset. Given the size constrains of the dataset used in 
the  analysis  and  the  need  to  utilize  all  development  data  records  in 
training  to  enhance  the  model’s  generalization  ability,  k-fold  cross- 
validation  was  chosen  as  the  preferred  approach  for  hyperparameter 
tuning (Saha et al., 2022). In this technique, the development dataset is 
evenly divided into k groups. During each iteration, one group called the

data), allowed the models to yield an almost perfect fit against the model 
development dataset.

Table 3 presents the fit statistics for the various models for the in-
dependent evaluation dataset. This is an important component for the 
evaluation of ML models as it allows one to verify possible overfitting. 
The  AutoML  models  achieved  the  best  results.  TabPFN  exhibited  the 
highest performance among all models, achieving an Accuracy of 91% 
and  a  F1-score  of  93%.  The  AutoGluon  model  achieved  comparable 
results, with a slightly lower Accuracy of 87% and a F1-score of 93%. 
The ensemble  ML models produced lower fits, with the XGBoost pro-
ducing  an  Accuracy  of  87%  and  an  F1-score  of  90%.  The  RF  model 
produced the lowest fit metrics (Accuracy = 73%, F1-score = 79%).

tuning dataset is excluded from the training process. The model is then 
developed using the remaining dataset (i.e. the training dataset), and its 
performance is evaluated using the tuning dataset. The average perfor-
mance of the k models developed on the validation groups represents the 
performance of the machine learning technique for the selected hyper-
parameters (Velasco Hererra et al., 2022). For this study, a value of 5 is 
assumed  for  k.  Grid  search  is  employed  to  evaluate  the  data-driven 
model’s  performance  using  each  combination  of  predefined  hyper-
parameters and identify the best hyperparameters. The maximum depth 
of the tree, the number of trees in the ensemble model, and the learning 
rate (which shows how fast the model learns) are tuned in this study as 
the influential hyperparameters (Cakiroglu et al., 2022).

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the development dataset was divided into two categories: the training dataset and the tuning dataset. This division aimed to use all available data records for training, thereby enhancing the model's generalization ability. Secondly, due to the constraints of the dataset size, k-fold cross-validation was chosen as the preferred approach for hyperparameter tuning. This technique involves evenly dividing the development dataset into 'k' groups. Each group is then used once as the validation set while the other 'k-1' groups serve as the training set. This process is repeated 'k' times, ensuring that every data point gets to be in the validation set exactly once. For this study, a value of 5 was assumed for 'k'. Lastly, grid search was employed to evaluate the data-driven model's performance using each combination of predefined hyperparameters and identify the best hyperparameters. The maximum depth of the tree, the number of trees in the ensemble model, and the learning rate were tuned in this study as the influential hyperparameters. These measures collectively helped improve the model's accuracy and prediction performance, thus ensuring its generalizability.
