For  the  simulations  the  infiltration  capacity  was  quantified  in  a 
parameter  derived  by  the  Soil  Conservation  Service  (SCS)  called  CN. 
This parameter determines the runoff over an area based on soil type, 
soil cover and the hydrological group of the soil (Cronshey, 1986). The 
figure calculated for sub-basin 1 is 80.1, for sub-basin 2 it is 78.5, for 
sub-basin 3 it is 77.3, for sub-basin 4 it is 74.0, for sub-basin 5 it is 76.1 
and for sub-basin 6 it is 81.0. To better assess the possible effects of using 
NBS,  four  hypothetical  scenarios  were  chosen.  These  scenarios  were 
based on changing the land use from agriculture to forestry. According 
to  Perpi˜na  Castillo  et  al.  (2020),  Galicia  has  one  of  with  the  highest 
percentages of abandoned agricultural land of any region in Spain, with

36–13 mm/h), 10% into type D (very slow infiltration, <13 mm/h) and 
only 14% into type A (fast infiltration >76 mm/h), which also influences 
the effective capacity of the NBS selected. This adds to the difficulty of 
solving the serious flooding problem in the Umia River Basin.

racy assessment requires these parameters to calculate the total number of 
training samples required for the image classified using Eq. 1.

infrastructure and natural water retention measures, such as land use 
conversion through afforestation to improve evapotranspiration, infil-
tration  and  retention  of  water,  land  management  practices  that  help 
increase  the  water  holding  capacity  of  soils  and  the  reconnection  of 
floodplains or ponds to rivers (Collentine and Futter, 2018).

Helpful Answer:
The query asks about regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, none of the given pieces of context discuss this topic directly. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct answer based solely on the information provided.

However, I can share some general knowledge about regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting. Regularization techniques aim to reduce model complexity and avoid memorizing training data, thus improving its ability to generalize to unseen data. Two common regularization methods mentioned in the query are Dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, effectively creating a thinned network. This helps prevent complex co-adaptations between neurons and reduces overfitting.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, involves adding a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of all weights in the network. This encourages smaller weights, reducing overall model complexity and helping prevent overfitting.

Other popular regularization methods include L1 regularization, early stopping, and data augmentation. L1 regularization uses the absolute value instead of the squared value of the weights in the penalty term, promoting sparse solutions. Early stopping stops training when validation performance starts degrading, preventing further overfitting. Data augmentation generates additional training examples by applying transformations like rotations, translations, or flips to existing data, increasing dataset size and diversity.
