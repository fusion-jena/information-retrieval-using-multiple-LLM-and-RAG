4.3.3. LSTM model 

The  long  short-term  memory  (LSTM)  model  is  a  common  deep 
learning model used to solve the prediction problem of time series data 
(Tang  et  al.,  2023).  Compared  with  traditional  machine  learning 
models, the LSTM model has better performance and ability to manage 
the  prediction  problem  of  time  series  data,  especially  the  long-term 
dependency  problem  and  multivariate  time  series  data,  and  has 
obvious  advantages  (Liu  et  al.,  2021;  Tang  et  al.,  2023;  Zhou  et  al., 
2023). Fig. 3 shows the prediction process of the LSTM model and the BP 
model.  This  study  compares  these  two  models  and  the  Markov  chain 
model. 

4.4. FMOP model 

Optimizing land allocation through a multiobjective programming 
(MOP) model combined with uncertainty analysis methods can provide 
a reference for decision makers.

5.2. Land type conversion drivers 

We  added  the  extracted  land  type  expansion  raster  to  LEAS  and 
imported  the  driver  raster  map.  Subsequently,  the  RFC  was  used  to 
obtain the probability of development and the contribution of drivers for 
each land category. We also set the sampling rate to 0.1, the number of 
decision trees to 20, the number of features used to train the random 
forest to 9, and the number of parallels to 12 to improve the execution 
speed. In summary, the contribution rates and root mean square errors 
of each driving factor to the expansion of each land type were obtained 
(Fig. 6). The root mean square error (RMSE) of the PLUS model's analysis 
of the drivers of expansion for the six land types in the YRB-SX for the 
years  2000–2010  and  2010–2020  was  less  than  0.2,  and  the  model 
performed well. 

The higher the variable contribution rate is, the greater the impact of

Spatial reconstruction and scenario simulation of historical processes and future trends of land use/cover change 
(LUCC) can help to reveal the historical background of land conversion and the spatial distribution of future land. 
Moreover, there is a close relationship between the spatiotemporal dynamics of land use/cover and changes in 
different ecosystem services (ESs). Using this relationship to simulate future land use scenarios is important. In 
this study, an LUCC dynamic analysis framework (LSTM-PLUS-FMOP) was constructed based on a deep learning 
time  series  forecasting  model  (LSTM),  a  parallelized  urban  land  use  simulation  (PLUS)  model  and  a  fuzzy 
multiobjective programming (FMOP) model. The PLUS model was used to analyze the driving mechanism of land 
expansion and explore the land conversion pattern. In addition, three land conversion scenarios were established:

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, the given context does not explicitly mention which specific frameworks or libraries are used to build the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model is employed for solving the prediction problem of time series data. Generally, popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch support building LSTM models. Therefore, either TensorFlow or PyTorch could have been used to construct the LSTM model mentioned in the context. Nonetheless, without explicit information about the frameworks utilized, we cannot definitively state whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other library was used to develop the deep learning model.
