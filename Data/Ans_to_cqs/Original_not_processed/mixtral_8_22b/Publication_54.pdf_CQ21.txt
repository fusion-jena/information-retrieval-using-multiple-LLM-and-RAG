the training and validation sets. Then, the model is ﬁt by using
(k − 1) folds and evaluated using the remaining k th fold. The
process is repeated until every k-fold is used as the test set.
However, this may produce varying results. Thus, to improve
the model and analyze the inﬂuence of various components
in the framework, we adopted multistage training with the
training and validation datasets (Fig. 4) to better predict test
dataset.

The model is then iteratively trained and validated on these
different sets. The training set is used to ﬁt the parameters of
the classiﬁer, whereas the validation set provides an unbiased
evaluation of the model ﬁt on the training set while tuning
model hyperparameters, such as the network layer size, ﬁnd-
ing the optimal number of hidden units, and regularizing the
model. Models with few hyperparameters are easy to validate
and tune, but if the model has many hyperparameters, a larger
validation dataset is required. In some cases, the evaluation
is biased when a validation dataset is not incorporated into
the model conﬁguration because the model may perfectly ﬁt
the training data with high accuracy but may fail to ﬁt the
test or validation data. In such cases, k-fold cross-validation,
which is a resampling technique, is used to avoid overﬁtting;
the training set is generated with different combinations of k
groups (say 5 or 10, depending on the size of the dataset) as

3. Furthermore, to enhance the performance and decrease
overﬁtting in the selected model, we proposed a mech-
anism to swap the training and validation misclassiﬁed
datasets. Then, we retrained the model until it yielded
the highest accuracy possible on the validation and test
datasets. Additionally, ﬁve-fold cross-validation was
employed to verify the predictive performance of the
model.

Thus, through the monitoring and identiﬁcation of endemic
birds in their habitats and estimating the size of their popula-
tions, the proposed system can help conserve biodiversity.

• Train the Inception-ResNet-v2 architecture on data aug-

mented from original images.

• Test the validation dataset and determine the misclassi-

ﬁed images.

• Randomly interchange the same amount of misclassiﬁed
validation images with the training images and retrain
the model again.

• Repeat this process until the classiﬁer adapts to the

speciﬁc target task.

• Fit the model to evaluate the test set.
In this way, the algorithm can tune itself and improve the
generalizability of spatial features to the previously unseen
domains present in the image.

Helpful Answer:
After the model training, several postprocessing steps can be performed to further analyze and understand the model's performance. Some common postprocessing techniques include:

1. Saliency Maps: These visualize which parts of the input image were most important for the model's prediction. This helps identify whether the model is focusing on relevant features or being distracted by irrelevant ones.

2. Metrics Calculation: Various metrics like precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curves, etc., can be calculated to quantify the model's performance. These metrics provide insights into how well the model performs across different classes and scenarios.

3. Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix is a table layout that allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm. Each row of the matrix represents the instances in an actual class while each column represents the instances in a predicted class. It gives us insight not only into the errors made by the classifier but more importantly the types of errors that are being made.

4. Cross-Validation: As mentioned in the given context, k-fold cross-validation is often employed to ensure that the model generalizes well to new data. This involves splitting the data into 'k' subsets, training the model on 'k-1' subsets, and testing it on the remaining subset. This process is repeated 'k' times so that each subset serves as the test set once.

5. Hyperparameter Tuning: After initial training, the model's hyperparameters might need adjustments to achieve optimal performance. Techniques like grid search or randomized search can be used to find the best combination of hyperparameters.

6. Model Interpretability: Post hoc interpretability methods like LIME, SHAP, etc., can be applied to explain individual predictions. This helps build trust in the model and ensures its decisions align with domain knowledge.
