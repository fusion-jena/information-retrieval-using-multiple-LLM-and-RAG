To quantify the relative parameter contributions of the parameters to 
the characteristics of DOM, the least absolute shrinkage and selection 
operator (LASSO) model was used to investigate the multicollinearity 
between the variables, and the analysis with lars() took place in the R- 
studio lars package. By imposing a penalty on the size of coefficients, the 
LASSO technique shrinks less important variables’ coefficients to zero, 
thus performing variable selection and allowing for the identification of 
the most relevant variables (Mukherjee et al., 2019). This model used 
+
environmental factors (pH, water temperature), nutrients (TP, TN, NH4
- 
(cid:0)
N, and NO3
-N), and phytoplankton (Chl-a) as predictors as predictors, 
with Fn355 as the response variable.

Due  to  the  increased  complexity  of  the  interactions  between  vari-
ables,  the  selection  of  important  variables  becomes  challenging.  The 
LASSO model was used for variable selection and statistical regulariza-
tion to enhance the prediction accuracy of the model (Mukherjee et al., 
2019). This model states that the impact of nutrient and environmental 
factors on FDOM varies with trophic state. Previous research conducted 
on the Inner Mongolia Plateau has validated the strong positive corre-
lations between the optical properties of DOM and the TSI, suggesting 
that  DOM  is  influenced  by  nutrient  variation  (Wen  et  al.,  2016). 
Regardless of the trophic state, pH consistently correlates with FDOM, 
with the highest pH values found under light-eutrophic conditions. Prior 
research indicated that pH significantly influences DOM photolysis rates 
and absorbance (Timko et al., 2015). pH is also the environmental driver

Based on the Trophic State Index, which ranges from 31 to 67, all 

Fn(355) values ranged from 1.16 to 2.97, with the average increasing

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given information, there is no explicit mention or description of how the hyperparameters of the LASSO model were optimized. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether techniques such as grid search, random search, or other methods were employed for this purpose.
