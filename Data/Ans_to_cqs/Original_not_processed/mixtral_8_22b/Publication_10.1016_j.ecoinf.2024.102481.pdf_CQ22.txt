Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

In addition to the OOB, the model performance was also evaluated 
using  the  confusion  matrix  with  the  following  metrics:  Cohen’s  kappa 
coefficient (κ) to measure the proportion of agreements (Cohen, 1960), 
Precision to determine proportion of correct predictions, Sensitivity for 
the true positive rate (correctly predicted phases), Specificity for the true 
negative rate (correct allocation to other phases), and Prevalence for the 
proportion  within  each  phase.  Descriptions  of  these  metrics  are  as 
follows: 

κ =

2 × (TP × TN (cid:0) FN × FP)
(TP + FP) × (FP + TN) + (TP + FN) × (FN + TN)

On each sampled fish, the Gonadosomatic Index (GSI) was computed 
as  GSI  = (OW  /  (TW  -  OW))  × 100.  In  addition,  a  measurement  of 
relative condition factor (Krel) was calculated as an indirect measure of 
nutritional status in according to Le Cren (1951), as Krel = TW / (αTL
),

error < 11%, high prevalence (>43%) and sensitivity higher than 86% 
(Table 2). In all classified maturity stages, the specificity was higher than 
85%.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics from the confusion matrix. These include Cohen's kappa coefficient (κ) to measure the proportion of agreements, Precision to determine the proportion of correct predictions, Sensitivity for the true positive rate (correctly predicted phases), Specificity for the true negative rate (correct allocation to other phases), and Prevalence for the proportion within each phase. Additionally, the error percentage is reported.
