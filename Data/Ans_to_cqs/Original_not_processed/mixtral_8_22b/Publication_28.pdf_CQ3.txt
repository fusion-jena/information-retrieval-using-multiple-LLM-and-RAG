Lunga  et  al.  (2020)  presented  a  new  remote  sensing  data  flow 
(RESFlow) to an advanced ML for computing huge amount of remotely 
sensed images. The important role is separating huge amount of data for 
homogeneous distribution to fit easier modules. Nguyen et  al. (2020) 
proposed  a  new  multi  temporal  high  spatial  resolution  classification 
technique using an innovative spatio temporal spectral DNN for locating 
paddy fields at the pixel level for an entire year and temporal instances. 
Boulila et al. (2021) proposed a new distributed DL based method for 
classifying the big remote sensing images. Particularly, they proposed an 
RS-DCNN for managing image classification. The initial phase is to make 
the  training  dataset  for  RS-DCNN.  Later,  for  ensuring  a  data  parallel 
training  on  Apache  Spark  architecture,  a  pixel  based  CNN  module 
through the big data cluster is executed by BigDL.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipelines mentioned. However, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and landmark annotation. These techniques help label datasets with relevant information required for training machine learning models. Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest within an image or video frame. Semantic segmentation involves assigning each pixel in an image to a class label, while instance segmentation involves identifying individual object instances within an image. Polygon annotation involves outlining complex shapes within an image, while key point annotation involves marking specific points on an object such as joints or facial features. Landmark annotation involves placing dots on specific parts of an object to define its shape or pose. It is essential to choose the appropriate annotation technique depending on the task requirements and the nature of the data being labeled.
