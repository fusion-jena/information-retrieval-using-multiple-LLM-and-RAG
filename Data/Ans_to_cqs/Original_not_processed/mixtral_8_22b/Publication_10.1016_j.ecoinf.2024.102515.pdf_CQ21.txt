2. Methodology

(INDITIC Consortium, 2023). This kind of initiatives would benefit of 
the implementation of the current methodology to reduce human effort. 
Although the usefulness of this methodology has been proven, there 
are still certain limitations that cannot be ignored. The main one cor-
responds to the nature of the tweets themselves, with a low number of 
words  accompanying  the  messages,  not  always  well  written,  which 
makes  it  difficult  to  obtain  useful  information.  This  leads  to  a  high 
number of tweets being lost in the filtering process. Furthermore, using 
exclusively textual information from tweets to obtain a training dataset 
would  only  lead  to  the  creation  of  a  deficient  model.  In  addition, 
biodiversity observations only make sense when accompanied by their 
location, allowing, among other applications, to alert about the presence 
of  invasive  species  or  reuse  the  information  in  species  distribution

successfully  located  after  contacting  the  user.  A  training  dataset  has 
been  made  available  at  https://github.com/PabloOtero/diversi 
mar_paper,  which  could  be  useful 
learning 
experiments.

a species observation must first know the monitoring network or pro-
gram to which he/she wishes to enrol and then send the data via email,

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit details on the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training for biodiversity observations. However, based on general machine learning practices, some common postprocessing steps include evaluating the performance of the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc. Additionally, confusion matrices can be used to visualize the performance of the model, showing true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. Another possible step is generating saliency maps, which highlight important features contributing to the model's predictions. These steps help assess the effectiveness of the model and identify areas for improvement.
