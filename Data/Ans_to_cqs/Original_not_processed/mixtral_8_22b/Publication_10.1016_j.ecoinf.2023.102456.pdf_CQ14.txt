The Gumbel-Softmax  function is  a  more general  function  that can 
approximate any discrete distribution to a continuous distribution. Its 
usefulness in optimizing neural networks involving discrete variables, 
such as those used in reinforcement learning and generative models, can 
be seen in (Mena et al., 2018; Strypsteen and Bertrand, 2021). However, 
the Gumbel-Softmax function is not a perfect substitute for the binary 
Bernoulli  random  variable.  Since  the  introduction  of  a  stochastic 
element into the computational process allows us to keep that character, 
but it could have an impact on our estimates. Furthermore, the function

function. We also avoid defining parameters, this allows us to learn non- 
linear  relationships  with  an  infection  capacity  greater  than  those 
established in (Boters-Pitarch et al., 2023a). Thirdly, the φ filter ensures 
that the expansion is carried out only by the infected elements of the 
system,  making  the  ΔID  parameter  decisive  during  learning,  which 
represents a significant advance over the previous relationship. Finally, 
using the sigmoid activation function σ (or similar) as the output of the 
network guarantees that all the cells of the neighbourhood relationship 
can  be  interpreted  as  probabilities,  without  having  to  consider  those 
with a probability greater than one, i.e. Rk ∈ [0, 1]N×,N.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, such as through methods like grid search or random search. Therefore, it cannot be determined from the provided context how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.
