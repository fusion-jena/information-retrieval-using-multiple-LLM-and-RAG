Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The sources of raw data used in deep learning pipelines vary depending on the specific application or problem being addressed. Some common methods for collecting raw data include:

1. Surveys: Data collected through surveys, such as questionnaires or interviews, can provide valuable insights into human behavior, opinions, and preferences. This type of data can be useful for applications like sentiment analysis, recommendation systems, and customer segmentation.

2. Sensors: Various types of sensors, including cameras, microphones, accelerometers, and GPS devices, can capture real-world data for use in deep learning models. Examples include using camera footage for object detection, audio recordings for speech recognition, and sensor readings for predictive maintenance tasks.

3. Public Datasets: There are numerous publicly available datasets containing diverse types of information, such as text, images, videos, and time series data. These datasets can serve as a rich source of labeled or unlabeled data for various deep learning tasks, reducing the need for extensive data collection efforts.

In the given context, some examples of these methods can be found:

* For marine mammals monitoring, researchers have employed drones equipped with high-resolution cameras to collect aerial images of whales [1].
* To study trends in sea surface temperature, scientists have relied on satellite remote sensing data [2].
* In the field of dermatology, researchers have leveraged large collections of clinical images to train deep learning models for skin cancer diagnosis [54].
* Google's AlphaGo project used historical records of professional Go games to develop its AI system capable of mastering the game [55].
* Researchers studying image super-resolution techniques have made use of publicly available datasets, such as the BSDS500 dataset [58].
