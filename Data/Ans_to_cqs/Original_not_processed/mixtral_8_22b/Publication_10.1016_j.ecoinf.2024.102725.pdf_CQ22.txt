3.4. Accuracy evaluation metrics

This study utilizes a consistent color ramp and stretch function to
render all of the NDVI images. Four evaluation metrics, the coefficient of
determination (R2), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute
error (MAE), and error relative global accuracy (ERGAS), are employed
to assess and contrast the disparities between the predicted and actual
images.

R2 reflects the goodness-of-fit of the predicted images to the refer-
ence images, with values ranging from -∞ to 1. An R2 value of 1 in-
dicates perfect alignment between the predicted and true values, while
R2 = 0 indicates that all of the predicted values are equal to the mean of
the true values. Values below zero indicate no correlation. The calcu-
lation formula is as follows:

where dh
dl represents the ratio of pixel sizes between images. The input
data for this study consists of fused predicted NDVI data with a spatial
resolution of 10 m; hence, the value is set to 1. μ(l) denotes the mean
value of the corresponding band. RMSE is the root mean square error. B
represents the number of bands, which has a value of 1 in this study.

The RMSE is used to evaluate the discrepancy between the fused
results and observed values. It is calculated as the square root of the
average of the squared differences between the fused results and
observed values and is particularly sensitive to the impact of outliers. A
higher value indicates a larger deviation, whereas a lower value in-
dicates a better match with observed values. The formula for the RMSE

Helpful Answer:
Four evaluation metrics are utilized in this study to compare the differences between the predicted and actual images. These include the coefficient of determination (R^2), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and error relative global accuracy (ERGAS).

The coefficient of determination (R^2) measures how well the predicted images fit the reference images, with values ranging from negative infinity to 1. A higher R^2 value indicates a better fit between the predicted and true values.

Root mean squared error (RMSE) evaluates the difference between the fused results and observed values by calculating the square root of the average of the squared differences between them. This metric is sensitive to outliers, where a higher value suggests a greater deviation, and a lower value indicates a closer match with observed values.

Mean absolute error (MAE) computes the average magnitude of errors without considering their direction. Lower MAE values suggest more accurate predictions.

Error relative global accuracy (ERGAS) quantifies the overall quality of the reconstructed image compared to the original one. ERGAS takes into account both spectral and spatial distortions, providing a comprehensive assessment of the fusion process.
