as a sum of two terms: binary cross-entropy and Dice coefﬁcient-related loss of the three predicted
masks [50–52]. We used the optimizer RMSprop (unpublished, adaptive learning rate method proposed
by Geoff Hinton here http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~tijmen/csc321/slides/lecture_slides_lec6.pdf)
with an initial learning rate of 0.0001. We trained our network for 300 epochs with 24 images per batch.

ability to identify features in large amounts of data, including very high-resolution imagery, achieving
accuracy similar to human-level classiﬁcation accuracy, but in a consistent and fast way, enabling
rapid application over very large areas and/or through time [14]. For example, individual tree species
mapping in tropical forests, that was in the past only possible on small scale with traditional machine
learning methods [15,16] is now feasible on a large scale (>5000 km2) with a deep learning method
called U-net [17–20].

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, some common regularization techniques include dropout, L1 and L2 regularization, early stopping, and data augmentation. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to make the model more robust by preventing complex co-adaptations on training data. L1 and L2 regularization add penalties to the loss function based on the weights of the neurons, encouraging simpler models and reducing overfitting. Early stopping involves monitoring the performance of the model on a validation set during training and halting the process when the performance stops improving. Data augmentation generates new training samples by applying random transformations to existing ones, increasing the diversity of the training data and helping to reduce overfitting. It is not clear if these techniques were employed in this particular case without further information.

Unhelpful Answer:
The context does not provide enough information to determine what regularization methods were used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot give a definitive answer to this query.
