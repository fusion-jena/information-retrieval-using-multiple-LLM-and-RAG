options, contribute to the stability of the search. Additionally, its effi-
cient standard marking system can remove low-quality pixels, thereby 
improving  search  quality  (Li  et  al.,  2023a,  2023b,  2023c,  2023d). 
However, L2gen requires an accurate understanding of aerosol types to 
obtain high-quality Rrs  retrieval, and the complex aerosols of PL make 
this practice less efficient.

artificial neural networks (ANN) (Men et al., 2022). The efficacy of these 
algorithms exhibits considerable variation across diverse aquatic envi-
ronments. For instance, the Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of 
Spectral  Hypercubes  (FLAASH)  model,  originally  developed  for  land 
pixels,  has  proven  effective  in  AC  for  aquatic  environments  utilizing 
Sentinel-2  and  SPOT-6  imagery  (Rotta  et  al.,  2016;  Li  et  al.,  2023a, 
2023b, 2023c, 2023d). Additionally, the FLAASH algorithm mitigates 
the  spatial  proximity  effect  by  employing  an  internal  pixel  averaging 
technique, which is essential for attaining high-quality AC (Wang et al., 
2021).  In  investigations  of  lacustrine  environments  using  Advanced 
Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) AVNIR-2 data, the efficacy of AC al-
gorithms  predicated  on  the  single  scattering  approximation  has  been 
significantly enhanced (Matsui and Kageyama, 2022). The Atmospheric

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, common practices include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization scales numeric columns to a range between 0 and 1, while scaling transforms features to have zero mean and unit variance. Cleaning involves handling missing values, outliers, or errors in the dataset. These techniques help improve the performance and convergence speed of machine learning algorithms.

Based on the context, it appears that the study focuses on atmospheric correction methods for satellite imagery, specifically addressing issues related to aerosol types and spatial factors. It mentions various models like L2gen, FLAASH, and ANN, but there is no direct reference to any specific preprocessing steps used before applying these models. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the exact preprocessing steps employed in this particular case.
