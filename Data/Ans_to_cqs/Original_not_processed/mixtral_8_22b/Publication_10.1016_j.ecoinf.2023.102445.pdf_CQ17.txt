input into the model network for training.

2.2.6. Experimental design 

In this paper, a sequence of 10 ablation experiments are conducted 
and labelled to evaluate the enhancements made to various components 
of the network architecture. These experiments use 10 different network 
models,  of  which  the  model  of  Experiment  1  is  the  original  YOLOv8 
model, and the remaining nine models are models with different struc-
tures modified on the basis of YOLOv8. 

The experimental training parameter settings are as follows: a batch 
size of 16 is selected, the input image resolution is set at 640 × 640, and 
the number of epochs is specified as 150. The learning rate is set to 0.01, 
and the optimizer is Adam. Additionally, the depth_scale parameter is 
assigned a value of 0.33, while the width_scale parameter is set to 0.25.

designs  the  C2flite  module  to  integrate  more  deep  features  into  the 
network.  Thus,  the  number  of  model  parameters  can  be  significantly 
reduced while maintaining high accuracy and speed. Concurrently, we 
conducted  ablation  experiments  and  compared  YOLO_MRC's  perfor-
mance with that of improved models such as YOLOv5s-ECA (She et al., 
2022),  Fast-RCNN  (Mobilenetv2)  (Shen  et  al.,  2018),  YOLOv5Ghost 
(Zhang et al., 2022), and YOLOv7Tiny (Wang et al., 2023) to explore the 
performance advantages of YOLO_MRC on our Bactrocera cucurbitae pest 
dataset. In addition, on the public dataset Pest_24_640, YOLO_MRC is 
used  to  conduct  benchmark  experiments  with  several  other  excellent 
SOTA  models  to  explore  its  performance  on  multiclass  pest  detection 
tasks.

(AdaptiveAvgPool). These operations generate lc
Avg. The output 
size of both branches is set to match the size of the m feature map. The 
resulting feature maps from these two branches subsequently summed to 
yield the lc
Max+Avg, and m 
feature maps are concatenated for subsequent processing. In this mod-
ule,  the  attention  mechanism  is  introduced  during  the  concatenation 
operation.  Network  training  yields  three  weight  values,  each  corre-
sponding to one of the feature maps. These weights are subsequently 
applied to the respective feature maps. A greater influence on the model 
is associated with a higher weight, while a lesser influence receives a 
lower weight. Each feature map is then multiplied by its weight before 
being concatenated alongside the others.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does provide information about the experimental setup and some modifications made to the YOLOv8 model.

Regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to avoid overfitting. On the other hand, L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, discouraging large weights and thus helping to reduce overfitting.

While these techniques are common in deep learning pipelines, without further details about the specific implementation of the models used in the experiments, it cannot be confirmed whether they were employed or not. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, I am unable to definitively state what regularization methods were used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
