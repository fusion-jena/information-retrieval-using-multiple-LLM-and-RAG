research center. The Direct Application Programming Interface (API) in 
Python is used to retrieve the necessary picture data for forest fire point 
information  in  the  study  area.  The  obtained  data  is  saved  in  “CSV” 
format on Google Drive for later examination. Data is stored on Google 
Drive in CSV format to aid with further calculations.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific data repository link of the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the research. Therefore, I cannot provide the exact link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. However, it mentions that the obtained data is saved in "CSV" format on Google Drive for later examination. It also refers to a dataset with comprehensive aboveground biomass data, whose standard errors are thoroughly delineated in the official documentation available at <https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/bedc59f37c9545c981a839eb552e4084>. Unfortunately, this information does not directly address the query regarding the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline.
