State of the Art: Machine Learning for
Insect Ecoinformatics
Ecologists strive to document and interpret the abundance
and distribution of organisms. Field observations are a major
means to this end, and the observational data that have
accumulated over the decades form a solid basis for our
view of ecosystems. In recent years, technological advances
enabled the solidiﬁcation of observational ecology into a
new scientiﬁc branch, ecoinformatics, which applies big-data
methods to ecological questions (Rosenheim and Gratton, 2017).
Ecoinformatics focuses on curating and mining large databases,
collected over long time periods across multiple locations (see
the GBIF Home Page1). The available data vary in format and
reliability (Gueta and Carmel, 2016) as they originate from
multiple sources, such as long-term ecological monitoring (Lister
and Garcia, 2018), citizen science projects (Hallmann et al., 2017),
or museum catalogs (Short et al., 2018).

Deep Learning for Insect Ecoinformatics

INTRODUCTION

Machine learning methods are increasingly applied to
biological problems that involve classiﬁcation of images and
extracting information from them. The current leading approach
to such tasks is supervised learning using deep neural networks

(DNNs), and particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs),
which are able to extract abstract high level features from images.
Identifying objects within the image and classifying them may
be treated as separate tasks. Yet, more recent methods, such as
“Faster R-CNN” (Ren et al., 2015), and YOLO (Redmon et al.,
2016) consider both problems at the same time.

Deep Learning for Insect Ecoinformatics

data points describe the performance attained by a model that
accepts all identiﬁcations, as its Tcs is minimal (0). Such a plot
can guide users in adjusting model parameters to their needs. If
fewer detections are accepted (low recall), precision increases.

Tables 3, 4 illustrate the types of recall (Table 3) and precision
(Table 4) errors made by the model when the conﬁdence
threshold was set to 0.7. The model rarely confused between our
three focal species (gray areas in Tables 3, 4). It made some false
positive predictions, particularly for the class “Psyllaephagus”
(bold text in Table 4, not tagged by the expert but predicted
by the model). Most of the missed predictions, however, were
false negatives (bold text in Table 3, tagged by the expert but not
identiﬁed by the model).

Helpful Answer:
The raw data used in the deep learning pipeline for insect ecoinformatics can be collected through various means. These include long-term ecological monitoring, citizen science projects, and museum catalogs. Long-term ecological monitoring involves systematic observation and collection of data over extended periods, often focusing on specific species or habitats. Citizen science projects engage non-professional volunteers in scientific research, contributing valuable data to the field. Museum catalogs provide historical records of specimens, offering insights into past distributions and abundances of different species. Additionally, other sources like remote sensing technologies, drones, and automated traps can also contribute to the pool of raw data.
