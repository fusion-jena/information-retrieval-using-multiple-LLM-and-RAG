solely using the hand-annotated data. This allows for a direct comparison of the contribution of
high-quality annotations when compared to the self-supervised model or the full model combining
both self-supervision and hand-annotation data.

combined with labeled data in a semi-supervised framework (sensu [14]), which may improve deep
learning on limited training data by providing neural networks the opportunity to learn generalized
features on a wider array of training examples, followed by retraining on a smaller number of high
quality annotations [16]. It is unknown whether moderate to low quality annotations can be used
to generate trees for initial model training, given the imperfect nature of existing unsupervised tree
delimitation approaches.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, based on common practices in machine learning and deep learning, some possible evaluation metrics could include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, and area under the curve (AUC). Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of total predictions made. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made. Recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positives. F1 score combines both precision and recall into a single metric. ROC curve plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate, while AUC represents the area under this curve. These metrics would depend on the specific task and dataset being used.
