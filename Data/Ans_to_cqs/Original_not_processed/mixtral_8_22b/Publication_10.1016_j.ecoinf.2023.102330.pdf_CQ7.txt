Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly state the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it is important to note that the standard practice in machine learning involves splitting the dataset into three subsets: training set, validation set, and testing set. Typically, the dataset is divided such that around 70% of the data is allocated for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. This division allows the model to learn from the majority of the data during training while using the remaining portions for tuning hyperparameters and evaluating its performance on unseen data. It should be noted that these percentages may vary depending on the specific requirements and constraints of each project.
