WT-HMM using varying dataset sizes over 10 runs.

techniques may enhance classification performance.

Furthermore,  the  comparison  between  recording  months  provides 
valuable insights into the tradeoffs  associated with dataset size  selec-
tion. The superior performance of the WT-HMM in the 8 to 20-h dataset 
size  range  for  both  months  suggests  the  most  suitable  range  for 
achieving  high  accuracy.  This  finding  resonates  with  studies  empha-
sizing the importance of selecting appropriate sample sizes for effective 
model training (Kahl et al., 2021).

2.2. Data denoising 

2.3. Data annotations 

Whale sound recordings typically contain some ambient noise from 
both geophonic (rain, sea currents, drifting icebergs, etc.) and anthro-
pogenic (sonar, vessel traffic, wind energy, and oil and gas exploration, 
among other sources) (Shabangu et al., 2022). Therefore, filtering and 
denoising contribute to improving the quality of the signal and ensuring 
that the subsequent feature extraction process is effective.

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not directly discuss specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it mentions two important aspects related to data preparation: data denoising and data annotation. These steps can help improve the overall quality of the input data and ensure accurate labeling, which indirectly contributes to reducing potential biases in the dataset.

Data denoising involves removing unwanted signals or noise from the whale sound recordings, which could be caused by various environmental factors or human activities. By applying filtering and denoising techniques, the researchers aim to improve the signal quality and ensure that the subsequent feature extraction process is more reliable. Although this step doesn't specifically target data bias, it helps maintain the integrity of the original information contained within the audio samples.

On the other hand, data annotation refers to the process of manually assigning labels or tags to each audio clip based on its content. In this case, the authors might have labeled their datasets according to different categories, such as species identification, vocalization type, or behavioral context. Proper data annotation ensures that the model receives consistent and accurate feedback during the training phase, ultimately leading to better performance and reduced bias.

While these methods do not explicitly tackle data bias issues like those mentioned in the query, they play crucial roles in preparing high-quality datasets for deep learning applications. To further mitigate any potential biases, one could consider employing additional strategies such as stratified sampling, oversampling underrepresented classes, or collecting diverse data from multiple sources.
