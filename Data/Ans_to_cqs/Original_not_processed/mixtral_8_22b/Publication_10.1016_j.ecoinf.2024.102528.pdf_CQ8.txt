Continuous  bioacoustic  monitoring  is  an  emerging  opportunity  as  well  as  a  challenge,  allowing  detection  of 
cryptic species' activity while producing high computational demands. In this paper, we present an automated 
framework that allows the monitoring of a large number of bird species by their vocalizations over extended 
periods. The framework relies on the BirdNET-Analyzer deep learning model. We applied the framework to >80 
species; 20 species with the highest recall scores were selected for further analysis.

In this study we demonstrated the use of our monitoring pipeline for 
computing  long-term  activity  behavior  of  several  species  recorded 
continuously for over two years in the Agmon Hula Lake Park located in 
the Hula Valley, a major migratory flyway. We generated the Agmon 
annotated dataset to examine the BirdNET deep learning model. A total 
of 23 species with the highest precision/recall values were selected for 
further analysis. When using automated deep learning models such as 
BirdNET the confidence score can strongly affect the automated iden-
tification  process  (Cole  et  al.,  2022;  PÂ´erez-Granados,  2023).  We 
demonstrated that using BirdNET the relationships between the confi-
dence thresholds and the precision and recall values are species-specific. 
Accordingly,  we  used  species-specific  confidence  thresholds  which 
yielded detection scores that accounts for the precision-recall tradeoff.

In this paper, we present an automated framework that allows the 
monitoring of a large number of bird species by their vocalizations over 
extended periods and across various time scales. The framework relies 
on the BirdNET Analyzer deep learning model (BirdNET-Analyzer, n.d.),

Our  monitoring  framework  relies  mainly  on  BirdNET-Analyzer, 
version V2.2,  released in August  2022 (Kahl  et al., 2021), which  is a 
free  BirdNET  application  (Kahl  et  al.,  2021).  BirdNET-Analyzer  is  a 
convolutional  neural  network  with  ResNet  blocks  (He  et  al.,  2016) 
which has been trained to identify >3000 bird species. We used the pre- 
trained  model  with  the  default  sensitivity  (1.0)  and  both  pre-defined 
threshold  confidence  score  values  of  0.35,  0.25  and  0.15  for  the  top 
three identifications, and species specific thresholds (see below) when 
applying our pipeline to conduct long-term analysis. The species specific 
threshold was determined for filtering out false positives while preser-
ving the recall score separately for each species. We computed the recall 
and  precision  for  various  threshold  values  of  the  confidence  score 
(Malamut, 2022), from 0.0 (i.e. without a threshold) to 0.95, with a step 
of 0.05.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it mentions that the BirdNET-Analyzer version V2.2, released in August 2022, is a free BirdNET application. This suggests that the code might be publicly accessible, possibly through the official BirdNET website or its associated repositories. To find the exact location, one could search online for "BirdNET-Analyzer V2.2" or visit the BirdNET website directly.
