et al., 2021; Stowell et al., 2019). Some of the state-of-the-art techniques 
for  handling  big  datasets,  such  as  deep  learning  and  convolutional 
neural networks (Stowell, 2022; Stowell et al., 2019), can be difficult to 
run for ornithologists, managers, and researchers without bioacoustics 
or  engineering  backgrounds.  However,  user-friendly  and  ready-to-use 
machine  learning  approaches  have  recently  been  developed  and  are 
increasingly accessible to respond to real-life monitoring challenges and 
the general public (Cole et al., 2022). Among these approaches is Bird-
NET, a research project between The Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the 
Chemnitz University of Technology. BirdNET facilitates the automated 
detection and classification of bird vocalizations, through a developed 
deep neural network, from sound recordings (Kahl et al., 2021). Bird-
NET is able to identify over 3000 bird species (Wood et al., 2021) and is

technique. For example, Cole et al. (2022) recently evaluated BirdNET 
for detecting 13 bird species in North America and found that the recall 
rate  ranged  from  9%  to  68%.  Similarly,  the  recall  rate  obtained  by 
Tolkova et al. (2021) ranged between 11% and 71% for three common 
bird species. Previous research has claimed that the accuracy of BirdNET 
increases when analysing bird songs of species that BirdNET was more 
familiar with (Arif et al., 2020). The Eurasian bittern is a widespread 
species, with over 900 recordings uploaded to Xeno-canto database and 
the Macaulay library of sounds, which may have contributed to the high 
recall  obtained  when  using  BirdNET  with  that  target  species.  We  are 
aware that we did not verify BirdNET detection, and therefore cannot 
rule  out  some  false  positives  (mislabelled  vocalizations)  within  the 
BirdNET  output. However,  no BirdNET  detection occurred  within  the

as  the  validation  dataset  to  assess  the  performance  of  BirdNET  and 
Kaleidoscope  Pro.  The  software  performance  was  evaluated  by 
comparing the recall rate and the percentage of occurrences detected 
using each software when compared to the ones obtained in the vali-
dation dataset. The recall rate is an index commonly used in bioacoustics

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information on specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that BirdNET uses a deep neural network to analyze sound recordings and identify over 3000 bird species. It also refers to previous studies evaluating BirdNET's performance in detecting certain bird species, but it does not mention any specific datasets used in those studies. Therefore, based on the given context, there is no clear answer to what datasets were used in the deep learning pipeline.
