5.4. Limitations and future studies 

Due to the limitations of data sources and classification methods (Jia 
et al., 2023), this may largely affect the in-deep understanding of various 
mangrove species status in China and globally. In addition, although this 
study  discussed  the  effects  of  governmental  policies  on  long-term 
mangrove  evolution,  it  was  still  difficult  to  quantify  the  contribution 
rate of policies on mangrove conservation and restoration. Future dis-
cussion  and  in-deep  study  of  quantifiable  policy  factors  as  well  as 
improved  image  resolution  and  machine  learning  approaches  toward 
accurate identification of mangrove species will be great significance for 
dynamic monitoring and evaluation of mangrove interspecies evolution.

(2)  Training samples were created and landscape types were rapidly 
extracted. Google Earth Pro was used to randomly generate 1800 
sample points in the image of the study area for each year (300 
sample  points  for  each  land  cover  type).  These  sample  points 
were imported into the GEE application programming interface 
(API)  for  further  analysis.  The  samples  were  then  randomly 
divided into training and validation datasets at a 7:3 ratio. The 
random forest algorithm was applied to rapidly classify the land 
use types in the study area.  

(3)  Post-classification  processing  was  applied  to  the  images.  A 
manual  visual  interpretation  approach  was  used  to  correct  the 
image classification results for mangroves within a 10-km buffer 
zone extending inland from the coastline. This procedure effec-
tively corrected misclassifications between forest and mangroves 
resulting from “spectral confusion”.

where q is the spatial variance of a factor indicator (used in this study to 
detect the factor’s influence on mangrove forest area); N and Nj  are the 
sample sizes of the whole region and the jth (j = 1, 2, …, L) sub-region, 
respectively; and σ2  and σ2
j  are the variance of mangrove forest area in 
the  whole  region  and  jth  sub-region,  respectively.  The  q  value  ranges 
from  0  to  1,  where  higher  q  values  indicate  a  higher  proportion  of 
variance explained (Song et al., 2020).

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or any specific strategies related to managing random seed values. However, some common practices to manage randomness in deep learning pipelines include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, employing techniques like cross-validation, bootstrapping, or bagging to reduce overfitting, and using ensemble models to combine multiple predictions and improve overall performance.
