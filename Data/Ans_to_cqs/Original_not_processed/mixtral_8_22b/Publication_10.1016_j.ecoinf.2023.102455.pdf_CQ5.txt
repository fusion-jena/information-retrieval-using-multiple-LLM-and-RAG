The last step in configuring the model involves feeding in predictors 
that  the  advanced  deep  learning  algorithm  feeds  by  the  decomposed 
components  resulting  from  the  previous  steps.  The  primary  model  is 
CNN-BiGRU  with  three  comparative  ML  methods  (KELM,  RVFL  and 
CNN-BiRNN),  which  provide  four  complementary  models  including 
MVMD-CNN-BiGRU,  MVMD-RVFL,  MVMD-KELM  and  MVMD-CNN- 
BiRNN.  These  models  are  used  to  create  the  multi-temporal  fore-
casting model of daily streamflow (Qflow). Setting hyperparameters and 
their structural architecture is the most important aspect of executing 
ML-based  predictive  models  (Jamei  et  al.,  2023b).  Based  on  recent 
research, the main approaches to tuning parameters are algorithms of 
metaheuristic optimization, schemes of cross-validation schemes (Nes-
ted/rolling  basis  cross-validation)  (Huyghues-Beaufond  et  al.,  2020),

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given information, it is not possible to determine what specific datasets were used in the deep learning pipeline. The provided context only discusses various aspects of a CNN-BiGRU model, such as its layers, filters, optimizers, activation functions, epochs, batch sizes, learning rates, dense layers, number of nodes, regularization coefficients, weight random ranges, bias random ranges, and kernel parameters. However, there is no mention of any specific dataset being used for training or testing this model. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
