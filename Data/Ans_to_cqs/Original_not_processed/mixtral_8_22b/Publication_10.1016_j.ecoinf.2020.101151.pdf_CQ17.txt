The nine-cell approach, the results of which are shown in this paper, led
to slightly better prediction results of the variants, likely because it
smoothed existing data inaccuracies within single grid cells.

Helpful Answer:
Regularization is a technique used in machine learning and deep learning models to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. In the context of deep learning pipelines, two common regularization methods are Dropout and L2 Regularization.

Dropout is a regularization method where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to make the model more robust and prevents overfitting. The idea behind dropout is to reduce co-dependency between nodes in the network, making them learn independently from each other. During training, some percentage of input or hidden units are randomly dropped out, along with all their incoming and outgoing connections. This forces the network to distribute its weights across multiple paths, reducing the risk of overfitting.

L2 Regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights. By doing so, it encourages smaller weights, effectively limiting the complexity of the learned model and preventing overfitting. The strength of the regularization can be controlled using a hyperparameter called the regularization parameter, which determines how much emphasis should be placed on minimizing the size of the weights compared to minimizing the error.

In summary, Dropout and L2 Regularization are commonly used regularization techniques in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting. Dropout achieves this by ignoring random neurons during training, while L2 Regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function based on the size of the weights. Both methods help create simpler and more generalizable models.
