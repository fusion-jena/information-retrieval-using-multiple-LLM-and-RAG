as a sum of two terms: binary cross-entropy and Dice coefﬁcient-related loss of the three predicted
masks [50–52]. We used the optimizer RMSprop (unpublished, adaptive learning rate method proposed
by Geoff Hinton here http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~tijmen/csc321/slides/lecture_slides_lec6.pdf)
with an initial learning rate of 0.0001. We trained our network for 300 epochs with 24 images per batch.

3.5. Segmentation Accuracy Assessment

Two performance metrics were computed. First, the overall accuracy was computed as the
percentage of correctly classiﬁed pixels. Second, the F1 score was computed for each class i as the
harmonic average of the precision and recall (Equation (1)), where precision was the ratio of the
number of segments classiﬁed correctly as i to the number of all segments (true and false positive)
and recall was the ratio of the number of segments classiﬁed correctly as i to the total number of
segments belonging to class i (true positive and false negative). This score varies between 0 (lowest
value) and 1 (best value).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using two main metrics. The first metric is the overall accuracy, which is calculated as the percentage of correctly classified pixels. The second metric is the F1 score, which is computed for each class. The F1 score is the harmonic average of precision and recall, where precision is the ratio of the number of segments correctly classified as a particular class to the number of all segments (true and false positives), and recall is the ratio of the number of segments correctly classified as a particular class to the total number of segments belonging to that class (true positives and false negatives). The F1 score ranges from 0 (lowest value) to 1 (best value).
