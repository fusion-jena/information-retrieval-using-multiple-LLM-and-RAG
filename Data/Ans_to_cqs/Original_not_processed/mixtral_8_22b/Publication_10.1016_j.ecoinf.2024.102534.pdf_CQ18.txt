data  was  used  to  validate  model  predictions.  The  Area  Under  Curve 
(AUC)  evaluation  metric  and  True  Skill  Statistics  (TSS)  were  used  to 
assess  the  performance  of  model  predictions.  The  predictive  map  of 
current  and  future  areas  were  classified  into  unsuitable  (0–0.6)  and 
suitable  (0.6–1).  The  threshold  value  of  0.6  was  derived  from  equal 
training sensitivity and specificity. The suitable areas from the current 
prediction was compared to future predictions to estimate change over 
time. The predictive maps of four groups of orchids (lowland epiphyte, 
lowland  terrestrial,  upland  epiphyte,  upland  terrestrial)  during  three 
time periods (current, future (2100) using SSP 1–2.6, and future (2100) 
using SSP 5–8.5) were compared in order to identify the potential impact 
of  climate  change  and  land  cover  change  on  suitable  areas  for  each 
group. Predicted suitable areas and elevation ranges were used as spatial

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions that the Area Under Curve (AUC) evaluation metric and True Skill Statistics (TSS) were used to assess the performance of model predictions. This suggests that these metrics might have been employed to evaluate the model's performance during training. Additionally, the threshold value of 0.6 was derived from equal training sensitivity and specificity, which could indicate a method used to optimize the model's performance during training. Nevertheless, without more specific details regarding the training process, it is difficult to definitively state what strategy was implemented to monitor the model performance during training.
