Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

higher  MS is needed to better capture the index response to wildfire. 
Compared to the default parameters, the overall accuracy and kappa of 
optimized  parameters  can  improve  by  up  to  8.4%  and  36.8%, 
respectively.

Model Proportion for best fitting. Runge et al. (2022) optimized the LTR

climate and vegetation cover conditions. By selecting the most appro-
priate  index  for  a  given  region,  the  LTR  algorithm  can  provide  more 
accurate results that are meaningful in the context of the specific climate 
conditions of that region.

%Query
Query: "Which hardware resources are used for training the deep learning model (e.g., GPUs, TPUs)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not contain information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot determine which hardware resources were used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs.
