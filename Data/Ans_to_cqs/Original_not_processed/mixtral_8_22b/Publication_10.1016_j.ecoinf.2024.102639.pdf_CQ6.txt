predictions. In contrast, machine learning, particularly neural networks, 
and deep learning provides powerful tools for pattern recognition, albeit 
with  challenges  in  data  requirements  and  interpretability  (see  (Barak 
and  Tsodyks,  2023;  Kliegr  et  al.,  2020;  Kuru  et  al.,  2023;  Tron  and 
Margaliot, 2004; Vos et al., 2006)). By adopting an integrative approach, 
we not only maintain the interpretability of traditional models but also 
benefit from the predictive capabilities of machine learning, advancing 
our ability to predict behavioral outcomes in a wide range of scenarios. 
This methodology propels our investigation forward, opening new av-
enues  for  anticipating  animal  behavior  in  various  conditions  and 
emphasizing the controlled settings of T-maze experiments.

In animal behavior studies, the integration of Machine Learning (ML) 
and  Deep  Learning  (DL)  methodologies  represents  a  significant  para-
digm  shift.  Traditionally,  these  advanced  computational  techniques, 
renowned for their predictive accuracy in fields such as artificial intel-
ligence  (Marar,  2024),  image  processing  (Zhang  et  al.,  2015),  neuro-
science (Dixon and Polson, 2020), and genomics (Xiao and Segal, 2009), 
have not been extensively harnessed for modeling or predicting animal 
movement. Such approaches extend the application of these technolo-
gies beyond their conventional domains and aim to transcend the mere 
prediction  of  behavior.  The  objective  is  to  craft  a  methodology  that 
utilizes machine learning to forecast behavioral patterns and intricately 
map animals’ actual movement trajectories.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it mentions some preprocessing steps related to Support Vector Machines (SVM). These include selecting a distance metric, which is often Euclidean, based on the data's characteristics and specific analytical prerequisites. It also involves dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to retain most of the original data's variance. This step is crucial to prevent overfitting and improve the model's performance. Additionally, the text discusses the use of grid search and cross-validation to tune the regularization parameter ('C') and the kernel type (linear) for the SVM model. While these steps are specific to SVM, they can be applied to other machine learning algorithms, including deep learning models. Preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, and cleaning are common practices in preparing datasets for any machine learning algorithm, including deep learning models. Normalization scales numeric columns to a similar range, while scaling transforms features to have zero mean and unit variance. Cleaning involves handling missing values, outliers, and irrelevant data points. Although the text does not explicitly mention these steps, they are essential for improving the model's performance and should be considered when preparing datasets for deep learning models.
