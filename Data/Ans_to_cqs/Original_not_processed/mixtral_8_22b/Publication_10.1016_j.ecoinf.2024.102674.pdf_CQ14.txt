over five decays (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1) and sizes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). We fitted 
RFs using the RANDOMFOREST R package (Liaw and Wiener, 2002) with 500 
trees, five as the minimum size of terminal nodes, and by sampling all 
descriptors for splitting at each node; these RFs were thus equivalent to 
bagged decision trees. Finally, we fitted GBMs via the  GBM  R package 
(Greenwell et al., 2020) by ensembling a maximum of 10,000 trees, with 
shrinkage and interaction parameters equal to 0.01 and 1, respectively; 
each  tree  was  thus  equivalent  to  a  decision  stump.  After  model  cali-
bration, we identified the most relevant physiographic descriptors for 
each algorithm and each month. For GAMs, we evaluated the predictors’ 
relative importance by considering their F statistics. We assessed vari-
able importance in ANNs by employing the Olden method (Olden et al., 
2004)  implemented  in  the  NEURALNETTOOLS  R  package  (Beck,  2018).

in Appendices). Like KGE scores, MAE and RMSE increased for all the 
algorithms during the hot season, although both metrics showed limited 
variability  (0.4–1.3 
C;  Fig.  A.10c  and  Fig.  A.10d  in  Appendices). 
Percent biases were always remarkably close to zero, with little differ-
ences between algorithms (Fig. A.10b in Appendices). Altitude was the 
most relevant physiographic descriptor; however, in all algorithms but 
ANN, its relative importance decreased during the hot season. In these 
same  months,  the  relative  importance  of  the  remaining  descriptors 
generally increased (Fig. A.11 in Appendices).

The  growing  availability  of  macroclimate  grids  is  also  coming  in 
handy.  These  products  provide  information  about  free-air  macro-
climates  concerning  large  shares  of  the  Earth’s  surface  and  are 
commonly used to model species distributions over large spatial extents 
(Elith  and  Leathwick,  2009).  Unfortunately,  macroclimate  grids  are 
usually  too  coarse  to  capture  the  range  of  microclimates  available  at 
smaller scales (Potter et al., 2013). Thus, macroclimate grids might need 
to be downscaled to the appropriate spatial scales before they can be 
effectively used (Lenoir et al., 2017). High-resolution free-air tempera-
ture  products  are  routinely  obtained  by  linking  macroclimates  to  the 
physiographic descriptors that drive local climatic conditions (McCul-
lough et al., 2016). Then, after modeling the offset between local cli-
mates and microclimates (Lenoir et al., 2017; Maclean et al., 2019) or

Helpful Answer: The text does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the models were optimized. However, it provides some details on the specific values chosen for certain hyperparameters. For instance, Random Forests were trained using 500 trees, with a minimum size of terminal nodes set to five, and all descriptors were sampled for splitting at each node. Gradient Boosting Machines were trained by ensembling a maximum of 10,000 trees, with shrinkage and interaction parameters set to 0.01 and 1, respectively. It appears that these hyperparameter choices were made based on the authors' experience and knowledge rather than through a systematic optimization process like grid search or random search.
