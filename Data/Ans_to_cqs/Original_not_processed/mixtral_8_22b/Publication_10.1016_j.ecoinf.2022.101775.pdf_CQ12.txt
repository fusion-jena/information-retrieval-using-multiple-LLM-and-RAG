2.2. Embedding layers 

(5)  

Embedding  layers  are  modules  of  deep  neural  networks  that  are 
generally  implemented  in  natural  language  processing  problems 
(Sharma  et  al.,  2020)  and  collaborative  filtering  (He  et  al.,  2017) 
because they can solve the one-hot encoding problem (Yu et al., 2022), 
where the latent representations in the classic models are composed of 
sparse representations generally using vectors mainly composed of zero 
layers  replace  such  dispersed  vectors  with 
values.  Embedding

where W denotes the matrix of weights in each layer; bi, the bias vector; 
g(.),  the  sigmoid  activation  function;  Θ(j),  the  hyperparameters  of  the

Lastly, according to (Fan and Cheng, 2018), the model presented in 
Eq.(13) is finally known as DMF. In this case, it will be called DMF1 and 
used to reconstruct the non-observed representations n in matrix M. 

2.4. Variations of the proposed DMF model 

This  section  presents  the  design  of  three  DMF  models  that  can 
complement the DMF1 model (see Fig. 2) by including spatial-temporal 
features,  which  vary  the  dimension  d  of  the  embedding  layers  in 
accordance with the information to be represented. In this sense, the aim 
of this proposal is to consolidate an approach to reconstruct signals that

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not explicitly mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, there are some clues that suggest the use of certain types of models. For instance, the paper by Sharma et al. (2020) mentions the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) deep learning model for sentiment analysis of short sentences. Additionally, the paper by He et al. (2017) discusses the use of embedding layers in collaborative filtering, which could imply the use of a feedforward neural network or a recurrent neural network (RNN). The paper also mentions the use of stochastic gradient descent for optimizing the regularized cost function, which is commonly used in training deep learning models. Therefore, based on these clues, we can infer that the pipeline may involve the use of either a CNN, RNN, or a feedforward neural network. However, without more explicit information about the architecture of the model being used, it is difficult to determine the exact type of deep learning model employed in the pipeline.
