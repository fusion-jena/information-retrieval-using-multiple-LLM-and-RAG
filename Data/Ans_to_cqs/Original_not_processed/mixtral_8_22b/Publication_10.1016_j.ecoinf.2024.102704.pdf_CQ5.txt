several  times  higher  than  those  of  other  operations  (Li  et  al.,  2018). 
Therefore,  reducing  memory  access  is  the  key  to  further  enhancing 
model  performance.  By  reconfiguring  the  computation  sequence  of 
‘convolutional layer + batch normalisation + activation layer on NVI-
DIA TESLA V100 GPUs, Wang et al. (2019) reduced memory access by 
33%,  22%,  and  31%  for  the  ResNet-50,  Inception  V3,  and  DenseNet 
models,  respectively,  leading  to  increases  in  the  computational  effi-
ciency  of  20.5%,  18.5%,  and  18.1%.  Lowering  the  memory  access  in 
models can accelerate operations across the three main layers of CNNs, 
thus fully harnessing the model's strengths and more effectively utilising 
the computational resources provided by the embedded devices (Gilan 
et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2015). Therefore, by reducing the number of 
layers  in  the  network  model,  the  number  of  convolutions  and  data

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipelines mentioned. However, it mentions a targeted fish species dataset that was divided into training and validation sets in an 8:2 ratio using a random selection process. It also references papers that discuss various aspects of deep learning, such as high-resolution monitoring of fish length and catch numbers from landings using deep learning, a deep learning approach to photo-identification for multiple cetacean species, and a fish detection method based on multi-enhancement and output fusion of fuzzy underwater images. These studies may have utilized different datasets relevant to their respective research topics. Unfortunately, without explicit mention of the datasets used in these deep learning pipelines, we cannot definitively state which ones were employed.
