SPEI time scale corresponding to the highest probability was identified 
as  that  month's  representative  drought  propagation  time.  With  this 
method,  it  is  possible  to  calculate  the  propagation  time  for  different 
drought propagation scenarios occurring in different months and obtain 
the probability of this drought propagation occurring. 

The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a feed-forward neural 
network primarily used to process gridded data of a fixed size. Its main 
advantage  is  the  ability  to  automatically  learn  spatial  hierarchies, 
making it highly suitable for processing data such as images, sounds, and 
time series. In this study, CNN is utilized to fit linear and nonlinear re-
lationships  between  independent  and  dependent  variables  and  in-
teractions  between  independent  variables(Gu  et  al.,  2018).  The  core 
formula of CNN is as follows:

(f*g)(i, j) =

to  the  size  and  number  of  convolution  kernels  and  hyperparameters, 
such  as  the  learning  rate.  Introducing  the  hybrid  model  not  only  en-
hances  the  processing  power  of  the  model  but  also  makes  the  model 
more robust and better able to deal with the complexity of the drought 
propagation time and the relationship between the influencing factors. 
Notably,  after  embedding  LSTM  into  the  CNN,  even  without  any  ad-
justments to the hyperparameters, the model's prediction accuracy on 
the  testing  set  has  already  improved  by  about  20%  compared  to  the 
original CNN.

improves  upon  the  limitations  of  traditional  methods  in  representing 
non-linear processes and also incorporates thresholds in drought indices 
to differentiate the levels of drought severity. A hybrid model is con-
structed  by  integrating  Convolutional  Neural  Networks  (CNN)  with 
Long Short-Term  Memory networks (LSTM) to effectively capture the 
intricate process of drought propagation (Ghimire et al., 2021; Khorram 
and Jehbez, 2023). CNNs are effective at modeling the linear and non- 
linear relationships between influencing factors and drought propaga-
tion time and the interactions among influencing factors. Meanwhile, 
LSTMs  are  used  to  learn  the  time  lags  in  the  responses  of  drought 
propagation time to various influencing factors.(Ghimire et al., 2021; 
Qu  et  al.,  2021).  The  hybrid  model,  constructed  by  integrating  both 
elements, can handle the complex process of drought propagation. This

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, there isn't specific information regarding the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, or others. However, the text does mention adjusting hyperparameters, which could include learning rates, batch sizes, and other parameters related to optimization algorithms. It also mentions using Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM) alongside Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), indicating potential use of backpropagation through time (BPTT) for training recurrent neural networks like LSTM. Nonetheless, without explicit details on the optimization techniques employed, we cannot provide a definitive answer.
