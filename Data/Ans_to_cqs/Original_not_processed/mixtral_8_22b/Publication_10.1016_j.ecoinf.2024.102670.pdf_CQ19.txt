An  issue  with  deep  learning  methods  is  that  it  can  be  difficult  to 
obtain enough ground truth data. Sharma et al. (2017) utilized crowd-
sourcing, involving non-expert users for obtaining manual annotation, 
and demonstrated the efficacy of their method on karyotyping images of 
chromosomes.

ingful outputs. In Fig. 15a, we apply a window with a size corresponding 
to 0.29mm2. Given a set of thin binary filaments, each with a unique ID, 
eq. (1) can be applied to each filament to get its length (Fig. 15b). To 
visualize the network structure, we can consider two diverse represen-
tations (Fig. 15c &  15d). In Fig. 15c, the separated hyphae have been

This study proposes an end-to-end solution for the automated anal-
ysis of key features in filamentous organisms, such as filament length 
and  network  topology.  The  focus  is  on  the  Rhizophagus  irregularis,  a 
model  fungus  known  for  establishing  symbiotic  relationships  with 
numerous crop plants. Our objective is to provide automated analysis 
tools to spark light on the morphological characteristics and dynamics of 
this organism.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not explicitly mention which specific framework was used to build the deep learning model. However, one reference mentioned is Lasser, J., Katifori, E., Dec. 2017. NET: a new framework for the vectorization and examination of network data. This suggests that the authors may have developed or used a custom framework called 'NET'. Unfortunately, without further information, I cannot confirm if this framework is based on popular deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
