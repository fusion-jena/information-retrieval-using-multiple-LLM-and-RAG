The prediction power with machine learning algorithms was tested 
with the package “sdm”  (Naimi and Araújo, 2016), “dismo”  (Hijmans 
et al., 2015), “bioclim” (Booth et al., 2014), and the ensemble modeling 
approach  implemented  in  “biomod2”  (Thuiller  et  al.,  2009;  2014). 
Model mean performances for AUC, ROC, TSS, KAPPA, and COR values 
were extracted using “shiny” packages (Chang et al., 2023) in RStudio 
(RStudio Team, 2020).

2.6. Model selection 

Since  performance,  accuracy,  key  parameters,  and  sensitivity  for 
prediction vary depending on which method that is used (Diniz-Filho 
et al., 2009; Elith et al., 2006; Qiao et al., 2015), we tested eight different 
machine  learning  algorithms  to  generate  our  predictive  models.  The 
included  algorithms  were:  Generalized  Linear  Model  (GLM),  Support 
Vector  Machine  (SVM),  Multivariate  Adaptive  Regression  Spline 
(MARS),  Random  Forest  (RF),  Flexible  Discriminant  Analysis  (FDA), 
Classification  and  Regression  Trees  (CART),  Generalized  Boosting 
regression Model (GBM) and Maximum-Entropy learning (MAXENT) for 
habitat suitability prediction (Table S5).

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be applied to improve its performance. These may include data cleaning, where missing or irrelevant data is removed or replaced. Normalization and scaling techniques such as min-max scaling or z-score standardization can also be employed to ensure all input features have similar scales, preventing any single feature from dominating the others during training. Additionally, encoding categorical variables into numerical form might be necessary if they cannot be directly fed into the model. Lastly, splitting the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets allows for better evaluation of the model's generalization capabilities. However, it should be noted that these specific preprocessing steps are not explicitly mentioned within the given context.
