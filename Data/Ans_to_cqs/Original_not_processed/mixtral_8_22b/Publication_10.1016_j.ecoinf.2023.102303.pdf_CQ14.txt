Gradient boosting refers to a class of ensemble Decision Tree (DT) 
algorithms  that  can  be  used  in  classification,  regression,  and  ranking 
applications (Badirli et al., 2020). However, gradient boosting leaves the 
width and depth dimensions of its DTs, along with the number of DTs in 
the ensemble adjustable. This leads to a vast number of hyperparameters 
that cannot be easily optimized for a given application. In this regard, 
XGBoost  was originally introduced  by Chu (2023) as an efficient and 
distributed gradient boosting algorithm with rapidly optimized hyper-
parameters.  XGBoost  outperforms  individual  DNN  models  when  it 
makes  the  final  decision  in  their  ensemble  (Shwartz-Ziv  and  Armon, 
2022).  It  is  therefore  beneficial  to  use  an  ensemble  of  DNNs  with 
XGBoost, which can perform better than any individual model, as well as 
other classical ensemble techniques (Shwartz-Ziv and Armon, 2022).

We show that our XGBoost ensemble model outperforms other recent 
publications in the literature (Soom et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2022; Yu 
et al., 2023). This ensemble model shows very high True Positive Rate 
(TPR) and True Negative Rate (TNR) of 0.88 and 0.99, while providing 
low False Negative Rate (FNR) and False Positive Rate (FPR) of 0.11 and 
0.01. In this regard, TPR (i.e., sensitivity, recall, or hit rate) refers to the 
fraction of video frames with fish prediction, conditioned on fish being

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide specific information about how the hyperparameters of the XGBoost ensemble model were optimized. However, it mentions that XGBoost was introduced as an efficient and distributed gradient boosting algorithm with rapidly optimized hyperparameters. This suggests that some form of optimization technique was employed, but without further details, we cannot determine whether it was grid search, random search, or another method.

Based on general knowledge, common methods for optimizing hyperparameters include grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and evolutionary algorithms. Grid search involves testing all possible combinations of hyperparameter values within a predefined range, while random search randomly samples from the same space. Bayesian optimization uses probabilistic models to guide the search process, and evolutionary algorithms employ principles inspired by natural selection to evolve optimal solutions over time. Without more specific information, it is impossible to identify the exact method used for optimizing the hyperparameters of the XGBoost ensemble model described in the text.
