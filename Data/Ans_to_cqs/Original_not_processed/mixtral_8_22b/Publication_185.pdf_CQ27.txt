Image  classification  on  the  CNN  architecture  known  as  AlexNet  was  proposed  by  Alex 
Krizhevsky and won the 2012 ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (Krizhevsky 
et al., 2012). There are eight layers in the network, containing five convolutional layers and three 
fully connected layers (Fig. 3). All feature extractors were initialized with white Gaussian noise 
and learned from data, and the resulting feature maps were passed through rectified linear units 
(ReLUs),  a  type  of  non-linearity  unit.  The  model  was  trained  using  stochastic  gradient  descent 
and  the  backpropagation  algorithm  included  in  Caffe  (Jia  et  al.,  2014),  with  the  learning  rate 
policy set to “step”. The learning rate set to 10-2 for all layers initially for the reason of accept the 
newly  defined  last  fully  connected  layer  set  to  10-2.  The  learning  rate  (lr)  was  decreased  by  a

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide a detailed response about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, based on common practices in machine learning projects, once the model has been successfully trained and validated, it would typically be saved or serialized into a format that allows it to be used later for predictions. This might involve saving the model weights or creating a complete model file that includes both the architecture and the weights.

As for platform selection, this depends on various factors such as the intended application, resources availability, and performance requirements. Common platforms include cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure, or local servers depending on the specific needs of the project.

However, since these details aren't explicitly mentioned in the given context, I cannot provide a more precise answer regarding the exact process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
