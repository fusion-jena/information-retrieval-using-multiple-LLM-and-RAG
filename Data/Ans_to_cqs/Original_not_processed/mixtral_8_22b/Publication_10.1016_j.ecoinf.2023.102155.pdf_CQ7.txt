Following  the  tools  we  previously  developed  in  Guilbault  et  al. 
(2021),  we  present  in  this  paper  extensions  that  accommodate  for 
necessary practical model accomodation: bias correction and lasso-type 
penalties. Observer bias correction allows for one to overcome prefer-
ential sampling that arise from opportunistic surveys. Lasso control for 
model complexity and multicollinearity which is particuarly useful with 
low sample size. First, we compare via simulations different measures of 
performance in classification and predicted distribution for the new al-
gorithms  based  on  mixture  modelling  (EM  algorithm)  and  machine 
learning (semi supervised learning) developed to the simple approach of 
fitting  individual  PPMs  to  the  points  with  known  species  labels  only, 
while also incorporating lasso penalization and bias correction. We test 
their performances in the context of low species abundance, the pres-

Figs.  3  to  6  show  the  predicted  intensity  maps  with  80%  hidden 
observations for the different combinations of lasso regularization and 
bias correction. The results for 20% and 50% hidden observations are 
shown in Appendix A.1.2. The following intensity prediction maps do 
not  display  all  methods  tested  previously.  We  focus  on  the  best  per-
forming methods across the performance measures (knn, LoopT) as well

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, common practices include splitting the dataset into three subsets: a training set, a validation set, and a testing set. The training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting during the training process. Finally, the testing set is used to evaluate the final model's performance after it has been trained and validated. The proportions of these splits can vary depending on the specific application or dataset, but a common choice is 60% for training, 20% for validation, and 20% for testing.
