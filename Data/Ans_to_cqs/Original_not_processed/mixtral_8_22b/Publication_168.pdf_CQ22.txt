On the other hand, since the powerful feature extraction 
capabilities, the deep learning methods have succeed in many 
fields,  such  as  computer  vision  and  natural  language 
processing. In recently, the deep learning based methods have 
also  been  used  to  solve  the  HSI  classification  task  and 
achieved remarkable achievements. Among the deep learning 
methods,  the  Convolutional  Neural  Networks  (CNNs)  are 
most widely explored to solve the HSI classification task. Hu 
et  al.  [4]  designed  a  one-dimensional  convolutional  neural 
network(1-D-CNN) for classification according to the spectral 
feature  of  HSI.  Due  to  the  insufficient  training  data,  the 
designed  1-D-CNN  just  includes  a  convolution  operation,  a 
pooling operation and a fully connected operation. Although 
the structure of  designed 1-D-CNN is simple, it achieved a 
satisfactory  classification  performance.  The  classification

SSPCNN  produced  competitive  performance  compared  with 
other methods.

Helpful Answer:

In this study, three metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models: average accuracy (AA), overall accuracy (OA), and kappa coefficient (K). OA represents the proportion of correctly predicted samples in the total samples, while AA represents the average of each category classification accuracies. The kappa coefficient is used to measure the consistency of the classification accuracy. It is a consistency test metric. These metrics are applied to compare the performance of different deep learning methods, including SVM, 1-D-CNN, and 2-D-CNN, which are used as contrastive algorithms. The experimental results are reported in Table II, where the classification accuracies of these methods are presented for nine classes.
