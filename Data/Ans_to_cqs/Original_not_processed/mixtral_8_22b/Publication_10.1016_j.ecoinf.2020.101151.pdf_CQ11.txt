Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

2.5. Vegetation

for the FWI and FFMC data layers with a spatial resolution of 1 × 1 km.
The nine-cell approach, the results of which are shown in this paper, led
to slightly better prediction results of the variants, likely because it
smoothed existing data inaccuracies within single grid cells.

Fig. 2. Screenshot of the Web-GIS application. The colored map represents the FFMC danger classes for August 26, 2019 in the north of Austria. Green colored fields
mean a “very low” (1) fire danger, yellow “low” (2) and orange “moderate” (3). (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is
referred to the web version of this article.)

and the FFMC was the underlying index in 2019. All cells with a danger
class of 3 to 5 were evaluated as false alerts. Data grid cells above
timberline and in non-burnable areas were excluded from this in-
vestigation.

We applied Pearson's chi square tests to test for significant differ-
ences in the performance of the FWI, the FFMC and the variants of the
IFDS. We applied linear regressions to analyze the relationship between
