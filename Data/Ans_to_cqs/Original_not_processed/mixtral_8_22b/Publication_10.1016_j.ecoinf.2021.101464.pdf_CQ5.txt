Future research should consider the changes of predictors at different 
spatial and temporal scales in order to better evaluate the explanatory 
power  of  independent  variables  in  different  climate  regions.  Such 
knowledge could then be applied to other climate region types to un-
derstand the importance level of climate region differences to selected 
variables and the overall prediction ability of the model. In addition, the 
observation  index  can  be  increased,  the  observation  time  can  be 
extended, and the joint observation of multi-region and multi-tree spe-
cies can be strengthened. Big data theory and technology, neural net-
works, structural equations, and other deep-level data mining methods 
are applied to understand the importance level of climate differences on 
selected variables and the overall prediction ability of relevant models, 
so as to comprehensively and systematically understand the influence of 
forest microclimate on NAI.

temperature and humidity sensor model were HMP155 (Vaisala. Inc., 
Finland), with a temperature measurement range of (cid:0) 80–60 m/s, and 
humidity measurement range of 0–100%; the wind speed sensor was a 
WindSonic anemometer (Gill. Inc., UK), with a measurement range of 
0–60  m/s;  the  atmospheric  pressure  sensor  model  was  AV-410BP 
(Avalon  Inc., USA),  with a  measurement  range of 600–1100  hPa; the 
photosynthetically  active  radiation  sensor  model  was  LI-190SB  (Licor 
Inc., USA), with a measurement range of 400–700 nm; the direct radi-
ation sensor model was LI-200× (Licor Inc., USA), with a measurement 
range of 400–1100 nm; the ultraviolet radiation sensor model was CUV5 
(Kipp zonen Inc., Netherlands), with a measurement range of 210–380 
nm;  the  net  radiation  sensor  model  was  CNR4  (Kipp  zonen  Inc., 
Netherlands), with a measurement range of 300–2800 nm; the partic-
ulate matter 2.5 sensor model was RR-9421 (Rainroot Inc., China), with

random  forest  model  were  applied  using  R  statistical  software  (Team 
RDC, 2010).

Helpful Answer:
The given text does not provide information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it mentions that big data theory and technology, neural networks, and other deep-level data mining methods have been applied to understand the impact of climate differences on selected variables and the overall prediction ability of relevant models. This suggests that some form of large dataset is being utilized for this analysis. Additionally, the use of random forest models implemented through R statistical software indicates that machine learning techniques are employed in the study. Unfortunately, without further details regarding the nature of these datasets, I cannot provide more specific information about their content or origin.
