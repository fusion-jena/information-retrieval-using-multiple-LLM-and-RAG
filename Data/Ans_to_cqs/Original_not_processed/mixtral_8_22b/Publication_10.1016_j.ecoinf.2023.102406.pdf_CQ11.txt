Tree species encompassed 80 tree species, which at least occurred in 
Mexico but were not endemic, and abundantly surveyed with 1000 to 
5000  observations  in  the  study  extent  of  North  America.  The  Global 
Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF; Global Biodiversity Information 
Facility, 2023) is a centralized data repository containing 65,000 data-
sets  of  2  billion  species  observations.  I  filtered  tree  species  that  were 
observed  since  1990  in  North  America  with  coordinate  uncertainty 
<1000  m  (GBIF  occurrence  download  https://doi.org/10.15468/ 
dl.22w5sf  on  17  March  2023).  For  pseudoabsences,  I  used  an  equal 
number  of  random  points  from  the  study  extent,  or  background.  I 
extracted climate variables for the occurrences and background absence 
points. Additionally, I also thinned the samples to a maximum of one 
sample  per  grid  cell  within  the  climate  raster  layers,  with  an  equal

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The data repository link mentioned in the given context is the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). However, it does not provide a direct link to a specific dataset or deep learning pipeline. Instead, it provides access to various datasets related to biodiversity information. To find relevant datasets, users can search for specific keywords or browse through different categories on the GBIF website. The URL for the GBIF website is <https://www.gbif.org>.
