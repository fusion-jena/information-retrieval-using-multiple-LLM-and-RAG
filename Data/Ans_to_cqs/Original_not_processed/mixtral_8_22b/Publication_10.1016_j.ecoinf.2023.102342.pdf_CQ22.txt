objective has been achieved, and if the answer is no, it proceeds with 
the reiteration (and possible modification) of the previous step and 
sometimes further steps.

The  numerical  values  of  some  parameters  (Tan  et  al.,  2019)  were 
calculated and provided as measures of the association values to explain 
the data mining results. The support parameter measures the abundance 
or  frequency  (often  interpreted  as  important)  of  a  set  of  items  in  a 
database. The value of the support parameter is given by the ratio be-
tween  the  number  of  times  an  item  appears  and  the  total  number  of 
items. We refer to a set of molecules as a “set of frequent molecules” if 
support  exceeds  a  specified  minimum  threshold  we  can  identify.  In 
general, the threshold depends on the size of the dataset.

The  support  metric  is  defined  for  itemsets  and  not  for  association 
rules. When applied to marketing strategies, the table produced by the 
association  rule  mining  algorithm  contains  different  support  metrics: 
antecedent  support,  consequent  support,  and  support.  In  marketing  anal-
ysis,  antecedent  support  calculates  the  percentage  of  transactions  that 
contain  the  element  defined  as  the  antecedent  (which  comes  before), 
and  consequent  support  calculates  the  transactions  that  contain  the

Helpful Answer:
Based on the provided context, there is no information about the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. However, common metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and Area Under Curve (AUC). Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of all predictions made. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made. Recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positives. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single measure of performance. The AUC represents the degree or measure of separability between classes. These metrics are often used in conjunction with one another to provide a comprehensive evaluation of a deep learning model's performance.
