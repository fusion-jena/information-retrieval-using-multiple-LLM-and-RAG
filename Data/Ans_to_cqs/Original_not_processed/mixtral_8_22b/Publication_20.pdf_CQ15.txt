A link to a depository with architecture details is given at the end of
references. We stopped the network training after 70 epochs (i.e. a
complete scope of the dataset where each image is used only once), to
−5, an exponential
prevent overﬁtting. We used a learning rate of 10
learning decay with a Gamma of 0.95, a dropout of 50% and an Adam
Solver type as learning parameters. Those are classic hyper-parameters
for a fast convergence of the network without over-ﬁtting (Srivastava
et al., 2014). The weight initialization is also classic with a random
Gaussian initialization. The training lasted 8 days on our conﬁguration;
we trained and ran our code on a computer with 64GB of RAM, an i7
3.50GHz CPU and a Titan X GPU card for 900,000 images.

We used at least 2200 thumbnails per ﬁsh species class, and batches

We used a GoogLeNet architecture as it was the winner of the 2015
competition imageNet (Szegedy et al., 2015), an identiﬁcation chal-
lenge on 1000 diﬀerent classes. This CNN is composed of 22 layers. It
uses inception modules. Inception modules allow the network to use
convolutions of diﬀerent sizes (1*1, 3*3 and 5*5 pixels) and to weight
each of these convolutions. This network could thus account more or
less strongly for the context of each pixel, which increases the range of
possibilities to improve its performance during the training.

We obtained a test dataset of 4405 annotated ﬁsh thumbnails be-
longing to 18 out of the 20 species present in the training dataset (Table
S3). We then randomly selected a subset of 1197 ﬁsh thumbnails be-
longing to 9 species to compare the performance of humans vs. ob-
tained models (Table S3).

2.2. Deep-learning algorithm

We used a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to build
a ﬁsh identiﬁcation model (Schmidhuber, 2015). CNNs are a class of
deep learning algorithms used to analyze data and particularly to
classify objects from images (Krizhevsky et al., 2012).

CNNs are made of layers of interconnected neurons and each neuron
includes a ‘convolutional kernel’ that computes a set of mathematical
operations (deﬁned by ‘weights’) on the matrices of values describing
the image (i.e. values for each color channel for each pixel).

Helpful Answer:
The authors used an Adam Solver type as their learning parameter. They also employed an exponential learning decay with a gamma of 0.95 and a dropout of 50%. These are considered classic hyperparameters for achieving fast convergence of the network without overfitting. Additionally, they mention using a random Gaussian initialization for weights. However, no specific information about the optimizer used within the Adam solver is mentioned.
