Where  q  is  the  factor's  influencing  power  (q∈[0,1]),  N  and  Nh 
represent the numbers of sample units in the whole area and sub-area, 
respectively, and h = 1, 2…. L, σ2, and σh  are the sum number of sec-
ondary regions, the sum variance over the region, and the sum of the

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about any specific deep learning model or its development process. Therefore, it is not possible to determine what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of such a model based solely on this context. However, some common techniques used to improve the generalization performance of machine learning models include using diverse datasets, cross-validation, stratified sampling, regularization, early stopping, and ensemble methods. These techniques help prevent overfitting and allow the model to perform well on unseen data.
