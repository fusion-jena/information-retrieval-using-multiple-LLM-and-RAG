solar  radiation  reflected  by  the  Earth  in  21  spectral  bands  at  spatial 
resolution of 300 m. It is important to note that this work focuses on 
these Sentinel-3-related products as they offer daily data from the same 
world  region  around  the  same  hour  (see  Table  2)  and  having  a  high 
temporal  resolution  is  essential  for  the  development  of  a  monitoring
