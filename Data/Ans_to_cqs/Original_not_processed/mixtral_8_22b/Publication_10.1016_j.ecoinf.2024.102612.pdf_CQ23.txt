3.2. Fuel model retrieval 

Once the DL model is trained, a few samples of real MS point clouds 
are segmented using the methodology exposed in Section 2.3 to create a 
ground truth. This ground truth was required to validate the classifica-
tions using a DL model trained with synthetic data. As mentioned in the 
previous section, the best classification performance of the SoftGroup 
semantic branch was achieved by the MS input data case; therefore, this 
pretrained  model was  used,  and  its  efficiency was  tested  by  inferring 
these real MS point clouds (Fig. 9). In addition, these inferences on real 
MS point clouds are taken as inputs for the decision tree scheme pre-
sented in Section 2.5, where the final fuel models are retrieved. The final 
fuel model classifications are summarised in Table 3.

and  Mean  IoU  (MIoU).  Notably,  in  addition  to  the  comprehensive 
evaluation  provided  by  the  Overall  Accuracy  and  IoU,  their  mean 
counterparts  (MA  and  MIoU)  consider  the  individual  values  for  each 
class within the dataset and compute their average. This approach en-
hances the reliability of the classification results for imbalanced data. 
Furthermore, the highest MIoU value was employed to determine the 
point at which the DNN attained optimal performance. 

Finally, the selected SoftGroup architecture was trained over 1000 
epochs for each type of input data, and metrics such as MIoU or MA were 
computed after each epoch to analyse the training performance. Once 
trained, the configuration weights that achieved the best classification 
performance were selected to establish the reference trained model and, 
finally, it was used to perform predictions on the real MS point clouds 
collected in Section 2.3, i.e. the ground truth data.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, a diverse dataset was created using synthetic data to train the model. This allowed the model to learn from a wide range of scenarios, improving its ability to handle real-world data. Secondly, the model was validated using a ground truth created from real multi-spectral (MS) point clouds. This validation process helped assess the model's performance when applied to actual data. Lastly, the SoftGroup architecture was trained over 1000 epochs for each type of input data, and metrics like Mean Intersection over Union (MIoU) or Mean Accuracy (MA) were computed after each epoch. This analysis of training performance enabled the selection of the configuration weights that achieved the best classification performance. These weights were then used to establish the reference trained model, which was subsequently used to perform predictions on the real MS point clouds collected earlier.
