Its  data  sources  mainly  include  the  following:  (1)  The  nighttime 
lighting data is extended NPP-VIIRS-like NTL Data for 2000–2021. The 
dataset  is  available  for  free  download  at  the  National  Earth  System 
Science Data Centre (National Earth System Science Data Center, n.d.). 
(2) Provincial statistical energy data for 2000–2021 are obtained from 
the China Statistical Yearbook (China Statistical Press, n.d.), municipal 
statistical data are obtained from the Xi'an Statistical Yearbook (Xi'an 
Municipal  Bureau  of  Statistics,  n.d.),  and  carbon  emission  factors  for 
various energy sources are obtained from the “2019 Refinement to the 
2006  IPCC  Guidelines  for  National  Greenhouse  Gas  Inventory”.  (3) 
Administrative  boundary  data  for  Xi'an  (district,  county,  and  street 
administrative  boundaries)  were  provided  by  the  National  Basic 
Geographic Information System (National Basic Geographic Information

(2000(cid:0) 2012) and synthetic annual NPP-VIIRS NTL data (2013(cid:0) 2021) 
(Chen  et  al.,  2021b).  The  spatial  resolution  of  these  data  is  500  m, 
allowing  for  an  accurate  representation  of  the  temporal  changes  in 
population and light intensity at various scales. NPP-VIIRS-like NTL data 
have better quality, overcoming issues such as image oversaturation and 
overflow  compared  to  the  previous  DMSP-OLS-like  NTL  data  (Chen 
et  al.,  2021b).  All  downloadable  NPP-VIIRS-like  NTL  data  are  in  the 
GCS_WGS_1984 coordinate system, and this leads to instability in the 
nighttime light grid in ArcGIS. Therefore, the coordinate system of all 
night  light  images  was  converted  to  Lambert's  equal-area  projection 
coordinate system. Subsequently, the ArcGIS Mask Extraction Tool was 
used to extract images of the target area.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the use of any techniques to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some commonly used techniques to handle data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes or labels in both sets. This ensures that the classifier learns from a representative sample of each class.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to balance datasets with imbalanced classes. Oversampling involves duplicating examples from the minority class, while undersampling involves removing examples from the majority class. These techniques can help prevent the classifier from being biased towards the majority class.

Diverse data collection involves collecting data from different sources, demographics, and environments to ensure that the dataset is representative of the population it aims to serve. This technique helps reduce bias caused by sampling errors and selection bias.
