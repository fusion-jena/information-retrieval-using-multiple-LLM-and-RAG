feature class as ‘L', ‘Q', ‘LQ', ‘LQP’, and set the regularization multiplier 
from 0.5 to 5, using the delta in the Akaike minimum information cri-
terion (delta.AICc) as the metric to determine the best tuning parame-
ters. The optimal model is the one with the minimum delta.AICc value 
(delta.AICc = 0), and a model with delta.AICc <2 is considered credible 
(Phillips et al., 2017). The Continuous Boyce Index (CBI)(Hirzel et al., 
2006) was employed in addition to the Area under the Receiver Oper-
ating Characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) because AUC-ROC is not reliable 
when  obtaining  true  absences  is  challenging  (Jim´enez  and  Sober´on, 
2020). The final optimal parameters were identified as the feature class 
‘LQP’ and a regularization multiplier of 3.5 (Fig. A.2). The mean AUC- 
ROC  stands  at 95.5%,  while the  average  CBI  index  for the  validation 
dataset is 82.6%.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, several strategies can be employed. One common strategy is to use fixed random seeds during training to ensure reproducibility of results. This involves setting the same seed value before each run of the model, which ensures that the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers is generated each time. Another strategy is to perform multiple runs of the model with different random seeds and then aggregate the results. This can help to mitigate the effects of any single run being influenced by a particularly favorable or unfavorable initialization. Additionally, techniques such as dropout and batch normalization can also be used to introduce controlled randomness into the model, which can help prevent overfitting and improve generalization performance. Finally, it may also be useful to explore different architectures and hyperparameters to find the most robust configuration for handling randomness.
