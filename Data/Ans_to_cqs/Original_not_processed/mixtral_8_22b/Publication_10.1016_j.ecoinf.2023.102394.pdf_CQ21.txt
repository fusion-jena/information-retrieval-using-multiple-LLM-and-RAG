Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

The  parameter  selection  was  performed  by  minimizing  the  mean 
squared  error.  The parameter  settings  of the  MLP  model are  listed  in 
Table 2.

Information System). The SOC in each depth interval was calculated as 
follows:

The MLP was implemented in the keras package (Allaire and Chollet, 
2018) with the TensorFlow backend (Abadi et al., 2016) in the R envi-
ronment. The SOCS values were log-transformed, and all environmental 
variables  were  normalized  to  0  and  1  based  on  the  minimum  and 
maximum values, respectively. 

2.3.3. Model projection 

Here,  we  aimed  to  forecast  (predict  a  future  trend  by  testing  the 
model based on historical data) or hindcast (estimate a past trend by 
testing  the  model  based  on  current  data)  SOCS  conditions  over  time.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it can be inferred from general machine learning practices that common postprocessing steps may include evaluating the performance of the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curves, etc. Additionally, techniques like saliency maps could also be used to understand which input features had the most impact on the predictions made by the model. It should be noted that these are only assumptions based on typical machine learning workflows and not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
