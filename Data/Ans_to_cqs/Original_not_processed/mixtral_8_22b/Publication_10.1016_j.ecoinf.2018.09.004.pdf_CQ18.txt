Typically, the input dataset is split into two disjoint subsets, the
training and the testing set. The training set is used to learn the model,
while the test set is used to measure a performance measure. But how
conﬁdent can we be about the classiﬁcation performance? The results
may be due to accidental characteristics of the speciﬁc partitioning. For
example, the test set may happen to include points that are easy to be
categorized, with the result that the categorizer yields good perfor-
mance. Consequently, the choice of a ﬁxed, predeﬁned partitioning of
the dataset may not be the best way for evaluating classiﬁers.

The ﬁnal step is to train and test the machine learning algorithms in
this dataset for 5-class classiﬁcation. Stratiﬁed cross-validation was
used, and evaluated with Precision, Recall and F-measure. This dataset
is not balanced as can be seen in Table 1. Cymodocea is the dominant
class that constitutes the 75% of the dataset. Thus, Accuracy may not be
a suitable measure, because it measures how many correct predictions
were made overall, and if we predict all the test examples as cymo-
docea, then Accuracy would be close to 75% without even predicting
another class. This is clearly a problem because many machine learning
algorithms are designed to maximize overall Accuracy, with the ex-
ception of the tree-based algorithms. So, we resort to the F-measure; the
algorithms are ranked based on it.

(in terms of comparative presence–absence item counts), Accuracy is a
suitable measure for model performance evaluation. Nevertheless, all
applied algorithms are ranked based on the F-measure (from worst to
best), for reasons to be explained in Section 4.1.1 below.

where TP is the number of true (correct) positive (presence) predic-
tions, TN is the number of correct negative (absence) predictions, FP is
the number of false positive predictions and FN is the number of false
negative predictions.

Other metrics used are Precision, Recall, and the F-measure.
Precision is deﬁned as the fraction of relevant/correct instances among
the retrieved instances for a class, while Recall is the fraction of re-
levant instances that have been retrieved over the total amount of

relevant instances. In terms of the same counts used above, they can be

Helpful Answer:

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is stratified cross-validation. This method involves splitting the input dataset into two disjoint subsets, namely the training and the testing sets. The training set is utilized to learn the model, while the test set is employed to evaluate its performance. However, this approach might lead to biased results due to specific characteristics of the chosen partitioning. To mitigate this issue, stratified cross-validation is applied, which ensures that each subset maintains the original class distribution.

In this case, the dataset is imbalanced, with one class (Cymodocea) accounting for 75% of the data. As a consequence, accuracy may not be a reliable metric since it only considers the proportion of correct predictions out of the total number of samples. Instead, precision, recall, and F-measure are adopted to assess the model performance more accurately. These metrics focus on correctly identifying both positive and negative classes, providing a better understanding of the model's ability to handle imbalanced datasets.

To summarize, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is stratified cross-validation, along with employing precision, recall, and F-measure as performance metrics instead of accuracy.
