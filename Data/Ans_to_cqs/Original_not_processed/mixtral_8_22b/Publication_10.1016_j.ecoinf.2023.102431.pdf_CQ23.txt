To identify variables with the greatest potential to discriminate be-
tween classes of objects (e.g., species or fisher sex) we used a predictor 
screening analysis that uses bootstrap forest partitioning to evaluate the 
contribution  of  predictors  on  the  response  object.  For  each  response 
object  we  employed  predictor  screening  using  1000  decision  trees  to 
evaluate all 124 potential FIT metrics. We then used the top predictor 
variables to evaluate the dataset for two potential sources of bias, 1) the 
use of mirrored right front tracks instead of only left front tracks (foot 
position  bias)  and  2)  the  potential  for  bias  between  observers  when 
manually  marking  the  landmark  points  in  the  FIT  interface (observer 
bias) which is a somewhat subjective process. Foot position (left-front or 
right-front) of each track was recorded for each track during the feature 
extraction  process.  To  evaluate  observer  bias  we  had  3  different  ob-

outliers and removed from the dataset for subsequent analyses.

We  used  a  stepwise  variable  selection  procedure  with  the  p-value 
serving as the decisive factor (threshold of 0.05) to select the variables 
that had the best discriminating power based on their F-ratios. We used 
linear  discriminant  analysis  to  generate  a  discrimination  line  (2  vari-
ables) or hyperplane (>3 variables) depending on the number of vari-
ables  in  the  resulting  model  to  classify  species  or  sex.  To  quantify 
uncertainty  in  classification,  we  then  generated  bands  of  uncertainty 
around  this  discrimination  hyperplane.  We  assigned  values  that  fall 
within these bands a probability value (p) indicating a level of certainty 
about the classification using a logistic regression model, as in Eq. (1)

Helpful Answer:
The authors have not explicitly mentioned any specific techniques such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning models. However, they did use a stepwise variable selection procedure with a p-value serving as the decisive factor to select the variables that had the best discriminating power based on their F-ratios. They also used linear discriminant analysis to generate a discrimination line or hyperplane depending on the number of variables in the resulting model to classify species or sex. Additionally, they evaluated the dataset for potential biases, including foot position bias and observer bias, by recording the foot position of each track during the feature extraction process and having three different observers manually mark the landmark points in the FIT interface. Outliers were identified and removed from the dataset for subsequent analyses. These steps may contribute to improving the robustness and generalizability of the models, but explicit mention of common methods like cross-validation or stratified sampling is missing.
