similarities. It is widely used to visualize high-dimensional data (van der 
Maaten  and Hinton, 2008). Here the  method has been applied to the 
fc1000 activation vectors returned by ResNet-50. 

4.2. Classifier model 

The labeled dataset was split 70/30 into training and testing data-
sets.  For  model  selection  and  parameter  optimization  50%  of  the 
training data were held-out for validation (see Supporting Information). 
The final classification model, a SVM with a cubic polynomial kernel, 
was trained using the ResNet-50 fc1000 activations of the full training 
dataset. A 10-fold cross-validation was then used to define the score-to- 
posterior-probability transformation function (Platt, 2000), which pro-
vides a basis for estimating the posterior probability for new observa-
tions. Fig. 9 shows a confusion matrix for the test data not seen during 
training.

when weights are used, the range of the kernels receiving full weight 
should be set larger than the confidence interval of the prediction.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the provided information, it appears that the final classification model, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a cubic polynomial kernel, was trained using the ResNet-50 fc1000 activations of the full training dataset. However, there is no explicit mention of the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete.

Typically, in machine learning models like this one, training can be considered complete when certain conditions are met. These conditions often include reaching a minimum error rate, achieving a stable validation accuracy, or when the validation loss plateaus. In some cases, early stopping may also be employed to prevent overfitting, where training stops if the performance on the validation set does not improve after a certain number of epochs.

Unfortunately, without more detailed information about the specific training process used in this case, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the exact criteria used to determine when training was complete.
