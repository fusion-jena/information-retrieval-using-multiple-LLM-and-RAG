Actually, the use of point clouds in landscape design is not new. Guo 
et  al.  (2023)  established  a  3D  landscape index  system  built  upon the 
“Patch-Class-Landscape” framework. The models employed point cloud

(UAV)  to  quantitatively  describe  spatial  landscape  features  at  patch,

%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to determine which specific platform was used to deploy the deep learning model mentioned in this context. None of the sources cited provide details about the deployment platform or any other related technical aspects regarding the implementation of the deep learning model. Therefore, it remains unknown whether the model was deployed on platforms such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or others.
