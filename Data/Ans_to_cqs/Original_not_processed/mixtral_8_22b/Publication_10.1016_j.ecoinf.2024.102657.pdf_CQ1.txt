grams, and created the metadata .csv file necessary for training the CNN 
and k-NN. Identical in structure to the metadata file outlined above, this 
file contained the metadata for the training set as opposed to the met-
adata for the entire dataset. 

No additional preprocessing was applied to the spectrograms as the 
goal was to do the least amount of preprocessing possible in order to 
demonstrate  the  power  of  human-machine  teaming.  Further,  when 
assessing the accuracy of the CNN on noise-filtered data versus raw data, 
the accuracy levels were similar: after 10 trials, the CNN’s accuracy on 
the  filtered  data  averaged  to  99.22%  and  the  accuracy  on  the  non- 
filtered data averaged to 99.25%.

Additionally,  we  created  a  metadata  .csv  file  that  listed  all  of  the 
necessary classification information for training the CNN and k-NN . The 
.csv file had five columns. The first, dialect_folder, listed the file path to 
the folder containing the bird song. Each folder was labeled with the 
dialect type and the year it was collected, for example, “ABLA_2022”. 
Note, each folder name contained the label of the songs inside, as this

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The paper does not provide explicit details about the method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the bird song data is stored in folders labeled with the dialect type and the year it was collected. This suggests that the data might have been gathered through field recordings over multiple years. Additionally, the authors state that they created a metadata.csv file listing all the necessary classification information for training the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN). This implies that the raw data collection process involved gathering relevant metadata along with the audio files. Unfortunately, without more specific information, I cannot definitively determine the exact method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
