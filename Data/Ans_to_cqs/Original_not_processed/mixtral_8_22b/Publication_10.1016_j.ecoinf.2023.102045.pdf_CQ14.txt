%Query
Query: "How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide information on how the hyperparameters of a specific model were optimized using methods such as grid search or random search. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which method was used based solely on the provided context.
