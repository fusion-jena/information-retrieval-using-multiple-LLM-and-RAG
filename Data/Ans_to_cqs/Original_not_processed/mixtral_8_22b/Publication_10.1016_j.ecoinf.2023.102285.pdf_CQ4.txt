The rest of this document is structured as follows: The methodology 
is revealed in Section 2. The datasets on which the methodology is built 
and tested are explored in Section 3. A summary of the findings is pro-
vided in Section 4. Discussions are outlined in Section 5. Section 6 draws 
a conclusion as well as future potential works. Finally, the limitations of

Phase III. Evaluation using recent surveys (Fig. 3 III): A dataset 
was  prepared  to  evaluate  the  eligibility  of  the  methodology.  This  set 
consists of 57 images with ISMMMOs and 5000 images with no ISMM-
MOs. This set is not included in the dataset used for the establishment of 

the  methodology  to  observe  if  the  methodology  works  as  desired  for 
other independent datasets. The test results are displayed in Table 10 B. 
We moved to the next phase to verify the system with field experts using 
other  independent  datasets  after  the  satisfactory  results  (Se,  Sp,  PPV, 
NPV, and ACC > 0.95) obtained in this phase. 

Phase  IV.  Validation  by  field  experts  using  the  most  recent 
surveys (Fig. 3 IV): Furthermore, in an independent verification dataset,

harness this challenging environment. More specifically, robotic vehi-
cles, autonomous vehicles, and surface vessels have been deployed for 
the  offshore  industries  and  deep-sea  archaeology,  ocean  engineering 
projects, rescue operations and environmental measurements for the last 
several  decades.  For  instance,  the  Argo  program,  an  international 
collaboration,  has  deployed  approximately  3900  instruments  in  the 
world's oceans to facilitate the collection of data for climatological and 
oceanographic studies. (Riser et al., 2016). Besides, artificial structures 
such as gas, oil and deep seabed mining platforms, offshore renewable 
energy harvesting technologies such as oil and gas installations, wind 
farms and wave energy converters, fish farms, ships, boats and yachts for

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given references, there isn't a direct mention of specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, translation, and shearing. These techniques help increase the amount of training data available and improve model performance by introducing variations into the input data. It would be best to refer to the original research papers or contact the authors directly for more detailed information about the specific data augmentation techniques used in their study.
