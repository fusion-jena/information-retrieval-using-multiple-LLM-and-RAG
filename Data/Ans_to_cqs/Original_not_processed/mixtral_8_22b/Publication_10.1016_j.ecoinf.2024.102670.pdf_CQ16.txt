In case (b), the goal was to assess the strength of agreement between 
the gold standard method (manual tracing) and the proposed automated 
method measuring the mycelium length. Lin’s Concordance Coefficient 
(ρc
) (McBride,  2005) is  a commonly  adopted method  to assess  agree-
ment  strength.  Since  the  relation  between  our  measurement  and  the 
manual  one can be  regarded  as  a  statistical population  of  continuous 
random  variables,  following  the  guidelines  by  McBride  (2005),  we 
considered  the  one-sided  95%  confidence  limit  of  ρc  which  was 
computed using the software provided in (Mathew, 2018). CIlow95%(ρc) <
0.9 as poor, 0.9 < CIlow95%(ρc) < 0.95 as moderate, 0.95 < CIlow95%(ρc) <
0.99  as  substantial,  and  CIlow95%(ρc)  > 0.99  as  almost  perfect,

2.5.1. Validation of mycelium detection

Galicia et al., 2023). Specifically, to automatically determine an optimal 
threshold value, Kapur’s maximum entropy method was adopted (Dikec 
et al., 2020; Ledoux et al., 2022, 2024). Global thresholding has been 
suggested to be unsuitable for filamentous structure since, depending on 
the  threshold,  thinner  filaments  may  be  omitted,  or  artifacts  may  be 
introduced (Fricker et al., 2017). Furthermore, it is sensitive to uneven 
illumination.  This  limitation  has  been  surpassed  with  local  adaptive 
thresholding,  as  adopted  in  (Sachs  et  al.,  2019).  Another  option  to 
segment  filamentous  images  is  to  adopt  ridge  detection  methods,  as 
done in (Fricker et al., 2017; Lopez-Molina et al., 2015; Obara et al., 
2012; Pain et al., 2019; Vidal-Diez de Ulzurrun et al., 2015; Vidal-Diez 
de Ulzurrun et al., 2019). Filaments, in fact, appear in an image as lines 
displaying a local maximum towards a certain direction. In particular, in

Query: "What criteria are used to determine when training is complete (e.g., validation loss plateau)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific criteria for determining when training is complete. However, based on general machine learning practices, common criteria include observing a plateau in the validation loss, reaching a predefined number of epochs, or achieving a desired level of performance on a validation set. It should be noted that these criteria are not mentioned in the given context.

Based on the information available, it appears that the focus of this study is on validating the accuracy of an automated method for measuring mycelium length against a manual gold standard method. The authors use Lin's Concordance Coefficient (ρc) to measure the strength of agreement between the two methods. They consider the one-sided 95% confidence limit of ρc and classify the agreement as poor, moderate, substantial, or almost perfect based on the value of CIlow95%(ρc).

Regarding the segmentation of filamentous structures, the authors discuss various approaches such as global thresholding, local adaptive thresholding, and ridge detection methods. However, they do not provide details about how these techniques were applied or what criteria were used to evaluate their effectiveness.

Therefore, without additional context, it is not possible to definitively answer the query regarding the criteria used to determine when training is complete.
