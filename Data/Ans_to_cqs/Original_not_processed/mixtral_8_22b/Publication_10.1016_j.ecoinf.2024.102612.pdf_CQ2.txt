different formats to achieve the best performance when leveraging MS data.

Moreover, enhancements in the classification outcomes of fuel types 
can be achieved using advanced DL classification models that can better 
handle  complex  and  high-dimensional  data  from  MS  geoinformation 
such as LiDAR point clouds or MS imagery. DL is a subfield of machine 
learning that uses Artificial NNs to learn from large datasets and make 
accurate predictions using new data (Sharma et al., 2021). The ability of 
DL models to learn complex patterns and relationships in data makes 
them particularly well-suited for fuel model retrieval, where there are 
often  many  variables  and  relationships  to  consider,  such  as  the  hori-
zontal and vertical continuities of different vegetal species (Skowronski 
et al., 2007). For instance, Kalinaki et al. (2023) used DL models such as 
U-Net  and  Deeplabv3+,  to  semantically  classify  forest  and  non-forest 
features  using  Sentinel-2  MS  imagery.  In  addition,  Marjani  et  al.

determining  a  suitable  scale  for  image  segmentation,  and  selecting 
appropriate  features  for  image  classification  (Abdollahi  and  Yebra, 
2023).

and  Mean  IoU  (MIoU).  Notably,  in  addition  to  the  comprehensive 
evaluation  provided  by  the  Overall  Accuracy  and  IoU,  their  mean 
counterparts  (MA  and  MIoU)  consider  the  individual  values  for  each 
class within the dataset and compute their average. This approach en-
hances the reliability of the classification results for imbalanced data. 
Furthermore, the highest MIoU value was employed to determine the 
point at which the DNN attained optimal performance. 

Finally, the selected SoftGroup architecture was trained over 1000 
epochs for each type of input data, and metrics such as MIoU or MA were 
computed after each epoch to analyse the training performance. Once 
trained, the configuration weights that achieved the best classification 
performance were selected to establish the reference trained model and, 
finally, it was used to perform predictions on the real MS point clouds 
collected in Section 2.3, i.e. the ground truth data.

Helpful Answer:
The text mentions two specific types of data formats used in the deep learning pipeline for fuel type classification: LiDAR point clouds and multispectral (MS) imagery. These data formats are derived from MS geoinformation sources. LiDAR point clouds provide detailed information about the physical environment, including the horizontal and vertical continuity of various vegetal species. On the other hand, MS imagery, like Sentinel-2 MS imagery, captures multiple bands of light reflected off the Earth's surface, providing valuable insights into land cover and vegetation health. Both these data formats are considered complex and high-dimensional, making them ideal candidates for processing with advanced deep learning models capable of handling intricate patterns and relationships in the data.
