InceptionResNetV2 

InceptionResNetV2  is  a  fusion  of  the  Inception  and  ResNet  archi-
tectures,  combining  the  benefits  of  both  networks.  It  incorporates  re-
sidual  connections  and  parallel  convolutions  to  capture  fine-grained 
details and high-level features simultaneously. InceptionResNetV2 has 
been  pre-trained  on  extensive  datasets,  enabling  it  to  learn  compre-
hensive feature representations and achieve high performance.

trated  in  Fig.  1.  The  methodology  incorporates  a  range  of  transfer 
learning  models,  including  MobileNet,  EfficientNet,  InceptionV3,

3.2.4. ResNet-50 

ResNet-50 is a widely used deep residual neural network architecture 
that addresses the challenges of training very deep networks. It employs 
residual blocks with skip connections to enable the flow of gradients and 
facilitate the training of deeper models. ResNet-50 has been pre-trained 
on  large-scale  datasets,  allowing  it  to  capture  complex  patterns  and 
achieve strong performance.

InceptionV3 

InceptionV3 is an advanced CNN architecture that incorporates the 
concept of inception modules. These modules utilize parallel convolu-
tions  of  different  kernel  sizes  to  capture  multi-scale  features.  Incep-
tionV3  has  been  pre-trained  on 
large-scale  datasets  and  has 
demonstrated  excellent  performance  in  various  image  classification 
tasks.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available from the given context to determine what specific data formats were used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the mentioned architectures such as InceptionResNetV2, ResNet-50, InceptionV3, and others, we can infer that the primary focus of these models is on image processing and computer vision tasks. Therefore, it would be reasonable to assume that the input data format used in their deep learning pipeline is likely images or visual data. Nevertheless, without explicit confirmation from the source material, this remains speculative.
