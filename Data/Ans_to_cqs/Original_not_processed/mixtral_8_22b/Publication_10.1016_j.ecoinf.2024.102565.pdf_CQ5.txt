NN, a powerful and widely utilized machine learning model, excels 
in tasks such as classification and regression (Arbib, 2003; Niroumand- 
Jadidi  et  al.,  2022).  Comprising  interconnected  nodes  (neurons)  ar-
ranged  in  layers,  NN  processes  and  transforms  input  data  to  produce 
desired  outputs  (Goodfellow  et  al.,  2016;  Niroumand-Jadidi  et  al., 
2022). The fundamental structure encompasses an input layer, one or 
more hidden layers, and an output layer (Hardesty, 2017). The number 
of  neurons  in  the  input  layer  aligns  with  the  count  of  input  features, 
whereas  in  this study, only  wind  speed  is  considered. The number of 
neurons  in  the  output  layer  corresponds  to  the  number  of  outputs  or 
classes  (Hardesty,  2017).  An  essential  consideration  of  NN  design

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions several studies related to remote sensing, image processing, and environmental science where various types of satellite imagery have been employed. For instance, Hanintyo et al. (2021) use Landsat 8 data, while He et al. (2013) utilize geostationary satellite ocean color data. Additionally, Ecological Informatics (2024) discusses the application of convolutional neural networks for water body extraction from Sentinel-2 images. Therefore, it can be inferred that these studies might involve datasets derived from satellite imagery sources like Landsat, Sentinel-2, or other similar platforms. Nevertheless, without explicit mention of well-known benchmark datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, we cannot definitively state which datasets were used in their respective deep learning pipelines.
