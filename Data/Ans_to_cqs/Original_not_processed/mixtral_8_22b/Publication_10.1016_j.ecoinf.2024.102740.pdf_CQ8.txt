the training subset. In this case, the total number of samples used for validation is 8. 

System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses (SAGA) software (version 9.4.0) (Conrad, 

2015) was employed to perform classification utilising the RF technique, based on Red 

Gren Blue (RGB) images acquired in March, April, and May.In this study, the maximum 

shaft number value was tested from 1 to 100 and the minimum sample number from 1 

to 50. Finally, the most accurate results for RF were obtained when the maximum tree 

depth was set to 10 and the minimum number of samples was set to 2. The regression

%Query
Query: "Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not mention any specific details about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, it is not possible to provide an exact location or link to the code repository. It could be hosted on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket, but without further information, we cannot determine its precise location.

Based on the given context, the authors have utilized various tools and techniques for their research, including QGIS software, SAGA software, and Random Forest algorithms. However, there is no explicit reference to a deep learning pipeline or its corresponding code repository. To find out more about the availability of the code repository, one would need additional information or contact the original authors directly.
