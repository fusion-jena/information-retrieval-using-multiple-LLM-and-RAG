(1)  In 2020, the ESA within the WRB covered approximately 43.362 
× 103 km2, comprising 32.38% of the entire area. This included 
mainly forest (89.3%) as well as grassland, and a small amount of 

farmland. In terms of spatial distribution, the source areas were 
predominantly  located  in  the  northern  foothills  of  the  Qinling 
Mountains in the southern part of the basin, in the Ziwu Moun-
tains between the Jing and Luo Rivers in the central part of the 
basin, and in the Huanglong Mountain area east of the Luo River.  
(2)  Fifty optimal ecological source regions were obtained using the 
GA,  generating  122  ECs  that  were  40.24  × 105  km  in  length, 
which could disperse the entire WRB. These were distributed in a 
circular pattern within the watershed.  

(3)  The ESA and EC before and after optimization were compared. 
The  GA  was  applicable  and  reliable  in  identifying  the  optimal 
ESA, providing a reliable approach for constructing a regional ES. 

Funding

The  operation  of  GA  requires  specifying  the  “initial  population” 
(Pop),  and  the  selection  of  the  “population”  size  will  affect  the  algo-
rithm’s performance and convergence speed. A larger population size 
can increase the diversity of algorithms, which helps explore the search 
space more comprehensively but also increases computational costs. A 
smaller population size may cause the algorithm to fall into local optima; 
however, the computational cost is lower. After multiple attempts, we 
obtained  the  ecological  source  locations  under  different  initial  pop-
ulations  and  compared  the  source  area  coverage,  average  source 
coverage,  and  source  fragmentation  to  determine  whether  an  initial 
population of Pop = 50 was the best choice. The comparative results of 
the ESA for the different populations are shown in Table 7 and Fig. 7. 
The connectivity rate of the source area reached 84.99%. The coverage
