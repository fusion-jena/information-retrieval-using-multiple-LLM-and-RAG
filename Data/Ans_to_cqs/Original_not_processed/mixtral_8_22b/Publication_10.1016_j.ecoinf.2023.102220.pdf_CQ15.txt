each, all using the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function; for 
the output layer we used the sigmoid activation function. We used the 
LSTM method by adding a long short term memory block on the DNNâ€™s 
architecture  previously  described.  The  implementation  of  the  classifi-
cation methods was carried out in Python using the libraries TensorFlow 
and Scikit-learn (Van Rossum and Drake Jr, 1995). Finally, we obtained 
the accuracy, true positive rate and false positive rate using the afore-
mentioned training-test splits of the time series.

in most comparisons while providing interpretability rather than being a black-box method. It is an improvement 
over current state-of-the-art machine learning tools, especially by non-specialists, such as ecologists aiming to use 
a quantitative approach for pest monitoring. We provide the implemented PBP method in Python through the

descriptive advantages combined with its predictive power.

Table 2 shows that the PBP method is competitive with state-of-the- 
art  machine  learning  methods,  such  as  the  commonly  used  Random 
Forest (RF) algorithm. The criterion of a false positive rate of at most 0.2 
provides an accuracy of 91.0%, a false positive rate of 8% and a true 
positive  rate  of  75%.  Only  DNN  could  obtain  similar  values  of  true 
positive rate for this case study. Moreover, our method using the criteria

Helpful Answer:
The given text does not explicitly mention any specific optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, or others. However, since the authors mentioned using TensorFlow, which is a popular library for building and training neural networks, it can be assumed that they might have employed one of these common optimization algorithms available within TensorFlow. These include but are not limited to SGD, Adam, RMSprop, Adagrad, and Adadelta. Without further information from the original source, it cannot be definitively stated which optimization technique was utilized in their deep learning pipeline.
