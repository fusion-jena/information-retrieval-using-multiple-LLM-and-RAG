1. Introduction  

Grasslands  are  among  the  leading  terrestrial  ecosystems  (Zhang  et  al.,  2022), 

occupying more than 40% of the world’s terrestrial area, a third of the agricultural area 

in  Europe,  and  storing  about  a  third  of  the  world’s  terrestrial  biomass  stock  (O‘Mara, 

2012; Stumpf et al., 2020 Bar-On et al., 2018; Erb et al., 2017).  

Moreover, grassland agroecosystems are of significant importance in the production of

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific details regarding optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, it discusses hyperparameter tuning strategies for Random Forest, a machine learning algorithm often used for tasks like classification and regression. It also mentions the use of Maximum Tree Depth and Minimum Number of Samples as parameters during the application of Random Forest. Additionally, the context refers to the use of QGIS software for geospatial analysis and the employment of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data for remote sensing applications.
