Advancements  in  bathymetry  retrieval  methods  have  led  to  the 
development  of  various  models,  including  linear  or  nonlinear  regres-
sion, logarithmic ratio transformation, and machine learning techniques 
such  as  CART,  RFR, and  SVM (Ashphaq et  al.,  2021; Cahalane et  al., 
2019; Lyzenga, 1978; Lyzenga et al., 2006). Gabr et al. (2020) utilized a 
linear model to estimate bathymetry and confirmed the equivalence of 
Landsat images to high-resolution PlanetScope (3 m) predictions. Sun 
et al. (2021) applied two regression tree models (CART and Cubist) to 
retrieve  coastal  bathymetry  and  analyze  vertical  water  environment 
information.  Zhang  et  al.  (2019)  employed  the  SVR  (support  vector 
regression) model to provide technical support for bathymetry data in 
Arctic waters. However, despite several studies, the application of CART 
and  RFR  models  in  nearshore  turbid  waters  for  bathymetry  has  been

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not directly mention any specific evaluation metrics used for assessing the performance of the deep learning model. However, common metrics used to evaluate deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, and Area Under Curve (AUC). These metrics help measure how well the model is performing on unseen data and can be chosen based on the problem statement and dataset characteristics. For instance, if the task involves imbalanced classes, then precision, recall, and F1 scores might be more suitable than accuracy alone.

In the context of remote sensing applications like coastal bathymetry estimation, some commonly used evaluation metrics could include Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), coefficient of determination (R^2), and correlation coefficients between predicted and actual values. These metrics would help quantify the error and agreement between the estimated bathymetric maps generated by the deep learning model and the ground truth measurements.
