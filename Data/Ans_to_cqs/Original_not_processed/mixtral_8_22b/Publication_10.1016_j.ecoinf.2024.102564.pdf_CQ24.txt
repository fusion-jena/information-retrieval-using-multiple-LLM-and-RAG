We found that machine learning methods were efficient and impor-
tant  tools  for  modeling  growth  in  forest  fragments  in  the  Brazilian 
Atlantic  Forest.  They  can  help  in  understanding  the  biome  and  in 
developing management strategies aimed at recovering biodiversity and 
reducing  the  deleterious  effects  of  fragmentation.  Their  ability  to 
analyze complex data, capture non-linear relationships, provide accu-
rate predictions, scale up, and support decision-making processes makes 
them  invaluable  for  understanding  and  conserving  this  unique  and 
threatened ecosystem. 

The Random Forest method showed superiority over the others for 
modeling growth in the Atlantic Forest. The metrics and the graphs of 
observed and estimate residuals used corroborate this statement. Studies

Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are computational models inspired 
by the structure and functioning of the human brain. The neural network 
is composed of multiple layers of neurons that carry out linear combi-
nations of the input values from the preceding layer. Then, a non-linear 
activation function is applied. The trainable parameters of the network 
are the weights associated with the linear combinations performed by 
each  individual  neuron  (Domingues  et  al.,  2020;  Kantarcioglu  et  al., 
2023). 

Random Forests (RF) is an ensemble learning method that combines 
multiple decision trees to make predictions. Each tree is trained on a 
random  subset  of  the  data,  and  the  final  prediction  is  determined  by 
aggregating the predictions of all trees. Random Forest releases robust 
results  even  when  the  number  of  observations  is  smaller  than  the 
number  of  variables  or  the  variables  are  correlated  (Breiman,  2001; 
Nguyen et al., 2019).

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, there isn't any direct information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, we can infer some general strategies based on common practices in machine learning and deep learning fields.

One strategy to manage randomness is setting a fixed seed value before training the model. This ensures reproducibility of results since the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers will be generated each time the code is executed. Different libraries like NumPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc., have their own functions to set seed values.

Another approach is employing cross-validation techniques, which involve splitting the dataset into several subsets and then training and testing the model multiple times, each time with different subsets. This helps in reducing the impact of random initialization of weights and biases in the model.

Ensemble methods, like Random Forests mentioned in the context, also deal with randomness inherently. These methods combine multiple base learners (decision trees in case of Random Forest), where each learner is trained on a randomly selected subset of features and samples. By aggregating the outputs of these diverse learners, ensemble methods reduce variance and improve overall model performance.

Lastly, hyperparameter optimization techniques, such as grid search or randomized search, can also indirectly address randomness. These methods systematically explore various combinations of hyperparameters and select the best performing ones. By trying out different configurations, they mitigate the effect of random initializations and contribute towards building more robust models.
