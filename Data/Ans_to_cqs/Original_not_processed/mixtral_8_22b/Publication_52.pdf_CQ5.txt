Through a series of new learning architectures and algorithms, have been transformed;
DELE methods are now the state-of-the-art in object, speech and audio recognition.
Deng and Yu (2013) had proposed methods and applications of DELE. A large deep
convolutional neural network trained (Krizhevsky, Sutskever, & Hinton, 2012) to classify
1.2 million high-resolution images in the ImageNet LSVRC-2010 contest into 1000
diﬀerent classes.
In recent years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have
become very popular and have achieved great success in many computer vision
tasks particularly in object recognition. Cellular Simultaneous Recurrent Networks
(CSRNs) applied (Alom, Alam, Taha, & Iftekharuddin, 2017) to generate initial ﬁlters
of CNNs for features extraction and Regularized Extreme Learning Machines (RELM)
for classiﬁcation. Experiments were conducted on three popular data sets for object
recognition (such as face, pedestrian, and car) to evaluate the performance of the pro-

a new deep neural network. Neurocomputing, 230, 374–381.

ARTICLE HISTORY
Received 30 November 2017
Accepted 14 July 2018

Before introducing our proposed algorithm, it would be essential to discuss the existing basic
theoretical framework. The question of whether a small Neural Network architecture can
learn a lot, even from huge training data sets, was answered in the aﬃrmative by ELM. An
ELM (Cambria & Guang-Bin, 2013) is a Single-Hidden Layer Feed Forward Neural Network
(SLFFNN) with N hidden neurons, randomly selected input weights and random values of
bias in the hidden layer, while the weights at its output are calculated with a single multipli-
cation of vector matrices. SLFFNNs are used in ELMs because of their ability to approach any
continuous function and to classify any discontinuous areas. An ELM can accurately learn N
samples, and its learning speed can be even thousands of times greater than the speed of
conventional Back Propagation Feed Forward Neural Networks (BP_FFNN).

Helpful Answer:
The paper mentions several datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for various tasks such as image classification, object recognition, and sound event classification. However, only one dataset is explicitly mentioned by name - the ImageNet LSVRC-2010 contest dataset containing 1.2 million high-resolution images classified into 1000 different classes. Other datasets mentioned include those used for object recognition tasks involving faces, pedestrians, and cars, but no specific names are given. Additionally, datasets used for sound event classification and automated bird acoustic event detection are also mentioned, but again, no specific names are provided. Therefore, based on the information available in this excerpt, we cannot provide a comprehensive list of all the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
