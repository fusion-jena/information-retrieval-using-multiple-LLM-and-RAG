Build a three-layer back propagation (BP) artificial neural network 
using MATLAB R2014b (Lin et al., 2021). The first layer (i.e. the input 
layer) corresponded to the aCDOM(254) and Fn(355) respectively. The 
intermediate layer (i.e. hidden layers) and the last layer (i.e. the output 
layer)  comprised  a  single  neuron,  that  corresponded  to  the  predictor 
(TSI). Set the maximum training times to 10,000 and the training error 
to 0.001. 64 water samples were utilized for model calibration, with the 
remaining  used  for  validation.  Validation  accuracy  was  assessed  by 
calculating the coefficient of determination (R2) and root-mean-square 
error (RMSE) between the measured and predicted TSI. The RMSE was 
determined using Eq. (6).

Helpful Answer:
After the model training, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the task. Based on the given context, it appears that the authors have calculated two metrics to evaluate the performance of their neural network model: the coefficient of determination (R^2) and the root-mean-square error (RMSE). These metrics help quantify how well the predicted values match the actual measurements.

The coefficient of determination (R^2) measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variables. It ranges from 0 to 1, where a value closer to 1 indicates better fit. On the other hand, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) calculates the average difference between the predicted and observed values. A lower RMSE value signifies a more accurate prediction.

In addition to these metrics, visualization techniques such as saliency maps or confusion matrices may also be employed based on the problem statement. However, since the context does not mention any use of these methods, we cannot confirm if they were applied in this particular case.
