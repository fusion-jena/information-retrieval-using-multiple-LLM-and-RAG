3.2. Model performance 

The five  component  models (GLM,  MaxEnt,  RF, GBM,  and  MARS) 
demonstrated variable  performance (Table 2).  Notably, the  RF model 
and the GLM model demonstrated the best and worst performance for all 
studied species, respectively (Table 2). 

3.3. Variable contributions to habitat suitability 

In the ensemble habitat suitability model, distance to mining roads, 
distance  to  roads,  distance  to  CAs,  and  distance  to  water  resources 
played  important  roles  in  predicting  habitat  suitability  for  the  three 
species (Table  3). Response curves  detailing the  relationship between 
habitat suitability and environmental variables in the best-performing 
model  (the  RF  model),  are  presented  in  Supplementary  Materials

Connectivity  prediction  was  implemented  in  UNICOR  over  the 
resistance  map  for  the  species  to  find  the  single-source  shortest  path 
between  start  and  end  occurrence  records  (Landguth  et  al.,  2012; 
Cushman et al., 2013). Furthermore, the continuous factorial least-cost 
path map was converted to a categorical map based on the same method 
used  for  core  habitats.  To  measure  the  coverage  of  core  habitats  and 
corridors by CAs, the proportion of these areas within CAs was measured 
(Almasieh and Mohammadi, 2023).

3. Results 

3.1. Ensemble habitat suitability model

Although  studying  complex  ecosystems  can  be  challenging,  this 
study  underscores  the  importance  of  interdisciplinary  collaboration 
(Westley and Miller, 2013). Continuous refinement of models is essential 
given the dynamic and nonlinear nature of ecological processes and the 
scarcity of long-term data (Bugmann and Weisberg, 2003). The findings 
of this study offer practical value and provide a roadmap for protecting 
essential habitats, restoring connectivity, and ensuring the resilience of 
ungulate populations in the face of escalating human activities.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to determine what specific process was used to deploy the trained deep learning model. The given sources discuss various aspects of landscape ecology, such as modeling habitat suitability for different species, using multiple statistical methods like GLM, MaxEnt, RF, GBM, and MARS, and analyzing factors affecting habitat suitability. However, none of them explicitly mention any details about deploying a deep learning model or its related procedures, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, it is not possible to accurately answer the query based solely on the provided context.
