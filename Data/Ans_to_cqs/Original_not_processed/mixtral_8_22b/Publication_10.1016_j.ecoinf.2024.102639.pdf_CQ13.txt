• The  selection  of  the  distance  metric,  typically  Euclidean,  was 
predicated on the data’s characteristics and the specific analytical 
prerequisites.  

was dictated by the explained variance ratio, to ensure the distilled 
dataset retained the majority of the original data’s variance.  
• The  SVM  model  was  thereafter  trained  on  this  dimensionally 
reduced  dataset,  with  hyperparameters  refined  as  delineated 
above.

• The  regularization  parameter  (‘C’)  and  the  kernel  type  (linear) 
were  calibrated  through  a  synergistic  application  of  grid  search 
and  cross-validation,  aiming  to  mediate  the  balance  between 
model complexity and its generalization prowess.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model. However, it mentions the use of Support Vector Machine (SVM) models and the process of tuning their hyperparameters. Specifically, the'regularization parameter (C)' and the 'kernel type (linear)' were adjusted using a combination of grid search and cross-validation techniques. Additionally, when dealing with non-linear SVMs, the 'kernel coefficient (gamma)' also underwent optimization via grid search. It is important to note that these hyperparameters pertain specifically to the SVM models mentioned in the text, rather than a generic deep learning model.
