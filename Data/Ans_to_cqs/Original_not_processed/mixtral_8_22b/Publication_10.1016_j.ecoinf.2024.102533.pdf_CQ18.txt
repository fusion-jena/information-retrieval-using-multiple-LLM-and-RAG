to experiment with the number and range of freshness classes using a 
clustering approach. For each fish, we automatically identify the num-
ber  of  classes  and  their  duration,  evaluating  them  using  the  elbow 
method. The significant prevalence of automatic computing minimizes 
subjectivity, enhancing the objectivity of our findings.

The  evaluation  scores  achieved  from  the  three  methods  are  then 
applied  to  the  Elbow  method.  This  method  identifies  a  point  where 
diminishing  returns  no  longer  justify  the  increased  expense  by  using 
the”elbow” as a cutoff point, as explained in Subsection 2.8. The dashed

2.6. Step 5: Clustering the freshness data using six body parts parameters 

The  most  suitable  number  of  clusters  from  the  previous  stage  be-
comes the standard for the proposed number of freshness classes. Each 
species  attains  several  freshness classes  based  on  its  freshness strong-
hold. We group the data using the clustering method to automatically 
determine freshness class based on the dataset. Intuitively, the clustering 
method partitions data where similar data are grouped in one cluster, 
while dissimilar data are separated into other clusters. The partitioning 
occurs automatically according to the clustering algorithm.

2.7. Step 6: Evaluating the clustering results 

Clustering divides data into groups based on inherent characteristics; 
not requiring external information, such as, classes which become data 
labels. Therefore, the created groups align naturally with the data con-
ditions  and  the  clustering  algorithm.  As  a  result,  the  evaluation  of 
clustering results is conducted internally, using Silhouette and Calinski- 
Harabasz.  High  evaluation  scores  on  both  methods  indicate  that  the 
clustering results obtained by the clustering method is the best outcome.

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, it appears that the researchers use the Elbow method to evaluate the performance of their model during training. The Elbow method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters or classes in a dataset. It works by plotting the explained variance as a function of the number of clusters and identifying the "elbow" point, where adding more clusters does not significantly improve the explained variance. In this case, the researchers apply the Elbow method to the evaluation scores achieved from three different methods to identify the optimal number of freshness classes for each species. By doing so, they can minimize subjectivity and enhance the objectivity of their findings. Additionally, they use internal evaluation metrics such as Silhouette and Calinski-Harabasz to assess the quality of the resulting clusters. These metrics provide insights into how well the clustering algorithm has performed and whether the identified clusters accurately reflect the underlying structure of the data. Overall, the implementation of these strategies allows the researchers to effectively monitor the performance of their model during training and ensure that it produces reliable and meaningful results.
