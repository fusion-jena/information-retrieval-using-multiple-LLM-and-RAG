5.4. Application to the problem of counting pollen-bearing bees 

Counting the number of pollen-bearing bees entering the hive enables beekeepers to monitor the 

hive’s food status and promptly replenish it if necessary. Recognizing this benefit, we integrated

Furthermore,  Fig.  15  depicts  some  detection  outcomes  of  the  second  proposed

overfitting. Additionally, the Global Average Pooling layer summarizes features, generating input 

for the fully connected layer. This layer also facilitates the visualization of regions relied upon by 

the network for predictions. The subsequent three fully connected layers generate the predicted 

class for the original image

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The paper does not provide explicit information about the specific hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer used in their deep learning model. However, they do mention using techniques like focal loss and overlap sampling which can influence the performance of the model. They also discuss using various architectures like YoloV5, RetinaNet, DETR, and Faster R-CNN with different modifications. For instance, they use a combination of YoloV5 with focal loss and another one with a classification layer. Similarly, they employ Faster R-CNN with an overlap sampler. These details suggest that the authors have experimented with different configurations and settings but the exact hyperparameter values remain undisclosed in the given context.
