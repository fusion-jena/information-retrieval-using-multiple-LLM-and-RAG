Helpful Answer:
To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, several strategies can be employed. One common approach is to use a fixed random seed value across different runs or experiments. This ensures that the results obtained are reproducible and comparable. Another strategy is to perform multiple runs with different random seeds and then aggregate the results. This helps to reduce the impact of any single run being influenced by a particularly favorable or unfavorable initialization. Additionally, techniques such as cross-validation and bootstrapping can also help to mitigate the effects of randomness by providing more robust estimates of model performance. Finally, it may also be useful to explore different architectures or hyperparameters to find configurations that are less sensitive to random initialization.
