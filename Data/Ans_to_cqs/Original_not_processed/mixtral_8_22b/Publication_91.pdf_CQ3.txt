Dataset Our dataset consisted of 35 573 images for each of the
12 channels covering 35 species and resulting in a total of 426
876 images. This dataset was split into three sets for training, val-
idation, and testing in the proportions 80 : 10 : 10. All images
were centre cropped to an equally sized rectangle. In order to gain
a more robust and better generalising classiﬁer, the images in the

database for training of deep learning models. Comparable stud-
ies used 1060 (Daood et al., 2016), 13 617 images (Pedersen
et al., 2017) or 19 500 images (Sevillano et al., 2020), while in
our study the CNN classiﬁer was trained with 426 876 images.

We have previously suggested that a minimum of 200 images
per species are required for accurate species identiﬁcation of phy-
toplankton (Dunker et al., 2018). By contrast, in the present
study on pollen, ﬁve out of six species with fewer than 200 pollen
grains were classiﬁed with an accuracy higher than 90%. Based
on these ﬁndings, we concluded that between 50 and 100 pollen
grains represented a reasonable amount of pollen images on a sin-
gle channel to be included in the reference library.

with a batch size of 32. The initial learning rate of 0.001 was
exponentially decayed every 3 epochs with a factor of 0.94.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in their deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the context that they used image classification as part of their approach since they mention training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier. Image classification involves assigning labels to entire images rather than individual objects within them. Therefore, it is likely that the authors did not use bounding box annotations or instance segmentations, which are typically employed for object detection tasks. Instead, they might have simply labeled each image with its corresponding species name. Additionally, the context mentions that all images were center cropped to an equally sized rectangle, suggesting some form of preprocessing or normalization technique applied to the images before feeding them into the model.
