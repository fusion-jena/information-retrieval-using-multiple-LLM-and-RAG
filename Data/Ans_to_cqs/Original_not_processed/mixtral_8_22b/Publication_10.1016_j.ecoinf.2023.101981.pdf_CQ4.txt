cation. The precision was estimated by dividing the number of cow calls 
detected by the software by the total number of ROIs within the “Cow” 
cluster (Knight et al., 2017; P´erez-Granados and Schuchmann, 2020a) 
and can be interpreted as an index of the percentage of ROIs correctly 
labeled by Kaleidoscope.

is the FFT window size. We opted for a larger FFT window size, which 
should  improve  the  resolution  at  lower  frequencies  on  which  cows 
vocalize. Finally, while Karmiris et al. (2021) used the same settings for 
detecting  the  three  ungulate  species  (e.g.,  their  minimum  frequency 
introduced  for  detecting  cow  vocalization  was  much  higher,  500  Hz, 
than the mean minimum frequency measured in our dataset, approxi-
mately 250 Hz), we fitted cow-specific parameters in the model, which 
could also partly explain why our model detected a much larger number 
of cow vocalizations.

recognition  software  has  increased  significantly  in  recent  years 
(reviewed by Sugai et al., 2019).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, or scaling applied in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based solely on this context.
