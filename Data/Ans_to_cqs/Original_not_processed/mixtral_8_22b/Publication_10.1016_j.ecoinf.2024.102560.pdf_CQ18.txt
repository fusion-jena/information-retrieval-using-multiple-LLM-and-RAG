The ratio γ in Eqs. (3) and (4) is restricted to a small value as Eq. (2) 
to ensure the empirical scaling function and the empirical wavelets are a

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide a specific answer regarding the strategy used for monitoring the model performance during training. However, some common strategies include tracking metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, or area under the ROC curve (AUROC). Additionally, techniques like cross-validation, early stopping, learning curves, and confusion matrices can also help evaluate and improve model performance during training.
