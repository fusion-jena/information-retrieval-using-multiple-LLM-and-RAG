Development of automated classification routines, if accurate, serves to 
improve the efficiency, reduce the subjectivity, and decrease the cost of 
analyzing large datasets.

BANTER  may  serve  as  an  option  for  automated  machine  learning 
classification.

Advances in computing have led to a dramatic increase in the op-
portunities  to  use  machine  learning  for  bioacoustic  classification 
(Bianco et al., 2019; Mutanu et al., 2022; Stowell, 2022). In particular, 
use of deep neural networks show great promise for large datasets on a 
wide variety of taxa, including marine mammals (Frainer et al., 2023; 
Frasier et al., 2017; Li et al., 2020a; Rom´an Ruiz et  al., 2023; Zhong 
et al., 2020). Neural networks typically require significant sample sizes 
for all classes, although there are increasingly new tools to enhance data 
or combined disparate datasets (Dufourq et al., 2022; Nanni et al., 2020; 
Nolasco et al., 2023; Padovese et al., 2023; Shorten and Khoshgoftaar, 
2019).  There  is  a  significant  learning  curve  to  understand  how  to

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge, some commonly used optimization techniques in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp), and others. These techniques help minimize the loss function during training by adjusting the model parameters iteratively. The choice of optimization technique depends on factors such as convergence speed, computational resources, and problem complexity. For instance, Adam combines the advantages of both SGD and RMSProp, offering faster convergence and better performance with sparse gradients. Nonetheless, without explicit mention in the provided context, it cannot be confirmed which optimization techniques were employed in this case.
