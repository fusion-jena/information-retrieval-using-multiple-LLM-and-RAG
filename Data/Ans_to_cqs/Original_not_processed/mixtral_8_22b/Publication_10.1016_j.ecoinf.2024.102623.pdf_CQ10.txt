vancements in deep learning to enhance performance. Specifically, our 
MLP architecture consists of four layers, each containing 512 neurons 
and connected with residual connections (He et al., 2016). We employ 
batch normalization (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015) and the Rectified Linear 
Unit (ReLU) activation function in all layers except the final one, where 
instead a sigmoid function is used to enable multi-label classification. 
The model is trained with a batch size of 256 for 30 epochs using the 
AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017). Both the weight decay 
and learning rate are set to 0.0001. Additionally, we employ a learning 
rate scheduler with exponential decay of 0.95, and introduce dropout

methods have shown significant advancements when applied to large 
datasets, often outperforming traditional machine learning techniques 
in various fields (Brown et al., 2020; Christin et al., 2019; Jumper et al., 
2021; Krizhevsky et al., 2012). A distinctive advantage of deep learning 
approaches lies in their inherent flexibility, enabling the simultaneous 
integration of diverse data types and the modeling of multiple species, a 
capability  that  is  increasingly  vital  in  ecological  research.  Recent 
research emphasizes the potential of deep learning methods in SDMs, 
showing performance that matches or exceeds traditional techniques. In 
particular, this improvement seems to extend to both presence-absence 
(Chen et al., 2016; Teng et al., 2023) and presence-only datasets (Botella 
et al., 2023; Deneu et al., 2021).
