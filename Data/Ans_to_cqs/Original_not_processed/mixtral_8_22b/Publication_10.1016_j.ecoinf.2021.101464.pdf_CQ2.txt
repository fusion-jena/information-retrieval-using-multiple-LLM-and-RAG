Future research should consider the changes of predictors at different 
spatial and temporal scales in order to better evaluate the explanatory 
power  of  independent  variables  in  different  climate  regions.  Such 
knowledge could then be applied to other climate region types to un-
derstand the importance level of climate region differences to selected 
variables and the overall prediction ability of the model. In addition, the 
observation  index  can  be  increased,  the  observation  time  can  be 
extended, and the joint observation of multi-region and multi-tree spe-
cies can be strengthened. Big data theory and technology, neural net-
works, structural equations, and other deep-level data mining methods 
are applied to understand the importance level of climate differences on 
selected variables and the overall prediction ability of relevant models, 
so as to comprehensively and systematically understand the influence of 
forest microclimate on NAI.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide explicit information about the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of big data theory and technology, neural networks, and structural equations for data mining. These techniques often involve processing large datasets containing various types of structured or semi-structured data such as CSV files, databases, or even images and videos depending on the application. Additionally, the study focuses on understanding the impact of forest microclimates on Net Assimilation Index (NAI). This suggests that the dataset might include environmental measurements like temperature, humidity, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, photosynthetic activity, etc. Therefore, it is likely that the data format used in this case would primarily consist of numerical data from sensors and possibly some form of spatial data related to the location of these measurements.
