scales associated with data collection (Zizka et al., 2020). Due to these 
disparities,  scholars  recommend  a  thorough  examination  and  refine-
ment  of  these  data  repositories  (Bonnet-Lebrunm  et  al.,  2023).  To 
enhance the quality and reliability of the information, a comprehensive 
series  of  filters  has  been  systematically  applied  to  our  analysis.  To 
minimize errors associated with the public usage of GBIF and OBIS re-
positories,  we  curated  the  dataset  following  Zizka  et  al.  (2020)  and 
filtered the dataset by the columns labeled “scientific name”, “family”, 
“year”, “longitude” and “latitude”. We retained all taxonomic informa-
tion down to the species level and removed records with NA in these 
columns. We also removed all duplicate records with identical latitude

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, there is no mention of any specific data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. However, some common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, shearing, and translating images. These techniques help increase the amount of training data available and improve model performance by introducing variations into the input data. It should be noted that the choice of data augmentation technique depends on the nature of the problem being solved and the characteristics of the input data.

This study focuses on understanding the prevailing data collection trends and laying the groundwork for potential corrective measures to address described biases related to scales associated with data collection. The authors have applied a series of filters to enhance the quality and reliability of their information, including removing duplicates and retaining only relevant columns such as scientific name, family, year, longitude, and latitude. They have also removed records with missing values and kept only taxonomic information down to the species level. While these steps do not directly involve data augmentation techniques commonly used in deep learning pipelines, they contribute to improving the overall quality and accuracy of the dataset.
