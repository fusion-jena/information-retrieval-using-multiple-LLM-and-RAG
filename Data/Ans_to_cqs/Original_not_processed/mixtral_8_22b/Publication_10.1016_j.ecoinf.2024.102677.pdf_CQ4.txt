as deep learning methods to promote a deeper understanding of rural 
landscapes.

(1)  Dataset construction

(2)  Model selection 

In recent years, deep learning has made rapid progress in the field of 
image  recognition,  thus  greatly  improving  computer  processing. Con-
volutional neural network (CNN) is a popular deep learning architecture 
applied to image classification with good performance in the extraction 
of underlying abstract features (Meng et al., 2022). Convolution layers, 
pooling layers, fully connected layers, and nonlinear operations consti-
tute the CNN model (Attri et al., 2023). We fine-tuned several state-of- 
the-art  CNN  architectures,  including  the  Visual  Geometry  Group 
(VGG)  (Simonyan  and  Zisserman,  2014),  Inception  (Szegedy  et  al., 
2016), and residual network (ResNet) (He et al., 2016) CNNs, using the 
training dataset, and we evaluated their respective  performances. We 
selected from these networks the most effective model to create the rural

discriminant rules are illustrated in Fig. 3. Finally, we employed deep 
learning techniques to predict the types of landscapes in the case study 
area. The classification process based on deep learning encompasses the 
following stages.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for promoting a deeper understanding of rural landscapes. However, common data augmentation techniques often applied in deep learning include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, zooming, shearing, and brightness adjustment. These techniques help increase the size and diversity of training datasets by creating modified versions of existing images, thereby enhancing the robustness and generalization capabilities of the models.
