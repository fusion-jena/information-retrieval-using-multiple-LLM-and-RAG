Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

2.4.4. System structure 

We endeavored to design the model structure as simple as possible to 
ensure its usability on devices with limited computing power and enable 
real-time predictions, as long as the performance was not significantly 
reduced. Our aim was to create a model that balances performance and 
efficiency.  The  selected  system's  structure  consists  of  an  input  layer, 
three LSTM hidden layers, one dropout layer, and one dense layer. In the 
case of binary classification, a dense layer with a single output is used, 
and Ïƒ is employed as the activation function. For tasks involving more 
than two classes, the dense layer has multiple outputs and the softmax 
function is used as the activation function. The overall structure of the 
model is depicted in Fig. 5.

2.2. Feature extraction 

To  solve  problems  using  the  machine  learning  method,  extracting 
features from the raw data to be used as inputs for the machine learning 
model is necessary. Although the importance of feature extraction has 
decreased with the introduction of deep learning, there are still aspects 
where features play a key role, such as considering the computing power 
of devices, reducing training time, and ensuring real-time performance 
in decision-making. 

In  this paper,  we used  the BLS  entropy profile to  characterize the 
swimming behavior of C. elegans, as in the work by Jeong et al. (2019). 
The BLS profile has also been used to calculate the Levenshtein distance, 
an indicator of how similar two sequences are, in order to illuminate the 
similarities  and  differences  in  swimming  patterns  of  C.  elegans  in  a 
controlled and chemical-contaminated water environment (Kang et al.,

Recent advances in deep learning techniques have revolutionized the 
field  of  ecology,  surpassing  the  predictive  performance  of  traditional 
methods and giving rise to innovative prediction systems (Capinha et al., 
2021). Deep learning technology has achieved notable success in various 
applications, including the vocalization detection of the North Atlantic 
right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) (Padovese et al., 2023), the recognition 
of soybean leaf diseases (Yu et al., 2023), bird vocalization recognition 
(Xie et al., 2023), and the monitoring of biological soil crusts (Herdy 
et  al.,  2024).  These  diverse  research  efforts  demonstrated  the  recent 
advancements and promising results achieved by applying deep learning 
techniques to ecological data.

The features used as input vectors of the learning significantly impact 
the performance of machine learning-based systems. The limited set of 
patterns used as features in the paper is what the HMM requires, not 
specific characteristics, as needed for LSTM. Using a finite number of 
patterns  has  the  advantage  of  facilitating  the  analysis  of  C.  elegans 
response behavior using statistical analysis or metrics like Levenshtein 
distance  (Kang  et  al.,  2012).  However,  this  clustering  step  inevitably 
leads to information loss, which may result in performance degradation 
of water quality assessment methods. Conversely, the proposed LSTM- 
based method can directly use the BLS profile without clustering, and 
it can be expected to achieve relatively higher accuracy because it uses a 
larger  feature  domain.  Additionally,  computational  measures  such  as 
BLS entropy have limitations in capturing important information found

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is primarily for classification tasks. This is evident from the description of the model structure, which includes an input layer, three LSTM hidden layers, one dropout layer, and one dense layer. The dense layer is designed differently depending on the type of classification task - for binary classification, it has a single output with sigmoid activation function, while for multi-class classification, it has multiple outputs with softmax activation function. The goal of this model is to classify swimming behaviors of Caenorhabditis elegans based on their BLS entropy profiles. The simplicity of the model structure is intentional, aimed at making it usable on devices with limited computing power and enabling real-time predictions, all while maintaining good performance.
