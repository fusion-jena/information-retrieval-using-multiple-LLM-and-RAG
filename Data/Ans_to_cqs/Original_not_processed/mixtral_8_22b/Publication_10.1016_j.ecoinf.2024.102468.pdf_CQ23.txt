WT-HMM using varying dataset sizes over 10 runs.

Furthermore,  the  comparison  between  recording  months  provides 
valuable insights into the tradeoffs  associated with dataset size  selec-
tion. The superior performance of the WT-HMM in the 8 to 20-h dataset 
size  range  for  both  months  suggests  the  most  suitable  range  for 
achieving  high  accuracy.  This  finding  resonates  with  studies  empha-
sizing the importance of selecting appropriate sample sizes for effective 
model training (Kahl et al., 2021).

The observed increasing trend in both accuracy and F1-score for the 
WT-HMM across different dataset sizes aligns with findings in similar 
studies.  Previous  research  in  bioacoustics  has  highlighted  the  impor-
tance of dataset size in training robust models for cetacean vocalization 
classification  (Lu  et  al.,  2021;  Ogundile  et  al.,  2020;  Ogundile  et  al., 
2021; Usman et al., 2020). Larger datasets provide models with more 
diverse examples, aiding in the generalization of learned features and 
patterns. The consistent improvement in accuracy and F1-score for both 
recording periods indicates that the WT-HMM is not only effective for 
smaller datasets but also scales well as the dataset size increases. This 
scalability  is  a  crucial  characteristic,  especially  in  bioacoustic  moni-
toring where datasets can vary significantly in size (Xie et al., 2020).

Typically,  a  higher  F1-score  (score  close  to  1)  indicates  a  better 
model performance, as it signifies a better balance between precision 
and recall. A low F1-score (score close to 0) suggests that the model may 
struggle  to  accurately  classify  positive  instances  and/or  may  miss  a 
significant  number of  positive instances.  Since the  classification algo-
rithm involves an element of randomness, such as random initialization 
of weights in ANN or random sampling during training. The experiments 
are performed over different runs to help capture the variability intro-
duced by these random factors.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the study utilized varying dataset sizes ranging from 8 hours to 20 hours, which helped in providing diverse examples to the model. This diversity aids in the generalization of learned features and patterns, making the model more robust. Secondly, the experiments were conducted over multiple runs, specifically ten times, to capture the variability introduced by random factors such as random initialization of weights in artificial neural networks (ANNs) or random sampling during training. Lastly, while the text does not explicitly mention cross-validation or stratified splitting, the use of varying dataset sizes and conducting multiple runs could be seen as implicit methods to ensure the model's ability to perform well on unseen data, thus contributing to its generalizability.
