bands had dGI values below 300. The training samples were incorpo-
rated as a GEE asset. When the algorithm is run in FIREMAP the results 
are visualized in the main screen as a categorized BA map, and the re-
sults can be exported to the user's Google Drive account in ESRI shapefile 
format for the region of interest.

Query: "What are the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The tables provided do not explicitly state the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, we can infer some information based on the available data. In Table 1, there are wildfire events listed with their corresponding fire sizes and whether they were used for training or validation purposes. This suggests that the dataset was divided based on these specific wildfire events rather than individual data points. It appears that certain wildfire events were designated for training, while others were reserved for validation. Unfortunately, without more explicit information about the splitting criteria, it cannot be determined if any specific rules or thresholds were applied when dividing the data.
