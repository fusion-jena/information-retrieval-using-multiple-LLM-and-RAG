3. A proposed deep learning framework for highway AQ 
monitoring and prediction 

The proposed framework is a four-layered architecture composed of 
the hardware layer, data storage layer, integration layer and analytics 
layer as depicted in Fig. 2. This section introduces these layers and their 
functionalities.

and PM10 pollutants and evaluation using deep learning, future research 
can focus on investigating other pollutants such as CO2, SO2 and Ozone 
as well as other machine learning approaches for estimation. This study 
is a part of a series of publications highlighting research findings on the 
REVIS  project.  This  is  just  a  scratch  on  the  surface  of  our  research

Fig. 13. An illustration of captured NO2 pollutant readings (blue highlight) and the deep learning model predictions (red highlight). These results were derived from 
an evaluation using the validation dataset. It should be pointed out that the model's predictions are not too far off the actual readings. (For interpretation of the

Question: %INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the provided pieces of context to answer the query in less than 400 words. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

%Query
Query: "What are the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Fliping, Roating, Scaling)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available in the given context to determine which data augmentation techniques have been applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context only mentions the use of deep learning models but does not provide any details about the specific data augmentation techniques used. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to this query based on the given context.
