2.2.3. Deep learning 

Once transformed into a matrix or vector, the results of voice feature 
extraction serve as the input for a deep learning algorithm. This algo-
rithm discerns patterns within the data, enabling it to make predictions 
based on these learned patterns, all without the need for explicit pro-
gramming (Fran√ßa et al., 2021; Navamani, 2019). A critical distinction 
between deep learning and traditional machine learning is the feature- 
extraction  process  during  classification.  Feature  extraction  from  data 
typically requires manual or human intervention in traditional machine 
learning.  Contrastingly,  deep  learning  models  are  designed  to  auto-
matically perform feature extraction.

of the FFT window, 1024. The feature extraction parameters that yielded 
the best performance were employed during the feature extraction phase 
in optimizing the CNN deep learning model. The results of model opti-
mization  were  acquired  by  employing  identical  performance  metrics 
used in optimizing the feature extraction parameters (Fig. 13).

In the CNN, feature extraction is automatically performed through a 
convolution process that applies a convolution kernel to the input data 
and pooling, which progressively reduces the spatial size of data rep-
resentation (Fernandes et al., 2021). Using convolution layers, pooling, 
and the parameter-sharing feature also makes CNN effective and effi-
cient  in  classifying  data,  such  as  images  and  sound  recordings  (Kim 
et al., 2018). When processing voice-recorded data, a visual represen-
tation of the sound in the form of a spectrogram is generated (Thakur 
and Kumar, 2021). Therefore, as with image data, a CNN can be used to 
map  patterns  from  a  given  sound  recording  data  (a  mosquito  voice 
recording in this case). Additionally, it can produce considerably higher 
accuracy than other deep learning algorithms.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:

The paper does not provide specific information about the method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions using voice recordings of mosquitos as input data for the deep learning model. It can be assumed that the authors collected these voice recordings themselves or obtained them from another source. Unfortunately, there is no further detail regarding the collection method or any potential sources.
