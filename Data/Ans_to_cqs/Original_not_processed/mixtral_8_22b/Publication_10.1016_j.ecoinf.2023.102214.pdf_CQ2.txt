cation  studies,  a  lack  of  data  is  the  greatest  challenge  and  limitation 
researchers encounter (Schneider et al., 2019). With the data collection 
compiled  in  this  work,  we  contribute  the  largest  fully  labeled  snow 
leopard dataset for deep learning research. In addition, we anticipate 
that our novel deep learning methods will encourage other academics to 
contribute  more  datasets  to  Whiskerbook.org  for  the  purpose  of 
continuously curating and enhancing the data used to improve the deep 
learning pipeline. Comparing these results to those of an earlier study by 
Johansson et al. (2020) that depended on human manual classification, 
without  AI  or  software,  determined  that  observers  significantly  over-
estimate  the  true  abundance.  AI-based  individual  ID  within  Whiske 
rbook.org  has  demonstrated  the  potential  to  enhance  the  precision 
and  efficiency  of  manual  observers,  approaching  more  accurate  esti-

image classification for individual ID for various species and has been 
incorporated into software (Burgstaller et al., 2020; Crall et al., 2013; de 
Lorm et al., 2023; Khan et al., 2022; Miguel et al., 2019; Nipko et al., 
2020; Park et al., 2019; Verschueren et al., 2023). Recent advances in 
deep  learning  have  facilitated  the  growth  of  convolutional  neural 
network  (CNN)-based  systems  that  can  now  extract  layers  of  image 
characteristics for a wide variety of ecological and environmental image 
processing  concerns,  especially  for  camera  trapping  image  analysis 
(Bogucki et al., 2019; El Abbadi and Alsaadi, 2020; Nguyen et al., 2017b; 
Norouzzadeh  et  al.,  2018a;  Shi  et  al.,  2020).  Due  to  the  capacity  to 
reduce images to numerous layers of distinct patterns, these advanced 
feature  extraction  and  CNN-based  deep  learning  approaches  have 
demonstrated  promising  results  for  identifying  individuals  (Bhatta-

Image classification 

To assess the efficacy of the various techniques, we compute the top- 
k accuracy on a test set, where k = 1, 5, and 10 represents the position of 
the correct match (i.e., an annotation of the same individual represented 
by a query annotation) within a list of proposed matches. Consequently, 
a top-1 rank is an accurate result supplied by the algorithm as the most 
probable match for a candidate annotation. A top-5 rating indicates that 
the correct answer might be any of the top-5 values among the returned 
options, and so on.

Helpful Answer: The text does not explicitly state what type of data format is used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that researchers face challenges due to a lack of data in cation studies. It also discusses the use of deep learning methods for image classification for individual identification of various species, including snow leopards. Additionally, it refers to recent advances in deep learning that facilitate the growth of convolutional neural network (CNN)-based systems for image processing concerns, particularly for camera trapping image analysis. Therefore, based on this information, it can be inferred that one of the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline is likely images.

However, without explicit confirmation from the authors or additional context, it cannot be definitively stated whether other types of data formats such as audio, video, or CSV files are also utilized in the deep learning pipeline.
