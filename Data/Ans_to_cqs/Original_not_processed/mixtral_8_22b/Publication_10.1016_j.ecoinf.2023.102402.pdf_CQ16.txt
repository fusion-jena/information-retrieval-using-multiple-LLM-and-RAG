(0–0.335),  medium 
formance  classes  were  considered:  poor 
(0.336–0.665), and good (0.666–1).

2.4. Model validation 

The model's performance was  evaluated using the Area Under the 
receiver-operator  Curve  (AUC).  The  AUC  values  range  from  0  to  1, 
where values closer to 1 indicate a higher accuracy of model prediction 
(Fielding and Bell, 1997). In addition to the AUC, the True Skill Statistics 
(TSS) was calculated. TSS values range between (cid:0) 1 and + 1. A TSS value 
of +1 means complete agreement between observed and predicted dis-
tributions, whereas values of ≤0 denote no better than random perfor-
mance  (Allouche  et  al.,  2006).  AUC  and  TSS  are  the  methods  most 
commonly used to assess the model performance in species distribution 
model studies (e.g., Gaier and Resasco, 2023; Mondanaro et al., 2023; 
Song and Estes, 2023).

goodness-of-fit and complexity. The model with the lowest AICc value (i. 
e. ΔAICc = 0) is considered the best model out of the current suite of 
models;  all  models  with  ΔAICc  <2  are  generally  considered  to  have 
substantial  support  (Muscarella  et  al.,  2014).  The  model  parameter 
settings with the lowest AICc values (ΔAICc = 0) for both H. guttulatus 
and H. hippocampus were chosen to establish the final Maxent models 
(ENMeval outputs in supplementary materials, Appendix 2).

Helpful Answer:
Answer: Based on the given context, it appears that the model's performance is evaluated using two main criteria: the Area Under the receiver-operator Curve (AUC) and the True Skill Statistics (TSS). The AUC values range from 0 to 1, where values closer to 1 indicate a higher accuracy of model prediction. On the other hand, TSS values range between -1 and +1, where a TSS value of +1 means complete agreement between observed and predicted distributions, while values of ≤0 denote no better than random performance. Additionally, the Akaike Information Criterion corrected for small sample sizes (AICc) is also mentioned as a criterion for selecting the best model among a set of candidate models. However, none of these criteria directly address the completion of training or validation loss plateaus. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, I cannot provide a specific answer regarding the criteria used to determine when training is complete.
