Ways  in  which  to  minimize  biased  training  of  machine  learning 
models  with  clustered  data  is  an  outstanding  challenge  (e.g.,  Meyer 
et al., 2018, 2019). We hypothesize that the improvements to predictive 
performance observed here using covariance-weighted bagging may be 
a  result  of  reduced  bias  during  model  training  from  down-weighting 
over-sampled  information,  but  this  was  not  tested  explicitly.  A  suit-
able experiment to explore this topic could simulate a surface from a pre- 
defined combination of response functions to environmental variables, 
and  test  for  the  capacity  to  recover  the  responses  using  covariance 
weighted bagging under various clustering scenarios. Simultaneously, it 
would be informative to observe the automatic variable selection and 
regularization behaviour of the bagging model.

training  (i.e.,  bagging),  then  to  obtain  unbiased  estimates  of  model 
performance  without  omitting  portions  of  the  feature  space  during 
validation. An important note is that the latter procedure also enables 
leveraging of spatial autocorrelation information for model prediction. 
Bagging normally proceeds by drawing many bootstrap samples of 
the data and training models on each, which are aggregated to form an 
ensemble predictor (Breiman, 1996). Individual data points each have 
probability P(si) = 1
n  of being selected during a single draw of a single 
bootstrap sample, where si  is one of n data points distributed over the 
study  area.  Non-independent  data  observations  can  be  considered  as 
partial replication of some information in the modelling dataset. In an 
extreme example, consider two data points at the same location with 
exactly the same environmental measurements. We could conceptualize

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically performed on the input data to improve the quality of the model and its ability to learn effectively. These steps include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing or correcting any errors, inconsistencies, or missing values in the data. It ensures that the model is trained on accurate and reliable data.

2. Normalization: This step scales the input features so that they fall within a specific range, such as [0, 1] or [-1, 1]. Normalizing the data helps prevent certain features from dominating others due to their larger magnitudes, ensuring that all features contribute equally to the learning process.

3. Scaling: Similar to normalization, scaling adjusts the range of input features to ensure that they are comparable. Common scaling techniques include min-max scaling and z-score normalization.

4. Feature Selection: This step involves selecting only the most relevant features for training the model. By reducing the dimensionality of the input data, feature selection can help improve computational efficiency and reduce overfitting.

5. Encoding Categorical Variables: Deep learning models require numerical inputs, so categorical variables must be converted into numerical representations. Techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding can be used for this purpose.

6. Data Augmentation: To increase the size of the training dataset and introduce more variability, data augmentation techniques can be applied. For image data, this might involve rotations, translations, or flips; for text data, synonym replacement or back translation might be employed.
