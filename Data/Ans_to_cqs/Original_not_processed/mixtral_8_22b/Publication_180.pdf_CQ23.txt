Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

TensorFlow
TensorFlow is an open-source software platform (Abadi et al. 2016) 
that supports deep learning research and applications, having been 
released  by  researchers  at  Google  (Google  Brain  Team;  https://re-
search.google.com/teams/brain/).  We  adapted  and  configured 
TensorFlow  for  application  and  use  in  our  project  via  Python. We 
adjusted  two  parameters  from  their  default  values:  validation  per-
centage and number of training steps. Although the default setting 
for validation percentage was 10%, given small numbers of images 
available for some species, we had to increase this number to 16%. 
For number of training steps, although the default value was 4000 
steps,  we  explored  different  numbers  and  compared  the  results  to 
find  the  optimum  balance  between  computing  time  and  classifica-
tion efficiency.

We  calibrated  our  models  for  Mexican  and  Brazilian  spe-
cies  using  different  numbers  of  training  steps,  and  considered  two 
factors  to  find  optima  for  training TensorFlow  (Fig.  2):  1)  correct 
identification rate, which improved up to a certain point, but then 
reached  a  plateau,  beyond  which  we  saw  no  significant  improve-
ment,  and  2)  processing  time  (in  hours),  which  showed  a  positive 
linear relationship with number of training steps. For the Mexican 
dataset, with 12 species, 2,000 emerged as an optimum number of 
training steps, which resulted in an 83.0% overall identification rate 
(Fig. 2); the largest gap between the processing time trace and iden-
tification  rate  occurred  following  this  number  of  steps. Above  this 
number of training steps, subtle improvements in identification rate

high  capability  of  DNNs  has  resulted  in  widespread  use  of  these 
techniques in other such inference challenges (Schmidhuber 2015). 
DNNs have outperformed traditional methods (e.g., linear discrim-
inant  analyses)  in  various  classification  tasks  (Schmidhuber  2015). 
Here, we used TensorFlow (Abadi et al. 2016), an open-source soft-
ware  platform,  representing  the  most  recent  addition  to  the  deep 
learning  toolbox  (Rampasek  and  Goldenberg  2016;  Google  Brain 
Team;  https://research.google.com/teams/brain/),  to  explore  the 
challenge of automated Chagas disease vector identification.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The authors did not explicitly mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, they mentioned adapting and configuring TensorFlow for their project and adjusting two parameters - validation percentage and number of training steps - from their default values. They also mentioned exploring different numbers of training steps and comparing the results to find the optimum balance between computing time and classification efficiency. Additionally, they calibrated their models for Mexican and Brazilian species using different numbers of training steps and considered factors like correct identification rate and processing time to find optima for training TensorFlow. These actions suggest that the authors took steps to optimize the performance of their deep learning model, though explicit measures for ensuring its generalizability are not directly stated.
