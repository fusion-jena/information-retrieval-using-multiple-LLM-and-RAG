Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the paper titled "Monitoring ecosystem service change in the City of Shenzhen by the use of high-resolution remotely sensed imagery and deep learning" published in Land Degrad. Dev. 30, 1490–1501. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which optimization techniques were applied in this particular study. However, some commonly used optimization techniques in deep learning pipelines include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp), and others. These techniques help minimize the loss function during training and improve model performance. Without further details from the authors or the full text of the article, we cannot confirm which technique was employed in their research.
