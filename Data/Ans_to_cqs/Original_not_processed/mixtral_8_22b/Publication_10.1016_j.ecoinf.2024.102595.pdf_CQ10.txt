This research underscores the significant impact of machine learning 
(ML) and deep learning (DL) models on the oil palm sector, offering a 
path to precise yield predictions and sustainable crop management. It 
highlights the utility of these models in enhancing agricultural practices 
by considering soil composition, climate variations, and farming tech-
niques, thus aligning production with market demands and optimizing 
the supply chain. Agronomists are encouraged to adopt a comprehensive 
approach leveraging ML and DL for research and development. At the 
same  time,  farmers  can  benefit  from  data-driven  insights,  mainly 
through  the  Extra  Trees  Regressor  model,  to  improve  planning  and 
resource  management.  Additionally,  the  findings  serve  as  a  basis  for 
stakeholders,  including  policymakers  and  the  agribusiness  sector,  to 
support ML integration in agriculture, fostering operational efficiency,

The rising global demand for oil palm emphasizes the importance of accurate oil palm yield predictions. This 
predictive  capability  is  critical  for  effective  crop  management,  supply  chain  optimization,  and  sustainable 
farming practices. However, the oil palm sector faces challenges in yield projection, stressing a noteworthy gap in 
the application and evaluation of modern machine learning and deep learning technologies. Our study addressed 
this  gap  by  systematically  evaluating  17  machine  and  deep  learning  models  in  predicting  oil  palm  yield, 
incorporating various agronomic parameters, e.g., soil composition, climatic conditions, plant age, and farming 
techniques. This holistic approach enhances the application of machine and deep learning in agriculture. Using 
the  feature  selection  technique  and  a  maximum  depth  of  32  and  1000  estimators,  the  Extra  Trees  Regressor

Recognizing the significant role of oil palm, extensive research has been 
conducted,  as  evidenced  by  studies  from  Melidawati  et  al.  (2021), 
Tuerxun et al. (2020), and Ang et al. (2022), each contributing insights 
into  oil  palm  cultivation  and  management.  Predicting  oil  palm  crop 
yields is crucial to effectively managing and optimizing the palm supply 
chain. It requires the incorporation of multiple datasets and is influenced 
by numerous variables, including climate patterns, soil quality, fertilizer 
use, and seed varieties (Xu et al., 2019). Applying Machine learning and 
deep learning models can accurately predict crop yields, aiding farmers 
in harvest planning and crop management decisions (Attri et al., 2023). 
Although these techniques have been implemented across various crops 
for environment-based yield forecasting, their deployment for predictive 
analysis of oil palm yields remains in its infancy (Rajakal et al., 2021).
