structured and unstructured data, such as images and text [Jafarzadeh 
et  al., 2022]. The divergence extends  to computational requirements, 
where deep learning models typically demand more resources, including 
GPUs  (Graphics  Processing  Units)  or  TPUs  (Tensor  Processing  Units),

and involve lengthier training times compared to the computationally 
efficient XGBoost [Joshi et al., 2023]. Moreover, the interpretability of 
these models varies significantly. XGBoost stands out by offering feature 
importance scores and decision rules, contributing to a clearer under-
standing  of  its  decision-making  process.  Conversely,  deep  learning 
models  often  carry  the  label  of  “black  box”  due  to  their  complexity, 
making it challenging to interpret and comprehend how they arrive at 
specific predictions [Wu et al., 2021]. Additionally, the performance on 
small  datasets  is  another  distinctive  factor.  XGBoost  demonstrates 
effectiveness  even  with  limited  data  [Chen  and  Guestrin,  2016;  Jing 
et al., 2022], while deep learning models generally require substantial 
datasets to achieve optimal results [Wu et al., 2021; Khruschev et al., 
2022].

To  develop  a  model  for  Fv/Fm  parameter  estimation,  this  study 
employed  the  eXtreme  Gradient  Boosting  (XGBoost)  algorithm,  intro-
duced  by  Chen  and  Guestrin  (2016).  The  arguments  we  applied  to 
XGBoost are as follows: small dataset (two years collection), model ar-
chitecture  (decision  trees),  structured  data  (Fv/Fm  and  vegetation 
indices),  and  feature  importance  scores  (straightforward  and  easy  to 
understand). XGBoost and deep learning models, both classified under 
the  broader  category  of  ML,  exhibit  notable  distinctions  [Wu  et  al., 
2021]. In terms of model architecture, XGBoost adopts an ensemble of 
decision  trees  as  its  foundation,  providing  a  structure  particularly 
effective  for  handling  structured  data  [Chen  and  Guestrin,  2016].  In 
contrast,  deep  learning  models  leverage  artificial  neural  networks 
characterized by multiple layers, allowing them to accommodate both

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model was not explicitly stated in the given context. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the deep learning model could have been used for various purposes such as image recognition, natural language processing, or predictive modeling. Deep learning models are known for their ability to learn from large amounts of data and can be used for tasks like object detection, semantic segmentation, or speech recognition. Without additional context, it would be difficult to determine the specific purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the passage.
