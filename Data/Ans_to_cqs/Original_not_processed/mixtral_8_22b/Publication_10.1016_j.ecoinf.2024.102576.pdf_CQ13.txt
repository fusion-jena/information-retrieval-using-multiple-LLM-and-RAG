the satellite. The labeling part determines the labeling methodology for 
training  the  deep  learning  model.  In  the  classification  part,  a  deep 
learning model was trained based on the results of previous steps. The 
target PSI, which has the same format as the trained PSI, can be classi-
fied using the trained model. Here, the format refers to the spatial res-
olution and spectral band used, interval in PSI, and chronological order 
of  each  band.  If  satellite  imagery  accumulates  owing  to  continuous 
satellite observations, the PSI can also be continuously generated, and 
classification can be continued using the model. This enables PCF land 
monitoring.

The use of deep learning models has become prevalent across various 
scientific  fields.  Specifically,  these  models  have  demonstrated  excep-
tional  performance  in  image  classification.  Consequently,  numerous 
researchers are employing these models for land-cover classification and 
extraction of ecological information (Capinha et al., 2021; Jagannathan 
and Divya, 2021; Kırbas¸ and Çifci, 2022; Passah and Kandar, 2023). The 
U-Net model, a type of convolutional neural network (CNN), is a deep 
learning  algorithm  that  performs  classification  through  supervised 
learning  (Ulmas  and  Liiv,  2020).  The  model  was  trained  using  both 
training and validation data, and classification was performed based on 
these data (Kattenborn et al., 2021). Consequently, the availability of 
labeling data is crucial for U-Net model applications. However, in North 
Korea, there is no official land-cover map based on national-scale field

the  research conducted  by Kim et  al. (2021a).  Therefore, even in the 
absence of specific classes, using phenological characteristics, elements 
can still be classified on the basis of using classes that are most relevant. 
As  suggested  by  Kim  et  al.  (2021a),  the  classification  accuracy  and 
performance improved as data increased during the training of a deep 
learning  model  using  satellite  imageries  over  multiple  periods,  (Kim 
et al., 2021b). Therefore, the characteristics of a deep-learning model 
can be used effectively. As a result, by employing PCF with DA, we could

To generate training data for the PCF, 16,660 grid cells with a res-
olution  of  2560  m  were  created  in  South  Korea.  This  resolution  was 
selected because the training unit of the U-Net model was 256 pixels, 
and 2560 m contains 256 pixels of Sentinel-2 with a 10 m resolution. 
Fig. 6a and b show the extracted results, where 8330 cells (half of the 
total) were randomly extracted as a mask for training data in Fig. 6a, and 
3,332 cells (20% of the total) were randomly extracted as a mask for 
validation data in Fig. 6b. The PSI was extracted from Fig. 6a and b to 
prepare input data for model training. The sub-class land-cover map of 
South Korea can be transformed into a macro-class land-cover map by 
converting all sub-class items into macro-class items (Fig. 4). This con-
version  process  resulted  in  the  production  of  a  completely  converted 
sub-class  land-cover  map  of  South  Korea,  as  shown  in  Fig.  6c.  Addi-

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, the given context does not provide any explicit details about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the optimizer. It primarily focuses on describing the overall process of generating training data for the Phenological Cycle Feature (PCF) using satellite images and the application of the U-Net model for land cover classification. To find out more about the specific hyperparameters used in this study, it would be necessary to refer to the original source material or contact the authors directly.
