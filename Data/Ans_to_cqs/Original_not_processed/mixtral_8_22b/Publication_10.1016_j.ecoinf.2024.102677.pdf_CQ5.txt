(1)  Dataset construction

(2)  Model selection 

In recent years, deep learning has made rapid progress in the field of 
image  recognition,  thus  greatly  improving  computer  processing. Con-
volutional neural network (CNN) is a popular deep learning architecture 
applied to image classification with good performance in the extraction 
of underlying abstract features (Meng et al., 2022). Convolution layers, 
pooling layers, fully connected layers, and nonlinear operations consti-
tute the CNN model (Attri et al., 2023). We fine-tuned several state-of- 
the-art  CNN  architectures,  including  the  Visual  Geometry  Group 
(VGG)  (Simonyan  and  Zisserman,  2014),  Inception  (Szegedy  et  al., 
2016), and residual network (ResNet) (He et al., 2016) CNNs, using the 
training dataset, and we evaluated their respective  performances. We 
selected from these networks the most effective model to create the rural

4.2. Landscape type classification 

The  five  network  models  were  evaluated  using  the  performance 
metrics  of  the  validation  and  test  sets.  The  model  accuracy  was 
continuously assessed using the validation set during training, and the 
performance of the testing set guided the final decision. Fig. 6 illustrates 
the  learning  curves,  indicating  a  reduction  in  training  losses  as  the 
number  of  epochs  increases  and  convergence  within  500  epochs. 
Inceptionv3  converges  by  400  epochs,  while  the  other  networks 
converge  within  150  epochs.  The  ResNet  architecture,  especially 
ResNet50 and ResNet101, outperforms the others.

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given information, it appears that the authors have not explicitly mentioned the specific datasets used for training or evaluating their deep learning models such as VGG, Inception, and ResNet. However, they do mention that they constructed a dataset for this purpose. Therefore, without additional context, I cannot provide the exact names of the datasets used in their deep learning pipeline.
