The challenge for applying deep learning to natural systems is the need for large training datasets.
A lack of training data is a pervasive problem in remote sensing due to the cost of data collection
and annotation [13]. In addition, the spatial extent of training data often prohibits the ﬁeld-based
veriﬁcation of annotated objects. For tree detection, the high variation in tree crown appearance, due
to taxonomy, health status, and human management, increases the risk of overﬁtting when using small
amounts of training data [10]. One approach to addressing the data limitation in deep learning is
“self-supervised learning” (sensus [14]), which uses unsupervised methods to generate training data
that is used to train supervised models [15]. This approach has recently been applied to remote sensing
for hyperspectral image classiﬁcation [9]. Self-supervision, which only relies on unlabeled data, can be

for learning both bounding boxes and image classes. Retinanet diﬀers from other object detection
frameworks, such as RCNN, by combining object detection and classiﬁcation into a single network.
This allows for faster training and it decreases the sensitivity to the number of box proposals among
the images [25]. We used a resnet-50 classiﬁcation backbone that was pretrained on the ImageNet
dataset [27]. We experimented with deeper architectures (resnet-101 and resnet-152), but found no
improvement where oﬀset increased the training time.

1. Introduction

Image-based artiﬁcial intelligence can advance our understanding of individual organisms, species,
and ecosystems by greatly increasing the scale and eﬃciency of data collection [1]. The growing
availability of sub-meter airborne imagery brings opportunities for the remote sensing of biological
landscapes that scales from individual organisms to global systems. However, the laborious,
non-reproducible, and costly annotation of these datasets limits the use of this imagery [2].

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, there is mention of one dataset used in the deep learning pipeline - the ImageNet dataset. Specifically, a resnet-50 classification backbone was used, which had been pretrained on the ImageNet dataset. Other datasets mentioned in the references include the MNIST dataset and the CIFAR dataset, although they were not explicitly stated as being used in the deep learning pipeline described in the text. It should also be noted that the authors experimented with different architectures (resnet-101 and resnet-152), but did not find any improvement compared to the resnet-50 architecture.
