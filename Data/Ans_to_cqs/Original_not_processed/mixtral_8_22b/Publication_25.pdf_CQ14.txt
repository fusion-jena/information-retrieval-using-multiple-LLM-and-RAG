The full model reduces the extraneous boxes and improves the segmentation of large trees by
combining the self-supervised and the hand annotated datasets (Figure 7). The full model has optimal
performance in areas of well-spaced large trees (Figure 7B), but it tends to under-segment small clusters
of trees (Figure 7C).

Figure 7. Predictions from the full model on data withheld from model training. Canopy complexity
increases from (A) well-deﬁned large trees to (B) mixed-species canopies to (C) tightly packed clusters
of trees. As canopy complexity increases, the full model tends to under-segment small tree clusters.

solely using the hand-annotated data. This allows for a direct comparison of the contribution of
high-quality annotations when compared to the self-supervised model or the full model combining
both self-supervision and hand-annotation data.

improve with a combination of better validation data and more hand-annotated training samples.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate response regarding whether they used methods such as grid search or random search.
