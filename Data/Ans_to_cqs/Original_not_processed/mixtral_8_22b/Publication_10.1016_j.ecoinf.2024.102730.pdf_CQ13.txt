To evaluate how well the models performed, we used three standard
metrics: MSE, mean average error (MAE), and the coefficient of deter-
mination (r2). For the grid search, we focused on minimizing the MSE to
identify the optimal set of hyperparameters. Prior to conducting the grid
search, we divided our data into a training set (80% of the data) and a
test set (20% of the data). This split ensures that the models are trained
on one portion of the data and tested on a separate, previously unseen
portion, allowing us to assess their ability to generalize to new, unseen
data accurately.

2.3.3. SHAP values

After training the MLP models, we computed SHAP values using the
model-agnostic Kernel SHAP method to understand which features are
most important in predicting the start and (height of the) peak of the
greening season. We used the implementation in the Python SHAP
package for this analysis Lundberg et al. (2017).

Despite massive advancements in the field of machine learning (ML)
during the last decade, ML is not yet often used for vegetation studies.
ML models can be used for various tasks, among which are classification,
regression, and image segmentation. In ML, models extract knowledge
from data and use this knowledge to produce an output relevant to the
task at hand. These models use three main learning paradigms: super-
vised learning, unsupervised learning or reinforcement learning. This
study only considers the first paradigm, as we build a regression model.
Within supervised learning, there are a multitude of model types, for
example, support vector machines (Hearst et al., 1998), boosted tree
ensembles (e.g., XGBoost (Chen and Guestrin, 2016) or LightGBM (Ke
et al., 2017)) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) (McCulloch and
Pitts, 1943). This analysis will use ANNs, particularly multilayer per-
ceptrons (MLPs), which are fully connected feedforward neural net-

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The study uses a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model for its deep learning approach. The hyperparameters used in the model include the number of neurons in the first and second layers, the strength of the L2 regularization term, the solver for weight optimization, initial learning rate, learning rate schedule for weight updates, maximum number of iterations, and maximum number of iterations with no improvement. The specific range of these hyperparameters can be found in Table 2 of the given context. The optimal values for each parameter were determined through a grid search process, focusing on minimizing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) metric.
