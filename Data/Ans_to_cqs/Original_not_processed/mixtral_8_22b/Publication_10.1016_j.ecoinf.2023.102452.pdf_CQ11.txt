The Ajichai basin has been extensively studied in prior research. By 
comparing  the  outcomes  of  various  utilized  Intelligent  Visualization 
Systems (IVSs) such as SOM, GCA, and PSO with the proposed GP, we 
have  determined  the  superiority  of  GP  in  this  particular  case  study 
(Dariane and Behbahani, 2022). In the second step, Genetic Program-
ming was employed to model all the scenarios, and the top 10 accurate 
models (trees) for each scenario were selected to extract the best inputs 
for the ANN model. The GP modeling incorporated various functions, 
including constant value, input variables, addition, subtraction, multi-
plication, division, negation, sine, cosine, exponential, and power. The 
ANN  model  was  implemented  using  the  FORTRAN  platform,  and  the 
training of the ANN network was performed using the Fully Informed 
Particle Swarm Optimization (FIPSO) algorithm. The ANN architecture

%Query
Query: "What is the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no information available regarding the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in the given context. It seems that the authors did not provide any specific links or references to the datasets they used in their studies. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact location of the dataset used in these studies. However, some general resources related to deep learning pipelines are mentioned in the context, such as Eureqa, which is a software tool developed by Nutonian for automated discovery of scientific equations from experimental data. Additionally, several other papers and articles are cited in the context, which may contain relevant information about the use of deep learning techniques in different fields, including hydrology, ecology, and environmental science.
