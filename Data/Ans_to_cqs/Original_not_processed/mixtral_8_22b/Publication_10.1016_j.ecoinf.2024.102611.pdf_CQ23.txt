4.3. Generalizability to specificity

Table  3  gives  insights  into  the  distribution  of  trained,  tested,  and 
validated samples across  the groups. The data suggest that consistent 
ratios across groups are maintained in the sampling process to avoid any 
potential bias during classification. Different samples are present across 
groups to establish the reliability and generalizability of the model. For 
evaluation,  both  validation  and  test  sets  are  considered  separately  to 
fine-tune the model’s hyperparameters, leading to generalizability and 
scalability towards unseen datasets. 

4.5. Classifier specifications 

The Random Forest (RF) classifier is used in both levels of the hier-
archical classification model for performing group and plant-level pre-
dictions. Let several estimators N and Fi(x) be the function of predicting 
̂
the ith  decision tree for the input X, then the prediction 
C by RF is given 
by (9).

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model, B.R. Pushpa et al. took several measures. Firstly, they maintained consistent ratios across different groups while training, testing, and validating the samples. This was done to prevent potential biases during classification. Secondly, they included diverse samples across various groups to establish the reliability and generalizability of the model. Thirdly, they utilized separate validation and test sets for evaluation purposes. These sets helped fine-tune the model's hyperparameters, contributing to its scalability and applicability to unseen datasets. Lastly, it can be inferred from the use of a Random Forest (RF) classifier in both levels of the hierarchical classification model that cross-validation might have been employed. However, this information isn't explicitly stated in the provided context. In summary, maintaining consistent ratios, using diverse samples, employing separate validation and test sets, and possibly implementing cross-validation techniques ensured the generalizability of the deep learning model developed by B.R. Pushpa et al.
