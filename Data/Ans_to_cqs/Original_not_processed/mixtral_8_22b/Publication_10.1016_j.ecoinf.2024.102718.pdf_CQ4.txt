leverage transformer capabilities with these existing models. This
combination ensures effective and complementary strengths for our

large-scale image datasets. Various methods have been explored for
vision transformers including contrastive learning and self-distillation

individual extraction of features. Such techniques acquire characteris-
tics directly from the unprocessed data,
improving accuracy and
robustness (Archana and Jeevaraj, 2024; Mumuni and Mumuni, 2024;
Yang et al., 2023a). In addition, deep learning effectively manages
extensive datasets, enhancing the ability to apply knowledge across
many scenarios in agricultural settings.

3.3.1. Preprocessing

Our preprocessing pipeline summarized in Table 4 involves a series
of modifications meant to enhance computational performance and
ensure consistency. Initially, we reduced the images to a workable scale
of 224 × 224 pixels. To boost the diversity of our dataset, we applied
data augmentation techniques. These comprised modifications in
brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue, along with random horizontal
and vertical flips, and random rotations up to thirty degrees. Addition-
ally, Gaussian noise is incorporated to improve the robustness of our
model in different conditions. However, Figs. 3 and 4 exhibit mean
pictures employed in statistical analysis of our dataset’s image data. The
resolution of the images utilized to construct the mean images was low
leading to a loss of detail and clarity in the final averaged images in the
datasets.
