2022).  The  most  important  feature  of  the  code  is  that  all  parameters 
depend  on  important  local  conditions  which  cannot  be  ignored  (e.g. 
Russo  et  al.,  2018;  Russo  and  Jones,  2002;  Voigt  et  al.,  2021). 
Acknowledging that no study areas are the same would demand more 
from a researcher in terms of understanding the local bat fauna. ABBA 
and the R-code in supplement S1 can be used to prepare data to be used 
in  statistical  modeling,  although  the  researcher  would  have  to 
acknowledge that the species assignments are probabilities and not ab-
solutes.  Manual  species  assignments  may  be  considered  by  many  re-
searchers  as  being  absolute  IDs,  but  the  evidence  suggests  otherwise 
(Rydell  et  al.,  2017,  Montauban  et  al.,  2021,  this  study).  Hence, 
Bayesian  approximation  should  not  be  considered  inferior  to  manual 
analysis in terms of uncertainty.

classified, due to the adoption of higher or lower frequencies. The R-

%Query
Query: "What is the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the code repository link for any deep learning pipeline. It discusses various aspects related to species identification using machine learning techniques and mentions an R-code available in supplement S1. However, there is no mention of a specific deep learning pipeline or its corresponding code repository link. Therefore, I am unable to provide the requested information based on the given context.
