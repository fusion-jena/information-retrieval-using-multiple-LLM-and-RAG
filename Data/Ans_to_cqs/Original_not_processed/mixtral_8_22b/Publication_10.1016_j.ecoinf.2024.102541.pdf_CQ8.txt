Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

tionally, our technique is compared with state-of-the-art deep learning models, and from the baseline model we 
recorded  a  17.65%  increase  in  FPS,  28.55%  model  parameters  reduction,  and  50.92%  in  FLOPs  reduction. 
Furthermore, our model has a faster model loading time, which is critical for deployment in remote areas. This 
enables real-time species recognition on basic hardware, aiding conservation efforts through rapid analysis. The 
model advances deep learning in ecology by balancing efficiency with performance.

%Query
Query: "Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. None of the references or citations mentioned provide any details about the location of the source code. It could be hosted on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket, but without further information, it's impossible to give a definitive answer.
