harmonizing  the  enhancement  of  carbon  sinks  with  ecological  risk 
reduction to ensure the prolonged stability of carbon sink ecosystems. 
On the one hand, optimizing carbon sinks is pivotal not only for climate 
change mitigation but also as a foundation for biodiversity protection 
and the sustenance of ecosystem services (Adelisardou et al., 2021; Piao 
et al., 2019). Regions with significant carbon stocks often coincide with 
biodiversity hotspots, making their protection vital for ecosystem health

5.3. Limitations and further prospects 

Certain limitations remain in the study that future research should 
address. First of all, the framework relies on a matrix that aligns carbon 
sinks  priorities  with  landscape  risks,  but  it  may  not  capture  the  full 
complexity  of  carbon  sink  dynamics.  Future  investigations  should 
further analyze natural factors, such as ecosystem services, biodiversity, 
ecosystems’  sensitivity  and  climate  change  resilience,  to  refine  in-
dicators assessing carbon sink capacity and risk. (Yang et al., 2021; Onil 
Banerjee et al., 2020). Moreover, while the MCDA methods provide a 
structured  analysis,  their  reliance  on  fixed  weights  and  scores  might 
impede their adaptability to evolving varous conditions. A more flexible 
intelligent algorithms scoring system would improve responsiveness to 
environmental  changes,  enhancing  the  framework’s  ability  to  tackle 
emerging ecological challenges (Krivoguz, 2024).
