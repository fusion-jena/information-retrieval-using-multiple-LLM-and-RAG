randomly  splitting  all  individual  observations.  This  data  splitting  ap-
proach is generally considered optimum in machine learning as it does 
not  introduce  any  systematic  differences  between  the  test  and  train 
datasets. To perform the RY data splitting, individual observations were 
grouped according to year of capture and years were randomly selected 
for inclusion in the train and test datasets. Although this may produce 
systematic  differences  between  the  test  and  train  datasets,  it  ensures 
that  the  model  is  tested  using  previously  unseen  combinations  of  ex-
planatory  variables  and  is  therefore  a  more  robust  test  of  model  per-
formance in this context.

between the response and explanatory variables is not specified, instead 
a learning algorithm is used to find patterns in the data. Due to these 
flexible properties, GBRT were selected as a suitable method for iden-
tifying  potential  drivers  of  changes  in  growth  across  the  two  herring 
populations.

2.4.2.  Hyperparameters 

Hyperparameter tuning was done manually. As a starting point the 
learning rate was set as low as possible and the number of iterations as 
high as computationally feasible (Hastie et al., 2009). The learning rate, 
which is also called a shrinkage parameter, determines the contribution 
of each tree to the model. The maximum tree depth which reflects the 
degree of interaction in the model is usually low. GBRT performs best 
using fairly shallow trees, so-called tree stumps.

Helpful Answer:
The context provided mentions several sources of data used in the analysis of herring populations. These include reports from the ICES Herring Assessment Working Group (HAWG) from 2014 and 2015, which likely contain survey data or other forms of collected information on herring populations. Additionally, there is mention of historical reconstructed sea surface temperature (SST) data derived from satellite imagery and in-situ observations, provided by Reynolds, National Climatic Data Center and MET Office Hadley Centre EN4 quality controlled ocean data version: EN.4.2.1. This suggests that remote sensing technology and publicly available datasets are also used as sources of raw data. However, specific details about the exact methods used for collecting raw data are not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
