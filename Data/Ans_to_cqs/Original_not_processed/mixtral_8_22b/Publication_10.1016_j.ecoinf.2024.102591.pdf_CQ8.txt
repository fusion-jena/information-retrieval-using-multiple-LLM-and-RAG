Google Earth Engine  (GEE; Gorelick  et al.,  2017) is  a  cloud-based 
platform 
to  high-performance 
computing with high applicability in wildfire science (e.g. Parks et al., 
2018; Piao et al., 2022; Roteta et al., 2021) because it hosts a vast remote 
sensing  data  catalog  in  the  petabyte  scale,  including  European  Space 
Agency  (ESA)  and  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration 
(NASA) datasets over 40-years. These datasets can be readily processed 
at very large spatial scales using automatic parallel processing (Gorelick 
et al., 2017), taking advantage of advanced image processing techniques 
and machine learning (ML) algorithms (Amani et al., 2020). However, 
JavaScript, Python or R application programming interface (API) and 
the associated interactive development environment (IDE) in GEE still 
requires a high-level technical expertise.

does not assume a specific distribution of the response variable, and is 
largely  computationally-efficient  in  GEE  (Belgiu  and  Dr˘agut¸,  2016; 
Breiman, 2001; Lary et al., 2016; Quintano et al., 2023; Roteta et al., 
2021). The default RF hyperparameters in the GEE implementation were 
preserved,  except  for  the  number  of  trees,  which  was  set  to  500  to 
improve  computational  efficiency  without  losing  precision  in  the  BA 
estimates as determined by recursive validation of the BA classification 
algorithm over independent wildfires (see Section 3.1). We calculated 
the mean decrease in the Gini Index (dGI) to assess RF variable impor-
tance on classification accuracy.
