with the full dataset where significantly higher values for all evaluation
measurements (RMSE, MSE, MAE and R2) were observed. Addionally,
the three models (ANFIS, ANN, and SVM) performed similar evalution
measurements when were trained using the BTS, which also prove that
the selection of most representative and variable scenarios for training is
effective to improve machine learning models performance.

Helpful Answer: The text does not explicitly mention the use of a deep learning model. However, it mentions the use of several machine learning models such as Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). These models are evaluated based on four different measurements: Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R2 score. These metrics are commonly used to assess the quality of predictions made by regression models. They measure the difference between predicted and actual values, with lower values indicating better performance.
