During the DeepLabV3+ model training process, feeding large-size 
images directly to the network may lead to memory overflow. There-
fore, it is necessary to cut all remote sensing images and semantic labels 
of land cover classes into a series of regular image blocks for input. To 
maximize the sample size and maintain consistency with the cropping 
approach in the model prediction stage, we set the cropping size to 32 ×
32  pixels  with  a  redundancy  rate  of  0.5.  In  continuing,  70%  of  the 
dataset  was  used  for  training  and  the  remaining  for  validation.  The 
training set was enhanced by: (i) Flipping the images and labels along 
the X or Y axis; (ii) Exchanging between multiple image channels while 
the  labels remain unchanged; (iii)  Randomly rotating  the images and 
◦
labels by 90
; and (iv) randomly adding noise to the 
images  while  maintaining  the  labels  unchanged  (Ye  et  al.,  2022).

3.1. DeepLabV3+ algorithm 

DeepLabV3+ is a CNN algorithm for semantic segmentation, which 
is the latest version of the DeepLab algorithms family (Scepanovic et al., 
2021).  In  the  encoding  stage,  DeepLabV3+ introduces  dilated  convo-
lutions,  which expands  the  receptive field  without losing information 
(Fig.  3).  The  Atrous  spatial  pyramid  pooling  module  with  dilated 
convolution  has  been  mainly  designed  to  appropriately  incorporate 
multi-scale information. During decoding, it is capable of enhancing the 
accuracy  of  segmentation  boundaries  by  further  integrating  low-level 
features with high-level features (Liu et al., 2021a).

DeepLabV3+ algorithm was developed by the PyTorch (1.12.1) li-
brary,  using  the  Python  (3.9)  programming  language  in  the  present 
investigation. Xception was chosen as the backbone network (Li et al., 
2022),  and  dilated  convolutions  with  different  dilation  rates  were 
employed for feature extraction. The selected loss function was Cross-
EntropyLoss with an initial learning rate of 0.001, a batch size of 4, and 
epochs  of  150  (Zhang  et  al.,  2022).  In  selecting  the  optimizer  and 
learning rate adjustment strategies, this study compared the SGD and 
Adam algorithms and experimented approach with various strategies, 
including  StepLR,  CosineAnnealingLR,  and  ReduceLROnPlateau. 
Finally, it was found that utilizing Adam in combination with Reduc-
eLROnPlateau could accelerate the convergence rate of model training 
and effectively reduce the risk of overfitting. The operating principle of

ReduceLROnPlateau was as follows: If the validation loss value did not 
decrease  after  5  consecutive  epochs,  the  learning  rate  was  halved.  If 
there was no decrease in the validation loss value after 10 consecutive 
epochs, the training process was terminated. Both model training and 
inference were executed on a GeForce RTX 3070 GPU.

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model such as DeepLabV3+, several preprocessing steps are typically involved. These steps help prepare the data for efficient and effective model training. Based on the given context, the following preprocessing steps are mentioned:

1. Image Cropping: Large-sized images can cause memory overflow during the training process. Therefore, all remote sensing images and their corresponding semantic labels are cut into smaller, regular image blocks. This step helps manage memory usage and allows for more efficient processing.

2. Data Augmentation: To increase the amount of training data and improve the model's ability to generalize, data augmentation techniques are applied. These include flipping images and labels along the X or Y axes, exchanging between multiple image channels, randomly rotating images and labels by 90 degrees, and adding random noise to the images while keeping the labels unchanged.

3. Normalization: Although not explicitly mentioned in the context, normalizing the pixel values of the images is often a crucial preprocessing step in deep learning models. Normalization scales the pixel values to a specific range (usually between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1) to ensure consistent input ranges across different samples.

4. Label Preparation: Semantic label preparation involves assigning class labels to each pixel in the image. For example, if the task is land cover classification, each pixel might be assigned a label representing its respective land cover type (e.g., water, forest, urban area, etc.).

These preprocessing steps aim to enhance the quality and quantity of the training dataset, ultimately improving the performance and robustness of the deep learning model.
