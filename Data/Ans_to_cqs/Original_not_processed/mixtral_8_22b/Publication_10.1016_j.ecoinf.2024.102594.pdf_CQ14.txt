8.55% compared to the UAV_2.5 m model, and the OA of the UAV_16m 
model has reduced by 7.78% compared to the UAV_10m model. Mean-
while,  the  discrepancies  in  the  classification  results  were  mainly 
distributed in the karst landscape area in the southern part of the study 
area and marked in  red in  Fig. 6, and  most of the PlatSpe and  water 
surrounded by mixed forests could not be accurately identified.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The paper titled "Enhancing Land Cover/Land Use (LCLU) classification through a comparative analysis of hyperparameters optimization approaches for deep neural network (DNN)" discusses the optimization of hyperparameters for DNN models used in land cover/land use classification. However, it does not explicitly mention which specific methods such as grid search or random search are used for this purpose. Instead, it focuses on comparing different optimization algorithms like Bayesian Optimization, Genetic Algorithm, and Particle Swarm Optimization. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot determine the exact method used for hyperparameter optimization in this case.
