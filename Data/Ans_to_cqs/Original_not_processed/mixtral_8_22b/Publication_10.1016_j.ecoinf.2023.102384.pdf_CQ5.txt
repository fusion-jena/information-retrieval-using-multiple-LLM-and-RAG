Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The papers mentioned do not explicitly state the use of specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, some relevant datasets can be identified from the given context. For instance, Wang et al. (2020) introduced the dataset called 'Pest24,' which is a large-scale dataset containing very small objects of agricultural pests for multi-target detection. Additionally, Li et al. (2019) developed an automatic localization and count system for agricultural crop pests based on an improved deep learning pipeline, but they did not specify the exact dataset used. Similarly, other studies focused on detecting various types of pests like whiteflies, thrips, and insects from field images using deep learning techniques, but no explicit mention was made regarding the use of popular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
