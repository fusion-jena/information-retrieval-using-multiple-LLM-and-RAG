Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, it discusses the optimization of the Landscape Transformation Rule (LTR) algorithm by Runge et al. (2022), which improved overall accuracy and kappa compared to default parameters. This optimization process might involve techniques similar to regularization methods to avoid overfitting, but the text does not specify this. Therefore, based on the information available, I cannot determine the exact regularization methods used in their deep learning pipeline.
