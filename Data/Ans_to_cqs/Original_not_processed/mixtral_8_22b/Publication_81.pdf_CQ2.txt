Abstract: Fish is one of the most extensive distributed organisms in the world. Fish taxonomy
is an important component of biodiversity and the basis of ﬁshery resources management. The
DNA barcode based on a short sequence fragment is a valuable molecular tool for ﬁsh classiﬁcation.
However, the high dimensionality of DNA barcode sequences and the limitation of the number of
ﬁsh species make it difﬁcult to reasonably analyze the DNA sequences and correctly classify ﬁsh
from different families. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning method that fuses Elastic
Net-Stacked Autoencoder (EN-SAE) with Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), named ESK model. In
stage one, the ESK preprocesses original data from DNA barcode sequences. In stage two, EN-SAE is
used to learn the deep features and obtain the outgroup score of each ﬁsh. In stage three, KDE is
used to select a threshold based on the outgroup scores and classify ﬁsh from different families. The

Deep learning, a method for learning and extracting useful representations from
raw data, training model, and then using the model to make predictions, has made great
progress in recent years [36]. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel method using
DNA barcode sequences through deep learning model to classify ﬁsh from different families
and determine which ﬁsh are regarded as outgroups, called ESK model. First, the method
aligns DNA sequences to obtain the sequences with the same length, then, converts them
into numerical data by using one-hot encoding. Second, the model uses Elastic Net-Stacked
Autoencoder (EN-SAE) to learn data features and obtains an outgroup score of each object.
Finally, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is used to generate a threshold and predict which
ﬁsh are outgroups base on the threshold. To verify the effectiveness of ESK model, three
families with a large number of species and obvious interspeciﬁc variation are selected as

To solve the problem of high dimensionality of DNA barcode sequences, we introduce
a deep learning model to extract useful features and classify ﬁsh from different families,
which is effective and robust.
To address the problem of overﬁtting caused by small dataset due to the limited
number of species in the family, the Elastic Net is introduced for the proposed method
to improve the generalization ability.

• We employ EN-SAE model to receive the outgroup scores. The decision threshold is
automatically learned by the KDE technique. A novel predictor is proposed based on
the outgroup scores, while other classiﬁcation studies often omit the importance of
automatic learning threshold.

• We quantitatively evaluate the performance of our method, and the results show
that the ESK model outperforms four commonly used machine learning methods.
The effectiveness and feasibility of using the proposed model for ﬁsh classiﬁcation
is demonstrated.

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, the authors describe a deep learning method for fish classification using DNA barcode sequences. They use DNA sequences as input data, align them to have the same length, and convert them into numerical data using one-hot encoding. This indicates that the data format used in their deep learning pipeline is not directly related to common multimedia formats like images, audio, or video but rather involves processing genetic information. Specifically, they work with DNA sequences represented numerically after alignment and conversion via one-hot encoding.
