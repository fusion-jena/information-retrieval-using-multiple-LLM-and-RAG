Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The paper does not provide explicit information about specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in their deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions several types of satellite data used in different batches:

1. Visible (red, green, and blue) bands of Sentinel-2 data
2. Twelve multispectral (MS) bands of Sentinel-2 data
3. MS bands combined with spectral indices
4. MS bands combined with spectral features and Sentinel-1 bands
5. MS bands combined with spectral features, textural features, and Sentinel-1 bands
6. MS bands combined with spectral features, textural features, Sentinel-1 bands, and Digital Surface Model (DSM)

These datasets are derived from various sources like Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 satellites, which provide multispectral and radar images respectively. Additionally, they mention the use of spectral indices, spectral features, textural features, and DSMs. These datasets are likely used for training and testing deep learning models in the research.
