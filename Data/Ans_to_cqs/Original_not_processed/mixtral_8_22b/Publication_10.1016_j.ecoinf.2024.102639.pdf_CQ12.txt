In animal behavior studies, the integration of Machine Learning (ML) 
and  Deep  Learning  (DL)  methodologies  represents  a  significant  para-
digm  shift.  Traditionally,  these  advanced  computational  techniques, 
renowned for their predictive accuracy in fields such as artificial intel-
ligence  (Marar,  2024),  image  processing  (Zhang  et  al.,  2015),  neuro-
science (Dixon and Polson, 2020), and genomics (Xiao and Segal, 2009), 
have not been extensively harnessed for modeling or predicting animal 
movement. Such approaches extend the application of these technolo-
gies beyond their conventional domains and aim to transcend the mere 
prediction  of  behavior.  The  objective  is  to  craft  a  methodology  that 
utilizes machine learning to forecast behavioral patterns and intricately 
map animals’ actual movement trajectories.

and deep learning provides powerful tools for pattern recognition, albeit 
with  challenges  in  data  requirements  and  interpretability  (see  (Barak 
and  Tsodyks,  2023;  Kliegr  et  al.,  2020;  Kuru  et  al.,  2023;  Tron  and 
Margaliot, 2004; Vos et al., 2006)). By adopting an integrative approach, 
we not only maintain the interpretability of traditional models but also 
benefit from the predictive capabilities of machine learning, advancing 
our ability to predict behavioral outcomes in a wide range of scenarios. 
This methodology propels our investigation forward, opening new av-
enues  for  anticipating  animal  behavior  in  various  conditions  and 
emphasizing the controlled settings of T-maze experiments.

predicated on the data’s characteristics and the specific analytical

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it mentions that deep learning methods are being integrated into animal behavior studies, which traditionally have not been extensively utilized for modeling or predicting animal movement. It also refers to the use of neural networks, which can be considered a subset of deep learning models. Furthermore, it discusses the use of Support Vector Machines (SVM) for training a model on a dimensionally reduced dataset. But no specific mention is made of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers. Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot definitively determine what type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline.
