2.4.2. Performance metrics and interpretation method of the model 

This  study  uses  the  correlation  coefficient  (R),  root  mean  square 
error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) coefficient of determination 
(R2), and mean relative error (MAE) metrics to confirm the prediction 
performance of the model on the validation set. R measures the linear 
relationship between two variables. Its value varies between (cid:0) 1 and 1, 
such that values closer to 0 denote a lesser correlation between the two 
variables,  indicating  improved  model  performance.  The  formula  for 
calculating R is as follows (Qi et al., 2018):

After reviewing the literature, the default model was determined as 
the starting point for exploring MLP modeling. The specific structural 
parameters  of  the  default  MLP  model  can  be  referred  to  (Fine  et  al., 
2020). After optimization, the optimal MLP model was used to predict 
soil  Mn  content.  Table  2  briefly  summarizes  the  optimal  network 
structure  and  parameters.  Briefly,  the  batch  normalization  technique 
was used to accelerate the learning process (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015), 
after which the dropout was employed to mitigate model overfitting. To 
train the MLP model, we applied the Adam optimizer with a learning 
rate of 0.0001, and used a batch size of 32 (Khan et al., 2020). The ReLu 
activation function was used in the network architecture and the early 
stopping mechanism was used to minimize overfitting (Prechelt, 1998).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of spectral reflectance data with 4200 dimensions as input for the neural network. This suggests that the dataset might contain hyperspectral or multispectral images related to soil analysis or environmental studies. Unfortunately, without more detailed information, it is impossible to determine if well-known datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet were utilized in this particular case.
