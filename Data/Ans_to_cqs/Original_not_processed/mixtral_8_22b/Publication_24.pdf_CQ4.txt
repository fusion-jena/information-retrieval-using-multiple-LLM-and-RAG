%Query
Query: "What are the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Fliping, Roating, Scaling)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it appears that the paper discusses the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Deep Learning for urban ecoacoustic assessment. However, there is no explicit mention of specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, scaling, etc. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. It would require further information or access to the original research paper to confirm if these techniques were employed.
