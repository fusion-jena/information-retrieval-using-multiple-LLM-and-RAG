W ± STD is the body weight ± standard deviation; RMSE is root mean square 
error; MRE is mean relative error.

references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) 

The precise dimensions of the object can be determined by rotating the 
minimum bounding rectangle and aligning it with the scale bar (Fig. 4 b 
and c) in the image. 

2.3. Fish image collection method 

The YOLOv5 model has been categorized into five versions based on 
varying  sizes,  training  speeds,  inference  speeds  and  model  accuracy, 
which were model n, s, m, l and x, respectively. The real-time detection 
of  free-swimming  orthogonal  fish  bodies  requires  high  performance, 
making model version n the most appropriate for this research project, 
with the fastest speed and smallest parameters.

Helpful Answer:
After the model training process, several postprocessing steps may be involved depending on the specific requirements of the study or application. Based on the given context, some possible postprocessing steps include:

1. Calculation of metrics: After training the model, various evaluation metrics such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Relative Error (MRE), and coefficient of determination (R^2) can be calculated to assess the performance of the model. These metrics help quantify the accuracy and precision of the model predictions.

2. Image processing techniques: In order to determine the precise dimensions of objects within images, image processing techniques like minimum bounding rectangle rotation and alignment with a scale bar can be employed. This step helps improve the accuracy of measurements derived from the images.

3. Model comparison: To compare different models or versions of a model, their performances can be evaluated using various criteria such as estimated weights, identified accuracies, and estimated efficiencies. For instance, the context mentions comparing the model effects between DL-YOLO and YOLOv5n.

4. Visualization tools: Postprocessing might also involve visualizing the results through saliency maps or other graphical representations. However, there is no explicit mention of these methods in the provided context.

These postprocessing steps contribute to understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the trained models, enabling researchers to optimize them further or select the best performing ones for practical applications.
