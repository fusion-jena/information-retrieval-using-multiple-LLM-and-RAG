was analysed using various evaluation matrices. During model training, 
the input image size was set to 512 × 512 and the maximum batch size 
was limited to 4. To prevent underfitting, all models were ensured to 
follow back-propagation after accumulating the batch size 32 times. The 
models were trained using a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer 
with an initial learning rate of 0.01 and a cycle learning rate of 0.2, with

where,  n  represents  the  input  tensor  with  shape  [batch_size,  height, 
width, channels].  It contains the input  data or feature map  used in a 
neural network, w(n) is a weight tensor derived from n, typically ob-
tained through some form of learned parameters or coefficients, and f (w 
(n), n) represents the process of treating the input feature n. 

The network architecture of the depth-attention YOLOv5 is shown in 
Fig. 10. Unlike other attention mechanisms that are usually introduced 
earlier in the network and trained along with the other layers, the depth- 
attention mechanism was placed after the final processing layers of the 
detection model. It remains unchanged and does not adapt during the 
training  process.  This means that the depth-attention  weights are not 
updated  during  training  and  remain  fixed  throughout  the  learning

A pre-processing pipeline is designed by applying segmentation and 
object extraction processes to obtain a pre-processed depth frame. The 
segmentation  process  is  performed  for  separating  a  point  cloud  into 
meaningful  segments  or  clusters  based  on  the  characteristics  of  the 
points. Object extraction is the third step of the process for separating 
the object of interest from the rest of the scene in the RGB-D image using 
the segmented point cloud data. In object extraction, the first step is to 
identify the points that belong to the object and create a binary mask 
that indicates which pixels or voxels in the RGB-D image belong to the 
object. The resulting images from this process are presented in Fig. 6.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the authors have utilized object extraction and segmentation processes for their deep learning pipeline. These techniques can be considered as part of the data annotation process. However, the specific details regarding the use of bounding box annotation or instance segmentation are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer about the exact data annotation techniques employed in the deep learning pipeline.

However, considering the general practices in deep learning pipelines, it is common to use bounding box annotations for object localization tasks such as object detection. Instance segmentation, on the other hand, involves labeling each pixel of an object with its corresponding class label, providing more detailed information about the objects present in the image. Both these techniques help train deep learning models effectively.

Without further context or information, I am unable to determine if both bounding box annotation and instance segmentation were used in the deep learning pipeline discussed in the provided context.
