3.2. Modelling AGBD using Sentinel-2 data 

We  used  linear  regression  to  model  AGBD  (field  measured)  as  a 
function  of  Sentinel-2  spectral  data  in  both  test  areas.  As  mentioned 
above, the selected model in the Betul area included bands 2, 5 and 6 
(B2, B5 and B6), and had a root mean square error (RMSE) of 11.27 ton/ 
ha  and  an  R2  of  0.90.  Inspections  of  residual  plots  indicate  that  the 
model  is  good  and  the  validation  of  the  model  using  a  leave-one-out 
cross-validation  (LOOCV)  approach  show  an  RMSE  of  13.93  ton/ha, 
an R2 of 0.88, a mean absolute error (MAE) of 10.77 and a bias of (cid:0) 0.28. 
The selected bands B2, B5 and B6 have been successfully used in recent 
studies to estimate forest biomass (Chen et al., 2021; Xi et al., 2022).

Helpful Answer:
After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the study or application. In this case, the authors mention two main postprocessing steps: inspection of residual plots and validation of the model using a leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) approach.

Inspection of residual plots involves examining the differences between the predicted and actual values of aboveground biomass density (AGBD) to assess the accuracy and reliability of the model. This step helps identify any patterns or trends in the errors, which could suggest potential issues with the model or the input data.

Validation of the model using LOOCV involves iteratively leaving out one observation from the dataset, fitting the model to the remaining observations, and then predicting the left-out observation. The process is repeated until each observation has been left out once. This technique provides a more robust evaluation of the model performance by reducing overfitting and improving generalization.

Additionally, the authors report several metrics to evaluate the model performance, including the root mean square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), and bias. These metrics provide insights into different aspects of the model's accuracy and precision, allowing researchers to compare models and select the most appropriate one for their purposes.

Other common postprocessing steps not explicitly mentioned in this context include generating saliency maps, calculating confusion matrices, and performing sensitivity analysis. However, these techniques may not always be relevant or necessary depending on the goals and scope of the study.
