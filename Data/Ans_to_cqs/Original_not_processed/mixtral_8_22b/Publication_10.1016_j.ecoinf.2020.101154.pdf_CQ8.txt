2.4.2.  Hyperparameters 

Hyperparameter tuning was done manually. As a starting point the 
learning rate was set as low as possible and the number of iterations as 
high as computationally feasible (Hastie et al., 2009). The learning rate, 
which is also called a shrinkage parameter, determines the contribution 
of each tree to the model. The maximum tree depth which reflects the 
degree of interaction in the model is usually low. GBRT performs best 
using fairly shallow trees, so-called tree stumps.

For  the  RI  models  the  same  initial  parameters  were  set  for  the 
analysis of the CS and NW datasets, then a grid search was performed 
on both datasets with a two-part split to give hyperparameters with the 
highest level of accuracy. These were as following: learning rate 0.05 
and maximum tree depth of 4 for both the CS and the NW models. The 
early stopping technique was used to determine when to stop the model 
training  to  avoid  overfitting.  Using  early  stopping  the  number  of 
iterations required until convergence was 120 for CS and 106 for NW. 
Grid search was not required for a three-part splits, and further tuning 
of the parameters was done manually. 

For the RY models, in contrast to the RI models, the best performing 
models (based on MSE) were models with a slow learning rate of 0.005. 
Additionally, the NW model had a very shallow tree (tree depth of 2). 
The number of iterations was kept at 500.

Spatial resolutions for the local environmental datasets are representative of the latitude and longitude where herring populations are found in the Celtic Sea and off 
the North-West of Ireland areas. Abbreviations C3, D4 and C4 refer to standard areas used in the CPR.  

steepest descent: The steepest descent direction is the negative gradient 
of the loss function evaluated at the current model Fm−1 which can be 
calculated for any differentiable loss function:

The accuracy of gradient boosting can be improved by introducing 
randomisation  into  the  procedure  through  taking  randomly  selected 
subsets  of  training  data  at  each  iteration  (hence  stochastic  gradient 
boosting).

The  tuned  hyperparameters  of  the  final  models  are  shown  in

Number of iterations was defined by early stopping. Subsample rate was 0.75% 
in  all  cases.  Parameters  for  2-part  split  were  defined  through  grid  search, 
whereas parameters for 3-part split were tuned manually.
