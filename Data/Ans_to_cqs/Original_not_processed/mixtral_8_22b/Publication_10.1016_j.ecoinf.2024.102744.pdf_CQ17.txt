overfitting. Additionally, the Global Average Pooling layer summarizes features, generating input 

for the fully connected layer. This layer also facilitates the visualization of regions relied upon by 

the network for predictions. The subsequent three fully connected layers generate the predicted 

class for the original image

4.4. Second improvement: Two class YOLOv5 + Focal loss 

In this enhancement, an object detection network is trained to detect two classes: pollen-bearing 

and  non-pollen-bearing  bees.  However,  due  to  data  imbalance,  where  one  class  significantly 

outnumbers the other, we propose the implementation of a focal loss function to address this issue. 

Focal  loss  [41]  is  a  technique  designed  to  mitigate  imbalance  problems  in  object  detection 

networks by assigning higher weights to samples that are challenging or prone to misclassification. 

These samples typically include those with complex backgrounds or only partial representations of

VnPollenBee dataset. The best metrics values are shown in bold font.

Helpful Answer:
The text mentions the use of the Dropout layer as a method to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. Dropout is a regularization technique used during training to randomly set a fraction rate of input units to 0 at each update, which helps reduce interdependent learning amongst neurons. By doing so, it prevents overfitting and improves the generalization capability of the model. Other common regularization techniques not explicitly mentioned in the given context but widely used in deep learning pipelines include L1 and L2 regularizations, early stopping, and data augmentation. These methods help control the complexity of the model and improve its ability to perform well on unseen data.
