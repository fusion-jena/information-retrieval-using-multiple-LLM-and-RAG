of CNN architectures, and adjust network layers and hyperparameters to 
predict or compare water quality across different water bodies. More-
over,  categorizing  research  findings  based  on  the  timing  of  policy  or 
management  interventions  could  elucidate  the  evolving  factors  and 
patterns  influencing  algal  blooms  over  different  periods,  fostering  a 
deeper comprehension of water quality and algal bloom dynamics. Such 
insights are crucial for developing targeted strategies for the prevention 
and management of algal blooms.

them in the same category. Finally, input the three categories of water 
quality level as training sets into CNN for training.

the study area is shown in Fig. 5. The CNN structure, depicted in Fig. 3, 
comprises five convolutional layers, one pooling layer; three fully con-
nected  layers,  and  three  water-quality  level  labels  including  Class  I, 
Class II, and Class III. To enhance model reliability, a dropout function 
was incorporated between the fully connected layers. Parameters were 
set with a kernel size of 3, stride of 1, and a dropout rate of 50% post the 
fully connected layer. The training was conducted over 500 epochs with 
(cid:0) 4, momentum at 0.9, with the learning rate 
an initial learning rate of 10
halved  every  20  rounds  to  optimize  performance,  culminating  in  the 
selection of the most effective model weights for each cycle.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves setting parameters and using specific techniques. The parameters set include a kernel size of 3, stride of 1, and a dropout rate of 50%. The dropout function is used between the fully connected layers to enhance model reliability. Training is conducted over 500 epochs with a momentum of 0.9 and an initial learning rate of 10, which is halved every 20 rounds to optimize performance. This process helps select the most effective model weights for each cycle.
