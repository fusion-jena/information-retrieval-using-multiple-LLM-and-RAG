During the DeepLabV3+ model training process, feeding large-size 
images directly to the network may lead to memory overflow. There-
fore, it is necessary to cut all remote sensing images and semantic labels 
of land cover classes into a series of regular image blocks for input. To 
maximize the sample size and maintain consistency with the cropping 
approach in the model prediction stage, we set the cropping size to 32 ×
32  pixels  with  a  redundancy  rate  of  0.5.  In  continuing,  70%  of  the 
dataset  was  used  for  training  and  the  remaining  for  validation.  The 
training set was enhanced by: (i) Flipping the images and labels along 
the X or Y axis; (ii) Exchanging between multiple image channels while 
the  labels remain unchanged; (iii)  Randomly rotating  the images and

labels by 90
; and (iv) randomly adding noise to the 
images  while  maintaining  the  labels  unchanged  (Ye  et  al.,  2022).

ReduceLROnPlateau was as follows: If the validation loss value did not 
decrease  after  5  consecutive  epochs,  the  learning  rate  was  halved.  If 
there was no decrease in the validation loss value after 10 consecutive 
epochs, the training process was terminated. Both model training and 
inference were executed on a GeForce RTX 3070 GPU.

MRS_DeepLabV3+ integrates  the  classification  results  (in  TIF 
format) predicted by the DeepLabV3+ algorithm and the segmentation 
results (in SHP format) obtained from MRS using Python programming 
language. The main specific steps of this approach have been provided in 
the following: First, let us count the number of pixels of each category in 
the current segmentation object area. After that, we select the category 
with the largest area. Finally, assign the largest category to the current 
object. The multiple classification models were then constructed based 
on MRS_DeepLabV3+ (Table 3).

Helpful Answer:
The dataset was divided into two parts: 70% for training and the remaining 30% for validation. No explicit mention was made about a separate testing set. The training set was further augmented using various techniques such as flipping the images and labels along the X or Y axis, exchanging between multiple image channels, randomly rotating the images and labels by 90 degrees, and randomly adding noise to the images while keeping the labels unchanged. During the training process, if the validation loss value did not decrease after five consecutive epochs, the learning rate was halved. If there was no decrease in the validation loss value after ten consecutive epochs, the training process was terminated.
