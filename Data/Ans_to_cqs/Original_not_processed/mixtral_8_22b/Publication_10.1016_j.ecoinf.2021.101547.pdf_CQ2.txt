The  mini-batch  size  is  user-adjustable  (typically  in  binary-number 
increments,  e.g.  2,  4,  8,  16,  32,  etc.)  depending  on  the  data  set.  Too 
small  a  mini-batch  size  may  provide  insufficient  image  data  for  the 
network  to  meaningfully  learn from  some or  all  of  the  classes  within 
each iteration, while too large a mini-batch size may cause the network 
to  overfit  to  the  training  images.  Because  of  the  high  computational 
complexity  of  the  deep  learning  process,  the  mini-batch  size  is  ulti-
mately limited by the amount of memory available to the GPU (in our 
case 8 GB), factoring in the size of the images (in our case 224 × 224 
pixels × 3 bands) and the number of internal parameters in the network 
(25.6 million in the case of ResNet-50). Thus, we were limited to mini-

By default, ResNet-50 processes three-band (RGB) input images with 
a size of 224 × 224 pixels. Training of the network is performed itera-
tively on small ‘mini-batches’ of the training images. At each iteration, 
the network is shown a new mini-batch of images and starts by classi-
fying them based on its current internal parameters. For each image, the 
network estimates the probability that the image represents each of the 
different user-defined classes, with the probability scores of all classes 
cumulatively adding up to 1. By default, the image is assigned to the 
class with the highest probability score. The network then ascertains the 
actual  class  of  the  training  image  as  per  the  user-provided  label,  and 
computes a ‘loss’ score for the image based on the difference between 
the estimated class probability scores and the actual scores, whereby the 
image should have a score of 1 for its actual class and a score of 0 for the

The  diversity  of  considerations  and  possibilities  for  improvement 
highlights another general challenge of using deep learning at present: 
as a still-burgeoning technology, optimized or standardized approaches 
for different analysis tasks are not yet well-established, so the range of 
possibilities  can  seem  overwhelming,  especially  to  non-expert  users. 
Even the basic training options, some of which are listed in Table 1, are 
numerous and highly technical. A sensible approach is to initially set 
options based on a review of published studies involving similar analysis 
tasks,  then  attempt  to  refine  certain  settings  through  trial  and  error. 
However,  it  should  also  be  noted  that  the  computationally  laborious 
process of training a CNN (several hours to several days of background 
processing) imposes a practical limit on the extent of trial and error that 
can  be  undertaken.  Nevertheless,  deep  learning  is  now  clearly  over-

batches of 64 images. Smaller mini-batches were not desirable in our 
case  because  of  our  significantly  imbalanced  training  image  set  that 
required both a large variety of background images and a certain min-
imum  number  of  polar  bear  images  in  each  mini-batch  (see  section 
2.4.3). The precise numbers of training images of various sorts that we 
used at different stages of training our CNN were calibrated to ensure 
that the total number of training images was divisible by 64, so that no 
images were excluded from each training epoch.
