In the realm of visualization, the chosen approach often depends on 
the target audience and the format of the source data. Given the limited 
literature on soil visualization outside of soil mapping, we conducted a 
broader  survey  of  this  topic  within  the  general  environmental  and 
ecological context. A significant portion of such research falls into the 
data  visualization  category,  which  utilizes  data  obtained  from  various 
survey  methods  to  reveal  targeted  information.  Techniques  such  as 
reinterpretation, analysis, mathematical modeling, and optimization are 
employed to transform data into a format that highlights the intended 
information.  The  results  of  these  studies  are  often  code  libraries  in 
conventional data science programming languages (Python or R), which 
users can utilize and build upon (Araya et al., 2018; Nguyen et al., 2022; 
Serrano-Notivoli et al., 2022). Another type of visualization is typically

2.2. Extension 

A key advantage of the BeingAliveLanguage visualization system is its 
extensibility, which has been purposefully designed. Our objective is to 
establish  a  shared  foundation  for  multidisciplinary  communication  in 
soil-related research and projects, catering to a range of requirements. In 
this section, we showcase two extensions: the integration of the climate 
graph, such as water balance graphs and Bagnouls-Gaussen diagram (or 
the  Gaussen  diagram)  (Bagnouls  and  Gaussen,  1957),  to  visualize 
climate  data  (the variation  in  soil water  content throughout  different 
months of the year); and the integration of root growth simulation into 
our tessellated soil diagram, providing a conceptual representation of 
the interaction between plant roots and soil. We anticipate that future 
users  will  further  expand  these  extensions  to  suit  their  specific 
applications.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any direct information about the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses some common techniques used in data visualization, including reinterpretation, analysis, mathematical modeling, and optimization. These techniques help transform raw data into a more understandable format that highlights the intended information.

Data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotation, scaling, etc., are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to increase the amount of training data available by applying random (but realistic) transformations to existing images. This helps prevent overfitting and improves model performance. While the context doesn't explicitly mention these techniques, they are widely known and used in the field of deep learning.
