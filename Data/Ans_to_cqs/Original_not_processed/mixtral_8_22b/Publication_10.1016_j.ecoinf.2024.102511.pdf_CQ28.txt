properly apply and test neural network classification methods on a novel 
dataset,  although  development  of  more  user  friendly  tools  are  in 
development (Kahl et al., 2021; Kirsebom et al., 2022). Despite the great 
potential for deep learning methods, modification of existing machine 
learning  methods  with  a  lower  barrier  to  entry  may  be  sufficient  for 
many bioacoustic classification tasks.

%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not include details about which specific platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or any other platform was used based solely on this information.
