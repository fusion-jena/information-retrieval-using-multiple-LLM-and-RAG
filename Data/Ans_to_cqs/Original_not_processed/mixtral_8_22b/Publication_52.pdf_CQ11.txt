As it has been proven, ELMs are an important approach for handling and analysing Big
Data as they require the minimum training time relative to the corresponding engineering
learning algorithms. Moreover ELMs do not require ﬁne manipulations to determine their
operating parameters and ﬁnally they can determine the appropriate output weights
towards the most eﬀective resolution of a problem. What is most important, they have
in contrast to corresponding methods which adjust their
the potential to generalize,

performance based solely on their training data set. It is obvious that the emerging use of
ELM in Big Data analysis as well as DELE creates serious prerequisites for complex systems’
development by low-cost machines.

This is a multi-layered neural network model that receives successive OL data streams
and uses the unsupervised GRELMA algorithm as a basic building block in which the
outputs of each level are used as inputs to the next one (Sun, Zhang, Zhang, & Hu, 2017).
An autoencoder is an ANN used for unsupervised learning of eﬃcient coding. The aim
of an autoencoder is to learn a representation (encoding) for a set of data, but with the
output layer having the same number of nodes as the input layer, and with the
purpose of reconstructing its own inputs (instead of predicting target value Y given
inputs X). The algorithm is described below (Sun et al., 2017):

(MIGRATE_ELM). The MIGRATE_ELM uses an innovative Deep
Learning algorithm (DELE) that is applied for the ﬁrst time for the
above purpose. The assignment of the corresponding class ‘native’
or ‘invasive’ in its locality, is carried out by an equally innovative
approach entitled ‘Geo Location Country Based Service’ that has
been proposed by our research team.
