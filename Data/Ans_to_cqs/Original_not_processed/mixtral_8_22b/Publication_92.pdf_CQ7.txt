Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

2.2 Deep Learning

Since the 2012 ImageNet competition, and new computational power accessible
through latest GPU, Neural Network came back as a strong possibility for clas-
siﬁcation tasks [18]. Moreover, by integrating convolutional layers, Deep Neural
Networks (DNN) are able to both create features vectors and classify them.

Neural network is a mathematical model which tries to mimic human brains
[19]. Like SVM, neural networks may classify feature vectors after a training
phase. A neural network is composed of interconnected nodes called neurons
and each neuron of each layer receives a signal from the neurons of the previous
layer. This signal is modiﬁed according to an activation function and transferred
to the neurons of the next layer.

We can deﬁne for the neuron n, the ﬁrst operation α(n) as:

α(n)(x(n)) =

c(cid:2)

i=1

i x(n)
w(n)

i

(1)

where x is the input vector, a given neuron, c the number of connections of this
neuron, w(n)
the input of rank i of
i
a neuron n.

3.1 Data Preprocessing

The choice of learning data is a crucial point. We worked with biology experts
of the MARBEC laboratory to label many videos. We cropped some frames of
the videos and created a training database composed of 13000 ﬁsh thumbnails.
The thumbnail size varies from a minimum of 20 × 40 pixels to a maximum of
150 × 200 pixels. Each thumbnail contains only one labeled-ﬁsh as shown on
Fig. 2.

We decided to keep only the species with more than 450 thumbnails. We also
widen the database by applying rotations and symmetries in order to capture
all the possible position of the ﬁshes. Table 1 lists the retained species.

Due to the highly textured natural background, we also added a class for the
background. This class is constituted with random thumbnails of the background
which were randomly selected in frames and speciﬁc background thumbnails
which were taken around the ﬁsh thumbnails.

Finally, in order to improve the localization accuracy, we decided to create
another class called part of ﬁsh, to ensure that the network does not focus on
a distinctive part of a ﬁsh as a stripe, a ﬁn, the head, but processes the ﬁsh
as a whole. We also created a class ﬁsh which contains some unknown ﬁshes to
make the method able to recognize any ﬁsh even though it is not in the learning
database. However, this class must contain less samples in order to be sure that
a ﬁsh will most likely be labeled by its speciﬁc class rather than the generic class
ﬁsh. Finally, we added 3 classes to our initial thumbnail database as listed in
Table 2.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the provided context, there isn't explicit information about how the authors split their dataset into training, testing, or validation sets for their deep learning models. However, typically, datasets are divided into these subsets using various strategies such as random sampling, stratified sampling, or time-series based splitting depending on the nature of the problem and the available data. The common practice is to use approximately 70-80% of the data for training, 10-15% for validation, and 10-15% for testing. It would be reasonable to assume that the authors followed similar practices when preparing their dataset for deep learning model training.
