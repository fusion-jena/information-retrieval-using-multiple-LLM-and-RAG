Table  2  lists  nine  grid  search  ML  models  with  fivefold  cross- 
validation for four WQPs and hyperparameters. Model evaluation and 
hyperparameter selection use cross-validation resampling. The dataset is 
split  into  five  equal-sized  folds  using  fivefold  cross-validation.  Five 
times, one of each fold, the training and assessment process is validated. 
A  more  complete  model  performance  analysis  is  possible.  Averaging 
coefficient of determination (R2) or RMSE across five iterations with five 
folds  improves  model  performance  and  hyperparameter  tuning  effi-
ciency estimation. The Python library’s randint command picks integers 
within a range for hyperparameters like n_estimators and max_depth. We 
use  the  uniform  command  for  discrete  or  continuous  values  inside  a 
range,  like  the  min_samples_split  hyperparameter.  These  commands 
examined  multiple  hyperparameter  value  ranges  to  establish  model

%Query
Query: "Where is the data repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any specific information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that the dataset was used for fivefold cross-validation and that it was split into five equal-sized folds. However, there is no mention of where this dataset can be accessed or downloaded from. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to this query based on the given context.
