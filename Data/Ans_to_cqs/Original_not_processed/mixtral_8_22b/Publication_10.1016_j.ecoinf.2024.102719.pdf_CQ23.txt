Predictive models that relate river health to gradients of environ-
mental factors can identify potential causes of impairment in areas of
ecological concern, supporting strategic decisions on prioritizing resto-
ration activities and new monitoring initiatives. Such models should be
generalizable to unseen data for predicting the river health in unmoni-
tored areas. Bias–variance decomposition is widely adopted for gener-
alizability evaluations of ML models (Guan and Burton, 2022; Van Der
Putten and Van Someren, 2004; Van Der Valk and Picek, 2019).
Although deep learning and other ML models have been widely
employed in river health predictions (Gazendam et al., 2016; Kwon
et al., 2024; Lee et al., 2021), they have not been supplemented with
evaluation techniques that would confirm their generalizability to un-
seen datasets. In the present study, the generalizability of various ML

3.2. Bias–variance decomposition

Bias–variance decomposition evaluates the generalizability of an ML
model to unseen datasets (Dietterich and Kong, 1995; Kohavi and
Wolpert, 1996). The loss is decomposed into bias, variance, and noise
terms. Bias evaluates the proximity of the average prediction of the
learning algorithm to the true label. Models with high bias tend to be
underfitted; that is, they oversimplify the interpretation of the under-
lying data patterns. The variance quantifies the variation in the model's
predictions caused by random fluctuations in the training data. Models
exhibiting high variance are typically overfitted to the training dataset.
Finally, the noise component represents the irreducible error incurred
by the learning algorithm. A model with low loss (i.e., combined low
bias and low variance) is considered as generalizable to unseen data.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide specific information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model used in this study. However, it mentions that bias-variance decomposition was employed to evaluate the model's generalizability to unseen datasets. This method helps determine whether the model has high or low bias and variance, which can indicate if the model is underfitting or overfitting the data.

While the text doesn't explicitly mention using diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, these methods could potentially improve the model's performance and generalizability. Using a diverse dataset ensures that the model learns from different types of examples, reducing the risk of overfitting to one particular type of input. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into multiple subsets and iteratively testing the model on each subset while training on the others. This process provides a more robust estimate of the model's performance and reduces the chance of overfitting. Lastly, stratified splitting maintains the same distribution of target classes across all splits, ensuring that the model sees a representative sample during both training and validation phases.

In summary, although the text does not specify the use of diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, these methods could contribute to improving the deep learning model's generalizability.
