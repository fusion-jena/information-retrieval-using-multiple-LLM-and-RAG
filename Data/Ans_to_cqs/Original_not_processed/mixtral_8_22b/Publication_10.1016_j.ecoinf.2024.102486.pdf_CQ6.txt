of compute time to the tasks within the bootstrap filter. This showed that 
the  vast  majority  of  compute  time  was  spent  projecting  particles  for-
wards to the following time step (Table 2). The proportions of time spent 
on each task are likely to change with the state-dimensionality of the 
application  at  hand  and  the  amount  of  interaction  between  particles 
(Whiteley  et  al.,  2016).  Large  state-dimensionalities  or  particle  inter-
action  can  lead  to  a  higher  proportion  of  compute  time  spent  on  the 
resampling  step  in  particular.  In  these  cases,  there  exist  alternative 
resampling  methods  to  reduce  the  impact  of  particle  interactions  on 
computational  cost  (e.g.  Lee  and  Whiteley,  2016).  Note  that  imple-
mentations  of  the  algorithm  in  different  programming  languages, 
especially compiled ones such as C or Fortran, will vary slightly in the 
proportion of compute time spent in each task.

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide specific information about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, generally speaking, common preprocessing steps include data normalization, scaling, cleaning, and augmentation. Normalization is used to rescale values measured on different scales to a standard scale, while scaling involves adjusting all features to have the same range of values. Cleaning refers to removing noise from the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, and irrelevant observations. Lastly, data augmentation techniques like rotation, zooming, flipping, cropping, etc., are often applied to increase the size of the dataset artificially. These preprocessing steps help improve the performance and accuracy of the deep learning model.
