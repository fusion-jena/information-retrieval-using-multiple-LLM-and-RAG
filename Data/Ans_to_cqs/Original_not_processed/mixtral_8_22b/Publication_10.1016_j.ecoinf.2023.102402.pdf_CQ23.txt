2.4. Model validation 

The model's performance was  evaluated using the Area Under the 
receiver-operator  Curve  (AUC).  The  AUC  values  range  from  0  to  1, 
where values closer to 1 indicate a higher accuracy of model prediction 
(Fielding and Bell, 1997). In addition to the AUC, the True Skill Statistics 
(TSS) was calculated. TSS values range between (cid:0) 1 and + 1. A TSS value 
of +1 means complete agreement between observed and predicted dis-
tributions, whereas values of ≤0 denote no better than random perfor-
mance  (Allouche  et  al.,  2006).  AUC  and  TSS  are  the  methods  most 
commonly used to assess the model performance in species distribution 
model studies (e.g., Gaier and Resasco, 2023; Mondanaro et al., 2023; 
Song and Estes, 2023).

3.3. Model validation 

SDMs showed an excellent level of predictive performance, as indi-
cated by the AUC and TSS values of 0.91 ± 0.02 (mean ± standard de-
viation) and 0.68 ± 0.02 in H. guttulatus and 0.92 ± 0.03 and 0.69 ±
0.03 in H. hippocampus. 

The  high predictive  performance of  our  models was  confirmed by 

validation using multiple databases (Table 2). 

3.4. Niche analysis 

The first and second principal component of the ecospat PCA of both 
species explained 35.4% and 22.2% of the variability in the study area, 
respectively  (Figs.  4a-g).  The  correlation  plot  showed  that  the  mean

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it can be inferred that the authors have employed certain techniques to validate their Species Distribution Models (SDMs) and evaluate their performance.

To measure the SDMs' performance, they utilized two metrics: Area Under the receiver-operator Curve (AUC) and True Skill Statistics (TSS). These methods are commonly used to assess the model performance in species distribution model studies. High AUC and TSS values close to 1 indicate a more accurate model prediction. The reported AUC and TSS values for both Hippocampus guttulatus and Hippocampus hippocampus suggest an excellent level of predictive performance.

Additionally, the authors validated their models using multiple databases, which could contribute to enhancing the robustness and generalizability of the results. This approach might help capture various aspects of the underlying data distributions and reduce potential biases associated with relying solely on one source.

In summary, while the text does not explicitly discuss specific techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting, it suggests that the authors took some measures to ensure the reliability and applicability of their SDMs. They achieved this through employing widely accepted performance metrics and utilizing multiple databases for model validation.
