Due to processing limitations in GEE, it is impossible to utilize many 
samples and automate hyperparameter tuning. To fill this gap and avoid 
overfitting,  the  validation  data  were  employed  for  tuning  the  key 
hyperparameters for each model. Table 3 presents the hyperparameters 
set for each model during training and validation.

The  pixel-based  classification  approach  relies  on  the  spectral

the inability to split further, is met. This algorithm is simple, fast, and 
highly interpretable (Gislason et al., 2006). It is important to note that 
CART models can be susceptible to overfitting without proper tuning of 
input  parameters.  In  this  research,  by  evaluating  the  model's  perfor-
mance  using  validation  data,  it  was  determined  that  setting  the  Max 
Nodes parameter to its default value (no limit on the number of nodes)

5.3.1. Classification algorithms in GEE 

In this study, 33,209 samples were collected using a stratified sam-
pling  approach.  Of  these,  70%  were  allocated  for  training,  and  the 
remaining 30% were employed for testing. Hyperparameter tuning for 
ML models was performed using validation data (10% of training data). 
This  research  utilized  CART,  RF,  GTB,  and  SVM  models  as  classifiers 
within GEE.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
In this study, 33,209 samples were collected using a stratified sampling approach. Out of these, 70% were allocated for training, while the remaining 30% were employed for testing. For hyperparameter tuning of ML models, validation data consisting of 10% of the training data was used. The specific hyperparameters set for each model during training and validation are presented in Table 3. These include max nodes, min leaf population, number of trees, bag fraction, variables per split, shrinkage, sampling rate, loss, kernel type, SVM type, and decision procedure.

Answer:::

Unhelpful Answer:
The table shows USGS 24 LULC classes defined for WRF simulation. However, this information does not directly address the query about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training.
