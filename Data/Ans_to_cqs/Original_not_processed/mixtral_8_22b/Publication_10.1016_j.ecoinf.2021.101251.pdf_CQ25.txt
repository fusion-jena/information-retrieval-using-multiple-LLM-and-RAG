A key element of data integration is enabling the use and citation of

need  to  systematically  evaluate  the  complex  socio-technical  issues 
around data producers and data consumers. Data producers are quickly

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention the purpose of any deep learning models used within the ESS-DIVE platform or its related projects such as AmeriFlux. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer based solely on the given information. However, considering the broader context, one can infer that the potential purposes of using deep learning models could be for tasks like classification, segmentation, or detection in various ecological datasets. These tasks might include classifying different types of vegetation, detecting patterns in climate change data, or segmenting satellite imagery for land cover analysis. Nevertheless, without explicit details about the implementation of deep learning models in this case, this remains speculative.
