80 cm), and 78% of measurements were expected to be low (i.e., less 
than 50 cm). This may indicate that permafrost in the Siksik Creek Basin 
has experienced less  thaw than elsewhere in the broader Trail Valley 
Creek area or that the boundaries based on ALT for Trail Valley Creek 
are not as representative of the Siksik Creek Basin.

Aside  from  the  benefits  this  modeling  approach  provides  in  data 
sparse regions, BNs also have the ability to engage a wider audience than 
traditional  modeling  approaches.  Users  without  highly  technical 
modeling skills can build BNs, and the graphical structure can easily be 
understood by and communicated to non-technical stakeholders. This is 
valuable in the context of interdisciplinary and participatory endeavors.

Query: "Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The information provided does not mention any specific details about a deep learning pipeline or its corresponding code repository. Therefore, it is not possible to determine where the code repository of such a pipeline might be available, whether it be on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
