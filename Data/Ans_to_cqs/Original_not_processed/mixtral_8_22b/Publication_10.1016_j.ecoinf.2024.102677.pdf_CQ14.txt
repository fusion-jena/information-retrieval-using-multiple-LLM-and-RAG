Table 6 presents the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores of the 
five networks. ResNet50 surpasses the other models in terms of all of the 
evaluation metrics, with an accuracy of 0.81, precision of 0.82, recall of 
0.81, and F1-score of 0.81 for the testing set. Considering the challenge 
of manual sample distinction, this result is commendable. Fig. 4 displays 
the  F1-scores  of  the  five  categories  across  all  of  the  networks,  with 
ResNet50 having the best values of the four categories, except for the 
RRP. Therefore, ResNet50 was selected for the case validation. 

After finalization, the model was applied to classify the case study 
area. The classification results correspond to the actual situation (Fig. 7). 
The RRP is primarily concentrated on the eastern and western edges of 
the study area, reflecting the history of top-down planning and devel-
opment in this area. The IRP is primarily situated in the central part of

To ensure the stability of the proposed models, we randomly divided 
the  dataset  into  three  parts:  training  (60%),  validation  (20%),  and 
testing  (20%)  (Meng  et  al.,  2022).  This  division  was  performed  in  a 
stratified manner to maintain class proportions across all of the parts. 
The dataset was randomly divided into a training set (2880 images), a 
validation set (961 images), and a testing set (958 images). The models 
were trained on an NVIDIA 3090 GPU with a 256 Ã— 256 image input 
size. After parameter tuning, the learning rate, batch size, and number of 
epochs were set to 0.0001, 8, and 30, respectively.

Helpful Answer:
According to the given information, it appears that the hyperparameters of the model were optimized through parameter tuning. However, the specific method used for parameter tuning, such as grid search or random search, is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. It can only be inferred that after parameter tuning, the learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs were set to 0.0001, 8, and 30, respectively.
