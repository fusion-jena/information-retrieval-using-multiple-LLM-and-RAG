4.2. Experimental setup 

During the training phase, to accommodate multivariate input and 
univariate output, the input and output dimensions of the encoder and 
decoder  are set  to the  number of variables  in the  dataset. The model 
dimensionality  is  set  to  128  to  achieve  a  balance  between  model 
complexity  and  computational  efficiency.  Additionally,  the  model  in-
tegrates 8 attention heads to enhance its ability to process parallel in-
formation flows. The model architecture includes two layers of encoders 
and one layer of decoders, which help to comprehensively capture fea-
tures from time series data. To reduce the risk of overfitting, a dropout

During  training,  the  input  tensor  comprises  three  dimensions:  the 
batch  size,  the  number  of  model  variables,  and  the  future  prediction 
length. The dimension concerning the number of features is segmented 
by dynamically changing the slice sizes and strides, and the segmented 
tensors are folded, adding a slice dimension. Finally, by merging the first 

In the second stage of the attention calculation, the covariates are 
dynamically segmented, capturing their features at different time scales 
through multiscale attention. Specifically, for the static variables S(t),

The  architecture  of  the  Transformer  model  consists  of  two  main 
parts: an encoder and a decoder. Each encoder layer contains a multi-
head self-attention mechanism and a feedforward neural network. The 
multihead attention mechanism is implemented through Formula 8: 

MultiHead(Q, K, V) = Concat(head1, …, headh)WO

Each”head” (headi) is computed using Attention

The decoder layer in the Transformer adds encoder–decoder attention, 
focusing on the encoder's output. Given the complex dependencies in the 
input DO series, a Transformer-based architecture is used in this study to 
mitigate the risk of gradient issues during training.

3. Proposed framework

√

The self-attention mechanism enables the model to capture context 
from the entire input sequence, making it highly effective for tasks such 
as  sequence-to-sequence  modeling.  Additionally,  the  Transformer  uti-
lizes a positional encoding scheme to give the model a sense of word 
order, which is crucial for understanding the structure of a sentence. The 
positional encoding is added to the input embeddings and is defined as 
follows: 

PE(pos, 2i) = sin

)

(

pos
100002i/dmodel

PE(pos, 2i + 1) = cos

)

(

pos
100002i/dmodel

(7) 

In these equations, pos is the position and i is the dimension. Each 
dimension of the positional encoding corresponds to a sinusoid, which 
helps  the  model  determine  the  position  or  order  of  the  tokens  in  the 
input sequence.

Helpful Answer:
The proposed framework uses a Transformer-based deep learning model. This model is chosen due to its effectiveness in handling complex dependencies in the input data and mitigating the risk of gradient issues during training. The Transformer model consists of two main parts: an encoder and a decoder. Each encoder layer contains a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a feedforward neural network. The multi-head attention mechanism allows the model to capture context from the entire input sequence, while the positional encoding scheme gives the model a sense of word order.
