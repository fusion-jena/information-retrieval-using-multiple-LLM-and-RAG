In this paper, we present an automated framework that allows the 
monitoring of a large number of bird species by their vocalizations over 
extended periods and across various time scales. The framework relies 
on the BirdNET Analyzer deep learning model (BirdNET-Analyzer, n.d.),

2.2. The Agmon annotated dataset 

We created the “Agmon annotated dataset”  to evaluate the perfor-
mance  of  BirdNET.  The  dataset  comprises  over  10,900  annotated  re-
cordings  of  >75  species.  The  annotations  have  been  carried  out  by

Continuous  bioacoustic  monitoring  is  an  emerging  opportunity  as  well  as  a  challenge,  allowing  detection  of 
cryptic species' activity while producing high computational demands. In this paper, we present an automated 
framework that allows the monitoring of a large number of bird species by their vocalizations over extended 
periods. The framework relies on the BirdNET-Analyzer deep learning model. We applied the framework to >80 
species; 20 species with the highest recall scores were selected for further analysis.

In this study we demonstrated the use of our monitoring pipeline for 
computing  long-term  activity  behavior  of  several  species  recorded 
continuously for over two years in the Agmon Hula Lake Park located in 
the Hula Valley, a major migratory flyway. We generated the Agmon 
annotated dataset to examine the BirdNET deep learning model. A total 
of 23 species with the highest precision/recall values were selected for 
further analysis. When using automated deep learning models such as 
BirdNET the confidence score can strongly affect the automated iden-
tification  process  (Cole  et  al.,  2022;  P´erez-Granados,  2023).  We 
demonstrated that using BirdNET the relationships between the confi-
dence thresholds and the precision and recall values are species-specific. 
Accordingly,  we  used  species-specific  confidence  thresholds  which 
yielded detection scores that accounts for the precision-recall tradeoff.

Helpful Answer:
The authors did not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in creating the Agmon annotated dataset. However, they mentioned that the dataset consists of over 10,900 annotated recordings of more than 75 species. This suggests that the annotation technique might involve labeling or tagging audio files with relevant information about the bird species present in each recording. Since the task involves identifying bird species based on their vocalizations, it is likely that the annotation involved assigning labels corresponding to different bird species to segments of audio data containing their respective calls or songs. Unfortunately, without explicit details regarding the annotation methodology, I cannot provide a definitive answer on whether bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, or other specific techniques were employed.
