bacterial  abundance  and  morphology  for  work  carried  out  on  micro-
fluidic platforms. Statistical data of distribution and morphology of live 
microbe in a soil-analogue environment gained from such methods is 
valuable  for  community  characterization  since  phenotypic  traits  of 
living organisms are as important as the commonly used cell biochem-
ical  constituents.  Enormous  efforts  have  been  done  to  promote  deep 
learning-based methods for researchers without coding expertise (Berg 
et al., 2019; G´omez-de Mariscal et al., 2021; In´es et al., 2019; Midtvedt 
et al., 2021; Ouyang et al., 2019; Sys et al., 2022; von Chamier et al., 
2021). Our work showcases that the approach works under significantly 
different conditions, allows quantifying bacterial populations, and de-
tects differences among bacterial communities from different locations. 
Since the first attempt to measure bacterial cell sizes by Henrici et al.

were  proven  to  succumb  to  complexity,  low  precision  and  reliability, 
whereas image analysis-based methods have now been widely adopted 
due to their efficiency and accuracy (Gupta et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 
2021).  The  deep  learning  model  successfully  segments  and  classifies 
various objects at satisfying accuracy. AI-aided soil chip analysis does 
not only allow to study abundance and biodiversity measures following 
local treatments or large biogeographic variations, but even to investi-
gate direct interactions of microbes with each other, or with additives to 
the ecosystem, such as biochar or toxins that can be added into the chips. 
The  approach  can  be  extended  to  other  microbial  groups  including

The three sampling locations exhibit noticeable differences in bac-
terial abundance and morphology, which can be attributed to various 
experimental conditions and strong differences in image quality. These 
data were utilized as a validation set to assess the efficacy of our deep 
learning recognition model in accurately capturing and quantifying such 
differences, thereby demonstrating its proof of concept. The sampling 
sites  were  thus  chosen  to  provide  large  differences  in  environmental 
conditions to demonstrate the versatility of the approach; it should be 
noted that our objective did not encompass a comparison of the effects of 
different experimental conditions on bacterial morphology.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, the method utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that the data collection involves using micro-fluidic platforms to gather statistical data of distribution and morphology of live microbes in a soil-analogue environment. This information is valuable for community characterization, as phenotypic traits of living organisms are essential for understanding biological systems. Additionally, the context mentions that enormous efforts have been made to develop deep learning-based methods for researchers without coding expertise. Therefore, while the specific data collection methods are not detailed, we can assume that they involve utilizing micro-fluidic platforms and possibly other unspecified techniques to collect data on bacterial abundance and morphology.

Unhelpful Answer:
The context does not provide explicit details about the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. It primarily focuses on discussing the importance of studying bacterial abundance and morphology, the use of deep learning models for segmenting and classifying various objects, and the potential applications of this research. Without more specific information, it is impossible to determine the exact methods employed for data collection.
