3.1.1.2. Convolution-batch  normalization-sigmoid  (CBS). The  YOLOv5s 
core  unit  is  a  CBS  that  employs  a  standard  convolution  to  filter  and 
connect the features in a single step from input to output. It uses the 
input spatial height and width and generates the output spatial height 
and width, which contain channels. This was then subjected to batch 
normalization, in which the convolution layer output was scaled to train 
the model faster and accelerate the learning process. Finally, a Sigmoid 
Linear Unit (SiLU) was used as an activation function to add nonlinearity 
to check the strength versus noise from the input image. This layer is 
depicted by CBS in Fig. 3 and remains unchanged in Fig. 4.

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model such as YOLOv5s, several preprocessing steps may be involved depending on the specific requirements of the dataset and task. These can include data augmentation techniques like rotation, flipping, zooming, or cropping to increase the diversity of the training set. Normalization methods such as mean subtraction, scaling, or batch normalization can also be applied to ensure consistent feature scales across different dimensions. Data cleaning processes might involve removing corrupted samples, handling missing values, or dealing with class imbalance issues. Additionally, label encoding or one-hot encoding could be necessary when working with categorical variables. However, it should be noted that not all these preprocessing steps are mandatory, and their application depends on the nature of the problem and the chosen architecture. For instance, YOLOv5s already incorporates batch normalization within its core unit, as mentioned in the given context. Therefore, additional normalization steps might not always be required.
