2.7. Training configuration 

The calculations were performed on an ASUS laptop with an Intel i7- 
11370H CPU (4 cores, 3.30 GHz), 16 GB DDR4 memory, and an NVIDIA 
GeForce RTX 3050 graphics card (4 GB). The dataset for each period was 
divided into training, testing, and validation sets in a ratio of 70:20:10, 
respectively. 

2.8. Classification accuracy 

The accuracy calculation was performed for each model trained on 
the corresponding period and was computed using the sklearn library for

The  Pooling  Layer  performs  data  downsampling,  reducing  dimen-
sionality and extracting essential features. The most common pooling 
method is max pooling, which selects the maximum value from a region 
of  input  data.  Pooling  helps  reduce  the  number  of  parameters  and 
computations,  enhances  invariance  to  small  shifts  and  scale  changes, 
and improves the model's generalization ability.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:

Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves dividing the dataset for each period into training, testing, and validation sets in a ratio of 70:20:10, respectively. This division allows for the evaluation of the model's performance on unseen data, ensuring its ability to generalize well to new inputs. Additionally, the classification accuracy was calculated for each model trained on the corresponding period using the sklearn library. These measures help ensure the reliability and robustness of the models developed.
