A pooling layer offers downsampling functionality that decreases the dimensionality
of the feature maps to achieve translation invariance to the alterations and the biases
incorporated and thus helps in reducing the number of learnable parameters. There are
two types of pooling operations, namely Max Pooling and Global Average Pooling [64].
The ﬁrst one extracts speckles from the input feature maps and offers maximum values
in each of the speckles and leaves the remaining values unattended. The second one
downsamples a feature map with a size equaling product of height and width into an array
of a one cross one by averaging the elements of each feature map by retaining the depth of
the feature map. The advantage of Global Average Pooling lies in reducing the number of
learnable parameters along with offering the CNN with variable sized input.

layers. The perfect combination of layers and activation functions was then used to predict
the species distribution Figure 7b.

2.5. Model Validation

All of the input parameters are resampled in a single grid size of 100 m and are
converted into the same ﬁle format. Out of the in-situ occurrences of Rhododendron arboreum
at ground locations, only 70% of the data were used in calibrating the model, whereas
the remaining 30% of the data were used to test the model. In any type of modelling,
performance evaluation is an essential task. In terms of validation of species probability
distribution, the AUC (Area Under ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics) Curve) is
one of the most used performance evaluation metrics [67]. The primary application of the
ROC curve is in the threshold independent assessment that characterizes the model perfor-
mance at various discrimination thresholds. This application was found in raster-based
studies focusing on predicting land use and land cover, species distribution modelling, risk
assessment, and other probability mappings.

Helpful Answer:
After the model training process, there are several postprocessing steps that can be taken to evaluate the performance of the model and interpret its results. Some common postprocessing steps include:

1. Saliency maps: These are visualizations that highlight the regions of an image that contribute most strongly to the output of a neural network. They can help identify which features of the input data are important for making predictions.
2. Metrics calculation: Various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc. can be calculated to quantify the performance of the model. These metrics provide insights into how well the model is able to classify or regress the target variable.
3. Confusion matrix: This is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification algorithm. It shows the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives for each class. This information can be used to calculate various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Based on the given context, it appears that the authors used a combination of these postprocessing techniques to validate their model. Specifically, they mention using the Area Under ROC Curve (AUC) metric to evaluate the performance of their model in predicting the species distribution. Additionally, they state that out of the in-situ occurrences of Rhododendron arboreum at ground locations, only 70% of the data were used in calibrating the model, while the remaining 30% of the data were used to test the model. This suggests that they likely also used some form of confusion matrix or similar technique to assess the performance of their model on both the training and testing datasets. However, without more specific details about the exact methods used, it is difficult to provide a more detailed response.
