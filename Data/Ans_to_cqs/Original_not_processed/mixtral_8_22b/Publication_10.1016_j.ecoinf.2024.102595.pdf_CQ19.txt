This research underscores the significant impact of machine learning 
(ML) and deep learning (DL) models on the oil palm sector, offering a 
path to precise yield predictions and sustainable crop management. It 
highlights the utility of these models in enhancing agricultural practices 
by considering soil composition, climate variations, and farming tech-
niques, thus aligning production with market demands and optimizing 
the supply chain. Agronomists are encouraged to adopt a comprehensive 
approach leveraging ML and DL for research and development. At the 
same  time,  farmers  can  benefit  from  data-driven  insights,  mainly 
through  the  Extra  Trees  Regressor  model,  to  improve  planning  and 
resource  management.  Additionally,  the  findings  serve  as  a  basis  for 
stakeholders,  including  policymakers  and  the  agribusiness  sector,  to 
support ML integration in agriculture, fostering operational efficiency,

Recognizing the significant role of oil palm, extensive research has been 
conducted,  as  evidenced  by  studies  from  Melidawati  et  al.  (2021), 
Tuerxun et al. (2020), and Ang et al. (2022), each contributing insights 
into  oil  palm  cultivation  and  management.  Predicting  oil  palm  crop 
yields is crucial to effectively managing and optimizing the palm supply 
chain. It requires the incorporation of multiple datasets and is influenced 
by numerous variables, including climate patterns, soil quality, fertilizer 
use, and seed varieties (Xu et al., 2019). Applying Machine learning and 
deep learning models can accurately predict crop yields, aiding farmers 
in harvest planning and crop management decisions (Attri et al., 2023). 
Although these techniques have been implemented across various crops 
for environment-based yield forecasting, their deployment for predictive 
analysis of oil palm yields remains in its infancy (Rajakal et al., 2021).

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The article does not provide specific information about which frameworks were used to build the deep learning models. However, common frameworks used for building deep learning models include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. These frameworks offer tools and libraries that simplify the process of creating and training neural networks. Without explicit mention in the given context, it cannot be definitively stated which framework was utilized in this particular study.

The abstract of the paper discusses the use of both machine learning and deep learning models for predicting oil palm yields. While the authors do not explicitly state which framework they used for developing the deep learning models, popular choices among researchers include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. Each of these frameworks provides a set of tools and libraries designed to facilitate the creation and training of neural networks. Given the lack of specific details regarding the employed framework in the provided context, one cannot conclusively determine which framework was used in this study.
