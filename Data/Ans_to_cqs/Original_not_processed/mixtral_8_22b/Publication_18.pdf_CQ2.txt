rocks” (Data S1). Whale images for training the CNN were mainly aerial images. For step-2, the training dataset 
contains 700 aerial images, with whales and background, in which each whale is annotated within a bounding box 
(the total number of bounding boxes is 945).

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a specialized type of neural networks capable of extracting spatial 
patterns from images. Their architecture is built by staking three main types of layers: (1) convolutional layer, 
which is used to extract features at different levels of the hierarchy, (2) pooling layer, which is essentially a reduc-
tion operation used to increase the abstraction level of the extracted features and (3) fully connected layer, which 
is used as a classifier at the end of the pipeline.

dataset for training is costly, the learning of CNNs on small datasets can be boosted by data-augmentation, which 
consists of increasing the volume of the training dataset artificially, and additionally by transfer learning, which 
consists of starting the learning of the network from a prior knowledge rather from scratch38,39.

Helpful Answer:
The given context primarily discusses the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for analyzing aerial images of whales. The specific application involves using these models to detect whales in new images based on patterns learned during training. From this information, we can infer that one of the primary data formats used in this deep learning pipeline is image data.

In general, deep learning pipelines can utilize various data formats depending on the problem being addressed. These formats include but are not limited to images, audio files, videos, and structured data like CSV or Excel files. However, the context provided does not explicitly mention any other data format besides images. Therefore, it is safe to conclude that the deep learning pipeline discussed here predominantly uses image data.
