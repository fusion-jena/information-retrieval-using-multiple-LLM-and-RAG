Various parameter values, including learning rate (i.e., 0.0001, 0.001,
0.01, and 0.1), batch size (i.e., 32, 64, 128, 256, and 512), and latent
dimension (i.e., 128, 256, 512, 2048), have been explored and
evaluated.

training fashion, where the data labels are not utilized, the generative
model is frozen and detached and exclusively employed to extract fea-
tures for both training and testing data, following the representation
learning literature (D'inc`a et al., 2023; Franceschini et al., 2022; Kor-
omilas and Giannakopoulos, 2021; Paoletti et al., 2021d; Paoletti et al.,
2022a). These features are then used to train an MLP.

Given that our model aims to learn to reconstruct these trajectories
without relying on labels, the entire dataset is utilized following the
representation learning literature such as (D'inc`a et al., 2023; Paoletti
et al., 2021a; Paoletti et al., 2022b). The optimization of the network's
parameters is achieved using the Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba,
2015), coupled with an inverse decay learning rate scheduler. This
scheduler initializes the learning rate at a default minimum value, which
is zero. Then, it progressively increases the learning rate until it reaches

5.2.1. Results: Trajectory reconstruction

While it is true that our diffusion and autoencoder models do not
know which sample belongs to which class, there may be some classes
that are implicitly simpler to reconstruct. Additionally, a model could be
learning those samples belonging to the most popular classes more
effectively. Consequently, we also conduct an analysis of the trajectory
reconstruction error for the proposed diffusion model and the proposed
autoencoder. This involves assessing the networks' loss (in terms of MSE)
and comparing the reconstructed data with the original data to measure
their similarity.
