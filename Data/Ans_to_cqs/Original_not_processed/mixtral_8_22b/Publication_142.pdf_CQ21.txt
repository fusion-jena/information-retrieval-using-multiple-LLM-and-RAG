mains, including water management,2 camera trapping,3 and

there are many tools available, including classical statistical
analyses5 and classiﬁcation by citizen scientists.6 However, at
some point traditional approaches may become inefﬁcient or
even impossible given the volume, diversity, and heterogeneity
of these data. Storage, exploration, curation, and revision of
data may have to be re-thought to allow for their quick and efﬁ-
cient transformation, annotation, or analysis. This is particularly

each image was also provided so that the expert could view other contextual
information, such as comments on the photo and adjacent images taken by
the same photographer. Within the app, the expert assessed each photo using
a standard set of questions. These were: (1) whether real plants were the main
focus of the photo; (2) if so, whether a single plant species was the focus; (3)
whether any real plant in a photo was considered to be clearly identiﬁable to
species; (4) whether the Pl@ntNet identiﬁcation was considered correct at
each of the family, genus, and species levels; (5) the national (British) status
of the focal species of the image, i.e., whether the species was native to Britain,
or considered to have been introduced by humans, either recently (post-1500;
a ‘‘neophyte’’) or anciently (pre-1500; an ‘‘archaeophyte’’); (6) whether the

Helpful Answer:
After model training, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the project. Here are some common postprocessing steps:

1. Model Evaluation: After training, it is essential to evaluate the performance of the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curves, etc. These metrics help us understand how well our model has learned from the training data and how accurately it predicts new instances.

2. Confusion Matrix: It is a table layout used to visualize the performance of an algorithm. Each row represents the actual class, while each column represents the predicted class. The diagonal elements represent the correctly classified observations, whereas off-diagonal elements represent misclassified ones.

3. Saliency Maps: They are visualizations of the input features that contribute most significantly to the output of a machine learning model. In deep learning models, saliency maps can highlight important regions in an image that influence the prediction made by the model.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning: Post-training, hyperparameters can be tuned to improve the model's performance further. Techniques like Grid Search, Random Search, Bayesian Optimization, etc., can be employed for this purpose.

5. Ensemble Methods: Multiple trained models can be combined to form an ensemble, improving overall performance. Techniques include bagging, boosting, stacking, etc.

6. Interpretability & Explainability: Efforts should be made to explain the predictions made by the model. Techniques like LIME, SHAP, Anchors, etc., can provide insights into why certain decisions were made.
