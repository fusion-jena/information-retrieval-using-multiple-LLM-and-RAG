be less prone to overfitting (Ruff et al., 2020; Sprengel et al., 2016).

Pre-training on the both ResNet50 (He et al., 2016) and Inception 
(Szegedy et al., 2014) neural networks did not meaningfully improve 
classification performance, therefore this simpler architecture, similar to 
those implemented by (Ruff et al., 2020; Sprengel et al., 2016) was used 
instead. 

2.6. Generating prediction record

(cid:0) 4 and a decay of 1×10

The  optimizer  Adam  was  selected  with  an  initial  learning  rate  of 
(cid:0) 7 and early stopping was used to prevent 
1×10
overfitting  (Kingma  and  Ba,  2014).  Typically,  the  model  trained  be-
tween 10 and 15 epochs before training ceased, where each epoch took 
roughly 1 min on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU. In addition to 
the conventional accuracy metric, the area under the curve, as computed 
by  a  Riemann  sum,  was  also  used  for  training.  From  the  assembled 
database of annotated clips, in each of the five cross-validation folds, 
10% of the data was reserved for comparing the training and validation 
loss/accuracy  after  each  epoch,  and  a  further  10%  was  reserved  for 
performance testing after all training had ceased. All results reported are 
the average after five-fold cross-validation.

analysis to subsets of larger datasets (Potamitis et al., 2014; Priyadar-
shani  et  al.,  2018;  Swiston  and  Mennill,  2009).  Artificial  neural  net-
works,  mathematical  frameworks  conceptually  modeled  on  the 
multilayered structure of the human cerebral cortex, have emerged as 
one powerful tool for automating such analysis (Rosenblatt, 1962). 

In  the  case  of  supervised  neural  networks,  labeled  input  data  is 
connected  to  nodes  whose  importance  weightings  are  continually 
updated  through  an  iterative  process  (Caudill,  1987).  Learning  con-
tinues until these layers of nodes are able to predict the correct associ-
ated label for as many of the data inputs as possible. Therefore, when the 
network encounters unlabeled data of a similar nature that it has never 
seen or trained on before, the nodes are weighted properly so that the 
correct prediction label may result.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not explicitly mention specific regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization. However, there are indications of techniques employed to prevent overfitting. For instance, the use of a simpler architecture instead of pre-trained models like ResNet50 and Inception suggests a form of implicit regularization. Additionally, early stopping is mentioned as a method to prevent overfitting. Early stopping involves monitoring the model's performance on a validation set during training and halting the training process once the performance starts degrading. This helps avoid overfitting by preventing the model from learning noise in the training data.
