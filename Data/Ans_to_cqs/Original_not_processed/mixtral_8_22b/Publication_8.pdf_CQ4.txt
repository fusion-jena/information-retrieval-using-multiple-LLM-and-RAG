This   rising   number   of   digitised   herbarium   sheets   provides   an   opportunity   to   employ
computer-based   image   processing   techniques,   such   as   deep   learning,   to   automatically
identify species and higher taxa (Carranza-Rojas et al. 2017, Younis et al. 2018, Carranza-
Rojas   et   al.   2018)   or   to   extract   other   useful   information   from   the   images,   such   as   the
presence   of   pathogens   (as   done   for   live   plant   photos   by   Mohanty   et   al.   2016).   Deep
learning is a subset of machine learning methods for learning data representation. Deep
learning   techniques   require   huge   amounts   of   training   data   to   learn   the   features   and
representation of those data for the specified task by fine tuning parameters of hundreds or
thousands of neural networks, arranged in multiple layers. Learning the value of these
parameters can take vast computer and time resources, especially on huge datasets.

In order to reduce the training time and, more importantly, because of the small size of the
training dataset, transfer learning (Yosinski et al. 2014) was implemented to initialise the
model weights pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset (Deng et al. 2009). Since the initial
layers of a CNN usually learn very generic features that can also be used in new contexts,
pre-trained   weights   can   initialise   the   weights   for   these   layers.   For   the   deeper   layers,
transfer learning is used to initialise the parameter weights pre-trained on the ImageNet
dataset and then fine-tuned during training, using the annotated herbarium scan dataset
until convergence.

The most common type of deep learning network architecture being used for extracting
image   features   is   the   Convolutional   Neural   Network   (CNN)   (LeCun   and   Bengio   1995).
A convolutional neural network extracts the features of an image by passing through a
series of convolutional, non-linear, pooling (image downsampling) layers and passes them
to a fully connected layer to obtain the desired output. Each convolutional layer extracts the
visual features of the image by applying convolution operations to the image with kernels,
using a local receptive field, to produce feature maps and passing it as input to the next
layer. The initial layers in the network compute primitive features on the image, such as
corners   and   edges,   the   deeper   layers   use   these   features   to   compute   more   complex
features consisting  of curves and  basic  shapes  and  the   deepest   layers  combine  these

Helpful Answer:
To improve the performance of the model and prevent overfitting, several data augmentation techniques were applied in the deep learning pipeline. These included horizontal flipping, rotation, scaling, shearing, and translation. Horizontal flipping involves reflecting the image along its vertical axis, which helps the model generalize better to different orientations. Rotation involves rotating the image by a certain degree, which helps the model recognize objects regardless of their orientation. Scaling involves resizing the image, which helps the model handle variations in object sizes. Shearing involves skewing the image along one of its axes, which helps the model recognize distorted objects. Translation involves shifting the image along one of its axes, which helps the model locate objects within the image. All these techniques help increase the diversity of the training data and improve the robustness of the model.
