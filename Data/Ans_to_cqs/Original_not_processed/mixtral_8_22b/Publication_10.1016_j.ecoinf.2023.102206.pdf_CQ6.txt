Further  discussions  analyze  IFTL  and  FTL  for  their  abilities  to 
improve learning by restricting overconfidence (controlling hesitancy) 
during TL by considering GRNN and SVR as the TUR. Overconfidence in 
ELM,  GRNN,  or  SVR  arises  when  they  make  predictions  on  a  dataset 
(target  domain) that has a huge data distribution difference from the 
source domain data on which they are trained. In this scenario, they just 
use their training experience to make predictions during testing without 
considering the distribution divergence in the testing dataset from the 
training  dataset.  We  conclude  this  section  with  the  execution  time 
analysis of the approaches.  

a)  GDP prediction using only CO2 emission data2

The industrialization has been the primary cause of the economic boom in almost all countries. However, this 
happened  at  the  cost  of  the  environment,  as  industrialization  also  caused  carbon emissions  to  increase  expo-
nentially. According to the established literature, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is related to carbon emissions 
(CO2) which could be optimally employed to precisely estimate a country’s GDP. However, the scarcity of data is 
a  significant  bottleneck  that  could  be  handled  using  transfer  learning  (TL)  which  uses  previously  learned  in-
formation to resolve new tasks, more specifically, related tasks. Notably, TL is highly vulnerable to performance 
degradation due to the deficiency of suitable information and hesitancy in decision-making. Therefore, this paper 
proposes ‘Intuitionistic Fuzzy Transfer Learning (IFTL)’, which is trained to use CO2 emission data of developed

This  tightly  coupled  relationship  between  CO2  emission  and  GDP 
motivated us to predict the GDP of a nation using its carbon emission. 
However,  the  available  dataset  of  some  countries  is  not  sufficient 
enough to train a machine learning (ML) model. To overcome this lim-
itation,  this  paper  proposes  a  novel  transfer  learning  methodology. 
Transfer  learning  (TL),  a  machine  learning  (ML)  technique,  utilizes 
previously learned information to resolve new tasks, more specifically, 
related tasks. In conventional ML techniques, every new task is learned 
from the scratch (Che et al., 2021), and the training and test data are 
drawn from the same distribution. However, if the data distribution is 
changed between the training and test data, the performance and reli-
ability  of  the  predicted  output  may  degrade  significantly  (Lu  et  al., 
2019). This may also lead to high computational costs and inappropriate

We have found that the proposed approach efficiently captured the 
uncertainty produced by extreme variations in data distribution or the 
predictive tasks across the source and target data. It suitably restricted 
overconfidence  for  better  learning  while  transferring  the  learned 
knowledge. IFTL outperformed FTL, where the training and testing do-
mains (including labels) have huge data distribution differences. This 
validated  the  effectiveness  of  hesitancy  in  restricting  overconfidence 
during TL. IFTL is also thoroughly analyzed for its asymptotic compu-
tational complexity and execution time. The limitation of IFTL is that it 
adds  additional  computation  by  calculating  membership,  non- 
membership,  hesitancy  margin  of  each  feature,  and  the  distance 
metric for refining the output labels predicted by other ML approaches. 
This  work  has  successfully  demonstrated  the  utility  of  ecological

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be taken to improve the quality of the input data and enhance the overall performance of the model. These steps include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing any irrelevant, redundant, or corrupted data points from the dataset. This step ensures that the model learns from accurate and relevant data.

2. Normalization/Scaling: Deep learning models often perform better when the input features are scaled to similar ranges. Techniques such as Min-Max Scaling, Z-Score Normalization, or Log Transformations can be used to scale numerical features.

3. Feature Engineering: This process involves creating new features based on existing ones to help the model capture complex patterns within the data. Examples include polynomial features, interaction terms, or binning continuous variables into categorical ones.

4. Handling Missing Values: Depending on the nature of missing values, different strategies can be applied, including imputation methods like mean, median, mode, or regression-based imputation. Alternatively, one might choose to drop rows containing missing values entirely.

5. Encoding Categorical Variables: Since most deep learning algorithms require numeric inputs, categorical variables need to be converted into numerical representations. Common encoding schemes include One-Hot Encoding, Label Encoding, or Target Mean Encoding.

6. Splitting Dataset: Before training the model, the dataset should be split into three subsets: training set, validation set, and test set. Typically, the ratio is around 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing.

These preprocessing steps ensure that the input data is well-structured, clean, and ready for consumption by the deep learning algorithm. By applying these techniques, we can expect improved model accuracy, faster convergence, and reduced risk of overfitting.
