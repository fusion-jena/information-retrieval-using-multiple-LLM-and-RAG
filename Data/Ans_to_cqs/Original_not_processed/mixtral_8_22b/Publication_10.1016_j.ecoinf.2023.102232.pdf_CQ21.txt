Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

A single iteration of the MCMC algorithm provides for the following 
steps.  It  is  selected  a  random  row  of  the  genetic  algorithm  output 
database between [1, nMCMC], and the best parameter values are subse-
quently absorbed. As already described in Section 2.3.1, even in this case 
the  absorbed  parameter  values  are  supposed  to  be  the  mean  of  a 
Gaussian  distribution,  μ,  while  in  this  case  the  associated  variance  is 
defined as a fixed value σ2 = (0.2 μ)2. A random value is generated from 
the Gaussian distribution associated with each parameter by using the 
random.normal() function, then, the ODE system is subsequently solved. 
At the same time, the step provides for absorbing the array of experi-
mental data, allowing the comparison between the ODE model output 
and the experimental data, based on the log-probability value.

The  entries  of  the  database  are  subsequently  ordered  from  the 
smaller to the higher sum of the residual values. This operation ends the 
first  step  of  the  LS  algorithm  and  leads  to  the  second  part,  hereafter 
defined  as  the  genetic  algorithm.  This  is  in  turn  based  on  an  iterative 
optimization, and its purpose is to partially optimize the results of the 
estimation and to better explore the space of the parameters. This part of 
the  process  is  analogous  to  the  previously  described  step:  the  first 
quarter  of  the  best  fit  parameter  values  stored  in  the  database  is 
considered as input for the process.

The final set of parameters, accordingly, is calculated by considering 
this second dataset. Thus, the a posteriori distribution of the parameters 
is generated by merging all the traces of each of the correct simulations 
in  a  single  database.  The  statistical  distribution  of  the  parameters  is 
reported  by  its  mean  and  the  standard  deviation  of  the  traces  of  the 
database of MCMC simulations.

2.3. The hybrid MCMC algorithm 

After  the  introduction  of  the  physiologically  based  model,  let  us 
detail the hybrid MCMC algorithm, the main objective of this study. It is 
worth pointing out that what follows in this section can be adapted to 
any model having the features described in Section 2.1. The algorithm 
can be divided into two macro steps: the first one is based on a Least 
Squares approach for finding  the optimal combination of  parameters, 
and the second one on a Metropolis-Hastings-like algorithm to sample 
the a posteriori distribution of parameters. A schematic representation 
of the logical steps is detailed in Fig. 2, while we hereafter report the

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, it appears that the text discusses a hybrid MCMC algorithm used for modeling purposes rather than machine learning or deep learning models. Therefore, the postprocessing steps mentioned in the query such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, confusion matrix do not directly apply to this scenario. However, I will provide information about the postprocessing steps involved in the hybrid MCMC algorithm discussed in the context.

In the hybrid MCMC algorithm, there are two primary steps involved in the postprocessing phase. After obtaining the optimal combination of parameters using the least squares approach, the next step involves sampling the a posteriori distribution of parameters using a Metropolis-Hastings-like algorithm.

Once the algorithm has been executed, the resulting outputs include the following:

1. Best parameter values: The algorithm selects a random row from the genetic algorithm output database and absorbs the best parameter values. These values are assumed to be the mean of a Gaussian distribution, denoted as μ, with an associated variance defined as a fixed value σ^2 = (0.2 μ)^2.

2. Random value generation: For each parameter, a random value is generated from the Gaussian distribution using the random.normal() function. Subsequently, the ODE system is solved.

3. Comparison with experimental data: The algorithm allows for comparing the ODE model output with the experimental data based on the log-probability value.

4. Ordering of database entries: The entries of the database are ordered from smaller to higher sum of residual values.

5. Generation of a posteriori distribution: Finally, the a posteriori distribution of the parameters is generated by merging all the traces of each correct simulation into a single database. The statistical distribution of the parameters is reported by its mean and the standard deviation of the traces of the database of MCMC simulations.
