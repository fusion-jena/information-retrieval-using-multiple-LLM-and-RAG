stochastic process mainly valued in a Hilbert space. Statistical methods 
for functional data have received a lot of attention from the scientific 
community  (Ramsay  and  Silverman,  2005;  Silverman  and  Ramsay, 
2002) over the last decade. Li et al. (2022) and Koner and Staicu (2023) 
reviewed recently some of the fundamental concepts of the FDA, their 
recent advances, and their impact on practical cases. FDA is an alter-
native to the use of diverse and heterogeneous datasets (Pauthenet et al., 
2017, 2019) of functional, shape or more complex structure. Here we 
studied the relationships between the SSL spatial structuration and the 
pelagic environment to take advantage of all the information available 
in the data. Previous work by Diogoul et al. (2020), among others, has 
been  done  on  aggregated  features  from  the  original  data.  Classical

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not directly address the handling of randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide some general strategies used to manage randomness in this context.

Randomness in deep learning pipelines often arises from various sources like weight initialization, batch selection during training, dropout regularization, etc. To ensure reproducibility and consistency across experiments, several strategies are commonly employed:

1. **Fixed Random Seeds**: Setting a fixed random seed value for all random operations ensures that the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers will be generated each time the code runs. This helps in reproducing results consistently.

2. **Deterministic Algorithms**: Using deterministic algorithms instead of non-deterministic ones can help eliminate unpredictable behavior due to randomness. For example, using a deterministic algorithm for mini-batch generation can ensure consistent batches across different runs.

3. **Repeatability vs Reproducibility**: While repeatability refers to obtaining identical results when running the same code multiple times on the same machine, reproducibility means getting similar results when running the code on different machines or environments. Achieving perfect repeatability might not always be possible due to hardware differences, but efforts should be made towards achieving reproducible results.

4. **Documentation**: Properly documenting the software versions, libraries, and dependencies used in the project can help others reproduce the results accurately. Tools like Docker or Conda can be used to create isolated environments with specific package versions.
