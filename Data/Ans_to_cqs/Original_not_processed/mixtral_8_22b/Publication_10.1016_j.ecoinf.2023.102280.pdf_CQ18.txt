for both methods are manually tuned to maximise the evaluation metrics

3. Methodology

training  deep  noise  reduction  techniques.  There  are  also  challenges 
when generating training data for fine-tuning. Generally, clean data is 
collected, and noise profiles are superimposed to provide both the input 
data  and  a  “denoised”  ground  truth.  Collecting  clean  recordings  is 
infeasible  in  many  cases  or  requires  the  recording  of  captive  animals 
which  may  not  be  representative  of  the  wider  population.  Adjacent 
fields can generate human speech or music as required but this is not an 
option for many bioacoustics applications.

5.2. Ablation studies 

Data  requirements  are  a  key  consideration  for  many  monitoring 
applications  given  the  lack  of  existing  datasets.  Audio  enhancement 
models  require  training  data  for  fine-tuning.  Fine-tuning  does  not 
necessarily require large datasets. Section 4.1.2 demonstrate that similar 
performance could be achieved using a subset of 100 training examples. 
Data  augmentation  techniques  such  as  superimposing  noise  samples 
should  also  be  considered  as  bioacoustics  applications  typically  have 
abundant  noise  features.  Both  WPD  and  spectral  subtraction  do  not 
require training data.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not explicitly mention the specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does discuss some aspects related to training and evaluating models. It mentions that deep noise reduction techniques are trained, which implies that some form of performance monitoring would be necessary during training. Additionally, it notes that evaluation metrics are used to tune these methods, suggesting that these metrics might be part of the strategy to monitor model performance. Furthermore, the text highlights the importance of collecting clean data and creating noisy versions for training purposes, indicating that the quality and representativeness of the training data could impact model performance. Lastly, it points out that data augmentation techniques like superimposing noise samples should be considered, especially since bioacoustic applications often have abundant noise features. This suggests that managing and utilizing noise effectively could play a role in maintaining good model performance.
