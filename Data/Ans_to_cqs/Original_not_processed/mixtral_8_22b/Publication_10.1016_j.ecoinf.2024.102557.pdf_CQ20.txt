2.2. Modeling 

We  trained productivity  models for  B.  edulis, H.  repandum,  L. deli-
ciosus, M. procera and T. portentosum based on the random forest algo-
rithm and the R package “ranger” (Wright and Ziegler, 2017). Random 
forest models allow us to find consistent nonlinear ecological relation-
ships  among  a  large  number  of  predictors,  making  them  suitable  for 
predicting  this  resource  that  sometimes  appears  to  be  driven  by

synthesis and use of conservation and environmental evidence. Conserv. Biol. 32 (4), 
762–764. https://doi.org/10.1111/cobi.13117.

2022; Christin et al., 2019; W¨aldchen and M¨ader, 2018) and promises to 
continue  to  make  further  progress  (Morera,  2024).  These  techniques 
have  allowed  to  improve  the  accuracy  of  results  compared  to  more 
traditional modeling techniques due to the possibility to approximate 
non-linear  relationships  and  to  consider  a  large  number of  predictors 
(Meyer  et  al.,  2019).  Machine  learning  in  ecology  has  been  used  for 
instance to study species distribution (Liang et al., 2022; Bellin et al., 
2022), species identification through imagery (Gao et al., 2024), char-
acterization of land use change (Gelabert et al., 2021), identification of 
conservable or restorable areas (Cheng et al., 2018), biodiversity con-
servation and estimation (Tuia et al., 2022; Chang, 2023), and invasive 
species risk assessment (Jensen et al., 2020).

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not contain information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding whether GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware resources were utilized during the training process.
