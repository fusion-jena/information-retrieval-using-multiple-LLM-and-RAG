species  in  ecosystems  including  artificial  neural  networks  (Park  and 
Chung, 2006), random forest (Lee et al., 2019; Park et al., 2013), and 
maximum entropy modeling (Maxent) (Hirata et al., 2017; Ikegami and 
Jenkins,  2018).  Machine  learning  methods  help  researchers  to  effec-
tively manage complex and nonlinear ecological data as a tool for data 
exploration, prediction of ecological patterns, and pattern recognition 
(Humphries et al., 2018).

Differences were also observed for the comparison between model 
outputs. The RF model showed a more conservative distribution of the 
probabilities  of  PWD  occurrence  than  the  Maxent  model.  However, 
these differences were very small for the same site (i.e., the same cell in 
the map). Therefore, we developed an ensemble model by integrating 
the RF and the Maxent models. The ensemble technique is frequently 
used  to  address  machine  learning  problems,  such  as  confidence  esti-
mation and error correction (Polikar, 2012). By integrating the models, 
each  model  acted  in  a  complementary  manner  and  generated  better 
results.  The  ensemble  model  in  this  study  showed  a  highly  improved 
power of prediction, compared to the corresponding power of either the 
RF or the Maxent model. 

4.3. Enhancement of management and control to prevent the pine wilt 
disease

Insect forest risk assessment is important to effectively manage insect 
pests, as it promotes efficient identification of hazardous forest condi-
tions and development of strategies for their control by providing in-
formation on pest occurrence patterns (Choi et al., 2017; Mason, 1985; 
Park  et  al.,  2013).  There  are  various  approaches  to  hazard  rating  for 
various  insect  pests  in  forest  ecosystems.  Recently,  machine  learning 
methods  have  been  successfully  used  to  evaluate  the  risk  of  invasive

Helpful Answer:
There are several techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the original class proportions. This ensures that both sets contain representative samples from each class, reducing the likelihood of biased results due to imbalanced classes.

Oversampling is a method used when dealing with imbalanced datasets where one class has significantly fewer instances than another. It involves duplicating examples from the minority class until its size matches that of the majority class. Alternatively, synthetic examples can be created through interpolation or extrapolation techniques.

Undersampling is another approach to handling imbalanced datasets but focuses on reducing the number of examples in the majority class instead of increasing those in the minority class. This can be done randomly or based on specific criteria like removing redundant or noisy examples.

Diverse data collection aims to gather a wide range of examples representing different aspects of the problem domain. This helps ensure that the trained model generalizes well across various scenarios rather than being overfit to a particular subset of the data.

These techniques should be applied judiciously depending on the characteristics of the dataset and the nature of the task at hand. In some cases, combining multiple methods may yield better results than relying solely on one approach.

Based on the given context, there is no direct mention of these techniques being used specifically for addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, they are commonly employed in machine learning applications, including those related to ecology and natural resource management.

Answer: Based on the given context, there is no direct mention of techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, common methods include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. These techniques aim to handle imbalanced datasets, maintain class proportions, reduce noise, and improve model generalization. They should be applied judiciously depending on the dataset and task requirements.
