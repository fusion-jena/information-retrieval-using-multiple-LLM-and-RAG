was analysed using various evaluation matrices. During model training, 
the input image size was set to 512 × 512 and the maximum batch size 
was limited to 4. To prevent underfitting, all models were ensured to 
follow back-propagation after accumulating the batch size 32 times. The 
models were trained using a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer 
with an initial learning rate of 0.01 and a cycle learning rate of 0.2, with

3.2. Model evaluation 

Matrices  such  as  precision,  recall,  and  average  precision  (AP)  at 
various Intersections Over Union (IoU) thresholds were used to evaluate 
the performance of the models using Eqs. (4–6). The AP0.5, indicating 
average precision at 50% IoU, provided a more balanced reflection of 
the global detection performance of the model. The evaluation metrics 
for each model on the validation set were calculated after 300 epochs.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To monitor the model performance during training, several strategies were employed. Firstly, the input image size was fixed at 512 x 512 pixels. Secondly, the maximum batch size was restricted to 4 to manage computational resources effectively. Thirdly, to avoid underfitting, the authors made sure that all models followed back-propagation after accumulating the batch size 32 times. Fourthly, the models were trained using a Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer with an initial learning rate of 0.01 and a cyclic learning rate of 0.2. Lastly, the performance of the models was evaluated using various matrices like precision, recall, and average precision (AP) at different Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds. These evaluations were conducted after every 300 epochs.
