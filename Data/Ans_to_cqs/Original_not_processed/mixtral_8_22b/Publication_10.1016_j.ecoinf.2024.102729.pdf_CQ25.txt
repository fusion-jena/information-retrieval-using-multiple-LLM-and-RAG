comprehensive  strategy  to  elucidate  the  role  of  environmental  stressors  that  modulate 

phytoplankton  dynamics.  This  approach  advances  our  understanding  more  than  the  -often

generalizable  non-linear  patterns  have  been  successful  in  predicting  chlorophyll-a  (Chl  a),  a 

commonly used proxy for algal biomass and a direct indicator to evaluate the ecological state of 

inland  waters.  Among  the  ML  methods,  Random  Forest  (RF)  modeling  emerges  as  a  popular

study,  the  dataset  was  randomly  divided  into  two  subsets,  the  first  one  was  used  as  a  training 

dataset  to  learn  the  optimal  model  structure  and  the  second  as  a  validation  dataset  to  test  its 

performance;  75%  of  the  data  were  devoted  to  model  training  and  25%  to  testing.  Given  the 

well-documented robustness of RF algorithms to randomly receive training data from subsets and 

establish models with high predictive capacity, we opted for random (instead of cluster) sampling 

with  one  major  condition  to  maintain  the  covariance  structure  among  the  predictor  variables 

relatively intact between the training and testing datasets.

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the given context is not explicitly stated. However, based on the references provided, it appears that the deep learning model may be used for various applications related to water quality management. For instance, the paper titled "Applications of deep learning in water quality management" suggests that deep learning models could potentially be applied for tasks such as prediction, monitoring, or analysis of water quality parameters like pH levels, dissolved oxygen, total suspended solids, etc. Another reference mentions using machine learning techniques, including deep learning, for analyzing spatial and temporal variation in water coverage in lakes. Therefore, without further specific details about the particular deep learning model being discussed, it can only be speculated that its purpose might involve some aspect of water quality management or analysis.
