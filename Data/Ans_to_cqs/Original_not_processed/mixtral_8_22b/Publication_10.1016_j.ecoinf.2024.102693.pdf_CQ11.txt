2.2. Transformer-like model 

Transformer  was  proposed  by  Vaswani  et  al.  (2017)  and  initially 
designed for Seq2Seq tasks, replacing long short-term memory (LSTM) 
with a full-attention structure. It was primarily applied in NLP, and both 
the  transformer  and  its  subsequent  iterations  demonstrated  excellent 
performance in a wide range of downstream tasks. With the success of 
the transformer in NLP, researchers have begun to explore its applica-
tion in CV. 

The core structure of the transformer-like visual model is an encoder 
module, which comprises several stacked blocks. Each block consists of 
two  components:  a  token  mixer  module  (Yu  et  al.,  2022)  for  fusing 
spatial information and an MLP module for fusing channel information. 
The main distinction among the different transformer-like visual models 
lies in the variations in the token mixer module. For example, the token 
mixer in a ViT (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) is a self-attention module.

Yuan et al. (2022) claimed that the superior performance of a ViT can 
primarily be attributed to extensive pre-training data. If a ViT is trained 
from  scratch  on  a  medium-sized  dataset,  its  performance  lags  behind 
that of a CNN model with comparable parameter sizes. To address this 
limitation, they proposed Volo with the novel Outlook Attention as the 
token mixer module, which enabled fine-grained token representation 
and the aggregation of global information.

2.1. CNN-like model 

CNN is a classical model in CV, renowned for its robust translational 
invariance and ability to extract high-level semantic features. ResNet, 
proposed by He et al. (2016), is a well-known CNN model with a core 
structure of residual units. This innovative design addresses the issue of 
gradient disappearance as the number of layers increases. This allows for 
a  greater  depth  in  the  network,  leading  to  the  extraction  of  more 
expressive  features.  ResNet  has  exhibited  superior  performance 
compared with previous models in various downstream recognition and 
detection tasks.
