medium, and high- coverage levels are NDVI, SAVI, WDRVI; NDVI, RVI, 
SAVI,  WDRVI;  EVI,  RVI,  SAVI,  WDRVI,  respectively  (abbreviations 
defined  in  Table  1  Table  2).  (3)  The  third  objective  is  to  extend  the 
model to Northeast China in 2023 to indicate the strong generalisation 
ability and robustness of our proposed model. The R2 in Northeast China 
is as high as 0.85, which is significantly higher than R2 = 0.82 that of the 
estimation model without considering crop coverage, indicating strong 
generalisation ability and robustness of the model.

and  verification  sets  in  a  ratio  of  3:1.  Five  modelling  methods  were 
selected: random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), multi-layer 
perceptron (MLP), extreme gradient boosting (XGboost), and multiple 
linear  regression  (MLR)  (Abdali  et  al.,  2023;  Fang  et  al.,  2024;  Khan 
et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2023; Xiao et al., 2023b; Xiao et al., 2024). First, 
the model with the highest accuracy was selected to estimate the rice 
LCC and crop coverage degree in the entire study area without consid-
ering the differences in crop coverage. The rice LCC model based on crop 
coverage was then used for estimation, and its accuracy was compared 
with the chlorophyll estimation model without considering differences 
in crop coverage.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model, several measures were implemented by L. Liu et al. These include using diverse datasets, employing cross-validation techniques, and stratified splitting. Specifically, they collected data from different regions and years, including low-, medium-, and high-coverage levels, to create a diverse dataset. They also utilized five modeling methods - Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) - to improve the model's performance and robustness. Furthermore, they divided the dataset into training and verification sets in a 3:1 ratio, ensuring that the model could be tested against unseen data. Lastly, they extended the model to Northeast China in 2023, demonstrating its strong generalization ability and robustness.
