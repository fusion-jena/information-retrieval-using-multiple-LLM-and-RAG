Question: %INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the provided pieces of context to answer the query in less than 400 words. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

%Query
Query: "Where is the data repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not contain any reference to a specific data repository or dataset related to a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it is impossible to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline might be available based solely on this context. It would require additional information about the source of the deep learning pipeline or its associated research project to provide a more accurate response.
