temperatures that occur during the wettest season (degrees Celsius); 3) 
bio9,  ‘Mean  temperature  of  driest  quarter’,  is  a  quarterly  index  that 
approximates  the  mean  temperatures  that  occur  during  the  driest 
quarter (degrees Celsius); 4) bio13, ‘Precipitation of wettest month’, is 
the index that identifies the total precipitation that occurs during the 
wettest month (millimetres); 5) bio19, ‘Precipitation of coldest quarter’, 
is  a  quarterly  index  that  indicates  the  total  precipitation  that  occurs 
during the coldest quarter (millimetres); and 6) ‘Slope’ in % values of the 
Iberian  Peninsula  (see  Supplementary  Material  1C).  Finally,  we  used 
clamping  maps  of  MaxEnt  to  project  the  same  set  of  environmental 
variables used to perform the current models but expressing other time

Table 3 
The values show averages of 10 replicate runs, estimating the relative contributions of the environmental and territorial variables to the MaxEnt model. The percentage 
contribution determines the jackknife; in each iteration of the training algorithm, the increase in regularized gain is added to the contribution of the corresponding 
variable. Permutation importance shows the values of that variable on training presence, and background data are randomly permuted. The model is reevaluated on 
the permuted data, and the resulting drop in training AUC is shown, normalized to percentages.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the data was split into a training dataset and a testing dataset using a 70/30 ratio. This means that 70% of the data was used for training the MaxEnt model, while the remaining 30% was used for testing its performance. However, there is no mention of a separate validation dataset being used. It seems that the maximum number of iterations was also specified when running the model with this particular setup. Additionally, the analysis involved examining various environmental and geographical factors such as temperature indices, precipitation indices, and slope. These factors were likely used as input features for the model.
