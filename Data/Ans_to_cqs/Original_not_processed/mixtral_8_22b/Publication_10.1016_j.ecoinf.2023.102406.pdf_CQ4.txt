4.5. Sample thinning 

Sample  thinning  had  very  little  effect  on  accuracy  or  variable 
importance,  or  mapped  models,  indicating  no  clear  benefits  for 
tampering  with  samples  that  may  provide  information  about  species 
characteristics and responses to the environment. It is not necessary to 
add another modeling step that involves many choices, although thin-
ning  may  be  beneficial  if  thousands  of  samples  were  taken  from  one 
study site. An outcome of reducing samples is that minimum sample size 
thresholds need to be lowered to maintain the same species pool. Sample 
thinning does provide a confirmation that sample size is not as critical as 
capturing ecological amplitude for species distribution. 

5. Conclusions

1.4. Modeling approaches 

Modeling also includes selection of the classifier (or probability of 
occurrence estimator), which encompasses hundreds of different options 
(FernÂ´andez-Delgado  et  al.,  2014),  although  general  linear  models, 
MaxEnt,  and  random  forests  are  among  the  most  commonly  applied 
classifiers  (Santini  et  al.,  2021).  For  the  selected  classifier,  modeling 
package  options  enable  automated  tuning  for  parameters  through 
resampling and standard default values to reach the most accurate final 
model configuration. Multiple methods may be applied to detect over-
lapping outcomes, allowing some strength of evidence within a study 
rather  than  only  comparing  support  from  other  studies,  but  multiple 
methods may be too burdensome when hundreds or thousands of models 
are generated due to numerous species, predictor variable combinations, 
and time intervals.

2. Methods 

2.1. Species samples and thinning

Accuracy  metrics  occurred  on  separate  testing  data,  or  withheld 
known classes, to determine how well the classifier assigned classes using 
predictor  variables.  The  testing  data  were  25%  of  samples  for  this 
modeling, a randomly sampled split that is standard modeling practice 
(performed through the createDataPartition function in the caret pack-
age). The true positive rate or sensitivity is a measure of the number of 
predicted observations that were accurately assigned to a class, while the 
true negative rate or specificity is a measure of the number of predicted 
observations where the response variable of interest did not occur.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given text does not discuss any data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotating, scaling, etc. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer based on the given context. However, these techniques are often used in image processing tasks to increase the amount of training data by creating modified versions of images in the dataset. This helps improve model performance and prevent overfitting.
