There is no doubt that low-quality images will increase the workload 
of  image  processing,  requiring  more  complex  algorithms.  Obtaining 
high-quality  images  through  a  fully  automated  biomass  estimation 
method, without any manual intervention, can significantly reduce the 
workload  for  humans.  To  decrease  the  need  for  manual  intervention, 
Ravanbakhsh et al. (2015) implemented a deep learning technique that 
automatically detected and identified the head and mouth of Southern 
Bluefin tuna that were cultured in deep-sea cages. The head and mouth 
of the fish in specific positions within the underwater stereo images were 
accurately recognized using the Haar classifier. Although this technique 
efficiently  decreases  manual  processes,  achieving  fully  automated 
acquisition  of  biomass  information  is  still  lacking  in  certain  aspects.

Helpful Answer:
The article does not provide explicit details about the preprocessing steps used before training their deep learning model. However, it mentions that they aimed to obtain high-quality images for accurate recognition of fish heads and mouths in underwater stereo images. This suggests that some form of image enhancement or filtering might have been applied during preprocessing.

Typically, when working with neural networks and deep learning models, common preprocessing steps include data normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization involves adjusting values measured on different scales to a common scale, while scaling refers to rescaling numerical input features to improve convergence speed during optimization. Cleaning may involve removing outliers, handling missing values, or correcting inconsistent entries in the dataset.

Although the article doesn't specify these exact preprocessing techniques, it is reasonable to assume that similar methods could be employed depending on the nature of the dataset being used for training the deep learning model.
