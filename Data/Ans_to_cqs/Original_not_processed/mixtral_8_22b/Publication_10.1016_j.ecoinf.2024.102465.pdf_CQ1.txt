The study employs the HRNet model due to its high accuracy and 
stability. HRNet effectively performs semantic segmentation by simul-
taneously  merging  high-resolution  and  low-resolution  convolution 
computations (Sun et al., 2019). By using HRNet to model social media 
image data in PyCharm software for semantic segmentation processing, 
in combination with graphics processing software for proofreading, the 
greenness, blueness, and sky openness index can be derived using the 
formulas described by Wu et al. (2023). G indicates the level of greenery 
in  the  panoramic  image;  PGreenness  is  the  total  number  and  amount  of 
pixels  corresponding  to  vegetative  and  green  spaces  identified  in  the 
semantic segmentation process; PTotal  represents the overall number of 
pixels specified in the image; O represents the level of openness in the 
panoramic image; PSky denotes the percentage of identified sky elements

Following

The study collected relevant reviews with images from the Weibo, 
Dianping, and Ctrip platforms for 57 traditional villages, respectively. 
After  cleaning  and  removing  irrelevant  data,  3694  social  media  data 
entries with photographs were obtained. The NLP model scores the text 
content in the valid data on a scale of 10 to (cid:0) 10, and the final average 
value for each traditional village is calculated. Higher values indicate 
more favorable sentiments.

Helpful Answer:
In this study, the researchers collect relevant reviews with images from three different platforms - Weibo, Dianping, and Ctrip - for 57 traditional villages. After cleaning and removing irrelevant data, they obtain 3694 social media data entries with photographs. This suggests that the primary method used for collecting raw data in their deep learning pipeline involves gathering user-generated content from various online sources. However, it should be noted that the specifics regarding how the data was extracted or scraped from these platforms are not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
