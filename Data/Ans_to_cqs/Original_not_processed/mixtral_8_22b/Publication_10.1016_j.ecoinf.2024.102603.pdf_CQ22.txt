and involve lengthier training times compared to the computationally 
efficient XGBoost [Joshi et al., 2023]. Moreover, the interpretability of 
these models varies significantly. XGBoost stands out by offering feature 
importance scores and decision rules, contributing to a clearer under-
standing  of  its  decision-making  process.  Conversely,  deep  learning 
models  often  carry  the  label  of  “black  box”  due  to  their  complexity, 
making it challenging to interpret and comprehend how they arrive at 
specific predictions [Wu et al., 2021]. Additionally, the performance on 
small  datasets  is  another  distinctive  factor.  XGBoost  demonstrates 
effectiveness  even  with  limited  data  [Chen  and  Guestrin,  2016;  Jing 
et al., 2022], while deep learning models generally require substantial 
datasets to achieve optimal results [Wu et al., 2021; Khruschev et al., 
2022].

structured and unstructured data, such as images and text [Jafarzadeh 
et  al., 2022]. The divergence extends  to computational requirements, 
where deep learning models typically demand more resources, including 
GPUs  (Graphics  Processing  Units)  or  TPUs  (Tensor  Processing  Units),

the examined population is recorded and utilized by the next tree in line 
to improve the previous results. 

To assess the model's performance, we used the leave-one-out pro-
cedure for cross-validation [Hastie et al., 2001]. It maximizes the use of 
available data, reduces bias in performance estimation, and is particu-
larly  useful  for  small  datasets,  as  it  rigorously  assesses  model  perfor-
mance by iterative training on all but one sample and evaluating the 
excluded  sample.  The  following  metrics  were  calculated  for  model 
performance:  the  coefficient  of  determination  (R2),  as  well  as  Mean 
Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Relative 
Root Mean Square Error (RRMSE).

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the evaluation metrics used specifically for a deep learning model. However, it mentions the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a model, which includes the coefficient of determination (R2), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Relative Root Mean Square Error (RRMSE). These metrics are used in conjunction with the leave-one-out procedure for cross-validation to assess the model's performance.
