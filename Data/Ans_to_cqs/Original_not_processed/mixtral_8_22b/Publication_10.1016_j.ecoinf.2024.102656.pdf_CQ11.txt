overlap with urial habitats (Table 4). The habitat corridor for the species 
covers 652.92 km2, and intersect 22 km of mining roads. In the eastern 
section,  89%  of  the  corridor  network  is  covered  by  CAs  (Fig.  4B, 
Table 5).

Connectivity  prediction  was  implemented  in  UNICOR  over  the 
resistance  map  for  the  species  to  find  the  single-source  shortest  path 
between  start  and  end  occurrence  records  (Landguth  et  al.,  2012; 
Cushman et al., 2013). Furthermore, the continuous factorial least-cost 
path map was converted to a categorical map based on the same method 
used  for  core  habitats.  To  measure  the  coverage  of  core  habitats  and 
corridors by CAs, the proportion of these areas within CAs was measured 
(Almasieh and Mohammadi, 2023).
