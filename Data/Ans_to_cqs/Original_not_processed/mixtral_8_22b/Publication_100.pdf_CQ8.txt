4.5. Implementation details

We have implemented our models in PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2017).
We trained 𝑀 = 5 models with batch size 𝐵 = 64 and a base learning
rate 𝛼 = 10−4. The learning rate is automatically reduced by a factor
of 0.1 when the validation loss has not improved for 15 consecutive
epochs. We apply weight decay to control the strength of the unit
Gaussian prior, with an empirically chosen magnitude of 10−3 that
is inversely proportional to the hyperparameter 𝜆 from Eq. (1). We
chose 𝛽1 = 0.9, 𝛽2 = 0.999 and 𝜖 = 10−8 as hyper-parameters for the
Adam optimizer. Each neural network was trained on a single Nvidia
RTX2080Ti GPU for ∼14 days.

5. Experimental results and discussion

As commonly done in deep learning, we iteratively learn the model
parameters with stochastic gradient descend, starting from a random
initialization. In each iteration, we randomly sample a batch of 𝐵 = 64
reference data patches of size 15 × 15 pixels, where a patch is only
considered for training if the center pixel is forested. We consider a
pixel forested if and only if it contains vegetation points (points with
𝐷𝑧 > 1.3 m, see Section 3.1) and also is considered forested based on
NIBIO’s Norway-wide timber volume map (Astrup et al., 2019). We use
the latter as an additional precautionary measure to avoid unnecessary
noise from non-forested areas, as we are interested in learning forest
characteristics only. For every reference data patch, we randomly pick
an optical image from the correct year and two SAR images (one as-
cending and one descending orbit) with acquisition dates near the one
of the optical image. Using SAR with both ascending and descending
