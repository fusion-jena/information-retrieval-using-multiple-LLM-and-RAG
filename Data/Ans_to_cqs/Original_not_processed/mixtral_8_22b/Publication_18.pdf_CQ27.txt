Further research could increase the performance and variety of species identified by our CNN-model. For 
instance, the model could be improved by increasing the number of samples and variety of atmospheric and sea 
conditions in the training datasets, by building hierarchical training datasets with different behaviour across 
different species67, by using more spectral bands and temporal information68, and by artificially increasing the 
spatial resolution of the images through rendering69. In addition, as it is a fast and scalable method, it can even be 
transferred to very high spatial resolution images (<10 cm) captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for the 
automatic identification of specific individuals70.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide explicit details about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, based on common practices in machine learning, we can infer some possible steps. After training the model, it would typically be serialized into a format suitable for storage or transfer, such as a.pkl file in Python's pickle module or a.h5 file in Keras. This serialized model can then be loaded onto a platform for use. The choice of platform depends on various factors like computational resources, accessibility, and intended application. It could range from a local device to cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure. Unfortunately, without further context, we cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the exact process followed in this particular case.
