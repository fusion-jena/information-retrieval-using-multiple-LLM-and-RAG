Fig. 3. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves of seven machine learning models. The true positive rate (sensitivity) of the vertical line and the false positive 
rate (1-specificity) of the horizontal line quantify the proportion of correctly and incorrectly classified samples, respectively. The red and blue curves represent the 
mean area under the curve (AUC) of training and test data, respectively. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to

Helpful Answer:
After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the project or research. Some common postprocessing steps include:

1. Model evaluation metrics: Calculating various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curves, etc., to assess the performance of the trained model. In Fig. 3, for example, the authors present receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for seven different machine learning models, comparing their mean area under the curve (AUC) values for both training and testing datasets.

2. Confusion matrices: Creating confusion matrices to visualize the performance of the model by displaying the number of correct and incorrect predictions made by the model. This helps identify any patterns or biases in the misclassifications.

3. Saliency maps: Generating saliency maps to highlight important features contributing to the model's decision-making process. These maps help researchers understand which input features have the most significant impact on the output prediction.

4. Hyperparameter tuning: Adjusting hyperparameters based on the initial model performance to improve its overall effectiveness. This step involves fine-tuning parameters like learning rates, regularization coefficients, or network architecture settings.

5. Ensemble methods: Combining multiple models using ensemble techniques to create a single, more robust model with improved generalization capabilities. Examples of ensemble methods include bagging, boosting, stacking, and voting.

6. Model interpretability: Explaining the model's decisions through feature importance rankings, partial dependence plots, or other interpretability tools. This step aims to provide insights into how the model arrives at its conclusions, making it easier for stakeholders to trust and use the model.
