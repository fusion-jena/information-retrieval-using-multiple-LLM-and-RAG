4.3. Advantages and drawbacks 

4.3.1. Model prediction beyond the training ranges

For  the  present  study,  we  used  the  Maximum  Entropy  (MaxEnt) 
ENM, a shallow-machine learning model that can reach high prediction 
accuracy (Angeletti et al., 2020; Baldwin, 2009; Capezzuto et al., 2018; 
Coro et  al., 2015b; Coro et al., 2022b; Coro and  Bove, 2022; Phillips 
et al., 2004; Phillips et al., 2006; Phillips and Dudik, 2008). MaxEnt can 
be effective in estimating species-richness change under future climate 
change  conditions  using  regional-  or  global-scale  environmental  pa-
rameters (Coro et al., 2022a; Gallagher et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2012). The 
model builds a species’ ecological niche as a probability density function 
π(x) of habitat suitability in the vector space of environmental param-
eters x. It uses two constraints: (i) π(x) should assign a reasonably high 
probability to the mean parameter values at the presence locations and 
(ii)  the  overall  entropy  function  (H = (cid:0)
π(x) ln(π(x) ))  should  be

the models to overestimate or underestimate species presence (Maldo-
nado et al., 2015). For example, a species might appear common in a 
given  period  and  area  just  because  there  was  an  intensive  sampling 
survey targeting that species in that period and area. One possibility to 
lower sampling bias is to combine data from FAIR repositories of species 
observation records with citizen-science data, i.e., data collected from 
the  field  by  citizens  with  education  on  species  identification.  If  the 
collection strategy had sufficient temporal and spatial precision, citizen 
data would allow for estimating reliable biodiversity trends, robust to 
errors in the overall data collection (Isaac et al., 2014). We pursued this 
practice for the present study.

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not directly address the specific issue of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing the impact of different random seed values. However, it does discuss some general strategies related to improving the accuracy and reliability of machine learning models like MaxEnt ENM. These include combining data from multiple sources, such as FAIR repositories and citizen science data, to reduce sampling bias and improve the estimation of biodiversity trends. Additionally, the use of MaxEnt ENM itself is noted for its ability to achieve high prediction accuracy due to its design and constraints. Nonetheless, without explicit information regarding the management of randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it cannot be definitively stated what strategies are employed based solely on these references.
