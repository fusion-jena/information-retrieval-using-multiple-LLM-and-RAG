Understanding  the  computational  cost  and  parameters  of  a  single 
layer allows for precise estimation and control of the total requirements 
of our model. Computational complexity is quantified in FLOPs, calcu-
lated considering the convolutional kernel size (k2), the number of input 
Cin  and output Cout  channels, and the feature map’s height (hout) and 
width  (wout).  FPS  measure  the  model’s  speed,  encompassing  pre-
processing, inference, and non-maximum suppression speeds, providing 
an overall assessment of the model’s efficiency in real-time applications.

%Query
Query: "What are the postprocessing steps involved after the model training (e.g., Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, Confusion matrix)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it can be inferred from the given context that some possible postprocessing steps might include generating ground-truth annotations, creating histograms to show class distribution, and producing various visualizations such as label, mask, and heat maps. These processes would offer comprehensive insights into the dataset's structure and diversity. Additionally, the text mentions metrics like mAP@0.5:0.95 (%), which suggests that calculating performance metrics could also be part of the postprocessing steps. Unfortunately, there is no mention of saliency maps or confusion matrices in the provided context.
