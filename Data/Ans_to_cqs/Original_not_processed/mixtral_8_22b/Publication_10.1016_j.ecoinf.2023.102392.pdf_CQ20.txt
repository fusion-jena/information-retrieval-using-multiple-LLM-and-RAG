2.2. Unmanned aerial vehicle data processing 

Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data is processed using CATALYST 
PROFESSIONAL image processing software. The UAV data processing 
process is divided into six significant steps.  

i)  Camera parameter correction: this stage aids in identifying and 
correcting  image  distortions  caused  by  lens  curvature,  focal 
length, and perspective effects;  

ii)  Set up  connection points: A linked point is  a  spot that may  be 
visually recognized on overlapping areas between two or more 
images;  

iii)  Point fine-tuning: in this stage, the constraint points established 
in the previous step are improved to eliminate those with high 
error values (values more than 0.5) that were deleted from the 
computational model;  

iv)  Edit ground control points: Establish ground control points to edit 
the  dataset’s  georeferenced  to  the  WGS84/UTM  coordinate 
system;
