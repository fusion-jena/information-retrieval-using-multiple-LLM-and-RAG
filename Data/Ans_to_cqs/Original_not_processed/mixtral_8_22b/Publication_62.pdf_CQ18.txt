Our   work   highlights   the   importance   of   proper   metadata   curation   when   approaching   a
machine learning project. Assembling the training dataset for the mercury analysis required
many person   hours   to   visually   inspect   images   for   staining,   whereas   clubmoss   and
spikemoss images were easily compiled using specimen metadata alone. Nascent eﬀorts
in digitization in NHCs must carefully consider the acquisition and curation of metadata
because it aﬀects how quickly machine learning tools can be applied to digitized museum
collections.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The information provided does not explicitly state the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, based on common practices in machine learning projects involving Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), one possible approach could have been employed. This might include tracking metrics such as accuracy, loss, or other relevant evaluation measures throughout the training process. Additionally, techniques like cross-validation or early stopping may also have been utilized to prevent overfitting and ensure optimal model performance. Nonetheless, without specific details regarding the monitoring strategy, this remains an assumption.
