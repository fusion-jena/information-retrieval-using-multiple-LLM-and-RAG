dataset for training is costly, the learning of CNNs on small datasets can be boosted by data-augmentation, which 
consists of increasing the volume of the training dataset artificially, and additionally by transfer learning, which 
consists of starting the learning of the network from a prior knowledge rather from scratch38,39.

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not directly address the specific strategy used to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing the impact of different random seed values. However, it mentions two techniques often used when dealing with limited or small datasets: data augmentation and transfer learning. These methods help improve model performance and generalization but do not specifically target handling randomness due to factors like random seed values.

Data augmentation involves creating additional synthetic samples based on existing ones using various transformations, such as rotating, scaling, flipping, cropping, etc. This technique helps increase the size of the training set and introduces more variability into the data, improving the model's ability to learn meaningful features and reducing overfitting.

Transfer learning refers to leveraging previously trained models on large datasets to initialize weights for another task. By doing so, the model starts its learning process with some prior knowledge instead of beginning from scratch. Transfer learning allows for faster convergence and better results even when working with smaller datasets.

While these techniques contribute to enhancing deep learning pipelines, they do not explicitly manage randomness caused by elements like random seeds. To tackle this issue, one common approach is setting fixed random seeds during development and experimentation stages to ensure reproducibility across multiple runs. Another method is employing ensemble learning, where several models are trained independently with varying initializations and then combined to produce final predictions. Ensemble learning reduces variance and improves overall robustness against random fluctuations.
