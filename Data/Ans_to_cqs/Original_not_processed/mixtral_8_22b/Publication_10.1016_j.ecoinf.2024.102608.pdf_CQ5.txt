Owing to their ability to understand complicated patterns in data, 
ANNs have been employed in a broad variety of applications, including 
speech recognition, image recognition, natural language processing, and 
freshwater ecology. To train properly, however, ANNs require copious 
amounts  of  data  and  can  be  computationally  intensive  (Lecun  et  al., 
2015; Rumelhart et al., 1986). 

2.5. Model performance assessment techniques 

The algorithms’ performance and parameter settings were assessed 
using a training and test set approach. Evaluation of the models involved 
analyzing key metrics such as the coefficient of determination (R2), root- 
mean-square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE), and both 
the training and test datasets.

training and test data set to evaluate the performance of the machine 
learning algorithms. Of the four machine learning algorithms, RF (S-2 
MSI: R2 = 0.61, MAE% = 6.56, RMSE = 12.51 μg/L, L-8 OLI: R2 = 0.56, 
MAE = 8.44%, RMSE = 16.01 μg/L) yielded the most accurate CHL-a 
predictions from the Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat-8 OLI data in the test 
set, outperforming the KNN (S-2 MSI: R2 = 0.60, MAE = 6.49%, RMSE =
12.64 μg/L, L-8 OLI: R2  = 0.55, MAE = 8.24%, RMSE = 16.22 μg/L), 
AdaBoost (S-2 MSI: R2 = 0.58, MAE = 7.39%, RMSE = 12.97 μg/L, L-8 
OLI: R2 = 0.44, MAE = 9.81%, RMSE = 18.11 μg/L), and ANN (S-2 MSI: 
R2 = 0.59, MAE = 7.31%, RMSE = 12.76 μg/L, L-8 OLI: R2 = 0.14, MAE 
= 11.27%, RMSE = 22.43 μg/L) models (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the RF 
algorithm also exhibited better SD predictions (S-2 MSI: R2 = 0.45, MAE 
= 0.76%, RMSE = 1.03 m, L-8 OLI: R2 = 0.35, MAE = 0.77%, RMSE =
1.09 m) and TSS (S-2 MSI: R2 = 0.46, MAE = 2.95%, RMSE = 5.61 mg/L,

in various scientific domains. Machine learning algorithms can extract 
patterns from datasets with minimal prior knowledge, capture data-rich 
features,  and  establish  relationships.  They  offer  advantages  over 
empirical and semi-analytical algorithms by bypassing errors introduced 
during atmospheric correction and providing universal and optimized 
water  quality  models  based  on  reservoir  datasets  (Li  et  al.,  2021b; 
Pahlevan et al., 2019b). This combination is particularly suited to large- 
scale applications for quantifying and mapping water quality parame-
ters,  such  as  CHL-a,  TSS,  and  SD.  Moreover,  machine  learning  algo-
rithms can handle complex non-linear relationships in multidimensional 
space,  enabling  comprehensive  investigations  and  management  of 
reservoir environments. Several machine learning algorithms, including

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it appears that the study uses two types of datasets: Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data. These datasets are not explicitly mentioned as being part of a deep learning pipeline, but they are used to predict Chlorophyll-a (CHL-a), Secchi depth (SD), and total suspended solids (TSS) concentrations in reservoirs.

The Random Forest (RF) algorithm was found to provide the most accurate CHL-a predictions from these datasets, outperforming other machine learning algorithms like k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), AdaBoost, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). However, there is no specific mention of any well-known deep learning datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet in this context. Therefore, I cannot definitively determine which datasets were used in the deep learning pipeline, if one exists within this research.
