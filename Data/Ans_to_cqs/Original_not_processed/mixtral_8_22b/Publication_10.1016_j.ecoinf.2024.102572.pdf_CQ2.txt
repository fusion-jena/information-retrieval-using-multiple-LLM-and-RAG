resulting  in  detailed  land  use  and  land  cover  (LULC)  data  for  the 
Panhandle  area  in  Florida,  USA.  This  has  offered  crucial  support  for 
diverse land management and conservation efforts. Bar et al. (Bar and 
Paridha,  2019)  demonstrate  the  incorporation  of  high-resolution 
Sentinel-2 satellite photos on a cloud platform. Machine learning tech-
niques were used to classify fire-damaged monuments, demonstrating 
notable success in identifying minor fires. Machine learning techniques

Python is used to retrieve the necessary picture data for forest fire point 
information  in  the  study  area.  The  obtained  data  is  saved  in  “CSV” 
format on Google Drive for later examination. Data is stored on Google 
Drive in CSV format to aid with further calculations.

Acknowledgments 

Thanks to the Global datasets of forest above-ground biomass pro-
duced as part of the European Space Agency’s (ESA’s) Climate Change 
Initiative (CCI) programme by the Biomass CCI team, and to the utili-
zation  of  the  Google  Earth  Engine  (GEE)  cloud  platform  and  MODIS 
series products, this study has obtained essential data support, enabling 
the successful completion of the research. However, it is regrettable that 
data extraction was hindered due to the absence of specific image pixel 
data,  specifically  from  Henan  Province  (2013),  Jiangxi  (2015),  and 
Inner Mongolia (2013,2021). Gratitude is extended to researchers in the 
domains of forestry science, forest ecology, and remote sensing science 
for  their  invaluable  contributions  in  providing  references  for  this 
research.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The deep learning pipeline primarily uses image data, specifically high-resolution Sentinel-2 satellite images. These images are processed using machine learning techniques to identify fire-damaged areas. Additionally, the study also employs the Direct Application Programming Interface (API) in Python to retrieve necessary image data related to forest fire points in the study area. This retrieved data is then stored in CSV format on Google Drive for further analysis. Therefore, both image and CSV data formats are utilized in the deep learning pipeline.
