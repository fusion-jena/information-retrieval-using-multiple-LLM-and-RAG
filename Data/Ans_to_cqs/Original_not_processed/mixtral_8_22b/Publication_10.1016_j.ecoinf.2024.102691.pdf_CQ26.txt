was analysed using various evaluation matrices. During model training, 
the input image size was set to 512 × 512 and the maximum batch size 
was limited to 4. To prevent underfitting, all models were ensured to 
follow back-propagation after accumulating the batch size 32 times. The 
models were trained using a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer 
with an initial learning rate of 0.01 and a cycle learning rate of 0.2, with

After the depth map has undergone pooling operations and sigmoid 
normalization, the resulting matrix represents the attention weights for 
each element in the depth map. To refine these attention weights, the 
matrix is multiplied elementwise by a set of attention coefficients (Dα). 
This means that each element in the matrix is multiplied by its corre-
sponding attention coefficient. This element-wise multiplication allows 

weighted  matrix.  The  bias  term  serves  as  an  additional  offset  or 
adjustment to the attention values. By adding the bias term, the atten-
tion values can be shifted or biased towards certain values or ranges. 

3. Results and discussion 

This  section  includes  the  experimental  evaluation  and  analysis  of 
visual  and  statistical  results  of  the  proposed  method.  The  proposed

noise and missing depth information results in the over-fitting of input 
data into the network.

2.4.1. Depth attention fusion mechanism 

The attention mechanism was used to provide different weights to 
things depending on how significant they are in a certain visual region. 
To  implement  this  mechanism,  many  techniques  like  SE,  CBAM,  Effi-
cient Channel Attention (ECA), Channel Attention (CA), Non-Local, and 
Global Context Networks (GCNet) are used. The attention mechanism in 
the YOLOv5 network is often included in the C3 module or the last layer 
of the backbone. The process of managing the input feature 'n' based on 
its associated weighting, w(n), is represented by Eq. (1) (Jie et al., 2021).

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no direct mention of specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it does discuss some aspects related to handling data in the deep learning pipeline.

For instance, the text mentions setting the input image size to 512 x 512 and limiting the maximum batch size to 4. It also talks about preventing underfitting by ensuring back-propagation after accumulating the batch size 32 times. These steps could potentially help manage data imbalance issues indirectly.

Moreover, the use of an attention mechanism in the YOLOv5 network is mentioned, which provides different weights to things depending on their significance in a certain visual region. This could also be seen as a way to handle potential data bias, although not explicitly stated as such.

However, without more specific details regarding the dataset and the exact nature of any potential data bias, it would be difficult to definitively state what techniques might have been used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
