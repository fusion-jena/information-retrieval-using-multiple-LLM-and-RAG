easy to train with reduced complexity, even though they have deeper 
layers than CNN models, because of the presence of skip connections 
between the input and output of each block (He et al., 2016). ResNet has 
different variants with a variety of convolution layers. We trialled three 
depths, ResNet-18, (cid:0) 50 and (cid:0) 101, and compared their training times 
and validation accuracies. They behaved similarly but ResNet-50 had a 
marginally  higher  validation  accuracy  (Section  3.1.1)  leading  us  to 
choose it for feature extraction.

ran in approximately 1.2 min for our experiments on the CPU, whilst 
softmax  took  12  min  on  the  GPU  to  complete  the  same  task.  So, 
although, softmax can accomplish our classification task, our proposed 
method has advantages.

The  deep  learning  approach  provided  quick,  reliable,  automatic 
classification  of  image  backgrounds.  ResNet-50  classified  with  a  very 
high test accuracy of 97.4% (Section 3.1.2) using only the CPU of a basic 
laptop  computer.  Our  trained  ResNet-50   + SVM  classifier  took 
approximately  90s  to  classify  500  image  backgrounds  on  this  modest 
hardware, evidence of the relatively low computational requirements of 
the method. As an alternative to our approach, we also tested a method 
that  employed  softmax  and  ResNet-50.  We  found  this  alternative 
method, even after fine-tuning, to be slightly inferior (best validation 
accuracy  = 95%) to our proposed SVM-based model (validation accu-
racy   = 96.4%).  In  addition,  softmax/ResNet-50  must  run  on  a  GPU, 
whereas our proposed model runs completely on CPU. A further benefit 
of our proposed approach when compared to softmax, is that our model

The  next step  was  to  gather  standard  visual  information  and  low- 
level  image  features  from  the  datasets  that  include  traits  such  as 
colour, texture, shape, etc. (Shih et al., 2001). These features can be used 
by classifiers or deep learning models for image segmentation, image 
classification  and  object  detection.  There  are  various  techniques  for 
conducting  image  feature  extraction.  With  advancements  in  machine 
learning,  specifically  deep  learning  and  convolution  neural  networks 
(CNNs), feature extraction from images can be performed automatically 
to obtain high levels of classification accuracy (Acharya and Khoshel-
ham, 2020). Therefore, we used a deep-learning model to extract fea-
tures  of  our  image  backgrounds  for  training  a  classifier  model.  We 
adopted  a  ResNet-50  model  (He  et  al.,  2016)  for  extracting  image 
background features for classification. ResNets (Residual Networks) are

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide explicit information about the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on common practices in deep learning, some possible regularization methods could include dropout, L2 regularization, early stopping, data augmentation, and batch normalization. Dropout randomly sets a fraction rate of input units to 0 at each update during training time, which helps prevent overfitting. L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, encouraging smaller weights and preventing any single weight from dominating the others. Early stopping stops the training process before convergence if the performance on a validation set starts to degrade, thus avoiding overfitting. Data augmentation generates additional training samples by applying random transformations to existing ones, increasing the diversity of the dataset and reducing overfitting. Batch normalization normalizes the activations of each layer, making the network more stable and faster to converge while also acting as a form of regularization. It should be noted that these methods are speculative and not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
