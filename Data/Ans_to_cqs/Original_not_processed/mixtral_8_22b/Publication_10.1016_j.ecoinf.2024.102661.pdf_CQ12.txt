Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Hyperparameters  are  instrumental  in  shaping  the  architecture  of 
deep  learning  models and  steering  the  learning  process  (Bischl et  al., 
2023).  The  TPEBO  algorithm  stands  out  for  its  strategic  approach  to 
hyperparameter optimization. Beginning with an exploratory phase of 
random  searches  for  feasible  hyperparameter  configurations,  TPEBO 
progressively narrows down its focus to zones within the search space 
where a local optimum is identified, thereby approximating the global 
optimum  with  increasing  precision.  This  methodological  approach  is 
particularly  beneficial  for  fine-tuning  LSTM  models,  known  for  their 
intricate  structures.  By  automating  the  hyperparameter  adjustment 
process,  TPEBO  not  only  enhances  the  model's  efficiency  but  also 
significantly  curtails  the  time  traditionally  spent  on  manual  tuning, 
making the modeling workflow more efficient. The process is succinctly

Where. 
xi  is the input independent variable value, 
n is the number of groups of forecasted variables, 
̂yi  is the forecasted value, 
yi  is the actual value, 
λ is the L2 regularization parameter (λ > 0), 
wj  is the weight of each layer in the LSTM neural network,  

(3)  Optimizing iteration and result optimization. 

The  input  dataset,  hyperparameter  search  range,  optimization 
objective  function,  and  algorithm  predefined  are  integrated  into  the 
TPEBO-LSTM  model.  The  model  undergoes  a  training  process 
comprising 10,000 iterations. During each iteration, the model logs the 
chosen  hyperparameter  combinations,  associated  training  times,  and 

loss  values.  This  systematic  recording  aims  to  pinpoint  the  hyper-
parameter sets that deliver optimal performance upon completion of the 
calculations.

The  TPEBO-LSTM  neural  network's  development  entails  three 
essential steps, ensuring a comprehensive approach to hyperparameter 
optimization:

specifying  the  bounds  within  which  the  algorithm  will  explore 
various hyperparameter values. Key hyperparameters include: 

Number  of  hidden  layers:  This  hyperparameter  is  crucial  for  the 
network's performance, helps the model capture complex patterns. The 
range for the number of hidden layers is set between 1 and 3, based on 
initial tests.

2023). GRU (Gate Recurrent Unit) with a structure similar to LSTM has 
also been used in carbon emission prediction and has shown excellent 
performance (Cao et al., 2024). Such advancements underscore LSTM's 
emergence as the most fitting and effective deep learning approach for 
tackling carbon emission forecasting challenges.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Answer: The pipeline uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, which is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN). LSTMs are particularly well-suited for handling sequential data and capturing long-term dependencies, making them ideal for tasks such as carbon emission forecasting. Other types of deep learning models mentioned in the context include Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) and Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU), but the primary model employed in this case is the LSTM neural network.
