2.3. Implementation and training 

The  CNN  was  implemented  using  the  Keras  (Chollet,  2015)  and 
TensorFlow  (Abadi  et  al.,  2016)  software  packages  implemented  in 
Python, and computation was performed using CUDA version 9.1 and 
CuDNN  with  Nvidia  (Nvidia  Corp.,  Santa  Clara,  California)  P100 
accelerator cards with 12 GB of GPU memory. We used a Keras imple-
mentation of EfficientNet–B4 called EfficientNet V1.1.0 (https://github. 
com/qubvel/efficientnet).  The  pre-trained  weights  used  for  transfer 
learning were available through this API.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Two datasets were used in the deep learning pipeline. The first one is the Salmon Scale 9056 image dataset, which can be accessed via its DOI: 10.21335/NMDC-1050865887. Additionally, another unspecified dataset containing 150 images is mentioned, but it does not provide a clear name or reference. It seems like these datasets were specifically created for this study rather than being standard benchmark datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
