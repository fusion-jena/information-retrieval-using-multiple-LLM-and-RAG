In general, extracting latent space representations from UML algo-
rithms links a high DBCV score with a high ARI and AMI score. This leads 
to coherent clusters that can be easily identified by an expert, potentially 
accelerating  the  process  of  an  ecoacoustic  research  program.  In  the 
current  experiment,  fine-tuning  of  the  model  using  a  pretrained  Den-
seNet network returned the highest DBCV score in all cases except for 
the  5  way-5  shot  tasks  combined  with  the  Relation  Networks  (RN). 
Nevertheless, it is not necessarily advisable to favor one pretrained CNN 
backbone  over  another  as  there  are  no  “universally  optimal  methods 
that  will  just  produce  natural  clusters”  (Hennig,  2015).  Here,  a

Compared to no fine-tuning of a pretrained DenseNet, fine-tuning a 
pretrained DenseNet on the Darksound dataset greatly improved clus-
tering quality, achieving average scores of 80% for both ARI and AMI 
compared  to  less  than  1%  for  no  fine-tuning.  This  illustrates  the 
importance of fine-tuning the CNN backbone of the model for improving 

clustering quality. Fine-tuning of the model on 5 way-1 shot tasks with 
Prototypical Networks (PN) also enabled it to find a number of clusters 
closer to the ground truth, with 25 out of 30 clusters found instead of 7 
without fine-tuning (i.e. baseline) (Fig. 7).

In  addition,  the  average  and  median  ROIs  values  found  for  the 
different numbers of classes in the clusters (excluding noise), as well as 
the total number of ROIs labeled as noise are specified in Appendix B. As 
an example, PN fine-tuned on 5 way-5 shot tasks resulted in 4192 ROIs 
over 8163 labeled as noise, for 23 out of 30 clusters found. This means 
that only 49% of the 8163 ROIs were included in the 23 clusters. 

5. Discussion 

In this study, UML algorithms have been explored for their capacity 
to tackle a recurring problem in ecoacoustics related to the lack of large 
labeled datasets for unknown or rare bird species. We proposed the MEC 
method  for  enabling  unsupervised  acoustic  feature  extraction  to 
improve  the  quality  of  clustering  of  unknown  or  rare  bird  sounds  in 
unlabeled datasets.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not directly address the handling of randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some strategies commonly used to manage randomness in deep learning pipelines include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, employing techniques like ensemble modeling or cross-validation to reduce variance caused by random initialization, and utilizing deterministic algorithms where possible.
