measured and predicted values of all samples were above 0.95. Finally, 
the average VI between all samples was calculated, and an average VI of 
30% or higher was selected for the final model (Table 4).

%Query
Query: "Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no information provided about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The given context only mentions that R statistical software was used for applying the random forest model but does not provide any details regarding the availability of the code repository. Therefore, it is not possible to determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available from the given context.
