Water quality parameters

randomly selecting a subset of the parameter grid to explore (Bergstra 
and  Bengio,  2012).  Instead  of  exhaustively  searching  through  all 
possible combinations of hyperparameters, which can be computation-
ally  expensive  and  time-consuming,  randomized  grid  search  offers 
several  advantages, like,  reduces computational cost, especially when 
dealing with a large number of hyperparameters, and it has been shown 
to find equally or more optimal solutions than an exhaustive grid search, 
particularly  when  some  hyperparameters  are  more  influential  than 
others (Bergstra and Bengio, 2012; Lee et al., 2022). We then generated 
various  cases  by  combining  hyperparameter  values  extracted  from  a 
uniform distribution and evaluated their performance. Table S4 in the 
supplementary file summarizes the hyperparameters, their ranges, and 
the intervals used in the grid search. After the randomized grid search,

in various scientific domains. Machine learning algorithms can extract 
patterns from datasets with minimal prior knowledge, capture data-rich 
features,  and  establish  relationships.  They  offer  advantages  over 
empirical and semi-analytical algorithms by bypassing errors introduced 
during atmospheric correction and providing universal and optimized 
water  quality  models  based  on  reservoir  datasets  (Li  et  al.,  2021b; 
Pahlevan et al., 2019b). This combination is particularly suited to large- 
scale applications for quantifying and mapping water quality parame-
ters,  such  as  CHL-a,  TSS,  and  SD.  Moreover,  machine  learning  algo-
rithms can handle complex non-linear relationships in multidimensional 
space,  enabling  comprehensive  investigations  and  management  of 
reservoir environments. Several machine learning algorithms, including 
neural  network  (NN)  (Hong  et  al.,  2022;  Reichstein  et  al.,  2019),
