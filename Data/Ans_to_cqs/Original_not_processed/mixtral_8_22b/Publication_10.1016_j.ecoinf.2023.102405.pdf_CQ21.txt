3.2. Data pre-processing 

Data  pre-processing,  a  crucial  step  in  ensuring  the  reliability  and 
integrity of data, involves preparing and cleaning the dataset to enhance 
its  quality  and  completeness.  In  this  study,  we  employed  various 
methods to pre-process the data, making it suitable for analysis. A sig-
nificant aspect of our pre-processing involved data cleansing, where we 
diligently identified and removed any incomplete or inaccurate records 
to ensure the dataset's accuracy.

Helpful Answer:
After the model training process is completed, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the project. Some common postprocessing steps include:

1. Model Evaluation: This involves evaluating the performance of the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, etc. These metrics help us understand how well the model has learned from the training data and its ability to generalize to unseen data.

2. Confusion Matrix Analysis: The confusion matrix provides a visual representation of the performance of the classifier by comparing actual vs predicted values. It helps identify false positives, false negatives, true positives, and true negatives. By analyzing the confusion matrix, one can gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the model.

3. Saliency Maps: Saliency maps highlight the most important features used by the model to make decisions. They provide insight into which parts of the input data were most influential in determining the output.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning: After initial evaluation, hyperparameters may need to be adjusted to improve the model's performance further. Techniques like Grid Search, Randomized Search, Bayesian Optimization, etc., can be used for hyperparameter tuning.

5. Ensemble Methods: Multiple models can be combined to form an ensemble, improving overall performance. Techniques like bagging, boosting, stacking, etc., can be used for creating ensembles.

6. Deployment: Once satisfied with the model's performance, it can be deployed in production environments. Depending on the use case, deployment strategies could involve serving the model through APIs, integrating it within existing applications, or deploying it on edge devices.
