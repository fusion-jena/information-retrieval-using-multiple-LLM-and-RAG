Some model parameters were modified from the default configura-
tion to balance use of resources and training speed. We retained a res-
olution of 704 × 704, batch size 64, 32 subdivisions and trained up to 
6000 iterations. Other parameters were kept to default or set according 
to guidance by the developers (https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet). 
Manual annotations were used to generate training, validation and 
testing  datasets.  Biigle  annotations  (label  name,  centre  x,  center  y,

2.4. Model evaluation 

The testing dataset was composed of 500 manually annotated images 
from  the  same  transect  and  was  only  used  to  calculate  performances 
outside  the  Darknet  framework  by  comparing  CNN  predictions  with 
manual annotations. 

Predictions  come  as  a  .JSON  file  containing  the  coordinate  of  the 
bounding box of each tentative annotation as well as a confidence score 
ranging from 0.05 at minimum (lower confidence scores introduced too 
much  noise  and  therefore  were  not  recorded)  to  1  at  maximum.  Pre-
dictions made on the testing set were compared to the manual annota-
tion of the same images.

3.1. Model evaluation and selection 

The number of iterations for which the CNN was trained has a strong 
influence on its performances as well as on the confidence it gives to its 
predictions (Fig. 2). In general, longer model training past 1000 itera-
tions tended to give higher recall but lower precision.

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is object detection. This can be inferred from the fact that the authors mention using bounding boxes around detected objects, which is a common technique used in object detection models. Additionally, they refer to the model as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is often used for image analysis tasks such as object detection.
