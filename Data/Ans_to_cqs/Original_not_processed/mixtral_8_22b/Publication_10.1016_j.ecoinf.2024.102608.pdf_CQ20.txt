Owing to their ability to understand complicated patterns in data, 
ANNs have been employed in a broad variety of applications, including 
speech recognition, image recognition, natural language processing, and 
freshwater ecology. To train properly, however, ANNs require copious 
amounts  of  data  and  can  be  computationally  intensive  (Lecun  et  al., 
2015; Rumelhart et al., 1986). 

2.5. Model performance assessment techniques 

The algorithmsâ€™ performance and parameter settings were assessed 
using a training and test set approach. Evaluation of the models involved 
analyzing key metrics such as the coefficient of determination (R2), root- 
mean-square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE), and both 
the training and test datasets.

we selected the set of hyperparameter values that resulted in the mini-
mum  MAE  and  RMSE,  as  well  as  the  highest  R2,  for  each  machine 
learning model. Table 1 presents the resulting hyperparameter values 
for the four machine learning models.

3.3. Hyperparameter tuning and performance evaluation of machine 
learning models 

We developed machine learning models to predict CHL-a, SD, and 
TSS using surface reflectance values from Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat-8 
OLI  imagery.  To  optimize  the  performance  of  these  models,  we  con-
ducted hyperparameter tuning. The optimal hyperparameter values for 
each machine learning model were determined using a randomized grid 
search  (Bergstra and  Bengio, 2012; Lee et  al., 2022). It is  a  powerful 
optimization  technique  that  differs  from  traditional  grid  search  by

randomly selecting a subset of the parameter grid to explore (Bergstra 
and  Bengio,  2012).  Instead  of  exhaustively  searching  through  all 
possible combinations of hyperparameters, which can be computation-
ally  expensive  and  time-consuming,  randomized  grid  search  offers 
several  advantages, like,  reduces computational cost, especially when 
dealing with a large number of hyperparameters, and it has been shown 
to find equally or more optimal solutions than an exhaustive grid search, 
particularly  when  some  hyperparameters  are  more  influential  than 
others (Bergstra and Bengio, 2012; Lee et al., 2022). We then generated 
various  cases  by  combining  hyperparameter  values  extracted  from  a 
uniform distribution and evaluated their performance. Table S4 in the 
supplementary file summarizes the hyperparameters, their ranges, and 
the intervals used in the grid search. After the randomized grid search,

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. However, it does state that artificial neural networks (ANNs) can be computationally intensive and require substantial amounts of data for proper training. This suggests that high-performance computing resources would likely be necessary to efficiently train such models. Therefore, while not explicitly stated, it is reasonable to infer that hardware resources such as GPUs or TPUs could potentially be utilized for this purpose due to their capacity for accelerating complex computations.
