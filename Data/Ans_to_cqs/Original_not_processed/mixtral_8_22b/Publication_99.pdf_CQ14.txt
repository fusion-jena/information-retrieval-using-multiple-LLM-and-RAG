3.4. Performance evaluation 

Quantitative  evaluation  of  generative  models  is  still  a  challenging 
task due to the existence of many possible solutions (Black et al., 2020). 
Similar to recent studies, all reconstruction models were evaluated using 
Peak  Signal-To-Noise  Ratio  (PSNR)  and  Structural  Similarity  Index 
Measure (SSIM).

3.3.3. Classification 

Pretrained classification models such as VGG16 have demonstrated 
to perform well on various plant species identification tasks (Pang and 
Lim,  2019).  To  train  our  classification  model,  we  adapted  the  vgg16 
network  pre-trained  on  ImageNet  dataset  (Simonyan  and  Zisserman, 
2014). The fully connected layers of the networks were replaced with a 
global max-pooling layer, a dropout layer with a dropout ratio of 0.5 as a 
network regularizer and single hidden layer with a total of 256 units for 
a larger image sized model(512 × 512) and 128 units for a smaller image 
size model (256 × 256). Both networks were trained for 20 epochs with 
a  batch  size  of 32  and  various data augmentation  techniques such as 
height and width shift, flipping, zooming and brightness changes were

image with ImageNet values and then rescaled between 0 and 1. Since 
our dataset was balanced, both networks were trained with a learning 
rate of 0.03, cross-entropy loss as a loss function optimized by Adam

used for training each model.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, it mentions that the learning rate used for training the network was 0.03. This suggests that some form of optimization or tuning might have been performed beforehand to determine this value. Unfortunately, without further details, it cannot be confirmed whether methods like grid search, random search, or other optimization techniques were employed.
