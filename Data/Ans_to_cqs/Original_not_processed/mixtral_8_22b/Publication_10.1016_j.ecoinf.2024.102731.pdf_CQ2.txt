portional to permeability, so the following scoring scale was used: very
low – 0.00, low – 0.25, medium – 0.50, high – 0.75 and very high: 1.00.
Once these values were set, they were converted into raster format to
enable determining the mean scores per climate pixel.

Although the origins of these data ranged from regional to global
sources, they were all consistent in their reproducibility on a global
scale. Climate data for historical and climate change projections is
provided by e.g. WorldClim (Fick and Hijmans, 2017), while a Digital
Elevation Model (DEM) with a resolution of 30 m can be acquired from
the Copernicus program (ESA, 2023). The soil type can be found on the
hydrogeological map of the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Nat-
ural Resources (Duscher et al., 2015). Vector data on roads and hunting
are available from the OpenStreetMap initiative, whereas landscape
metrics can be determined from ESA CCI land cover maps, as previously
mentioned.

Climate data were used without further processing as representative
of the effects of extreme temperatures and precipitation on rabbit

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions several types of data sources such as climate data, digital elevation models, hydrogeological maps, vector data on roads and hunting, and land cover maps. These data could potentially be in various formats like CSV, shapefiles, geotiffs, etc. Additionally, the text refers to converting certain values into raster format, which suggests the use of raster data. Without more detailed information, it cannot be definitively stated what exact data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline.
