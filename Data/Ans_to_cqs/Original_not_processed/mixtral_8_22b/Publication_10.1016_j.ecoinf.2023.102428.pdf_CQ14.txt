vances,  several  LULC  simulation  models,  including  the  MLP  neural 
network-Markov chain (MLPnn-MC) model (Nasiri et al., 2019; Vass and 
Elofsson, 2016; Vinayak et al., 2020), SD-CLUE-S model (Liang et al., 
2017), Logistic-CA-MC model (Guan et al., 2019), FLUS model (Liang 
et al., 2018), SLEUTH model (Kumar and Agrawal, 2022), PLUS model 
(Tao  et  al.,  2023)  and  others,  integrated  with  carbon  mapping  and

using  the  following  formula  (Eq.  (15))  (Kumar  et  al.,  2023),  which 
generally acts as a supplement to K-indices in assessing the accuracy of 
LULC simulation (Zhang et al., 2023).

%Query
Query: "How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide information on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether methods such as grid search or random search were used for optimization.
