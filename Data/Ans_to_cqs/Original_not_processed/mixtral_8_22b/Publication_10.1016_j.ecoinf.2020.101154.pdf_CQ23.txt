For  the  three-part  split  the  VI  score  on  the  validation  set  is  used 
instead of the test set. Then one is allowed to tweak the values in the 
parameters grid to see if values that improve the score can be found. 
Once  there  is  confidence  that  the  validation  score  cannot  be  further 
improved  via  parameter  tweaking  (or  feature  engineering)  one  can 
evaluate the  best  model on  the  final test  set  (only  once). In some in-
stances  the final  test score maybe lower  than the  validation score.  In 
that case the test score is taken as the most realistic evaluation of the 
true generalization performance of the final model. 

2.4.2.  Hyperparameters

For  the  RI  models  the  same  initial  parameters  were  set  for  the 
analysis of the CS and NW datasets, then a grid search was performed 
on both datasets with a two-part split to give hyperparameters with the 
highest level of accuracy. These were as following: learning rate 0.05 
and maximum tree depth of 4 for both the CS and the NW models. The 
early stopping technique was used to determine when to stop the model 
training  to  avoid  overfitting.  Using  early  stopping  the  number  of 
iterations required until convergence was 120 for CS and 106 for NW. 
Grid search was not required for a three-part splits, and further tuning 
of the parameters was done manually. 

For the RY models, in contrast to the RI models, the best performing 
models (based on MSE) were models with a slow learning rate of 0.005. 
Additionally, the NW model had a very shallow tree (tree depth of 2). 
The number of iterations was kept at 500.

randomly  splitting  all  individual  observations.  This  data  splitting  ap-
proach is generally considered optimum in machine learning as it does 
not  introduce  any  systematic  differences  between  the  test  and  train 
datasets. To perform the RY data splitting, individual observations were 
grouped according to year of capture and years were randomly selected 
for inclusion in the train and test datasets. Although this may produce 
systematic  differences  between  the  test  and  train  datasets,  it  ensures 
that  the  model  is  tested  using  previously  unseen  combinations  of  ex-
planatory  variables  and  is  therefore  a  more  robust  test  of  model  per-
formance in this context.

2.4.2.  Hyperparameters 

Hyperparameter tuning was done manually. As a starting point the 
learning rate was set as low as possible and the number of iterations as 
high as computationally feasible (Hastie et al., 2009). The learning rate, 
which is also called a shrinkage parameter, determines the contribution 
of each tree to the model. The maximum tree depth which reflects the 
degree of interaction in the model is usually low. GBRT performs best 
using fairly shallow trees, so-called tree stumps.

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the Random Forest (RF) algorithm was employed, which inherently reduces overfitting by averaging multiple decision trees. Secondly, the data was divided into training and testing sets using a randomized approach. This method, known as random stratification, involves grouping individual observations based on specific criteria (in this case, the year of capture), followed by randomly selecting these groups for inclusion in either the training or testing datasets. While this could potentially introduce systematic differences between the test and train datasets, it guarantees that the model is evaluated using previously unseen combinations of explanatory variables, thereby providing a more robust assessment of its performance. Thirdly, hyperparameter tuning was conducted manually. Initially, the learning rate was set as low as possible and the number of iterations as high as computationally feasible. The learning rate, also referred to as the shrinkage parameter, dictates the influence of each tree on the overall model. Additionally, the maximum tree depth, reflecting the degree of interaction within the model, was typically maintained at a low value. Lastly, Gradient Boosting Regression Trees (GBRT) were utilized due to their superior performance with relatively shallow trees, often termed 'tree stumps'.
