During  the  classification  process,  the  VAE  model  gets  executed  to 
assign proper class labels to the applied satellite images. Autoencoder 
(AE) is a kind of NN which is trained to replace the input with the output. 
It includes a hidden layer h to define a code employed for input repre-
sentation. The network comprises of an encoder function z = f(x) and 
decoder function r = g(z), where x denotes the input data. The mean-
ingful features from the AE by the constraint that the z to have lower 
dimensions compared to x. The code of the AE which is lesser than the 
input  dimensions  are  known  as  under  complete.  The  learning  of  the 
undercomplete  depiction  enforces  the  AE  in  capturing  the  important 
characteristics of the training data. The VAE is a directed network which 
makes  use  of  learned  approximate  inferences  and  undergoes  training 
using gradient approaches. For generating a sample from the model, the

This  paper  presents  a  new  parameter  tuned  deep  learning  based 
EfficientNet model with Variational Autoencoder (PTDLEN-VAE) model 
for satellite imagery analysis on ecology management. The goal of the 
PTDLEN-VAE model is to examine the satellite images using DL model 
for  ecological  condition  monitoring.  Initially,  the  satellite  images  are 
pre-processed to improve the contrast level of the image. Besides, the 
PTDLEN based feature extractor is utilized using EfficientNet model for

satellite image classification using deep learning approach. In: Machine Learning

displayed in Fig. 2. The presented PTDLEN-VAE model includes a series 
of operations such as pre-processing, EfficientNet based feature extrac-
tion, IKHO based parameter optimization, and VAE based classification. 
Once  the  contrast  level  of  the  input  satellite  images  is  improved,  the 
features  are  extracted  by  the  EfficientNet  model,  and  the  hyper-
parameter of the EfficientNet model is optimally adjusted by the IKHO 
algorithm.  Finally,  the  VAE  based  classification  model  is  executed  to 
assign the proper class labels to the satellite images.

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model presented in this paper is for satellite imagery analysis on ecology management, specifically for examining satellite images using a deep learning model for ecological condition monitoring. The model used is called the Parameter Tuned Deep Learning based EfficientNet model with Variational Autoencoder (PTDLEN-VAE). This model aims to assign proper class labels to satellite images during the classification process. It utilizes an autoencoder (AE) network, which is a type of neural network trained to reproduce the input as the output. The AE has a hidden layer that defines a code used for input representation. The network consists of an encoder function and a decoder function, where the input data is denoted as 'x'. The meaningful features from the AE are captured by constraining the code 'z' to have lower dimensions compared to 'x', resulting in an undercomplete representation. The Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is a directed network that uses learned approximate inferences and is trained using gradient approaches. The PTDLEN-VAE model includes several operations such as pre-processing, EfficientNet-based feature extraction, IKHO-based parameter optimization, and VAE-based classification. The ultimate goal of this model is to monitor ecological conditions through satellite image analysis.
