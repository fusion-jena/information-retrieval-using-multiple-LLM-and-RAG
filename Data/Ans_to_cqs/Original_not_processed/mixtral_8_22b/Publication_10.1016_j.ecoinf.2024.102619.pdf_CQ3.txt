screening tool to improve quality of the ground-truth. Here although the 
task  is  a  simple  one,  its  time-consuming  nature  means  that  for  many 
large datasets it would be impossible to complete this task fully due to 
manual analysis constraints. Thus there is a suitable trade-off with the 
error-rate and efficiency of the approaches used. Regardless, the accu-
racy  and  reliability  of  annotations  should  always  be  interrogated,

From a coding perspective, training an SVM is extremely straight-
forward, with training, optimisation and testing executed within only a 
few simple lines of code. The relative complexity with the CNN þ SVM 
approach,  and  by  extension  the  CNN  approach,  rather  lies  in  data 
management and feature extraction. The complexity of these steps is not 
so  much  related to the  actions required, but navigating  the extensive 
literature and knowing “where to start”. As one of the contributions of 
this paper we hope to better guide the user with clear and detailed de-
scriptions  of  these  steps,  that  are  applicable  across  ML  frameworks 
(Table 3). Aside from these preparations, training the CNN classifier is 
further complicated since an optimal is not automatically found. Instead 
performance  metrics  must  be  monitored  across  epochs  and  decisions 
made on when to stop training - typically the point at which training and

softwares such as BIIGLE (Langenk¨amper et al., 2017), VIAME (Dawkins 
et al., 2017) and CoralNet (Chen et al., 2021). However these may be 
unsuitable for those requiring more flexibility in ML approaches or those 
wishing  to  integrate  ML  functionality  into  their  custom  annotation 
programs. They are also tailored for certain automation tasks.

Pytorch (Paszke et al., 2019) ML framework for deep learning (CNNs). 
These libraries also include tools for data pre-processing, model selec-
tion and evaluation. To keep our model training and analysis pipelines 
comparable, we use skorch, a scikit-learn compatible neural network li-
brary that wraps PyTorch. This allows the same scikit-learn training and 
evaluation procedure to be used for both models. Skorch is also helpful 
for end-users in CNN training, as it has a clear and simple interface. It 
only requires end-users to add the prepared datasets, model and specify 
the associated hyperparameters (Table 4). Documentation for the entire 
machine learning pipeline can be found at (PyTorch, 2023) for Pytorch 
(Paszke  et  al.,  2019;  scikit-learn,  2023)  for  scikit-learn  and  (skorch,

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it mentions the importance of accurate and reliable annotations for large datasets, where manual analysis might be constrained due to time limitations. In this case, there is a trade-off between error rate and efficiency of the approaches used. Additionally, the text discusses using machine learning frameworks like PyTorch and Scikit-Learn for deep learning tasks, including data pre-processing, model selection, and evaluation. These frameworks could potentially support various data annotation techniques depending on the requirements of the project.
