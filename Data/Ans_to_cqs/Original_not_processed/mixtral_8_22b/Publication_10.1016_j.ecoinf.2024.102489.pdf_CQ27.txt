Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

period  of  lush  vegetation.  Therefore,  the  selected  training  samples 
lacked low-value LAI samples, resulting in a lack of training in this part 
of the RF model, which could not predict low-value LAI accurately.

vegetation growth cycle included in the training samples.

For machine learning methods such as RF models, the quality of the 
training samples can seriously affect their prediction results. Although 
this study utilised the pixel quality control metrics of MODIS products to 
eliminate  cloud-contaminated  and  poor-quality  pixels  and  to  remove 
outliers  from  the  training  samples,  the  surface  of  the  study  area  was 
highly heterogeneous compared to that of Zhai et al. (2020). To ensure 
that a sufficient number of LAI training samples could be selected, the 
main  algorithm  saturated  the  pixels  during  the  selection  of  the  LAI 
training  samples,  but  this  increased  the  high-value  LAI  uncertainty 
(Kang  et  al.,  2021).  Jamali  et  al.  (2023)  used  a  variety  of  machine 
learning  algorithms  to  estimate  various  leaf  parameters  for  wheat 
leaves, concluding that deep neural networks were the most capable of 
improving the prediction accuracy of leaf parameters. Therefore, field

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. The text discusses issues related to the use of Random Forest (RF) models for predicting low-value Leaf Area Index (LAI), the impact of training sample quality on prediction results, and the application of deep neural networks for improving parameter predictions. However, it does not mention any specifics about the deployment of a trained deep learning model, including processes like model serialization or platform selection.
