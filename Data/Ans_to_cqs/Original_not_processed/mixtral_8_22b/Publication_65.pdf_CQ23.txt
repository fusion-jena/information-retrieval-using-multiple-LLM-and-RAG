The most signiﬁcant variation of performance is concerning the number of parameters
and with training and inference time. Despite being the best architecture in performance,
According to Table 2, DeepLabv3+ needed more parameters than the other architectures,
about 2.75 times more parameters than the U-Net, the least requiring one. The need for a
more signiﬁcant number of parameters often implies a higher demand for training samples
that our dataset or another dataset may not have met that the methods present in this
research paper may be applied, possibly causing the DeepLabV3+ architecture to perform
below its potential.

All deep learning-based models exploited in this work were implemented using the
TensorFlow [51], a Python framework conceived to allow efﬁcient analysis and implemen-
tation of deep learning with Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). All experiments conducted
here were performed on a 64-bit Intel i7-8700K@3.70GHz CPU workstation, 64 GB memory,
and NVIDIA® GTX 1080 GPU with 12Gb of memory, under a 10.0 CUDA version. Debian
4.195.98-1 version was used as the operating system.

following an exponential decay parameter of 0.5 by an SGD scheduler. Aside from this,
we used rotation, noise, and ﬂip (as in [50]) for data augmentation, and we were capable
of augmenting the dataset by six times. With the data augmentation technique, we can
make the CNN classiﬁcation more robust and generalize better. In Figure 9, we can see the
schematic diagram for the evaluation process.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, data augmentation techniques such as rotation, noise, and flip were employed to increase the size of the dataset by six times. This helped in making the CNN classification more robust and improved its ability to generalize better. Secondly, the learning rate was adjusted using an exponential decay parameter of 0.5 by an SGD scheduler after 50,000 iterations. This prevented overfitting and ensured that the model did not become too specialized to the training data. Lastly, all experiments were conducted on a diverse hardware setup consisting of a 64-bit Intel i7-8700K@3.70GHz CPU workstation, 64 GB memory, and NVIDIA® GTX 1080 GPU with 12Gb of memory, under a 10.0 CUDA version. This allowed for efficient implementation and analysis of deep learning algorithms with GPUs. However, there is no explicit mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting in the given context.
