select  the  activities  marked  as  “viewed”  and  4.  a  form  where  S  can 
indicate the correct prediction in case a model misclassification occurs. 
Such  functionality  is  expected  to  assist  in  gathering  data  in  order  to 
improve the classification algorithm in an online mode.

Therefore, the recording campaign was planned to last an entire year so 
as  to  capture  the  variations  that  goat  vocalizations  demonstrate 
throughout  the  year.  Overall,  we  have  collected  approximately  10  M 
sound  events  lasting  more  than  34,000  h.  Fig.  7  illustrates  the  data 
distribution per farm in terms of number of audio files, annotations and 
durations.

table); it is reconstructed based on the start times and durations of both 
entities. A particular scenario is that of event instances whose duration is 
very short (impulsive events, duration d ≈ 0s) or impossible to detect 
(unknown events, duration d = (cid:0) 1). In these cases, the event is auto-
matically associated with all the audio files that cover its start time.

REC event is in progress and the envelope e falls below τ ⋅ δ, the device 
enters the stop phase and continues the recording for 5 s. If e exceeds 
again τ ⋅ δ within the stop phase, the recording resumes. Otherwise, after 
5 s, the device enters the refractory phase in which no REC event can be 
triggered. Then, the device resumes listening when the recording of the

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, based on common practices in machine learning, some possible postprocessing steps could include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, creating confusion matrices, and performing cross-validation. These steps help evaluate the performance of the trained model and identify areas for improvement.

Unhelpful Answer:
I do not know what the postprocessing steps are after the model training.
