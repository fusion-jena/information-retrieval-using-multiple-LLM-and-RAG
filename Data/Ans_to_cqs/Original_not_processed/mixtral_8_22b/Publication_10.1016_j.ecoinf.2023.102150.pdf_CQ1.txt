Helpful Answer:
The authors utilize various methods for collecting raw data in their deep learning pipeline. One such method involves the use of camera traps, which consist of a Reconyx camera mounted on the ceiling of a metal box that can be entered by small mammals. These camera traps are then protected with stones when placed in the field (Soininen et al., 2015). Additionally, the authors mention that they have trained a deep neural network using the ResNet50 architecture with an adam optimizer (He et al., 2016; Kingma and Ba, 2014). They also note that several neural networks trained on large image datasets are now publicly available via simple user interfaces (Tabak et al., 2020). However, it is not explicitly stated whether these publicly available datasets were used in this particular study or if they were solely mentioned as examples of resources available to researchers. Overall, the authors appear to primarily rely on camera trap data collected through their own efforts rather than utilizing pre-existing public datasets.
