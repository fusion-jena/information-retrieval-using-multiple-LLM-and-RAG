randomly selecting a subset of the parameter grid to explore (Bergstra 
and  Bengio,  2012).  Instead  of  exhaustively  searching  through  all 
possible combinations of hyperparameters, which can be computation-
ally  expensive  and  time-consuming,  randomized  grid  search  offers 
several  advantages, like,  reduces computational cost, especially when 
dealing with a large number of hyperparameters, and it has been shown 
to find equally or more optimal solutions than an exhaustive grid search, 
particularly  when  some  hyperparameters  are  more  influential  than 
others (Bergstra and Bengio, 2012; Lee et al., 2022). We then generated 
various  cases  by  combining  hyperparameter  values  extracted  from  a 
uniform distribution and evaluated their performance. Table S4 in the 
supplementary file summarizes the hyperparameters, their ranges, and 
the intervals used in the grid search. After the randomized grid search,

where x denotes the input features, n is the number of input features, m

weights connecting the input layer to the hidden layer, respectively, and

Owing to their ability to understand complicated patterns in data, 
ANNs have been employed in a broad variety of applications, including 
speech recognition, image recognition, natural language processing, and 
freshwater ecology. To train properly, however, ANNs require copious 
amounts  of  data  and  can  be  computationally  intensive  (Lecun  et  al., 
2015; Rumelhart et al., 1986). 

2.5. Model performance assessment techniques 

The algorithms’ performance and parameter settings were assessed 
using a training and test set approach. Evaluation of the models involved 
analyzing key metrics such as the coefficient of determination (R2), root- 
mean-square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE), and both 
the training and test datasets.
