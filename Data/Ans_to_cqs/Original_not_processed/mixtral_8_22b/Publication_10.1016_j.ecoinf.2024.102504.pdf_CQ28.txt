Power plants can emit significant amounts of 
carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere ( 
Pandey, 2020). Furthermore, the 
combustion of furnace oil or diesel in power 
plants produces substantial amounts of 
sulfur oxides (SOx) and nitrogen oxides 
(NOx) (Kouravand and Kermani, 2018). 
Landfills can contribute to air pollution by 
releasing dust and gases such as methane 
(CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and etc. ( 
Iravanian and Ravari, 2020).

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given information, it is not possible to determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. The sources provided do not mention any specific cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. Therefore, without additional context, we cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
