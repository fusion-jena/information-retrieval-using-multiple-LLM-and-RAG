2.3. Pre-processing of imagery

4.2. Opportunities of the modeling approach

Segmentation and classiﬁcation strategies in eCognition are still
rapidly evolving; methods and rule sets for automatically selecting
segmentation parameters are under development (Dragut et al.,
2010, 2014; Martha et al., 2012), but there is not yet consensus on
best practices. Better classiﬁcations, which could then better capture
the process of interest, may be possible as these tools develop fur-
ther. Machine learning techniques are being brought together with

segmentation to more automatically classify images (Nancy Thomas,
personal communication). This set of approaches with historical im-
agery could become more powerful as new methods are developed.
We do caution that even with machine learning, some supervision
and validation using aerial photo interpretation techniques or
other data sources are still necessary (Sexton et al., 2015).

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of historical imagery and segmentation techniques combined with machine learning for image classification. It also discusses the potential benefits of developing new methods for improving image classifications. Therefore, we can infer that one method for collecting raw data might involve obtaining historical imagery, possibly through satellite or aerial photography. Additionally, the table provides site characteristics such as distance from the coast, average elevation, latitude, longitude, total annual rainfall, and July-August mean temperature, suggesting that environmental data collection methods like weather stations or GPS measurements could also play a role in gathering relevant data.
