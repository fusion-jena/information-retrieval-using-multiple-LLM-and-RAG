P = 100 or P = 80, G = 100, and setting the minimum fitness value as 7 
according to the specific situation of this study, is shown in Fig. 7a. The 
obtained ecological source using P = 60 or P = 50 and G = 100, and 
setting the minimum fitness value to 10 according to the specific situ-
ation of this study and based on the results obtained in the previous step 
is shown in Fig. 7b. Finally, the obtained ecological source using P = 30 
or P = 20 and G = 100, and setting the minimum fitness value as 15 
according to the specific situation and based on the results obtained in 
the previous step is shown in Fig. 7c. Different “initial population” and 
different minimum fitness values were set for each result. Therefore, the 
ESA resulted in these three cases were used in the result analysis. By 
calculating the source coverage area, source coverage rate, source con-
nectivity rate, fragmentation index, IIC, and PC, it was found that when

P  = 50, the  ESA was  the  best, the  connectivity  rate of  the  ecological 
source  was  84.99%,  the  IIC  value  was  0.81,  the  ecological  source

Therefore, the algorithm was capable of identifying the optimal ESA.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there isn't a direct mention of a strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, we can infer from the use of different AI techniques such as traditional linear programming, nonlinear programming, dynamic programming, modern genetic algorithms (GA), particle swarm optimization algorithms, and deep learning, that some form of monitoring would be necessary to ensure the models are performing optimally.

For instance, in the case of genetic algorithms, one common approach to monitor performance is through the use of fitness functions. These functions evaluate how well a solution solves the problem, which can help determine if the model is improving over time. Similarly, in deep learning, metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., could be used to track the model's performance during training.

In the context of this study, the authors seem to have evaluated their model by calculating various indices such as source coverage area, source coverage rate, source connectivity rate, fragmentation index, IIC, and PC. They also compared different scenarios with varying initial populations and minimum fitness values to find the optimal ESA. This suggests that they likely monitored the model's performance during training by evaluating its output against these indices.
