Type of architecture and accuracy of candidate models and predictive performance of selected models (bold). The accuracy of candidate models was measured using 
the proportion of correctly classified cases. The accuracy of selected models was measured using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).

hyperparameters  (i.e.,  ‘AutoML’;  He  et  al.,  2021).  This  represents  an 
important  advantage  for  non-experts  in  deep  learning,  as  it  does  not 
require  the  manual  assembly  of  the  models  and  definition  of  their 
hyperparameters. The AutoML procedure starts by generating a set of 
candidate models with architectures and hyperparameters (e.g. number 
of layers; learning rate) selected at random from a prespecified range of 
values (see Fig. 2). Each candidate model is trained using a small subset 
of the data (data partition At; Fig. 2) during a small number of epochs. 
After  training,  the  performance  of  the  candidate  models  is  compared 
using a left-out validation data set (Av; Fig. 2). The selected candidate 
model (usually the best performing among candidates) is then trained on 
the full training data (Bt; Fig. 2). In this step it is required to identify an 
optimal number of training epochs, to avoid under- or overfitting of the

applied to image data. The challenges arising from computational de-
mand appear harder to solve. Here we showed that ‘typical’ classifica-
tion tasks can take several hours to run on a standard desktop computer. 
Additionally, the computational expensiveness of deep learning is ex-
pected  to  grow  in  the  future  (Thompson  et  al.,  2020).  To  face  this 
challenge, ecologists will likely have to move in the same direction as 
their  fellow  computer  scientists  and  embrace  faster  hardware  (e.g. 
GPUs,  ‘tensor  processing  units’  and  large-resourced  cloud  computing 
services)  and  scalable  model 
implementations  (e.g.  distributed 
computing).

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly state which specific hardware resources were used for training the deep learning models. However, it mentions that 'typical' classification tasks can take several hours to run on a standard desktop computer. Additionally, it suggests that ecologists may need to use faster hardware such as GPUs, tensor processing units (TPUs), and large-resource cloud computing services to address the challenge of computational demand in deep learning. Therefore, while it cannot be definitively stated, it can be inferred that the deep learning models mentioned in the text could potentially have been trained using GPU or TPU resources.
