reproducibility, and we evaluated multiple seeds to select the one that 
provides  the  most  stable  and  reliable  results.  To  carry  out  the  grid 
search, we defined a range of potential values for each parameter based 
on  prior  knowledge  and  literature  review.  The  grid  search  then 
exhaustively tested all possible combinations of these values and eval-
uated the model’s  performance using cross-validation techniques. For 
each  combination,  we  utilized  the  RMSE  as  the  evaluation  metric, 
aiming to minimize the RMSE to achieve the most accurate predictions. 
By employing the grid search method, we aimed to optimize the model’s 
hyperparameters and enhance its ability to generalize well to new, un-
seen data, making it a robust and effective tool for our regression task. 
The  winning  parameters  are  as  follows:  numberOfTrees:  150,  min-
LeafPopulation: 3, bagFraction: 1, and seed: 123.

parameters of our machine learning model. Specifically, we focused on 
tuning  several  critical  parameters,  namely  ‘numberOfTrees’,  ‘min-
LeafPopulation’, ‘bagFraction’, and ‘seed’. The ‘numberOfTrees’ repre-
sents the number of decision trees in the ensemble, and through the grid 
search, we explored different values to determine the ideal number of 
trees  that  balances  model  complexity  and  predictive  performance. 
Similarly, ‘minLeafPopulation’  refers to the minimum number of sam-
ples required to form a leaf node in each tree. We experimented with 
various values to find the optimal setting that prevents overfitting while 
capturing meaningful patterns in the data. The ‘bagFraction’  indicates 
the proportion of the training dataset used to train each individual tree, 
and  we  searched  for  the  best  value  to  enhance  model  diversity  and 
generalization. Lastly, ‘seed’  is a random number seed used to ensure

We have extensively used different machine learning algorithms for 
AGB  estimation  (Tamiminia  et  al.,  2021;  Tamiminia  et  al.,  2021a; 
Tamiminia et al., 2022). Since the RF model has less hyperparameters in 
comparison  to  gradient  boosting  machines  and  it  is  less  sensitive  to 
hyperparameter  tuning, it  provides more accurate results for  biomass 
estimation (Tamiminia, 2021; Y. Li et al., 2019; M. Li et al., 2013). Thus, 
in this paper, we utilized an RF regression algorithm to create a 10 m 
CHM and AGB map of New York for 2019. Our state-wide CHM and AGB 
mapping approach comprises two main steps (CHM and AGB mapping) 
as depicted in Fig. 2. First, GEDI footprints were extrapolated to a 10 m 
pixel resolution raster using an RF model and Sentinel-2 imagery. Then, 
the trained RF regression model was used to generate a 10 m CHM of 
New York for the year 2019. Second, the produced CHM was used along

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given information, it appears that the study does not involve a deep learning model but rather focuses on a Random Forest (RF) regression algorithm for creating a 10m Canopy Height Model (CHM) and Aboveground Biomass (AGB) map of New York for 2019. Therefore, there is no mention of hyperparameters specific to deep learning models such as learning rates or optimizers. However, the study discusses the optimization of hyperparameters for the RF model, which includes 'numberOfTrees','minLeafPopulation', 'bagFraction', and'seed'. These hyperparameters are crucial for achieving the desired balance between model complexity and predictive performance. The 'numberOfTrees' represents the number of decision trees in the ensemble, while'minLeafPopulation' determines the minimum number of samples required to form a leaf node in each tree. The 'bagFraction' indicates the proportion of the training dataset used to train each individual tree, and the'seed' is a random number seed used to ensure reproducibility. Through a grid search approach, the researchers exhaustively tested various combinations of these hyperparameters and selected those that yielded the most stable and reliable results, aiming to minimize the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for enhanced accuracy in their regression task.
