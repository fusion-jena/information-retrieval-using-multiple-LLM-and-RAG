Next, three essential parameters were configured in the RF training: 
the number of random regression trees (ntree, tested 20 to 100 trees); 
the number of division variables (mtry, used to determine the number of 
variables available to each node of the tree, with the default number of 
1/3 of the independent variables); and the minimum size of nodes (node 
size, value = 5).

The trained ANN was the multilayer perceptron, also known as the 
multilayer perceptron (MLP), with a hidden layer. The range of neurons 
in  this  layer  was  defined  by  the  Fletcher-Gloss  method  (Silva  et  al., 
2010): 2 × n0.5 + n2 ≤ n1 ≤ 2 × n + 1; in which: n = number of network 
inputs; n1 = amount of neurons in the hidden layer; and n2 = number of 
neurons  in  the  output  layer.  The  activation  functions  tested  were

Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are computational models inspired 
by the structure and functioning of the human brain. The neural network 
is composed of multiple layers of neurons that carry out linear combi-
nations of the input values from the preceding layer. Then, a non-linear 
activation function is applied. The trainable parameters of the network 
are the weights associated with the linear combinations performed by 
each  individual  neuron  (Domingues  et  al.,  2020;  Kantarcioglu  et  al., 
2023). 

Random Forests (RF) is an ensemble learning method that combines 
multiple decision trees to make predictions. Each tree is trained on a 
random  subset  of  the  data,  and  the  final  prediction  is  determined  by 
aggregating the predictions of all trees. Random Forest releases robust 
results  even  when  the  number  of  observations  is  smaller  than  the 
number  of  variables  or  the  variables  are  correlated  (Breiman,  2001; 
Nguyen et al., 2019).

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be taken to ensure optimal performance. These may include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing any irrelevant or redundant information from the dataset. It could also involve handling missing values, either by filling them in using statistical methods like mean imputation or median imputation, or by simply dropping those rows or columns.

2. Normalization or Standardization: This step is crucial for many machine learning algorithms, including deep learning models. Normalization scales the features to a range between 0 and 1, while standardization transforms the features so they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Both techniques help to bring all features to the same scale, preventing any one feature from dominating the others due to its larger magnitude.

3. Feature Scaling: Similar to normalization and standardization, feature scaling rescales the values of features into a certain range. However, unlike normalization and standardization, it does not necessarily aim to maintain the distribution of the original data.

4. Encoding Categorical Variables: Deep learning models cannot handle categorical variables directly. Therefore, these variables need to be converted into numerical form. One common way to do this is through label encoding or one-hot encoding.

5. Splitting Dataset: Before training the model, the dataset is usually split into two parts - training set and test set. The training set is used to train the model, while the test set is used to evaluate its performance. Sometimes, a third part called validation set is also created to tune hyperparameters during the training process.
