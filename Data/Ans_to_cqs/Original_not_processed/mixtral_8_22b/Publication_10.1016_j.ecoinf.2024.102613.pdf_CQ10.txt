%Query
Query: "What is the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about a specific code repository link for a deep learning pipeline related to smart farming or fish biomass estimation. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact code repository link from the provided sources. To find the relevant code repository, one would need additional resources or search for open-source projects related to these topics on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
