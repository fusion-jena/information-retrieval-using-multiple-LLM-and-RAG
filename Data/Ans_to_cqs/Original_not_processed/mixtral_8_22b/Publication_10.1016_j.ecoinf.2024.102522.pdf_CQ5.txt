Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it mentions several studies related to nighttime light images, vegetation continuous fields products, biological factors, geographical environment factors, human spread factors, and bioclimatic variables. These studies may have utilized various datasets relevant to their respective research topics but do not explicitly mention any dataset commonly associated with deep learning pipelines like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
