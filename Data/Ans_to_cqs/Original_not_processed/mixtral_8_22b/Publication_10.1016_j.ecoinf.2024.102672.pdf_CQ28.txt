Data-driven models are an alternative type of models, among which 
machine learning and deep learning (ML and DL) models stand out in 
recent years. According to Lee et al. (2023) data-driven models applied 
to freshwater ecosystems have been mainly focused on phytoplankton, 
while there is a lack of research in modelling future changes, such as 
climate change and subsequent changes in habitat conditions. A good 
example of a data-driven model focused on algal blooms prediction is 
that  presented  by  Miura  et  al.  (2023).  Nonetheless,  there  are  several 
examples in the scientific literature about ML or DL models designed to 
predict the temperature profile in water masses. Liu and Chen (2012) 
developed ML models based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) using 
as inputs meteorological conditions to predict the temperature in the 3

The result of this process was added to the dataset as a new cate-

(took the value of 0 when the reservoir was not stratified and 1 when it 
was stratified).

For  the models with  up to  3 days-lagged variables, a  single  dense 
layer with 32 neurons was the optimal topology. Although the models 
did not present a pronounced trend to overfit, in general they performed 
better when a dropout layer was added after the dense layer. Finally, 
when 4 and 5 days-lagged variables were included, the model benefited 
from  the  addition  of  an  additional  dense  layer  followed  by  another 
dropout layer. According to the results, in general the training metrics 
improved as lagged variables were added, however when the 5 days-
