racy assessment requires these parameters to calculate the total number of 
training samples required for the image classified using Eq. 1.

The next step was accuracy assessment, which is necessary to assess 
the  reliability  of  the  results.  The  Error  of  Commission  (EC),  Error  of 
Omission  (EO), Producer  Accuracy (PA)  and User  Accuracy  (UA) were 
computed based on an error matrix resulting from accuracy assessment. 
EO is linked to the classified results and is supplemented by PA. They refer 
to  items  that  are  left  out  of  their  correct  class  in  the  classification.  EC 
represents classified values that were predicted to be in a particular class 
but do not belong to that class. It is supplemented by UA. In this study an 
advance accuracy assessment using the SCP (Semi-Automatic Classifica-
tion Plug-in) functions for the RF classifier was performed. Using the land 
cover classification map generated, the next analytical step was to run a 
post-processing  tool  to  obtain  the  reports  from  each  classifier,  which 
provide the pixel sum and area coverage of each land cover class. Accu-

For  the  simulations  the  infiltration  capacity  was  quantified  in  a 
parameter  derived  by  the  Soil  Conservation  Service  (SCS)  called  CN. 
This parameter determines the runoff over an area based on soil type, 
soil cover and the hydrological group of the soil (Cronshey, 1986). The 
figure calculated for sub-basin 1 is 80.1, for sub-basin 2 it is 78.5, for 
sub-basin 3 it is 77.3, for sub-basin 4 it is 74.0, for sub-basin 5 it is 76.1 
and for sub-basin 6 it is 81.0. To better assess the possible effects of using 
NBS,  four  hypothetical  scenarios  were  chosen.  These  scenarios  were 
based on changing the land use from agriculture to forestry. According 
to  PerpiËœna  Castillo  et  al.  (2020),  Galicia  has  one  of  with  the  highest 
percentages of abandoned agricultural land of any region in Spain, with

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't enough information to provide a specific criterion used to determine when training is complete. However, common criteria include reaching a validation loss plateau or achieving a desired level of performance on a validation set.

Unhelpful Answer:
The context does not mention anything about the completion of training or the criteria used to determine it. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer.
