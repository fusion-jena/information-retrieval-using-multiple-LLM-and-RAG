our study, is due to the deep learning method’s loss function, which is 
biased toward overrepresented classes. This represents a performance 
barrier for any study using semantic segmentation with few images and 
high class-imbalance.

Since the multi-class (i.e. 10 classes) semantic segmentation problem 
is quite complex, the set of 290 training images was found to be insuf-
ficient to obtain satisfactory results, even with the use of the transfer 
learning framework. Therefore, we employed data augmentation stra-
tegies to increase the training set size fourfold: horizontal flip, Gaussian 
noise  addition,  and  contrast  reduction.  The  first  two  augmentation 
strategies are fairly common. The contrast reduction strategy was spe-
cifically motivated by our application, namely given that we expect the 
images  to  contain  shadows  occluding  the  vegetation  types,  contrast 
reduction helps to simulate areas of low lighting which can be expected 
in the dataset.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information on the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that manual classification of fuel types was used in semantic segmentation training and testing, which suggests that some form of image labeling or pixel-level annotation might have been applied. Semantic segmentation involves assigning a class label to every pixel in an image, so this process would require detailed annotations. Additionally, the text discusses a multi-class semantic segmentation problem with 10 classes, further supporting the likelihood of pixel-wise annotations. Unfortunately, without more specific details about the annotation methods used, I cannot definitively state whether bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, or other techniques were utilized.
