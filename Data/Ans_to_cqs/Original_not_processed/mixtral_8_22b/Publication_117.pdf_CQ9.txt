Helpful Answer:
The source code of the deep learning pipeline is available on Zenodo, accessible through the DOI link <http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2562058>. However, the raw count data can be found in the Enlighten: Research Data repository, accessible through the URL <https://doi.org//10.5525/gla.researchdata.732>.
