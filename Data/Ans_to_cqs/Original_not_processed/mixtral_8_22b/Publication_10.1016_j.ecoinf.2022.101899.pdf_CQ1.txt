Halgamuge et al. (2020) focused on utilizing deep learning to esti-
mate the best optimizer selection methods for wildfire event predictions 
in Australia. They developed an algorithm to collect the data automat-
ically and analyzed six different optimizer models using deep learning 
technology. They concluded that this approach could predict a natural 
disaster, including wildfire events, by investigating historical environ-
mental  conditions  before  and  after  wildfires  occurred  using  the  deep 
learning methodology. Dowdy (2020) focused on demonstrating a sea-
sonal prediction system for wildfire event prediction in Australia. This 
measured  spatio-temporal  variations  and  seasonality  across  several 
datasets  and  utilized  this  methodology  to  predict  wildfire  events, 
focusing on the seasonal predictions using the 2019â€“2020 wildfire sea-
son  as  an  example  and  measuring  long-term  predictions.  Coen  et  al.

Helpful Answer: The research conducted by Halgamuge et al. (2020) focuses on employing deep learning techniques to determine optimal optimizer selection methods for forecasting wildfire occurrences in Australia. Although the paper does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for gathering raw data within their deep learning framework, it is implied that they have created an automated algorithm for data collection purposes. However, without further information or direct reference to the exact sources of data acquisition, such as surveys, sensors, or publicly available datasets, we cannot definitively state which methods were employed for obtaining raw data in their deep learning pipeline.

On the other hand, Dowdy (2020) presents a seasonal prediction system for wildfire event forecasts in Australia. In this case, multiple datasets are examined to measure spatiotemporal variations and seasonality. While no explicit details regarding the source of these datasets are given, one can infer that the author may have relied on various types of data sources, potentially including satellite imagery, weather stations, or meteorological records. Nevertheless, without concrete evidence from the text, it remains uncertain what precise methods were utilized for acquiring raw data in the deep learning process.
