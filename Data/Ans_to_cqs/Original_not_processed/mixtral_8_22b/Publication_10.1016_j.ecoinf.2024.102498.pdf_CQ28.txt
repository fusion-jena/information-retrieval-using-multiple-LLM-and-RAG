Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

An alternative approach to enhancing the accuracy of LULC maps is 
to leverage deep learning techniques. These techniques operate patch- 
wise,  where  each  patch  incorporates  sophisticated  features  extracted 
from satellite imagery. This enables them to recognize intricate patterns 
effectively.  Particularly,  Convolutional  Neural  Networks  (CNNs)  are 
highly  effective  for  LULC  classification.  These  models  automatically

%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about which specific platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. The context only mentions that CNNs are highly effective for LULC classification but does not specify any details regarding the deployment platform. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which platform was used based solely on this context.
