Fig. 4. Neural networks architecture consists of: an input layer with two nodes, one for DOY and the other for GDD; two hidden layers with 32 nodes each, Dense
layers with Monte Carlo Dropout in the MCD approach, DenseVariational layers in the VBI approach; an output layer which is the combination of a Dense layer with
two nodes and a DistributionLambda layer that maps the values of these two nodes into the parameters of a Gaussian distribution, used to predict the BBCH value.

Deep Neural Networks are architectures that present remarkable
advantages and can potentially map every possible function, but they
are often affected by many issues such as overfitting. The main draw-
back of standard Deep Learning is that Neural Networks compute single
values of their parameters and therefore they are incapable of correctly
assessing the uncertainty related to the data (aleatoric uncertainty) or to
the model itself (epistemic uncertainty); in fact they often produce
overly confident decisions about the correct class, prediction or action to
take, even if the sample is very far from the training data we provided.
The purpose of Bayesian Neural Networks is to use probability theory
to express uncertainty, especially in the prediction phase. The advantage
is clear in areas where decision making plays a fundamental role. To be
more specific, a Probabilistic Neural Network handles the aleatoric
uncertainty by placing a probability distribution (whose parameters can

Helpful Answer:

In the given context, there is no direct mention of techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some commonly used techniques include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets based on certain characteristics, ensuring that each subset has roughly the same proportion of classes as the original dataset. This helps maintain the balance between classes when creating training and testing datasets.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to handle imbalanced datasets. Oversampling increases the number of instances in the minority class, while undersampling reduces the number of instances in the majority class. These methods help achieve better class representation and improve the performance of machine learning models.

Diverse data collection focuses on gathering data from various sources and environments to ensure that the dataset represents real-world scenarios accurately. This technique aims to reduce biases introduced due to limited data sources or homogeneous data.

While these techniques are not explicitly mentioned in the given context, they are widely used in addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
