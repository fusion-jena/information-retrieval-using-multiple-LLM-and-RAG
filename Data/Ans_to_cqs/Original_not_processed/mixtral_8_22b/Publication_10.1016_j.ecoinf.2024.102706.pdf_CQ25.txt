approach (Li et al., 2022) have also been efficiently used in satellite
image-based vegetation indices for predicting forest canopy cover. The
application of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) for semantic
segmentation has also been investigated across various types of young
vegetation cover (Cameron et al., 2022). Regarding advanced machine
learning approaches, the RF and SVM were the foremost priorities for
the researchers for canopy cover modelling from O'brien, 2007 to 2017,
as reported by Thanh Noi and Kappas (2017). Other advanced ML ap-
proaches have recently been added to similar studies (Li et al., 2022;
Zhou et al., 2020). The boosting methodology represents a synthesis of
robust prediction techniques, frequently surpassing the performance of
individual models such as single decision trees. The emergence of
refined ensemble machine learning techniques like light gradient
boosting machines
represents notable advancements

For machine learning models, the GARI, GI, GNDVI, GREEN, MSR,
NDVI, RDVI, RED, SI2, and VARIg were selected as described earlier in
the methodology sections. The performance of the models is presented
in Table 6. In the testing dataset, it was observed that all models
demonstrated lower coefficients of determination than the training data,
except for the linear and Enet models. Machine learning algorithms
outperformed linear in modelling forest canopy cover. The LightGBM
exhibited the most substantial model training ability (R2 = 0.69), fol-
lowed by SVM, RF and XGboost, each with an R2 value of 0.66. All six
models yielded satisfactory results with an R2 ≥ 0.58 in training data,
meeting our study's canopy cover prediction criteria. Further evaluation
in independent
test samples, considering additional fit statistics,
XGboost and LightGBM demonstrated superior predictive capabilities
with R2 = 0.64, RMSE = 0.16, rRMSE = 22%, and MAE = 0.12, out-

linear to machine learning methods, were fitted in training data to
construct regression equations. We used multiple linear regression, Enet,
SVM, RF, XGboost and LightGBM to predict canopy cover from planet
data. In general, all the mentioned models are used in machine learning
as they use algorithms to automatically learn patterns and relationships
from data to make predictions or decisions. However, we categorised

linear as a simple statistical model and the rest of the advanced machine
learning models as machine learning. The regression analyses were
conducted using Python 3.12.2, distributed by Anaconda Inc. The Scikit-
learn library (Pedregosa et al., 2011) was employed for all models except
those utilising XGboost and LightGBM. For XGboost and LightGBM
models, the respective Python libraries “xgboost” (Chen and Guestrin,
2016) and “lightgbm” (Ke et al., 2017) were utilised. Additionally, a 5-
fold cross-validation grid search strategy was implemented to tune
hyperparameters within the training dataset for all machine learning
models, leveraging functionalities inherent in their respective Python
packages. The information on hyperparameters and their optimised
value for all machine learning models are presented in Table 4. More-
over, we converted the canopy cover output percentage to a fraction
(0–1) for convenience and smoothness in the further calculation.

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in this context is not explicitly stated. However, based on the given information, it appears that the deep learning approach being referred to is the application of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) for semantic segmentation across various types of young vegetation cover. Semantic segmentation involves assigning a label or category to every pixel in an image, which could be useful for tasks such as identifying different types of vegetation or estimating canopy cover. Therefore, it seems that the primary purpose of the DCNN model in this case would be to perform semantic segmentation of satellite images to aid in the analysis and modeling of forest canopy cover.
