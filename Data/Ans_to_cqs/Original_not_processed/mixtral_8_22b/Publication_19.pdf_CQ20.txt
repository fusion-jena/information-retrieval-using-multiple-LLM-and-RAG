C.  Results 

  As  Table  III  show  all  models  performed  reasonably  well 
with macro-F1 averages above 91%. Because the models are to 
be deployed on IoT edge devices, the size of each model is an 
important  consideration.  As  Table  III  shows 
the  best 
performing model was Inception-V3 with a macro Average F1 
score of 0.93, and the smallest size of 175 MB.

Finally,  a  recent  architecture  called  EfficientNet  [19] 
achieved 84.4% top-1 and 97.5% top-5 accuracy on ImageNet 

while  being  6.1x  faster  on  inference  than  the  best  existing 
ConvNet and 8.4x smaller. The small size of the model and high 
accuracy achieved make this architecture a good candidate for 
running on edge devices.  

B.  Embedded Devices for the Edge Inference  
   Many neural networks have been deployed on edge devices 
for  the  purposes  of  animal  classification.  The  most  common 
edge  device  used  was  a  Raspberry  Pi  (RPi)  [11],  [14],  [20], 
[21],[22].

Inception-V3,  MobileNet-V2,  ResNet-18,  and  DenseNet-
121, were all trained on this data. All architectures were pre-
initialized  to  ImageNet  weights.  Initially,  the  models  were 
trained by freezing the feature extraction layers and training the 
classification layers only. However, better results where the F1-
score  improved  by  about  20-30%,  were  obtained  when  both 
feature extraction and classifier layers of each architecture were 
configured to be trainable. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) 
was  used  as  the  optimizer  for  all  four  models.  Other  hyper-
parameters like batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs 
were  obtained  using  the  grid  search.    The  models  were 
implemented  using  Keras  (https://keras.io/).  The  resulting 
hyperparameters for each model are shown in Table II.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information regarding the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware resources were utilized during the training process based solely on the provided context.
