In addition,  in the prediction  of dissolved oxygen in  water, (Chen 
et  al.,  2020)  not  only  applied  water  quality  parameters  but  also 
considered parameters such as temperature, humidity, and atmospheric 
pressure in the air as input variables for the model, providing ideas for 
subsequent research. 

At last, for the dataset as listed in Table 1, and, three different data 
processing methods were trained and tested using the proposed method,

Medians of measured versus computed DO concentration.  

The  above  results  and  analyses  show  that  traditional  machine 
learning  methods  (SVR)  and  deep  learning  methods  (LSTM)  can  be 
adapted  to  address  the  problems  of  poor  generalization  ability,  local 
optimum, underfitting, and overfitting of conventional models to predict 
DO concentration successfully. The machine learning and deep learning 
literature also discuss the prediction of DO concentration. For example, 

Models

search algorithms such as the genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm 
optimization (PSO) are often used to solve model parameter problems, 
for instance, the number of neurons in neural networks, error penalty 
factor in SVM, etc. For example, Yan used GA and PSO to optimize a BP 
neural network to build a DO estimation model of Beijing Lake in Beijing 
(Yan et al., 2019). Compared with the GA algorithm, PSO is used more in 
DO  modeling  in  combination  with  BPNN,  GRU,  LSTM,  SVM,  support 
vector regression (SVR), and other algorithms (Wu et al., 2018; Huan 
et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2021; Cao et al., 2021b; Liu 
et al., 2014, exhibiting high efficiency and good robustness with mini-
mal calculation. Other optimization algorithms, such as the multi-verse 
optimizer,  have  also  been  adopted  for  parameter  optimization  (Yang 
et al., 2021).

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, none of the provided sources explicitly mention which specific hardware resources were used for training their respective deep learning models. However, it is common practice in the field of deep learning to use Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) due to their superior performance in handling parallel computations required during the training process. Therefore, while we cannot provide a definitive answer, it is highly likely that either GPUs or TPUs were utilized for training these deep learning models.
