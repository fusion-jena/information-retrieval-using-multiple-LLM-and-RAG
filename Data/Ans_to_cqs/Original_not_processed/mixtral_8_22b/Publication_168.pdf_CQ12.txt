On the other hand, since the powerful feature extraction 
capabilities, the deep learning methods have succeed in many 
fields,  such  as  computer  vision  and  natural  language 
processing. In recently, the deep learning based methods have 
also  been  used  to  solve  the  HSI  classification  task  and 
achieved remarkable achievements. Among the deep learning 
methods,  the  Convolutional  Neural  Networks  (CNNs)  are 
most widely explored to solve the HSI classification task. Hu 
et  al.  [4]  designed  a  one-dimensional  convolutional  neural 
network(1-D-CNN) for classification according to the spectral 
feature  of  HSI.  Due  to  the  insufficient  training  data,  the 
designed  1-D-CNN  just  includes  a  convolution  operation,  a 
pooling operation and a fully connected operation. Although 
the structure of  designed 1-D-CNN is simple, it achieved a 
satisfactory  classification  performance.  The  classification

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1-D-CNN) was designed by Hu et al. [4] for classifying forest species using hyperspectral images (HSIs). This 1-D-CNN consists of a convolution operation, a pooling operation, and a fully connected operation. Additionally, the text mentions that other researchers have employed different types of CNN architectures, such as multiscale CNN with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and residual networks including residual blocks of spectral and spatial based on the 3-D convolutional kernel. However, these models still fall under the broader category of CNNs.
