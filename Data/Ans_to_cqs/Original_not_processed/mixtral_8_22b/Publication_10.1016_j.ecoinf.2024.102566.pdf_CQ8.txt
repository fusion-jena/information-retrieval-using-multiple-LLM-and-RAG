The forest ecosystem plays a pivotal role in the global carbon cycle and is crucial for investigating atmospheric 
carbon  exchanges.  Forest  biomass,  a  fundamental  quantitative  measure  of  the  forest  ecosystem,  serves  as  a 
critical  indicator  for  forest  carbon  stocks  and  carbon  sequestration  capacity.  This  study  utilizes  the  GIMMS 
NDVI3g dataset to downscale forest inventory data spanning from 1989 to 2018, creating a 1 km resolution map 
of forest biomass density in the Qinba Mountains. The density initially decreased but has been increasing since 
2004. The northern region of the Qinba Mountains exhibits a high forest biomass density (>100 Mg/hm2), while 
the  southern  region  has  relatively  lower  biomass  density.  This  study  provides  the  longest-term  estimation  of 
forest biomass density in the Qinba Mountains to date. It serves as a foundation for regional-scale forest carbon

field-collected data and machine learning methods on developing AGB 
models.  Moreover,  the  quality  of  training  samples  and  the  layout  of 
sampling  points  are  crucial  for  constructing  accurate  and  reliable 
models for biomass estimation (Morais et al., 2021). In this study, owing 
to  the  insufficiency  of  high-quality  training  samples,  we  employed  a 
method with low data dependency that integrates forest inventory data 
with remote sensing imagery for biomass estimation.

crucial to enhance environmental education and raise awareness about 
carbon  sequestration  management  among  the  government,  residents, 
and  businesses.  The  government  should  develop  comprehensive  and 
effective  policies  for  carbon  sequestration  management  in  the  Qinba 
Mountain area, taking into account the actual situation and opinions of 
relevant  stakeholders,  to  achieve  goals  related  to  reducing  carbon
