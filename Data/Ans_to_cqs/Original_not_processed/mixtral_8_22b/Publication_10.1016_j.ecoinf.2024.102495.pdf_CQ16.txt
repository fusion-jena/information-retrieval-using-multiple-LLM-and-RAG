The CNN model was trained using epochs and batch sizes of 10 and 
32,  respectively.  This  model  was  compiled  using  a  categorical  cross- 
entropy loss function, and the hyperparameters used in the CNN algo-
rithm  were  tuned  using  a  root  mean  square  propagation  (RMSProp) 
optimizer. The model generated in the training process was evaluated 
using stratified 10-fold cross-validation with calculated values of accu-
racy,  precision,  recall,  F1-Score,  area  under  the  curve  (AUC)  score, 
confusion  matrix,  and  model  training  time  for  binary  and  multiclass 
classifications (Forman and Scholz, 2010; Grandini et al., 2020; Ouyang 
et al., 2015). The model performance needs to be evaluated to determine 
the modelâ€™s ability to classify mosquitoes, and a good model is charac-
terized by high values of predetermined performance parameters.

The model demonstrating the best performance was observed in the 
first and tenth running folds. A comparison between the two reveals that 
the recall performance metrics and the F1-Score in the tenth running 
fold  model  exhibited  higher  values,  specifically  90.85%  and  0.9153, 
respectively, compared to the first running fold. Based on these findings, 
model 9, specifically in the tenth iteration of the cross-validation pro-
cess, was determined to be the ideal choice for ovitrap testing in mul-
ticlass classification.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it appears that the model was trained using a fixed number of epochs and batch size, which were set to 10 and 32, respectively. However, there is no explicit mention of any specific criteria used to determine when the training should stop or if it has reached completion. Typically, common criteria used to determine when training is complete include reaching a certain number of epochs, achieving a desired level of accuracy or loss value, or observing a plateau in the validation loss. In this case, since only the number of epochs is mentioned, we can infer that the training might have been stopped after completing the specified number of epochs. However, without further details about the actual implementation or results, it cannot be definitively stated what criteria were used to determine when training was complete.
