et al., 2017) and SmoothGrad (Smilkov et al., 2017) methods over each 
model. These methods plot a point cloud, where the density denotes the 
input space relevance. Thus, a higher density in a region suggests that 
the network ponderates it the most when classifying.

4.2. Architecture configurations 

Convolutional neural networks (CNN) outstand over DL techniques 
by disentangling high-level representations across multiple processing 
layers. CNN’s process data on two levels: a convolutional block for the 
automatic  feature  extraction,  and  fully  connected  layers  to  establish 
feature-output  correlation.  The  convolutional  block  comprises  con-
volutional,  ReLU,  and  max-pooling  layers.  Each  set  of  convolutional 
layers diversify features by applying a set of parallel filters that process 
local sections of the input space. The feature vector integrates low-level 
local features from the first layers and higher-level representations from 
the latest ones.

%Query
Query: "Which hardware resources are used for training the deep learning model (e.g., GPUs, TPUs)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. Therefore, I cannot determine which hardware resources were used for training the deep learning models, such as GPUs or TPUs.
