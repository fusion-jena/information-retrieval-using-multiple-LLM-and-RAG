Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

algorithms character vector with the name(s) of the 
algorithms(s) used for the embedding procedure; 
ncov value for the target number of covariates to 
include in the final set; maxncov value for the 
maximum possible number of covariates to include in 
the final set; nthreads value for the number of cores to 
be used during parallel operations    

corcut value of the correlation coefficient threshold 
used for identifying collinearity; categories character 
vector with category-level covariate names; variables 
character vector with variable-level names

windows of 100-m, 500-m, or 1-km radii), (ii) the category level (e.g.: 
within thematic covariate categories), and (iii) using all remainders.

We compared the average computation time needed for (i) running 
the overall covariate selection procedure and model fitting steps under 
each of the three main procedures, and (ii) model fitting only. Analyses 
were run using a 10-core central processing unit strategy with AMDÂ® 
EPYC 7402 on the University of Lausanne HPC cluster.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it is not explicitly mentioned which specific hardware resources were used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. However, it does mention that analyses were run using a 10-core central processing unit (CPU) strategy with AMD EPYC 7402 on the University of Lausanne HPC cluster. This suggests that CPU resources were utilized for the computations involved in the study. Without further information, we cannot definitively state whether GPUs or TPUs were also employed for training the deep learning model.
