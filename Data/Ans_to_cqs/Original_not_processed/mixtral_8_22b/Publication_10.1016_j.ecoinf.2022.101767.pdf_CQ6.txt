On the official YouTube platform, we entered the keyword in Japa-
nese  “Yacho”  (wild  birds)  on  15  June  2022  and  sorted  the  videos 
uploaded from the start of the YouTube service to the present day (at the 
time) in the order of the number of views. We attempted to set other 
keywords, including “Tori” (birds) and “bird watching” (this word was 
entered in Japanese Katakana script), but we could not efficiently search 
the videos displaying birds from these keywords (Table S1). The videos 
returned from those keywords did not display wild birds but rather pet 
birds, such as parakeets, those displayed in music videos, and those that 
focused on bird-watching equipment, such as cameras and binoculars. 
Therefore,  we  decided  to  use  the  keyword  “Yacho”  and  extracted  the 
videos that had been viewed >100 times as of 15 June 2022 (n = 449). 
There were too many videos that had been viewed <100 times to extract

upload, thumbnail information in each video, the number of subscribers 
and number of uploaded videos on each channel, as well as the number 
and  presence/absence  of  wild  bird  species  in  each  video.  By  viewing 
videos that recorded wild birds’  singing, we accurately quantified the 
effects of the presence of specific species as well as species richness on 
the number of views. We then examined the relationship between the 
number of views in each video and important video factors selected by 
the machine learning algorithm.

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be taken to improve its performance. These may include data normalization, which scales numeric variables to a common range or mean; data cleaning, where missing values, outliers, or irrelevant features are removed or handled appropriately; and feature engineering, where new features are created based on existing ones to better capture patterns in the data. Additionally, data augmentation techniques like rotation, zooming, flipping, or cropping images can help increase the size and diversity of datasets for image classification tasks. It is also essential to split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate the model's generalizability and prevent overfitting.
