ering larger datasets. Also in this case, larger R2 values are found when 
considering L < 500.

Finally,  the  metric  developed  here  can  become  useful  in  various 
application contexts. Here we discuss four main potential applications of 
the proposed approach.

the weights were obtained from an already trained implementation of 
DeeplabV3+ (https://github.com/zllrunning/deeplab-pytorch-crf) with 
the COCO dataset. COCO is a dataset that has 121,408 images and a total 
of 883,331 object annotations divided in 184 classes. COCO is a widely 
used  dataset  to  train  computer  vision  models  and  sets  a  baseline  to 
benchmark their performance. Since we want to derive common objects 
below the skyline, we inference without training the model directly on 
the landscape photos. A typical example of the masks obtained with such 
a semantic segmentation is provided in Fig. 3.

Helpful Answer:
The authors used an already trained implementation of DeeplabV3+ with the COCO dataset for deriving common objects below the skyline. The COCO dataset consists of 121,408 images and a total of 883,331 object annotations divided into 184 classes. This dataset is widely used to train computer vision models and set a baseline to benchmark their performance. By using this diverse dataset, the authors aimed to improve the generalizability of their deep learning model. However, it is not explicitly mentioned whether they employed additional techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting to further enhance the model's robustness and generalizability.
