5.1. Comparison of SLSTM and SGRU models 

Deep learning methods have accelerated the development of artifi-
cial intelligence and demonstrated potential in various domains (Chen 
et al., 2021). Deep learning architectures simulate neurons in the brain, 
and their ability to learn from complex data renders them the preferred 
choice for time-series prediction (Choi et al., 2021). RNNs are neural 
networks that use backpropagation techniques and short-term memory 
to  enhance  their  time-series  prediction  performance  (Kavitha  et  al., 
2023).

Deep learning-based air pollution analysis on carbon monoxide in Taiwan

Deep  learning  methods  are  being  widely  applied to  create  models 
directly from large volumes of complex data (Seng et al., 2021). Deep 
learning methods have superior performance for time-series prediction 
than  do  many  other  models  (Li  et  al.,  2019b).  SLSTM  has  been  suc-
cessfully used to predict agricultural product sales (Yoo and Oh, 2020). 
To mitigate the high price volatility of agricultural products, sales vol-
ume can be forecasted before production for reducing production risks 
and  facilitating  agricultural  planning,  ultimately  minimizing  post-
production  price  fluctuations.  In  a  case  study,  an  SLSTM  model  was 
found  to  exhibit  lower  errors  and  considerably  higher  performance 
compared with the ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM models. In another case 
study, an SGRU model was used for successfully predicting the Pacific 
decadal  oscillation  index  at  multiple  time  scales  and  achieved  mean

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not mention any specific dataset used in the deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it is mentioned that deep learning methods are being widely applied to create models directly from large volumes of complex data. Additionally, it is stated that these methods have superior performance for time-series prediction compared to many other models. Specifically, the context mentions two case studies where SLSTM and SGRU models were used for different applications - one for predicting agricultural product sales and the other for predicting the Pacific decadal oscillation index. Unfortunately, no information about the datasets used in these case studies is provided. Therefore, based on the given context, we cannot determine which datasets were used in the deep learning pipeline.
