2.6. Performance metrics 

Conventional  metrics  were  used  to  evaluate  the  model’s  perfor-
mance, such as confusion matrices, accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, 
Cohen  Kappa,  and  the  area under  the  ROC curve,  some of  which  are 
defined below (Johnson and Khoshgoftaar, 2019).

2. Methods 

Fig. 2 summarizes a series of processes in designing a deep-learning 
architecture that acts as a toxicovigilance tool. Subsequent sections will 
provide a comprehensive description of each section. 

2.1. Data collection

The model was trained using varying disjoint subsets of the dataset in 
order to assess the number of recordings necessary to yield satisfactory 
classification  metrics.  These  subsets  corresponded  to  different  time 
steps, namely 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 days of flight activity recordings. 
Subsequent  experiments  included  training  the  model  with  various 
combinations of datasets: 1, 2, 3, or all four datasets combined. These 
raw  and curated versions of the datasets are  readily accessible in the 
Code and Data Availability section.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide explicit information about the specific format of the data used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the model is trained using varying disjoint subsets of the dataset corresponding to different time steps of flight activity recordings. This suggests that the data might be in a time-series format, possibly related to flight activities. Without more detailed information, it cannot be definitively stated what exact data format is being used.
