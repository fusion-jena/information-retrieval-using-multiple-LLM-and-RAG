different modules of I3Net.  Unlike training the YOLO models without 
domain adaptation, a different learning rate scheme was implemented to 
train the I3Net modules. Considering the embedded noise in unpaired 
target  domain  images  may  adversely  affect  early-stage  training,  the 
initial  learning  rate  was  set  to  0.001  for  training  the  I3Net  modules, 
which  aimed  to  ensure  the  effective  learning  of  source-domain  infor-
mation, being less disturbed by the target domain images, and thereafter 
the learning rate was reinitialized to 0.01 to enhance feature adaptation 
to  the  target  domain.  Other  hyperparameter  settings  remained  as 
described in Table 2.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The papers mentioned do not provide explicit information about the specific type of deep learning model used in their pipelines. However, some clues can be found in certain papers. For instance, Beck et al. (2021) mention using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for computer vision tasks in agriculture. Similarly, Rahman et al. (2022) discuss using deep neural networks for weed detection, which could imply the use of CNNs or other types of deep learning models suitable for image processing tasks. Nevertheless, it should be noted that these are only assumptions based on the given context, and the exact type of deep learning model used in each paper cannot be definitively determined without further information.
