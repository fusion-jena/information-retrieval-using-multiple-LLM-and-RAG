IV. EXPERIMENTS

A. Hand-crafted Feature Extraction Experiment

1) Biased Dataset: This dataset was created by randomly
taking 70% of the data in D for training and 30% for
testing. These are really approximate percentages because such
distribution has to be attempted for each species in dataset D.
How close to a 70%-30% distribution is achieved depends
on how many photos per species there are in dataset D. For
example, if a given species X has 20 photos, 14 randomly
chosen photos will go to the training dataset and 6 to the
testing dataset. However, if the number of photos for species
X is 2, one will go to the training dataset and the other one to
the testing dataset, resulting in a 50%-50% distribution. This
is the approach most of previous plant identiﬁcation studies
have followed (particularly those based on leaf-scans).

Figure 1: Unbiased and biased splits of a small dataset of 3
specimens of Tecoma stans (L.) Juss. ex Kunth. Each
specimen contains 3 photos framed with the same color.

species are used for training and the rest for testing, but, at
the specimen level, all images of a given specimen are either
used for training or for testing. An observation is a set of
pictures of the same specimen. Figure 1 illustrates two ways
of splitting into a training and a test subsets a very small
dataset with three observations, which are differentiated by
the color of their frames. Each observation, in turn, consists
of three pictures. On the left, the SSPB is avoided while on
the right, pictures from a same specimen, sharing potentially
very similar color and texture distributions, are indifferently
in the training and the test datasets.

B. Deep Learning Experiment

The second experiment is similar to the ﬁrst one but it uses
deep learning CNNs to determine if the SSPB introduces a
signiﬁcant bias. It corresponds to the second row in Figure I.
There is no segmentation applied to the data, only a resize to
224x224 pixels before running the network on the data.

V. RESULTS

A. Hand-crafted Feature Extraction Experiment

Table III shows the results related to the hand-crafted feature
extraction approach experiment. The accuracy obtained is
always considerably better when the biased dataset is used,
with a 26.4% difference when top-5 is used. This clearly shows
that SSPB introduces a signiﬁcant bias.

Helpful Answer:
In the deep learning experiment, the data is split into training and test subsets without any specific mention of a validation subset. The method used to divide the data is not explicitly stated; however, it can be inferred from the description of the first experiment that a similar approach might have been adopted. In the first experiment, the data was divided into a training and a test subset using a 70%-30% distribution, respectively. This distribution was approximated since it had to be attempted for each species in the dataset. Therefore, depending on the number of photos available for each species, the actual distribution could vary slightly. Additionally, the division was done at the photo level rather than the specimen level, meaning that some photos from the same specimen could end up in both the training and test subsets. This approach introduced a significant bias known as Same Specimen Per Bias (SSPB), which affected the performance of the models. Based on this information, it can be assumed that the deep learning experiment also employed a similar methodology for dividing the data, although the exact details remain unclear.
