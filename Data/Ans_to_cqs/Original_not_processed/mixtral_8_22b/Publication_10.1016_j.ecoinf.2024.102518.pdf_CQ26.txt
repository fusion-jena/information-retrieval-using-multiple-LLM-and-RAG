feature class as ‘L', ‘Q', ‘LQ', ‘LQP’, and set the regularization multiplier 
from 0.5 to 5, using the delta in the Akaike minimum information cri-
terion (delta.AICc) as the metric to determine the best tuning parame-
ters. The optimal model is the one with the minimum delta.AICc value 
(delta.AICc = 0), and a model with delta.AICc <2 is considered credible 
(Phillips et al., 2017). The Continuous Boyce Index (CBI)(Hirzel et al., 
2006) was employed in addition to the Area under the Receiver Oper-
ating Characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) because AUC-ROC is not reliable 
when  obtaining  true  absences  is  challenging  (Jim´enez  and  Sober´on, 
2020). The final optimal parameters were identified as the feature class 
‘LQP’ and a regularization multiplier of 3.5 (Fig. A.2). The mean AUC- 
ROC  stands  at 95.5%,  while the  average  CBI  index  for the  validation 
dataset is 82.6%.

Percent  contribution  and  permutation  importance  are  two  metrics 
provided by MaxEnt to determine the importance of input variables in 
the final model (Phillips, 2005). The percent contribution measures the 
contribution of each variable to the model as a percentage of the total 
contribution of all variables. The permutation importance measures the 
decrease  in  training  AUC  for  each  variable  when  the  values  of  that 
variable are randomly permuted among the training points. We identi-
fied the variables that had high percent contribution and permutation 
importance scores as key variables. We then compared the characteris-
tics  of  these  key  variables  between  potential  and  non-potential  areas 
using violin plots.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit details about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions some techniques relevant to handling imbalanced datasets or improving model performance. These include identifying key variables based on their percent contribution and permutation importance scores, comparing characteristics of those key variables between potential and non-potential areas, and employing the Continuous Boyce Index (CBI) along with the Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) to evaluate model performance. While these methods do not directly address data bias, they can help improve model accuracy and robustness. To specifically tackle data bias, common techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection could be applied depending on the nature of the dataset and the specific biases present.
