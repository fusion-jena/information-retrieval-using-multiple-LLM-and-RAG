AI naturalists, just like their human counterparts, may have
their own biases which must be fully understood if the informa-
tion that they generate is to be trusted and suitably utilized. For
example, most AI systems can only detect or recognize already
seen (or learned) objects or concepts. Benchmark datasets of
images can be organized to precisely assess the limits of AI sys-
tems’ ability, highlighting where human expertise is still required.
Deep learning models (some of the most advanced AI algo-
rithms) are developed with training datasets that allow them to
capture discriminant visual patterns. Their performances are
then strongly correlated to the quality and completeness of the
datasets on which they are trained. Unbalanced, biased, or
otherwise poor-quality training datasets will lead to underper-
forming algorithms in real conditions.27 During the learning
phases, particular attention must be given to any relevant limita-

or in terms of certain traits, for example, toward species that are
typically considered more photogenic due to large colorful
ﬂowers or leaves. Search terms could be modiﬁed to either focus
on a speciﬁc sub-group, e.g., searching using scientiﬁc names,
or to exclude non-target images, e.g., excluding images that
include the words ‘‘show’’ or ‘‘garden’’ in their metadata. Finally,
high-level image classiﬁers could be trained to remove images
that are clearly not plants, for example, removing images of an-
imals, paintings. High-level classiﬁers developed to separate im-
ages that contain plants from those that do not, without looking
to identify species, could be used to ﬁnd images worthy of further
examination in large datasets that do not have metadata (such as
titles and descriptions),
removing the need for keyword
searches, such as that used in this study.

Helpful Answer:
Regularization methods are techniques used in machine learning and deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the noise in the training data instead of generalizing well to unseen data. Two common regularization methods used in deep learning are Dropout and L2 Regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training. This means that their contribution to the activation of downstream neurons is temporally removed on the forward pass and any weight updates are not applied to the neuron on the backward pass. The idea behind dropout is to reduce co-dependencies among neurons, making the network more robust and less likely to overfit.

L2 Regularization, also known as Ridge Regression or Weight Decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of all parameters. By adding this penalty term, we encourage smaller weights, leading to simpler models that generalize better. In other words, it discourages complex models that might fit the training data too closely but perform poorly on new data.

In summary, both Dropout and L2 Regularization are effective ways to combat overfitting in deep learning models. Dropout achieves this by preventing complex co-adaptations on training data, while L2 Regularization encourages smaller weights, resulting in simpler models that generalize better.
