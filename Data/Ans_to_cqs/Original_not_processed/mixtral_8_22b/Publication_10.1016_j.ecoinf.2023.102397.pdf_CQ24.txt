Automated  Remote  Biodiversity  Monitoring  Network  (ARBIMON; 
hereafter  referred  to  as  Arbimon)  is  an  online  open-source  platform 
linked  to  the  Rainforest  Connection  website  (https://arbimon.rfcx. 
org/),  with  a  combination  of  hardware  and  software  for  automating 
data acquisition, data management, and species identification based on 
audio recordings (Aide et al., 2013). From the several tools available to 
the user, we used a random forest model, which is a machine learning 
model based on decision trees and has shown to be robust and powerful 
(Breiman,  2001).  The  model  works  with  one  or  two  ROIs  (region  of 
interest, template, that contains the desired vocalization), the training 
data that contain validated recordings of the presence or absence of the 
vocalization provided by the user, and the threshold value set by the 
user. The threshold value ranges from 0 to 1. A score close to 0 means

of the recognizer, we chose the optimal cut-off thresholds (in the case of 
identical F-scores, we used the mean of the thresholds); (4) we ran a 
random forest model using the best replicate and threshold on the test 
set and evaluated its performance; and (5) we implemented the same 
recognizer and threshold to the target set to obtain biologically relevant 
data.

over which the quality measures and results fail to continue improving. 
Benkendorf and Hawkins (2020), analyzing the effect of sample size on 
deep neural networks, similarly concluded that by increasing the num-
ber of hidden layers, which can be interpreted as adding more training 
recordings in our software, the neural network can largely improve the 
performance of the model.

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not directly address the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing the random seed value. However, it does mention the use of a random forest model, which is a type of ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. This model is known for its ability to handle high dimensionality and large datasets, making it suitable for tasks like species distribution modeling and audio recognition (Benkendorf & Hawkins, 2020; Breiman, 2001).

In general, handling randomness in deep learning pipelines involves techniques such as setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using cross-validation methods to evaluate models, employing regularization techniques to prevent overfitting, and applying dropout layers within neural networks to randomly ignore certain neurons during training. These strategies help ensure that the models are robust and reliable, even when dealing with inherent randomness in the data or the algorithms themselves.

However, since the provided context does not explicitly discuss these strategies, this response cannot provide a detailed explanation of how they were applied in the given studies. It is recommended to refer to other sources or consult domain experts for further information on managing randomness in deep learning pipelines.
