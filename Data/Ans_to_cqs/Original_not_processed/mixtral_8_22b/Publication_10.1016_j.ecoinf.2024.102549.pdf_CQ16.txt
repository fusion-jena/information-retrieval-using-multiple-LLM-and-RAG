Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

the study area is shown in Fig. 5. The CNN structure, depicted in Fig. 3, 
comprises five convolutional layers, one pooling layer; three fully con-
nected  layers,  and  three  water-quality  level  labels  including  Class  I, 
Class II, and Class III. To enhance model reliability, a dropout function 
was incorporated between the fully connected layers. Parameters were 
set with a kernel size of 3, stride of 1, and a dropout rate of 50% post the 
fully connected layer. The training was conducted over 500 epochs with 
(cid:0) 4, momentum at 0.9, with the learning rate 
an initial learning rate of 10
halved  every  20  rounds  to  optimize  performance,  culminating  in  the 
selection of the most effective model weights for each cycle.

quality level as training sets into CNN for training.

%Query
Query: "What criteria are used to determine when training is complete (e.g., validation loss plateau)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it appears that the training process for this particular Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is set to run for a fixed number of epochs, specifically 500 epochs. This means that the training completes after running through all the data 500 times. However, the text does not explicitly mention any specific criteria for determining when the training should stop based on the model's performance or loss metrics. Therefore, we cannot definitively state what criteria are used to determine when training is complete beyond the fact that it runs for a predetermined number of epochs.
