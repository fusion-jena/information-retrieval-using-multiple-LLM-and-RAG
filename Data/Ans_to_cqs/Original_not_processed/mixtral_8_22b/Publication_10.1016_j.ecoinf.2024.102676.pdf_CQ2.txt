To  further  enhance  the  Footprint  Identification  Technique  (FIT) 
method,  we  recommend  collecting  imperfect  footprints  when  high- 
quality  footprints  are  insufficient  during  field  surveys.  Instead  of  dis-
carding incomplete prints, we advocate using missing value imputation 
as  part  of  the  data  preprocessing  pipeline.  This  approach  preserves 
valuable data and improves the accuracy of FIT predictions when sub- 
quality footprints are included. Our findings are supported by a study 
using  deep  learning  models  to  classify  three  sympatric  otter  species, 
where a model trained on images of all qualities was only marginally 
outperformed  by  a  model  trained  on  high-quality  prints,  highlighting 
the  potential  of  utilizing  lower  quality  data  effectively  Kistner  et  al.

For  the second experiment, we engaged with a  dataset of cheetah 
(Acinonyx jubatus) footprints that were processed by an operator expe-
rienced in this specific area. Unlike the first experiment, which utilized 
high-quality images, this dataset included images of lesser quality that 
would normally be excluded based on the FIT standard protocol. Due to 
the limited availability of lower-quality images, we did not differentiate 
whether missing features were the result of distorted footprints or gen-
eral image quality issues, such as resolution and lighting. The inclusion 
of these images allowed us to explore the robustness of our methodology 
in handling data of varying quality. 

All landmarks within each footprint image were meticulously rated 
according  to  their  visibility  and  clarity:  0  = clearly  identifiable,  1  =
unclear, and 2 = fully missing. This rating system was crucial, as land-
marks rated with a 1 were visible to the experienced operator but might

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not explicitly state the data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the dataset used for the second experiment consists of footprint images of cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus). These images were likely used as input for the deep learning models mentioned in the text. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is primarily image data.
