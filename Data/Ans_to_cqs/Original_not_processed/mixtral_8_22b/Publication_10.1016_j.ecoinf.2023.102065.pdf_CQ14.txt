2.8.3. Optimal model and threshold selection

3.4. Optimal model selection for each species 

We used soundscape data to select the optimal model with the cor-
responding threshold that produced the highest F0.5 score. We found 
that different optimal models were chosen for each species (Figs. 6 & 7). 
For  example,  MobileNetv2  was  selected  for  CAVI,  ResNet101v2  for 
WEME, and ResNet50v2 for CAQU (Fig. 6). The MobileNet architecture 
was the most common optimal model in our soundscape data (17 of 37 
species; Fig. 7), with an average F0.5 of 0.80 and average threshold of 
0.79 (Table 2). 

Based  on  soundscape  data,  total  precision  (pooled  across  species) 
with  optimal  CNN-XC  model  selection  was  84.5%.  Species  precision 
ranged from 46.9% (SOSP) to 100.0% (COYE, MOUQ, and WIWA), with 
average species precision of 85.1 ± 13.2% (Fig. 8A). Total recall (pooled 
across  classes)  with  optimal  models  was  60.0%  and  average  species

recall  was 59.2 ± 15.0%  (Fig. 8B). Species  recall ranged from 20.8% 
(SOSP)  to  88.2%  (COYE).  These  levels  of  recall  for  each  species  are 
acceptable for our biodiversity application that requires accurate species 
detection  at  a  site  level,  even  if  some  2-s  detections  are  missed  (i.e., 
increased number of false negatives that lower recall). With the optimal 
model selection, overall (pooled across species) F0.5 was 0.78 and F1 
was 0.70, while class average F0.5 was 0.77 ± 0.12 and F1 was 0.69 ±
012.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. It only mentions that different optimal models were chosen for each species based on soundscape data, but it does not specify the method used for selecting these models or optimizing their hyperparameters. Therefore, I do not have enough information to answer this question.
