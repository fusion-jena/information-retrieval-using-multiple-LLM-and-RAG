hyperparameters  in  a  model.  It  identifies  the  most  effective  set  of 
hyperparameters  that  enhance  the  model's  performance.  During 
training,  GSCV  generates  a  series  of  models,  each  characterized  by  a 
different  set  of  hyperparameters.  The  purpose  of  this  technique  is  to 
systematically train and assess the performance of these various models 
through cross-validation. The process concludes with the selection of the 
model that demonstrates the most superior performance, determined by 
its optimal hyperparameter combination (Adnan et al., 2022). Details of 
the primary tuning parameters, their range and the optimal combination 
of  hyperparameters  utilized  for  each  algorithm  for  each  model  are 
shown in Table 1.

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be taken to improve the quality of input data and ensure better results. These include:

1. Normalization: This involves rescaling the features so they fall within a specific range, typically between 0 and 1. This helps prevent any single feature from dominating the others due to differences in scales.

2. Scaling: Similar to normalization, scaling also adjusts the range of features but does not necessarily restrict it to a fixed interval. Common methods include standardizing (subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation) and min-max scaling (rescaling to a given range like -1 to 1).

3. Cleaning: This step involves handling missing values, outliers, and noisy data. Missing values can be filled using techniques such as imputation, while outliers and noise can be detected and removed using statistical methods or visual inspection.

4. Encoding: For categorical variables, encoding converts them into numerical representations that can be processed by the model. Techniques include label encoding, one-hot encoding, and ordinal encoding.

5. Feature Selection: Identifying relevant features and removing redundant ones can help reduce overfitting and improve model performance. Methods include correlation analysis, mutual information, and recursive feature elimination.

6. Augmentation: To increase the size of the dataset and introduce variability, augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, zooming, and cropping can be applied to image datasets.

These preprocessing steps may vary depending on the nature of the problem and the type of data being used. However, they generally contribute to improving the overall accuracy and efficiency of the deep learning model.
