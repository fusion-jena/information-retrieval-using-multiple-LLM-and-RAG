5.4. Connectivity data 

The  synthetic  connectivity  data  was  generated  using  a  Generative 
Adversarial Network (GAN) model based on the y-data-synthetic Python 
package (YData, 2023), as this model was able to replicate the sparse-
ness  of  the  original  connectivity  matrices  best  and  performed  best  in 
terms of the utility metrics. GAN models feature a generator component, 
which learns the latent features of the data to generate a data sample, 
and  a  discriminator,  which  is  a  classification  model  which  learns  to 
classify real and synthetic data. Backpropagation from the discriminator 
updates the model parameters in the generator with the magnitude of 
the update depending on the success of the discriminator in classifying

adversarial  networks  (GAN),  and  are  better  at  learning  sophisticated 
patterns in data but can be more computationally expensive and require 
more data to train (Endres et al., 2022).

5.2. Initial coral cover data 

The  initial  coral  cover  model  was  developed  using  a  TVAE  model 
from SDV, which is based on a Variational Autoencoder model. In this 
model,  an  encoder  maps  the  original  data  to  distributions  in  a  lower 
dimensional latent space. Data is then sampled from the latent space and 
transformed back to the original space using a decoder. In the learning 
phase the decoder learns by finding a transformation with minimal loss 
between the original and final data distributions. This loss is quantified 
using the evidence lower bound (ELBO), which transforms intractable 
inference  problems  into  optimisation  problems  which  can  be  solved 
using gradient methods (Xu et al., 2019). 

The model learns the spatially dependent distribution of cover for 
each of the six species of coral modelled in ADRIA. The radially sampled 
latitudes and longitudes from the synthetic site data set are then used to

Classical and deep learning methods are increasingly being used to 
generate synthetic data as they can perform better at emulating complex 
patterns and relationships in the original datasets, and do not require 
knowledge  of  prior  or  posterior  distributions  for  dataset  variables. 
Classical  machine  learning  methods  include  regression,  K-nearest 
neighbours,  and  support  vector  machines,  and  can  perform  better  on 
smaller data sets and take less time to train than deep learning methods. 
Deep  learning  methods  are  based  on  neural  networks,  including

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model used in generating the synthetic connectivity data is to create a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model. The goal of this GAN model is to replicate the sparseness of the original connectivity matrices and perform well in terms of utility metrics. The GAN model consists of two components: a generator and a discriminator. The generator learns the latent features of the data to generate a data sample, while the discriminator is a classification model that learns to classify real and synthetic data. Through backpropagation from the discriminator, the model parameters in the generator are updated, with the magnitude of the update depending on the success of the discriminator in classifying the data.

Additionally, another deep learning model, a TVAE model from SDV, is used to develop the initial coral cover model. This model is based on a Variational Autoencoder model, where an encoder maps the original data to distributions in a lower dimensional latent space. Data is then sampled from the latent space and transformed back to the original space using a decoder. During the learning phase, the decoder learns by finding a transformation with minimal loss between the original and final data distributions. The model aims to learn the spatially dependent distribution of cover for each of the six species of coral modelled in ADRIA.
