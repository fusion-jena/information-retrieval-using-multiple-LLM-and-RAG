bandwidth.  The  FCOVER  retrieval  must  be  based  on  atmospherically 
corrected data to provide interpretable canopy reflectance by PROSAIL- 
D RTM (Fern´andez-Guisuraga et al., 2021a; Jia et al., 2016), and thus 
the  algorithm  relies  on  harmonized  S2  post-fire  Level-2  A  data 
(COPERNICUS/S2_SR_HARMONIZED  dataset  in  GEE)  discarding  60  m 
bands as in the BA product. Additional sensors will be included in future 
FIREMAP  versions  (see  Section  4)  to  allow  for  the  FCOVER  retrieval 
prior to 2018.

Query: "What methods are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., surveys, sensors, public datasets)? "

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of the Google Earth Engine platform, which provides access to various satellite imagery datasets such as Sentinel-2 and Landsat. These datasets could potentially be used as input for the deep learning models. Additionally, the text references several studies that have likely used remote sensing techniques and possibly other sources of data collection such as ground surveys or LiDAR data. Without more explicit information about the specific methods used for data collection, this is the best interpretation we can make based on the given context.
