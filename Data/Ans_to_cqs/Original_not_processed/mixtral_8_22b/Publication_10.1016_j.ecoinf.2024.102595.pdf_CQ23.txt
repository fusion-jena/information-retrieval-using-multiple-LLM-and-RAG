In  the  development  stage,  the  preprocessed  data  was  divided  into 
training (80%), validation (10%), and test sets (10%) for model training 
and testing purposes (Shah et al., 2018), followed by the construction of 
predictive  models  using  both  deep  learning  algorithms  (e.g.,  Deep 
Neural  Networks)  and  traditional  machine  learning  approaches  (e.g., 
AdaBoost  Regressor,  Support  Vector  Regressor,  etc.),  with  hyper-
parameter tuning performed via GridSearchCV with cross-validation (cv 
= 10).  While some studies  might  use different proportions, such as  a 
70–30 split between training and testing/validation (Khan et al., 2022), 
the  80–10-10  split  employed  in  this  study  ensured  a  more  extensive 
training set, potentially leading to a better-generalized model. The test 
set,  which  the  model  has  not  previously  seen  during  the  training  or 
validation phases indicates the model’s performance in real-world sce-
narios (Shah et al., 2018).

Employing GridSearchCV ensured that each candidate combination 
of  hyperparameters  is  assessed  using  cross-validation  with  a  fixed 
number of folds, in this case, ten, as highlighted by Shahhosseini et al. 
(2021). This tenfold cross-validation provides a reliable estimate of the 
model’s performance, balancing the trade-off between bias and variance 
and  guarding  against  overfitting.  The  hyperparameter  tuning  process 
implemented  in  this  study  relied  on  a  detailed  and  systematic  search 
across a predefined grid of hyperparameter values. A unique parameter 
grid  was  defined  for  each  model  considered,  targeting specific  model 
characteristics such as the number of estimators in ensemble methods or 
the  depth  of  trees  in  decision  tree-based  algorithms.  This  process 
ensured that the eventual choice of hyperparameters was not arbitrary 
but  is  backed  by  empirical  evidence  that  aligns  with  Schratz  et  al.

(2019),  stating  that  optimal  hyperparameter  settings  are  critical  to 
reducing bias in the model predictions.

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were implemented. Firstly, the preprocessed data was divided into three distinct subsets: training (80%), validation (10%), and test sets (10%). This division allowed for comprehensive model training and testing, with the larger proportion allocated to the training set aimed at enhancing the model's ability to learn patterns within the data.

Secondly, the predictive models were constructed using both deep learning algorithms (such as Deep Neural Networks) and traditional machine learning approaches (like AdaBoost Regressor and Support Vector Regressor). This approach enabled the exploration of various modeling strategies, thereby increasing the likelihood of identifying the most effective method for the given task.

Thirdly, hyperparameter tuning was conducted through GridSearchCV with cross-validation (cv = 10). This technique systematically searches across a predefined grid of hyperparameter values, ensuring that the final selection of hyperparameters is based on empirical evidence rather than arbitrary decisions. Moreover, the implementation of tenfold cross-validation provided a robust estimate of the model's performance, striking a balance between bias and variance while safeguarding against overfitting.

Lastly, the test set, which remained unseen by the model during the training and validation stages, served as an indicator of the model's performance in real-world scenarios. By evaluating the model's performance on this separate subset of data, it was possible to gauge its capacity to generalize beyond the training data.

These combined efforts—including diverse dataset partitioning, application of multiple modeling techniques, rigorous hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation on a separate test set—collectively contributed to enhancing the generalizability of the deep learning model.
