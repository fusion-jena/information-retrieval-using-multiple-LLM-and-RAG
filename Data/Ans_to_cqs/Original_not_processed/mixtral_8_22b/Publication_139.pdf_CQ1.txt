2.3. Data pre-processing 

Once all of the audio data was collected, it was segmented into 8 s- 
long clips, to increase the likelihood  that both biological and  anthro-
pogenic sound sources with longer call lengths (the cardinal, with a song 
sequence that often lasts 4 s, and the siren call, one period of which lasts 
5  s)  to  be  captured  in  their  entirety.  Each  segment  was  then  down-
sampled to 16 kHz for processing efficiency, allowing each to be rep-
resented  as  a  128,000-sample  vector.  Finally,  these  segments  were 
converted into log-mel spectrograms using the Librosa python package

2.4.1. Training database assembly 

To assemble a training database, three randomly selected days from 
each month of the calendar year (see Table 1) were selected for anno-
tation. Select spectrogram images were manually labeled via visual in-
spection by two trained graduate students into a set of sound categories 
that evolved as the year progressed. On average, around 60 images could 
be  annotated  per  minute,  which  corresponds  to  8  min  of  audio  data. 
Therefore,  annotating  every  single  spectrogram  from  a  single  day 
(10,800 images) would take 3 h. Assembling the training database took 
less time in practice because only 10–15% of the spectrograms from each 
of the selected days were actually annotated (many spectrograms which 
contained only background noise were simply not needed). 

In total, this database consists of over 40 k images of bio-, anthro- 
and  geophonies.  The  full  contents  of  the  database  are  presented  in 
Table 2.

can  be  highly  variable,  they  cannot  be  readily  compressed  into  the 
feature sets suitable for these traditional machine learning paradigms 
(Kong  et  al.,  2017).  Consequently,  it  is  advantageous  to  carry  out 
analysis  on  spectrograms,  pictorial  representations  of  the  raw  audio 
data.  Spectrograms  convey  the  temporal  dimension  on  the  horizontal 
axis,  while  frequency  increases  along  the  vertical  axis.  The  third 
dimension of a spectrogram, sound power level, is typically represented 
with  color.  To  classify  audio  data  in  this  form,  networks  specifically 
designed  for  image  classification,  convolutional  neural  networks 
(CNNs), are often employed (Florentin et al., 2020; Kahl et al., 2019; 
Ruff et al., 2020). CNNs, like other deep learning models, involve end-to- 
end  learning,  where  feature  sets  are  not  hand-selected,  but  instead 
learned during training.

monitoring is proposed and demonstrated, capable of providing valu-
able  and  nuanced  information  about  the  acoustic  environment  with 
readily  available  equipment  and  techniques.  Convolutional  neural 
network training provides accurate sound classification for a wide range 
of call types and durations – after a minimal amount of manual anno-
tation relative to the size of the dataset. 

In  particular,  after  manual  analysis  of  only  1–3%  of  the  dataset, 
around 150 h, deep learning techniques facilitate the accurate classifi-
cation of over 8700 h, one year of audio data. Without model training, 
only those 150 h of manually annotated data could be viably analyzed. 
Hence,  manual  annotation  is  justified  in  this  application  because  the 
effort scales; the approach becomes increasingly time efficient with an 
increasing number of years of data collection at a particular site or in a 
particular region.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit details regarding the method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the given context, we can infer that the authors might have used some sort of recording devices such as microphones or audio recorders to collect the audio data. This is evident from the fact that the authors mention working with audio data and converting them into spectrograms for further processing. Additionally, the authors also discuss selecting specific days for annotation, indicating that they had access to a large pool of recorded audio data. Therefore, although the exact method of data collection is not mentioned, it can be assumed that the authors used recording devices to gather the necessary audio data for their study.
