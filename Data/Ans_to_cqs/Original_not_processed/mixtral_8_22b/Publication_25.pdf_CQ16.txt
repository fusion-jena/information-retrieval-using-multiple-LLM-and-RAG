improve with a combination of better validation data and more hand-annotated training samples.

solely using the hand-annotated data. This allows for a direct comparison of the contribution of
high-quality annotations when compared to the self-supervised model or the full model combining
both self-supervision and hand-annotation data.

combined with labeled data in a semi-supervised framework (sensu [14]), which may improve deep
learning on limited training data by providing neural networks the opportunity to learn generalized
features on a wider array of training examples, followed by retraining on a smaller number of high
quality annotations [16]. It is unknown whether moderate to low quality annotations can be used
to generate trees for initial model training, given the imperfect nature of existing unsupervised tree
delimitation approaches.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does discuss various aspects related to improving models through different types of data and methods such as self-supervision, hand-annotations, and semi-supervised learning. In machine learning, common criteria used to determine when training is complete include reaching a certain number of epochs, achieving a desired level of accuracy or loss, or observing a plateau in validation loss. Without explicit information from the provided context, these general criteria can be considered as potential answers to the query.
