2.3. Gradient boosters 

LightGBM,  proposed  by  Microsoft,  is  a  newly  developed  gradient 
boost  or  tree-based  learning  algorithm.  It  was  designed  to  improve

2. Data and methods 

The overall workflow of the proposed method is shown in (Fig. 1). 
For  simplicity,  the  workflow  starts  with  collecting  sample  plots  and 
image processing to generate a tabulated dataset, including on-field AGB 
and  independent  features.  This  data  set  is  fed  into  hybrid  models,  in 

which  Bayesian  optimizers  and  TDO  tune  the  hyperparameters  of 
XGBoost and LightGBM using RMSE as the objective function. The best 
model  (with  the  smallest  RMSE)  is  selected  to  estimate  AGB  for  the 
entire study area. This model was also interpreted to understand better 
what operates inside the ‘black box.’ More detailed descriptions of the 
study area,  data specifications and preparation, and  algorithm justifi-
cations are presented in the following sections.

2.4. Hyperparameter optimisation 

Hyperparameter  optimization  searches  for  the  best  set  of  hyper-
parameters  for  a  machine  learning  model  that  can  perform  best  on  a 
given  task.  In  many  packages,  random  or  grid  search  is  the  default 
method  for  selecting  optimal  hyperparameters  (Snoek  et  al.,  2012). 
There are many studies on the selections of optimization algorithms for 
theoretical  problems  or  engineering  applications,  in  which  various 
versions  of  Bayesian  optimizers  and  Swarm-based  algorithms  were 
compared (Stenger et al., 2019; Stenger and Dirk, 2022).
