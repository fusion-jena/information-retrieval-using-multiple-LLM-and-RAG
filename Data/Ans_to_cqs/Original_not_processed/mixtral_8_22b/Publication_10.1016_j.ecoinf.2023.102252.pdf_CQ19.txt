whilst providing very reasonable data and computational requirements. 
In Section 6, we discuss the advantages and limitations of the model and 
future work. And finally, we summarize the main findings in Section 7.

ables  over  time.  However,  the  highly  detailed  modeling  of  physical 
processes also brings significant data requirements, including detailed 
meteorological,  soil,  and  vegetation  data,  as  well  as  substantial 
computational costs. This can make energy balance models impractical

%Query
Query: "Which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no information about which specific frameworks were used to build the deep learning model. The text only mentions a discussion about the advantages and limitations of the model and future work in Section 6, but it does not provide any details regarding the implementation or development process of the model. Therefore, without additional context, it is impossible to determine which frameworks were used to build the deep learning model.
