Surveillance  and  monitoring  are  fundamental  for  pest  and  disease 
management and control (Prasad and Prabhakar, 2012), as they provide 
a guideline for management to detect the occurrence areas of invasive 
species in the early stages of invasive history. Furthermore, these data 
support decision-making relative to, for example, the zone of concen-
trated control and allocation of budget and manpower during pest and 
disease dispersal.

%Query
Query: "What process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model (e.g., Model serialization, Platform selection)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given information, there is no specific mention or details about the deployment process of any trained deep learning model. Therefore, it cannot be determined what process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection.
