approach of missForest allows it to progressively enhance its imputation 
accuracy.

missForest  is  a  Random  Forest-based  algorithm  developed  by 
(Stekhoven and Bühlmann, 2012), which imputes missing values itera-
tively using Random Forests trained on subsets of the dataset. In contrast 
to  the  standard  Random  Forest  methodology,  as  introduced  by  (Brei-
man,  2001),  where  the  focus  is  primarily  on  predictive  modeling  or 
classification tasks, missForest uses the Random Forest algorithm for the 
specific  task  of  imputation.  In  missForest,  each  variable  containing 
missing values is treated as a target variable. For every target variable, a 
dedicated  Random  Forest  model  is  trained,  utilizing  the  remaining 
variables as predictors. This targeted model is then employed to predict 
missing values within subsets of the dataset. This procedure is repeated 
with  the  updated  imputed  missing values  until a  predefined  stopping 
criterion  is  reached  Stekhoven  and  Bühlmann  (2012).  The  iterative

To  further  enhance  the  Footprint  Identification  Technique  (FIT) 
method,  we  recommend  collecting  imperfect  footprints  when  high- 
quality  footprints  are  insufficient  during  field  surveys.  Instead  of  dis-
carding incomplete prints, we advocate using missing value imputation 
as  part  of  the  data  preprocessing  pipeline.  This  approach  preserves 
valuable data and improves the accuracy of FIT predictions when sub- 
quality footprints are included. Our findings are supported by a study 
using  deep  learning  models  to  classify  three  sympatric  otter  species, 
where a model trained on images of all qualities was only marginally 
outperformed  by  a  model  trained  on  high-quality  prints,  highlighting 
the  potential  of  utilizing  lower  quality  data  effectively  Kistner  et  al.

Helpful Answer:
The query asks about regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. Regularization techniques help improve the generalization performance of machine learning algorithms by reducing their complexity and preventing them from memorizing the training data. Two common regularization methods mentioned in the query are dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a technique proposed by Geoffrey Hinton et al. (2012) to address the problem of overfitting in neural networks. Dropout works by randomly dropping out neurons along with their connections during training, which helps reduce co-adaptations between neurons and encourages the network to learn more robust features. During testing, no neurons are dropped, but their outputs are scaled down proportionately to account for the reduced capacity due to dropout.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, is another popular regularization method used in deep learning. It adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights. By penalizing large weights, L2 regularization discourages complex models and promotes simpler solutions that generalize better to unseen data.

Other regularization methods not explicitly mentioned in the query include L1 regularization, early stopping, and batch normalization. L1 regularization, like L2 regularization, adds a penalty term to the loss function, but instead of squaring the weights, it takes their absolute value. Early stopping involves monitoring the validation error during training and halting the process once the error starts increasing, indicating that the model has begun to overfit. Batch normalization is a technique that normalizes the inputs to each layer in a neural network, helping stabilize the learning process and improving generalization performance.
