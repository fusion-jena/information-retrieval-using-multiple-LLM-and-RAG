artificial neural networks (ANN) (Men et al., 2022). The efficacy of these 
algorithms exhibits considerable variation across diverse aquatic envi-
ronments. For instance, the Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of 
Spectral  Hypercubes  (FLAASH)  model,  originally  developed  for  land 
pixels,  has  proven  effective  in  AC  for  aquatic  environments  utilizing 
Sentinel-2  and  SPOT-6  imagery  (Rotta  et  al.,  2016;  Li  et  al.,  2023a, 
2023b, 2023c, 2023d). Additionally, the FLAASH algorithm mitigates 
the  spatial  proximity  effect  by  employing  an  internal  pixel  averaging 
technique, which is essential for attaining high-quality AC (Wang et al., 
2021).  In  investigations  of  lacustrine  environments  using  Advanced 
Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) AVNIR-2 data, the efficacy of AC al-
gorithms  predicated  on  the  single  scattering  approximation  has  been 
significantly enhanced (Matsui and Kageyama, 2022). The Atmospheric

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it mentions two studies that utilize deep learning models for their respective tasks.

In the study by Kumar and Gorai (2023), they compare the performance of a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) and a deep neural network (DNN) for land use/land cover classifications of mining regions using fused multi-sensor satellite data. This suggests that either DCNN or DNN could be employed in the pipeline, depending on the task requirements.

Additionally, Meng et al. (2024) discuss the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for classifying inland lake water quality levels based on Sentinel-2 images. This indicates that CNNs might also be considered when designing the pipeline.

However, without more detailed information regarding the specific pipeline mentioned in the query, we cannot definitively state whether a CNN, RNN, Transformer, or another deep learning model would be most suitable.
