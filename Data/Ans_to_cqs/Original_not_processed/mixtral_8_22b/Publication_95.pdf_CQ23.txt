When training a deep convolutional neural network, it is important to split the data
into a training set, a validation set, and a test set. The training set is used for optimizing the
parameters of the network, while the validation set is used for monitoring the performance
of the network during training and for comparing the performance of different networks
with, for example, different hyperparameters or network structures. The test set acts as a
ﬁnal evaluation of a network. To ensure a proper evaluation on both the validation set and
the test set, samples in each set must be independent and have similar class distributions.
The full data set can be split in various ways. The naïve approach is to randomly
sample images from the full data set. However, due to the images being captured in
close proximity and potentially having overlapping ﬁelds of views, information may leak
between the data sets when using the naïve approach. Another approach would be to

the collected data. Finally, the deep learning algorithms are evaluated and the challenges
of monitoring IAPS are discussed.

Figure 8. Recall of the ResNet50V2 models on the validation set as a function of the annotation size relative to image size.
The validation images were binned according to the relative size of their respective annotations with respect to the image
size (“annotation size”). Each line shows the recall (left axis) of a ResNet50V2 model with a given input image size across
the binned annotation sizes. The recall lines were “smoothed”, using kernel density estimation. The number of images in
each bin is shown as vertical bars (right axis).

All networks were trained on the training set for 100 epochs, using the Adam opti-
mizer [27] with a learning rate of 0.001 and cross-entropy loss. The image batch size varied
from 1 to 32 images, depending on the input image resolution with larger batch sizes
for smaller image sizes. After each epoch, the network was evaluated on the validation
set. The epoch model with the highest accuracy on the validation set during training was
saved for further analysis. Before training the networks, the training set was balanced by
upsampling the images from the underrepresented classes through repetition to match the
number of images of the most represented class, “No species”.

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the data was divided into three distinct subsets: a training set, a validation set, and a test set. This division allowed for the optimization of parameters using the training set, monitoring of performance during training using the validation set, and final evaluation of the network using the test set. It was emphasized that samples within each set should be independent and maintain similar class distributions to prevent any potential bias or overfitting.

Secondly, instead of simply randomly sampling images from the entire dataset, which could lead to information leaking between datasets due to close proximity capturing and overlapping fields of view, another approach was adopted. Although not explicitly stated, this suggests that some form of stratified splitting might have been employed to ensure diverse representation within each subset.

Thirdly, all networks were trained for 100 epochs using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 and cross-entropy loss. The batch size varied based on the input image resolution, with larger batches for smaller image sizes. After each epoch, the network was evaluated on the validation set, and the model with the highest accuracy on the validation set during training was saved for further analysis.

Lastly, before training the networks, the training set was balanced by upsampling the images from underrepresented classes through repetition to match the number of images of the most represented class, "No species". This step ensured that no single class dominated the training process, thereby improving the model's ability to generalize well to unseen data.
