5. Conclusion 

CRediT authorship contribution statement

fish leads to greater errors in weight estimation. Consequently, the use of 
a deep learning network for high-quality target detection proved crucial 
in dealing with the complexities of the underwater environment. Using 
fish body area as a parameter to estimate body weight resulted in higher 
accuracy with a MRE of 3.44% (Shi et al., 2022). However, a consid-
erable  amount  of  image  processing  work,  including  segmentation, 
erosion, and angle correction, led to a decline in the efficiency of body 
weight estimation. Therefore, the proposed method for fully automatic 
biomass  estimation  had  minimized  the  workload  and  complexity  of 
image preprocessing, thereby increasing the efficiency and robustness of 
body weight estimation.

%Query
Query: "What optimization techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., SGD, Adam)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The paper does not provide specific information about the optimization techniques used in their deep learning pipeline. The authors mention using a deep learning network for high-quality target detection but do not specify which optimizer was employed during training. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if they used optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam).
