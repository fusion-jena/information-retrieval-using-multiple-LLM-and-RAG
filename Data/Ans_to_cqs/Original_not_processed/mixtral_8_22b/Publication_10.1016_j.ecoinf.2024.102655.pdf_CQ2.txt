with the full dataset where significantly higher values for all evaluation
measurements (RMSE, MSE, MAE and R2) were observed. Addionally,
the three models (ANFIS, ANN, and SVM) performed similar evalution
measurements when were trained using the BTS, which also prove that
the selection of most representative and variable scenarios for training is
effective to improve machine learning models performance.

River systems provide multiple ecosystem services to society globally, but these are already degraded or
threatened in many areas of the world due to water quality issues linked to diffuse and point-source pollutant
inputs. Water quality evaluation is essential to develop remediation and management strategies. Computational
tools such as machine learning based predictive models have been developed to improve monitoring network
capabilities. The model’s performance is reduced when datasets composed of reductant information are used for
training, on the other hand, the selection of most representative and variable water quality scenarios could result
in higher precision. This study analyzed historical water quality behavior in the Santiago River, Mexico, to
identify the most variable and representative data available to train machine learning models (Adaptive Neuro
Fuzzy Inference System – ANFIS, Artificial Neural Network – ANN, and Support Vector Machine - SVM). Thirteen

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the data used for training the machine learning models (ANFIS, ANN, and SVM) is likely in a structured format, possibly a CSV file, since the parameters listed include various water quality measurements with their respective units. These types of data are typically stored in tabular form, making them suitable for use in machine learning algorithms. It should be noted that without explicit confirmation, this remains an educated guess based on the context provided.
