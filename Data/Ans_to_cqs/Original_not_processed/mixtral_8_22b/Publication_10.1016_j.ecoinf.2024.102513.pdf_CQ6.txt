where  zi  is  the  output  value  of  the  i-th  neuron,  wj  is  the  convolution 
weight for input value xj, bi  is the bias, and f is the activation function. 
The  Pooling  Layer  performs  data  downsampling,  reducing  dimen-
sionality and extracting essential features. The most common pooling 
method is max pooling, which selects the maximum value from a region 
of  input  data.  Pooling  helps  reduce  the  number  of  parameters  and 
computations,  enhances  invariance  to  small  shifts  and  scale  changes, 
and improves the model's generalization ability.

Based on the architecture of the convolutional neural network pre-
sented in the 8, its main elements include the input layer, convolutional 
layer, pooling layer, fully connected layer, and output layer. The raster 
bands stack, serving as the input layer of the network, represents a stack 
of various rasters, such as spectral channels from satellite images, each 

containing information about different wavelengths. This stack forms a 
multidimensional tensor, where each dimension corresponds to a spec-
tral channel. This layer allows the model to process and utilize spectral 
information  from  images  for  LULC  classification.  The  input  layer  re-
ceives  input  data from  the  raster  bands  stack  and  passes  them to  the 
subsequent layers of the network. It does not perform any computations 
and serves solely to transmit data further through the network.

of deep learning, a neural network was meticulously trained using these 
datasets.  This  training  process  was  pivotal  in  developing  a  classifier 
capable of accurately identifying various land cover forms based on their 
spectral signatures.

The Convolutional Layer performs the convolution operation, aiding 
in extracting local spatial patterns and features from the input data. Each 
neuron in the convolutional layer is associated with a small region of 
input data called a receptive field. The convolution operation involves 
applying a  convolution kernel to  the receptive field  and computing a 
weighted sum of values. Formally, for each neuron in the convolutional 
layer, the output value can be calculated as follows (Gholamalinezhad 
and Khosravi, 2020):

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps may be required depending on the nature of the dataset. These steps help improve the performance and accuracy of the model by preparing the data in a suitable format. Some common preprocessing techniques include:

1. Data Cleaning: This step involves removing or correcting erroneous, missing, or inconsistent data points within the dataset. This ensures that the model learns from accurate and reliable data.

2. Normalization/Scaling: Deep learning models often work better when all input features have similar scales. Techniques like Min-Max Scaling, Z-Score Normalization, or Log Transformation can be used to rescale feature values between a specific range (usually 0 to 1 or -1 to 1).

3. Feature Selection/Extraction: Selecting relevant features or creating new ones from existing features can significantly impact the model's performance. Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), or other dimensionality reduction methods can be employed to identify important features.

4. Data Augmentation: To increase the size of the dataset and prevent overfitting, synthetic samples can be generated by applying transformations like rotation, flipping, zooming, etc., to the original data.

5. Splitting Dataset: Dividing the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets is crucial for evaluating the model's performance during and after training. A typical split might involve allocating 70% of the data for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing.
