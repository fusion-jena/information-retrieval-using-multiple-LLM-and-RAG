2.3. Data collection

4.5. Opportunities and limitations for monitoring invasive alien plants 

Even though our study is only exploratory, several issues need to be 
emphasised  for  the  general  detection,  mapping,  and  monitoring  of 
invasive alien plants. The process of acquiring data from citizen science 
or social media platforms can be quite easy, either through an API, or 
other  scrapping  methods,  enabling  the  relatively  fast  and  automated 
collection of big digital data. Yet, not all social media and citizen science 
platforms allow data scrapping, according to the terms and conditions of 
use of each platform. Likewise, the use of deep learning can automate 
the process of detecting invasive alien plants from big digital images, 
making  the  monitoring  of  invasive  alien  species  more  time-,  and 
perhaps,  cost-effective  when  looking  into  large  geographic  areas  and 
time  periods,  compared  to  other  conventional  methods  (e.g.,  field

workflow adopted, addressing any biases or ethical concerns associated 
with  deep  learning  applications  and  the  use  of  personal  data.  The 
collaborative  nature  of  our  approach,  where  the  public  contributes 
through citizen-science and social media platforms, can foster a sense of 
shared responsibility, which usually increases the trust in these methods 
(Liberatore et al., 2018).

The last decade has also seen enormous technological advances in 
our  ability to  identify,  access,  and  analyse online  digital  data  (Farley 
et  al.,  2018;  Hampton  et  al.,  2013;  Runting  et  al.,  2020).  The  use  of 
artificial  intelligence,  and  specifically  of  machine  learning  and  deep 
learning  algorithms,  such  as  Convolutional  Neural  Networks  (CNNs), 
have led to significant progress in environmental monitoring from on-
line  digital  images,  including,  for  instance,  the  recognition  and  sur-
veillance of plant diseases (e.g., Abade et al., 2021), the classification of 
land cover (ElQadi et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2017) or the detection and 
classification of animals in camera traps (Tan et al., 2022), requiring a 
low degree of human supervision (Lusch et al., 2018).

Helpful Answer:

The text discusses various methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for ecological studies. One method mentioned is using citizen science or social media platforms to acquire data. This can be done easily through APIs or scraping methods, allowing for quick and automated collection of big digital data. However, it is noted that not all social media and citizen science platforms permit data scraping due to their respective terms and conditions. Another method discussed is utilizing artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning and deep learning algorithms like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to analyze online digital images. These techniques have been applied to tasks such as recognizing plant diseases, classifying land cover, and identifying animals in camera trap images with minimal human supervision.
