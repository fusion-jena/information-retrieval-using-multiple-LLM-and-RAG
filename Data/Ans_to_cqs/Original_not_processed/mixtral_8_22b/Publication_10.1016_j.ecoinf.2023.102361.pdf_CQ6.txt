Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

2.2. Split the datasets 

In this research, the datasets were randomly divided into three parts 
for training, validation and testing. Here, 60% of the data was used to 
train the deep learning models, and 20% of them was kept to validate the 
models. The remaining 20% data was used to evaluate the performance 
of the models. Table 1 show the number of data in the dataset and how 
they are separated for training, testing and validation.

2.6.4. Model training with selected patches 

We trained the same deep learning models as mentioned in Section 
2.5. For training, we resized all the patches of images to a resolution of 
256 × 256 pixels. Although after dividing the image into patches, there 
were images with lower resolution, i.e., 64 × 64 and 128 × 128 pixels, 
they were converted into a uniform size. 

2.6.5. Evaluation of the models 

An image was divided into patches first to predict its class label. Then 
the important patches were selected using the approach mentioned in 
Section 2.6.3. After that, the model predicted the class label for each 
patch. The weighted majority voting technique was used to predict the 
class label of the image from the predicted labels. 

2.7. Experimental setup

VGG16 and VGG19 are classical architectures that are well known 
for  simplicity  and  uniformity.  These  models  are  suitable  for  smaller 
datasets and can provide better accuracy by fine-tuning the pre-trained 
network (Sukegawa et al., 2020). The models have several drawbacks, 
such  as  vanishing  gradient  problems  and  loss  of  fine-grained  spatial 
information (Pan et al., 2020). On the other hand, ResNet-50 contains 
residual  connections,  which  can  overcome  the  vanishing  gradient 
problem and enable training very deep networks. The model performs 
well on both large and small datasets (Al-Masni et al., 2020).

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps may be involved depending on the nature of the data and the specific requirements of the model. In the given context, two main preprocessing steps are mentioned:

1. Data splitting: The datasets are randomly divided into three parts for training, validation, and testing. This is done to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data. In this case, 60% of the data is used for training, 20% for validation, and the remaining 20% for testing.

2. Image patch resizing: All the patches of images are resized to a resolution of 256 x 256 pixels before being fed into the deep learning models. This step ensures that the input dimensions match the expected input shape of the models. It also helps in maintaining consistency across different images and facilitates efficient processing during training.

Other common preprocessing techniques not explicitly mentioned in the given context but often employed in deep learning include:

1. Normalization: Scaling pixel values to a standard range (usually between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1) to improve convergence speed and stability during training.

2. Augmentation: Applying various transformations such as rotation, flipping, zooming, etc., to increase the diversity of the training set and prevent overfitting.

3. Cleaning: Removing noise, outliers, or irrelevant information from the dataset to enhance the quality of the input data.
