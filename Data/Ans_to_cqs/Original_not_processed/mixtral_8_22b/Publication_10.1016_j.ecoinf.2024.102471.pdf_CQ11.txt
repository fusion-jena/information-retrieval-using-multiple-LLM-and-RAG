As machine learning continues to advance, the process of identifying 
bird species can be automated by transferring the knowledge of experts 
in this field to a learning model. A recent study has shown that deep 
learning is an effective method for classifying birds based on their calls, 
such as processing large amounts of audio data, which allows it to detect 
subtle  differences  between  bird's  calls  (Michaud  et  al.,  2023).  Addi-
tionally, deep learning models can be trained on a wide variety of audio 
data,  allowing  them  to  identify  even  rare  ecological  moment  of  bird 
species (Akbal et al., 2022). Transfer learning is an important tool in 
machine learning, allowing models to leverage the knowledge learned 
from  one  domain  and  apply  it  to  another.  Transfer  learning  is  very 
helpful when there is insufficient data to fully train a model, such as 
recognizing  uncommon  bird  species  (Huang  and  Basanta,  2021).

Attention-based  hybrid  CNN-LSTM  is  a  deep  learning-based  archi-
tecture that hybridizes CNN and LSTM with an attention mechanism for 
the classification of audio recordings (Hamdi et al., 2022) (Zhang et al., 
2021).  The  main  advantage  of  an  Attention-based  CNN-LSTM  over  a 
simple CNN-LSTM is that it can focus on the most important parts of the 
input  data  when  making  predictions.  An  Attention-based  model  can 
learn to assign higher weights to the most important parts of the input 
data and lower weights to the less important parts. It can lead to better 
performance, as the model can focus on the most relevant parts of the 
data  instead  of  being  distracted  by  irrelevant  parts.  Furthermore, 
attention-based models can lead to higher interpretability because the 
model  is  more  explicit  about  which  input  data  elements  has  to  pay 
attention.

Wav2vec is one of the latest state-of-art models for Automatic Speech 
Recognition  and  other  audio-related  problems  (Boigne  et  al.,  2020) 
(Shibano et al., 2021). The architecture of the Wav2vec is based on the 
transformer's  encoder,  with  a  training  objective  like  BERT's  masked 
language modelling objective but adapted for speech instead of text. The 
self-supervised  way  of  training  allows  Wav2vec  to  pre-train  on  unla-
belled data, which is more accessible (Hendrycks et al., 2019). Later, the 
model can be fine-tuned on a particular dataset for a specific purpose. 
This  approach  shows  remarkable  improvement  in  the  model's  perfor-
mance, especially if the dataset size is very small with label.
