2.2.6. Experimental design 

In this paper, a sequence of 10 ablation experiments are conducted 
and labelled to evaluate the enhancements made to various components 
of the network architecture. These experiments use 10 different network 
models,  of  which  the  model  of  Experiment  1  is  the  original  YOLOv8 
model, and the remaining nine models are models with different struc-
tures modified on the basis of YOLOv8. 

The experimental training parameter settings are as follows: a batch 
size of 16 is selected, the input image resolution is set at 640 × 640, and 
the number of epochs is specified as 150. The learning rate is set to 0.01, 
and the optimizer is Adam. Additionally, the depth_scale parameter is 
assigned a value of 0.33, while the width_scale parameter is set to 0.25.

Helpful Answer:
After the model training process, there are several postprocessing steps that can be taken depending on the specific requirements of the task or project. Some common postprocessing techniques include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score, and creating confusion matrices.

Saliency maps are visualizations that highlight the regions of an input image that contribute most significantly to the final prediction made by the model. They can provide insights into how the model is making its decisions and help identify any potential biases or errors in the model's reasoning.

Calculating metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score involves comparing the predicted labels generated by the model against the true labels in the dataset. Precision measures the proportion of correct positive predictions among all positive predictions made by the model, while recall measures the proportion of correct positive predictions among all actual positives in the dataset. The F1 score provides a single measure of both precision and recall, taking their harmonic mean.

Confusion matrices are another useful tool for evaluating the performance of a machine learning model. A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the results of a classification problem, showing the number of true positives, false negatives, false positives, and true negatives produced by the model. This information can be used to calculate additional metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.

However, it should be noted that not all of these postprocessing techniques may be relevant or necessary for every project. It ultimately depends on the goals and objectives of the research or application.
