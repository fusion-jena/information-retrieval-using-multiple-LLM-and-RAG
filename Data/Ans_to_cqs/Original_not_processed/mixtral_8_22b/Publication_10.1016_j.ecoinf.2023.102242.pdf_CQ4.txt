refine  the  subsequent  classification  process.  Future  research  should 
focus on this issue to yield more reliable results.

4.4. Classification method

The  processing  of  high-resolution  remote  sensing  data,  which  en-
compasses  a  plethora  of  feature  information  (Girshick  et  al.,  2014), 
demands  significant  time  and  costs.  This  presents  considerable  chal-
lenges for many researchers (Modzelewska et al., 2020). Prior to clas-
sification, samples require training. The representativeness and quantity 
of  these  training  samples  significantly  influence  the  accuracy  of  the 
classification  models.  Platinum  (Ting,  2016)  demonstrated  that  when 
the training samples are not sufficiently typical, other categories can be 
easily misclassified into the sampleâ€™s category. If the number of training 
samples is insufficient, network training may not meet the requirements. 
Conversely, an excessive number of training samples can lead to data 
redundancy, reducing the efficiency of model training (Shi, 2018). To 
address  this  issue,  this  study  employed  feature  optimization  tools  to

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention any specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses the challenges faced during the classification process due to the large amount of feature information present in high-resolution remote sensing data. It also mentions the importance of having representative and sufficient training samples for accurate classification models.

To address these issues, the study employs feature optimization tools, but it does not provide details about what those tools are or if they include data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
