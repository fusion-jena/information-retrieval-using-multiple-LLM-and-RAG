Google Earth Engine  (GEE; Gorelick  et al.,  2017) is  a  cloud-based 
platform 
to  high-performance 
computing with high applicability in wildfire science (e.g. Parks et al., 
2018; Piao et al., 2022; Roteta et al., 2021) because it hosts a vast remote 
sensing  data  catalog  in  the  petabyte  scale,  including  European  Space 
Agency  (ESA)  and  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration 
(NASA) datasets over 40-years. These datasets can be readily processed 
at very large spatial scales using automatic parallel processing (Gorelick 
et al., 2017), taking advantage of advanced image processing techniques 
and machine learning (ML) algorithms (Amani et al., 2020). However, 
JavaScript, Python or R application programming interface (API) and 
the associated interactive development environment (IDE) in GEE still 
requires a high-level technical expertise.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The information provided does not contain details about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate response to this query based on the given context.
