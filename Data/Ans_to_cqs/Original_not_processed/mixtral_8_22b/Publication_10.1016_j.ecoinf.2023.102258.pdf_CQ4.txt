Several systems adopted a prototypical network approach, perhaps 
influenced by the baseline code and/or the outcomes of the 2021 edi-
tion.  Simple  improvements  over  the  baselines  were  achieved  by 
applying data augmentation techniques and intelligent post-processing. 
Better ways to construct the negative prototype were also explored by 
some  teams  who  reported  improved  results  (Liu_Surrey,  XuQianHu_-
NUDT_BIT,  Jung_KT,  Wu_SHNU,  Jung_KT,  Willbo_RISE).  Transductive 
inference—adapting  the  learnt  feature  space  at  test-time  based  on  the 
newly-presented  positive  and  negative  events—was  also  applied  by 
some  participants  (Liu_Surrey,  XuQianHu_NUDT_BIT,  Li_QMUL,  Tan_-
WHU, Zou_PKU).

Query-time adaptation (transductive inference) was shown in mul-
tiple cases to lead to very strong performance, within both the proto-
typical  and  fine-tuning  paradigms.  This  comes  at  a  cost  of  added 
complexity  and  added  query-time  computation,  since  typically  a  new 
run of statistical optimisation must be performed for a new query task. 
Thus, from the present results we can recommend that a system should 
include query-time adaptation for the best possible detections, but that a 
system without query-time adaptation should be a widespread default. 
Such fixed embeddings can easily be used off-the-shelf, in the same way 
that  other  pretrained  networks  are  now  commonly  downloaded  and 
used.  The  DFSL  method  employed  by  Wu_SHNU  is  an  alternative 
approach  which  combines  an  unchanging  feature  extraction  with  a 
query-time  adaptive  weighting.  This  combines  stability  with  dynamic 
adaptation, and thus is worthy of further investigation.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific details about the exact data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that simple improvements over the baselines were achieved by applying data augmentation techniques. Data augmentation techniques generally refer to methods used to increase the amount of training data by creating modified versions of the original dataset. Common examples include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, and adding noise. These techniques help improve model generalization and prevent overfitting. Without explicit information, one cannot definitively state which specific data augmentation techniques were used in this case.
