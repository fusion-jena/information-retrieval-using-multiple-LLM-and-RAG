Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

In ecology in particular, there is a growing interest in deep learning for automatizing repetitive
analyses on large amounts of images, such as identifying plant and animal species, distinguishing
individuals of the same or different species, counting individuals or detecting relevant features
(Christin, Hervet, and Lecomte 2019; Lamba et al. 2019; Weinstein 2018). By saving hours of manual
data analyses and tapping into massive amounts of data that keep accumulating with technological
advances, deep learning has the potential to become an essential tool for ecologists and applied
statisticians.

Here, we showcase a full why-what-how workflow in R using a case study on the structure of an
ecological community (a set of co-occurring species) composed of the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx)
and its two main preys. First, we introduce the case study and motivate the need for deep learning.
Second we illustrate deep learning for the identification of animal species in large amounts of images,
including model training and validation with a dataset of labelled images, and prediction with a
new dataset of unlabelled images. Last, we proceed with the quantification of spatial co-occurrence
using statistical models.

With the rapid advances in technologies for biodiversity monitoring (Lahoz-Monfort and Magrath
2021), the possibility of analysing large amounts of images makes deep learning appealing to
ecologists. We hope that our proposal of a reproducible R workflow for deep learning and statistical
ecology will encourage further studies in the integration of these disciplines, and contribute to the
adoption of computer vision by ecologists.

6 Appendix: Reproducible example of species identification on

camera trap images with CPU

In this section, we go through a reproducible example of the entire deep learning workflow, including
data preparation, model training, and automatic labeling of new images. We used a subsample of
467 images from the original dataset in the Jura county to allow the training of our model with CPU
on a personal computer. We also used 14 images from the original dataset in the Ain county to
illustrate prediction.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a specific random seed value. However, it can be inferred that the authors might have controlled for randomness during their experiments by fixing the random seed values before running their code. This practice ensures that results are reproducible and comparable across multiple runs. Additionally, techniques like cross-validation and bootstrapping could be employed to assess the robustness of the models against variations due to randomness.
