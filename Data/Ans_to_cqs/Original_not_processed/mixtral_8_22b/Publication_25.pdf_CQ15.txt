combined with labeled data in a semi-supervised framework (sensu [14]), which may improve deep
learning on limited training data by providing neural networks the opportunity to learn generalized
features on a wider array of training examples, followed by retraining on a smaller number of high
quality annotations [16]. It is unknown whether moderate to low quality annotations can be used
to generate trees for initial model training, given the imperfect nature of existing unsupervised tree
delimitation approaches.

for learning both bounding boxes and image classes. Retinanet diﬀers from other object detection
frameworks, such as RCNN, by combining object detection and classiﬁcation into a single network.
This allows for faster training and it decreases the sensitivity to the number of box proposals among
the images [25]. We used a resnet-50 classiﬁcation backbone that was pretrained on the ImageNet
dataset [27]. We experimented with deeper architectures (resnet-101 and resnet-152), but found no
improvement where oﬀset increased the training time.

The challenge for applying deep learning to natural systems is the need for large training datasets.
A lack of training data is a pervasive problem in remote sensing due to the cost of data collection
and annotation [13]. In addition, the spatial extent of training data often prohibits the ﬁeld-based
veriﬁcation of annotated objects. For tree detection, the high variation in tree crown appearance, due
to taxonomy, health status, and human management, increases the risk of overﬁtting when using small
amounts of training data [10]. One approach to addressing the data limitation in deep learning is
“self-supervised learning” (sensus [14]), which uses unsupervised methods to generate training data
that is used to train supervised models [15]. This approach has recently been applied to remote sensing
for hyperspectral image classiﬁcation [9]. Self-supervision, which only relies on unlabeled data, can be

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about specific optimization techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, there are some indications of optimization strategies employed.

For instance, the use of a pre-trained ResNet-50 classification backbone suggests transfer learning, a technique that leverages knowledge gained from solving one problem to solve another related problem. This can help optimize the learning process by reducing the amount of training needed.

Additionally, the mention of self-supervised learning indicates another optimization strategy. Self-supervised learning involves generating training data using unsupervised methods, which can then be used to train supervised models. This approach can help overcome limitations in labeled data, thereby optimizing the learning process.

Lastly, the choice of RetinaNet as the object detection framework also implies optimization considerations. RetinaNet combines object detection and classification into a single network, allowing for faster training and reduced sensitivity to the number of box proposals among images.
