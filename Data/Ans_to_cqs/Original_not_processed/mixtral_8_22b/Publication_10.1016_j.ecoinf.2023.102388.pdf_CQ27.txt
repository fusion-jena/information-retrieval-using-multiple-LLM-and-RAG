• No-overfitting. In this setting, the optimization algorithm of CNNs is 
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), with a learning rate of 0.0001 
and a weight decay of 0.5. The batch size is set to 32, the number of 
training epochs to 200 and finally the batch-norm and dropout (0.5) 
are used to reduce the overfitting level.  

• Overfitting.  We  use  the  same  hyperparameters  setting  as  the  no- 
overfitting  but  we  remove  the  use  of  batch-norm,  weight  decay 
and dropout techniques to ensure that the model overfits.

The traditional way of training machine learning models normally 
aims at avoiding the overfitting phenomenon (Ravoor and T.S.B., 2020; 
Santos and Papa, 2022). Indeed, the main concern about overfitting is 
that it occurs when the model performs well on the training data but 
generalizes  poorly  on  unseen  samples  (i.e.,  test  set).  In  the  privacy 
domain,  overfitting  has  also  been  shown  to  make  the  model  more 
vulnerable to privacy attacks as it results in the model memorizing more 
information  about  the  training  set  (Shokri  et  al.,  2017;  Song  et  al., 
2019).

3.2.1.1. Training process. Dtrain  is the training dataset, which is used for 
training the target model using the learning algorithm A. In contrast, DS 
functions as the attack dataset, completely separate from the training 
dataset  Dtrain,  and  consists  of  data  points  drawn  from  the  same  data 
distribution as the training samples in Dtrain. The adversary first trains 
the attack model using the attack training dataset DS  and the learning 
algorithm A, in such as way that the attack model mimics the behavior of 
the target model. T is the attack test dataset that is assumed to be both 
disjoint  from  Ds  and  Dtrain,  in  the  sense  that  it  is  composed  by  non- 
member  individuals  never  seen  before  by  Ds  and  Dtrain.  Once  the 
training of the attack model is finished, the adversary proceeds to query 
the  attack  model  using  both  the  attack  training  and  test  datasets, 
extracting  the  resulting  prediction  vectors  for  each  data  point.  More

prominent  in  demanding  tasks  like  the  re-identification  of  marine 
mammals in underwater environments. 

The  challenge  of  generalization  often  arises  as  a  consequence  of 
network overfitting during the training phase. In simplified terms, the 
network’s  weight  parameters  are  adjusted to  optimize  their  fit  to  the 
provided training examples, thus effectively “memorizing” the training 
data. However, when applied to new and unseen data during testing, the 
network’s  response  exhibits  a  more  balanced  consideration  of  the 
diverse training examples. This discrepancy frequently leads to dimin-
ished performance on the test dataset and might persist even after the 
network  has undergone  prolonged training over  numerous epochs.  In 
recent  years,  significant  research  endeavors  have  been  dedicated  to 
mitigating overfitting challenges to enhance model generalization.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given context, there isn't enough information to provide a detailed answer regarding the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. Typically, once a deep learning model is trained, it can be serialized or saved into a file format that can be loaded later for making predictions. Commonly used formats include.h5,.onnx,.pb, etc. Depending on the platform where the model will be deployed, additional steps may be required, such as converting the model to a different format or optimizing it for better performance. Popular platforms for deploying deep learning models include TensorFlow Serving, ONNX Runtime, AWS SageMaker, Google Cloud AI Platform, Azure Machine Learning, etc. Each platform offers its own unique features and benefits, so the choice depends on factors such as cost, ease of use, scalability, integration with other services, etc. However, without further details about the specific scenario, I cannot provide a more precise answer.
