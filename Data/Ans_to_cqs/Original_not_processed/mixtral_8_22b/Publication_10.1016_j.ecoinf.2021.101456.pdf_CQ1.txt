Given unlabelled input data consisting of N samples with F features, 
x ∈ ℝN×F,  the  probabilistic  encoder  of  a  VAE  maps  the  input  to  the 
posterior density p(z|x) over the latent variable, z ∈ ℝN×L. In practice, 
L << N and the encoder neural network approximates the true posterior 
density, p(z|x), with a multivariate Gaussian, qθ(z|x) ∼ 𝒩 (μθ, σ2
θ ). The 
decoder of a VAE reconstructs the input data from the latent variable 
and is given by the density function pφ(x|z). The encoder and decoder 
neural networks are parameterised by θ  and φ, respectively. The opti-
mization objective of a VAE consists of two competing terms and it can 
be shown to be (Kingma and Welling, 2014)

dataset  recorded  at  a  different  location  and  was  gradually  expanded 
until  reconstructions  were  sufficiently  good.  In  order  to  visualize  the 
latent  representation,  the  size  of  the  bottleneck  of  the  model  (latent 
dimension) was limited to two. Details of the network architecture are 
reported in Table 1.

3.2. Semi-supervised clustering 

Using a small subset of labelled data that optimizes a relevant loss 
could steer learning of representations that are more expressive for the 
downstream tasks under consideration. One approach to achieve this is 
to introduce auxiliary tasks  based on the labelled data, resulting  in a 
semi-supervised learning setup (Figueroa and Rivera, 2017).

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the use of Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) for processing and analyzing data. It also mentions the use of a dataset recorded at a different location, which suggests that the data could have been collected using various methods such as sensors or surveys. Additionally, the context refers to a study that uses polarization lidar measurements of honey bees in flight for locating land mines, indicating that sensor data may have been used in that particular case. Overall, while the exact method of data collection is not specified in the provided context, it implies that various methods such as sensors, surveys, or public datasets could potentially be used depending on the application.
