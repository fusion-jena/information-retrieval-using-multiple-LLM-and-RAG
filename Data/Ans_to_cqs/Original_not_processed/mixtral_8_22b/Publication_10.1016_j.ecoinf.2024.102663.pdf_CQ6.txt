4.2.1. Experimental results for the proposed method before and after 
preprocessing

Furthermore,  the  introduction  of  deep  learning  techniques  to  pre-
processing under extreme conditions such as low light, extreme occlu-
sion, or overlapping of fish can address unique challenges by tailoring 
datasets to specific use cases and training deep learning models on these 
datasets. Incorporating Bidirectional LSTM with GloVe (Abualigah et al., 
2024; Chen et al., 2020) embeddings could enhance the detection and 
classification of fish species within the dataset, capturing contextual and 
semantic information that improves the accuracy of fish biomass esti-
mates. Continuing to modify the architecture of deep learning models 
like YOLO, to better suit specific requirements, includes altering various 
parts of the architecture as needed to handle different environmental 
factors, such as salinity, which affect fish biomass.

Random Forest Regressor exhibits the longest training time. However, 
the potential improvement in performance may warrant the investment 
of additional effort. Performance of Linear Regression, Lasso, and Ridge 
models is deemed unsatisfactory despite their efficient training times.

Helpful Answer: The paper discusses several preprocessing methods used before training a deep learning model like YOLOv8. These include white balance, gamma correction, sharpening, dehazing, denoising, and CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization). White balance adjusts colors in an image to give a more natural look, while gamma correction changes the overall brightness of an image. Sharpening enhances the edges of objects in an image, making them appear clearer. Dehazing removes haze from images, improving visibility. Denoising reduces noise in images, and CLAHE improves contrast in images. These preprocessing steps help improve the quality of input data, leading to better performance of the deep learning model.
