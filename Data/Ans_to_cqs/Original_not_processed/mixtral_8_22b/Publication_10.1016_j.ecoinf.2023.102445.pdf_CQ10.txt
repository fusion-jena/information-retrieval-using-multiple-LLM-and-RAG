Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

In addition, Luca Ciampi et al. proposed a model-independent deep 
learning-based modular counting pipeline for estimating the number of 
insects present in images of colour-changing sticky traps and performing 
detailed  analysis  of  counting  metrics  (Ciampi  et  al.,  2023),  which  is 
worthy of recognition. However, when using this method, it still needs 
to be combined with other deep learning algorithms, so how to make the 
deep learning algorithm model balance speed, accuracy and lightweight 
performance at the same time is still a major challenge.
