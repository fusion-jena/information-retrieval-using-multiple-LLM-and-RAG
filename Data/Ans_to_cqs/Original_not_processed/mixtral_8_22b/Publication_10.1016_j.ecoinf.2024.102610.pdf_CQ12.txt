expected that creating a mask to delineate the “area of applicability” for 
the trained model (Meyer and Pebesma, 2021) would successfully filter 
out a significant portion of regions lacking training data, particularly in

The attained performance of the trained models (R2  values ranging 
from 0.38 to 0.41) demonstrates the potential for predicting tsetse fly 
relative numbers using machine learning methodologies. Our analysis 
indicates that using environmental and weather data near the period of 
tsetse monitoring yields more accurate predictions compared to longer- 
term averages. When extrapolating tsetse number predictions based on 
different  sets  of  predictors,  significant  disparities  emerge.  VSURF- 
retained variables of 2021 reveal pronounced tsetse hotspots (>6 FTD) 
within  known  tsetse  belts  (McCord  et  al.,  2012).  On  the  other  hand, 
predictions based on RFE-retained variables did not identify prominent 
hotspots,  and  most  of  these  predictions  fell  outside  the  range  of  the 
environmental and weather data used for model training. Notably, for 
RFE-retained variables and VSURF long-term variables, extrapolations

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it does not provide information about the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. The paper by Keshavamurthy et al. (2022) discusses a systematic review of machine learning and deep learning approaches for predicting infectious diseases but does not specify which particular deep learning model was employed. Similarly, Khun (2022) provides details about classification and regression training using the package 'caret,' but no mention is made regarding any specific deep learning architecture such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers. Therefore, without additional context, we cannot determine what kind of deep learning model is utilized in the pipeline.
