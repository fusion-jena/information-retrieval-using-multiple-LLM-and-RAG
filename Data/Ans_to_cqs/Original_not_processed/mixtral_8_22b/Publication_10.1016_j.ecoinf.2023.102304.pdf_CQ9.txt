Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not include details about a specific deep learning pipeline or its associated data repository. Therefore, it is not possible to determine where the data repository of such a pipeline might be located. Some common repositories for sharing research data include Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, and GBIF, but without more specific information, it cannot be determined if any of these are used for this particular case.
