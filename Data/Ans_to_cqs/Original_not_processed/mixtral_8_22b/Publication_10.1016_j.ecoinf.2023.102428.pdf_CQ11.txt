2.5. Model description 

2.5.1. MLPnn-MC modelling 

MLPnn-MC  modelling  integrates  the  multi-layer  perceptron  (MLP) 
algorithm  and  Markov  chain,  which  unravels  robust  future  LULC 
simulation (Gebresellase et al., 2023; Nasiri et al., 2019). The novelty of 
this model lies in the fact that it utilises deep machine learning to learn 
the model in automated mode in less calibration time through complex, 
multivariate, and non-linear relationships to create several transitions 
and predict unseen data within the model at a single time by compre-
hending the hidden relationships (Kumar and Agrawal, 2023). MLP is 
the  most  prevalent  machine  learning  algorithm  in  ANN  (Artificial 
Neural Network) modelling (Alla et al., 2021; Band et al., 2020), which 
uses  back  propagation  (BP)  or  the  reverse  method  of  automatic

2.3. Research design and data processing 

The research workflow of the study is organised into three stages, 
viz., data processing and classification, change detection and prediction, 
and  valuation  of  C  sequestration.  At  the  first  stage,  pre-processing  of

Mission for Sustaining the Himalayan Eco-system. This is one of eight 
missions under the National Action Plan for Climate Change (NAPCC). 
Moreover, the National Mission for a Green India under NAPCC also puts 
special emphasis on the forestry sector for enhancing the resilience and 
adaptation capacity of forests against climate change (Negi, 2018).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide a direct link to the data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in this study. However, based on the given context, we can infer that the authors might have used publicly accessible datasets from sources such as USGS EarthExplorer [2] and OpenStreetMap [3]. To find more specific details about the dataset used in this study, I recommend checking the original paper or reaching out to the corresponding author(s) directly.
