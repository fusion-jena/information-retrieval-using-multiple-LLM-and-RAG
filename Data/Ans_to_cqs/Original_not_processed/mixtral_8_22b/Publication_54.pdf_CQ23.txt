IV. EXPERIMENTAL SETTINGS
To extract the relevant features of birds, we randomly split
the endemic bird data into 3,132 images for training and
760 images for testing. To allow the deep networks to con-
verge and improve the ability of the model to generalize
adeptly, we augmented the training dataset 10 times, resulting
in a total of 31,320 images. Then, 25,056 (80%) images were
used for training and 6,264 (20%) were used for validation.
The Inception-ResNet-v2 model was trained using the mini-
batch gradient descent algorithm with the batch size set to
32 and the learning rate maintained at 0.0001. The Adam
optimizer was used to ﬁne-tune the model with the following
parameters:

• Exponential decay rate of ﬁrst-moment estimation

of 0.9.

C. MULTISTAGE MODEL VALIDATION
The aim of this work was to incorporate a strong backbone
network architecture of transfer learning that can facilitate
the learning and transfer diverse domain-invariant features
from different datasets to a uniﬁed feature space to classify
endemic bird images of new datasets with high classiﬁcation
accuracy. The deep learning method is systematically man-
aged with a multilayered neural network (NN) in which the
layers are densely interconnected. To select the best model
hyperparameter, a large dataset is required. The collected data
are split into two sets: a training set and test set. Typically,
the test set is a holdout dataset used to evaluate how well the
model has been trained, indicating the importance of the input
value. Then, from the training dataset, T% of the dataset is set
as the training set and the rest of the dataset (100 − T)% is set
as the validation set, where T is a ﬁxed number (say 70 or 80).

3. Furthermore, to enhance the performance and decrease
overﬁtting in the selected model, we proposed a mech-
anism to swap the training and validation misclassiﬁed
datasets. Then, we retrained the model until it yielded
the highest accuracy possible on the validation and test
datasets. Additionally, ﬁve-fold cross-validation was
employed to verify the predictive performance of the
model.

Thus, through the monitoring and identiﬁcation of endemic
birds in their habitats and estimating the size of their popula-
tions, the proposed system can help conserve biodiversity.

Helpful Answer:

To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the endemic bird data was randomly split into 3,132 images for training and 760 images for testing. This allowed the model to learn from a diverse range of examples, improving its ability to generalize adequately. Secondly, the training dataset was augmented ten times, resulting in a total of 31,320 images. Data augmentation techniques such as rotation, scaling, and flipping were likely applied to increase the diversity of the training data further. Thirdly, the Inception-ResNet-v2 model was trained using the mini-batch gradient descent algorithm with a batch size of 32 and a learning rate of 0.0001. The Adam optimizer was also employed to fine-tune the model. Fourthly, a mechanism was proposed to swap the training and validation misclassified datasets. By doing so, the model could be retrained to correct any errors made during the initial training phase, thereby enhancing its overall performance. Lastly, five-fold cross-validation was utilized to verify the predictive performance of the model. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into k subsets or folds, then training the model on k-1 folds while validating it on the remaining fold. This process is repeated k times, each time with a different fold serving as the validation set. By averaging the results obtained from each iteration, a more robust estimate of the model's performance can be achieved. Overall, these measures helped to ensure that the deep learning model could accurately classify endemic bird species across various datasets, thus contributing to the conservation of biodiversity.
