method offers the best performance and robust results of Maxent models

The  following  parameters  were  used  in  Maxent:  random  seed; 
remove  duplicate  presence  records;  write  plot  data;  regularisation 
multiplier (obtained from ENMeval analysis); 5000 maximum iterations, 
this value was increased to 5000 to allow the model time to converge 
(Bulgarella et al., 2014); 10,000 background points obtained by using 
buffer distance from observation points (further details in the ENMeval 
analysis in Appendixes 1 and 2); cloglog format, i.e., this output appears 
to  be  the  most  appropriate  for  estimating  the  probability  of  presence

type selected as bootstrap, i.e., replicate sample sets chosen by sampling 
with replacement. We choose bootstrap as the replicated run type as this

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, there is no direct mention of specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization used in a deep learning pipeline to prevent overfitting. However, we can infer that some form of regularization has been applied based on the use of a regularization multiplier in the Maxent modeling process. The regularization multiplier is a parameter used in Maxent to control the strength of regularization, which helps prevent overfitting by penalizing complex models. In this case, the regularization multiplier was obtained through ENMeval analysis, which is a tool used to evaluate and select optimal settings for species distribution models like Maxent. While not explicitly stated, it is possible that the regularization multiplier could have been derived from techniques similar to L2 regularization, where a penalty term is added to the loss function during optimization. Nonetheless, without further information, it cannot be confirmed if other common regularization methods like dropout were employed in the deep learning pipeline.
