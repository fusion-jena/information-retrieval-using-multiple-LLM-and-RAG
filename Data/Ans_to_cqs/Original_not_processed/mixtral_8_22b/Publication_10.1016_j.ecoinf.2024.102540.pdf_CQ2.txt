Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Boosting, 
and Random Trees (Yang et al., 2010). However, a growing subarea in 
machine learning, called deep learning, can leverage large image data-
sets  to train  deep neural networks such as  Convolutional Neural  Net-
works (CNNs) (Jordan and Mitchell, 2015) to make accurate predictions 
on new, unseen images.

2.3. Imagery splitting ratio 

We split the dataset in a ratio of 80:10:10 for training, validation, and 
testing sets, respectively. This ratio was used due to prior evidence of 
exceed performances in detecting small insects and diseases using deep 
learning models (Kiratiratanapruk et al., 2022; Krishnadas and Sampa-
thila, 2021; Mulchandani et al., 2019). The training dataset consisted of 
1543 images, 243 images for the validation set, and 247 images for the 
testing set and all were at input resolution of 640 × 640 pixels. The 1280 
× 1280 pixels input resolution consisted of 1637 images for the training 
set, 255 images for the validation set, and 262 images for the testing set. 
Independently,  we  trained  5  different  versions  of  the  YOLOv5  model 
family  including:  YOLOv5n,  YOLOv5s,  YOLOv5m,  YOLOv5l,  and 
YOLOv5x models to detect alates on sorghum leaves.

using  the  Common  Objects  in  Context  (COCO)  dataset  for  training 
(Ultralytics, 2023). As the YOLOv5 version increases from nano towards 
extra-large,  the  file  size  and  processing  time  increases  (Ultralytics, 
2023). 

consisted of a NVIDIA A100 GPU from Google's cloud server integrated 
with an open-source Python notebook available based on the YOLOv5 
family repository by Ultralytics and Roboflow (Dwyer and Nelson, 2022; 
Ultralytics, 2023).

3. Results 

Out of the YOLOv5 family of detection models, the YOLOv5x model 
performed the highest with a precision of 84%, a recall of 86.90%, and 
90.40% mAP@0.5 (Table 1). The trained models using images at 1280 
× 1280 pixel input resolution performed higher than those using a 640 
× 640 pixel input resolution based on the calculated metrics. Therefore, 
we focused on the  trained models with images  at 1280 × 1280  pixel 
input resolution for the remainder of the results. 

YOLOv5x had the highest precision of 84%, and only <1% lower for 
the YOLOv5l detection model (Table 1). The recall and mAP@0.5 were

Helpful Answer:
The study primarily focuses on using deep learning models for detecting alates on sorghum leaves. Based on the given information, it is clear that the authors use image datasets for their research. Specifically, they mention using images at input resolutions of 640 x 640 pixels and 1280 x 1280 pixels. They also discuss training five different versions of the YOLOv5 model family, which is known for object detection tasks in images. Furthermore, they reference the Common Objects in Context (COCO) dataset, which is a popular benchmark dataset for image recognition tasks. Given this context, it can be concluded that the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is images.
