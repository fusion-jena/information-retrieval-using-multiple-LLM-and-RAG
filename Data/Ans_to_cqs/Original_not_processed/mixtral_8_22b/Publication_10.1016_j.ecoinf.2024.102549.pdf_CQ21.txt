features; ReLU (The Rectified Linear Unit) refers to the activation function, which is used to perform nonlinear mapping of the output results of the convolutional 
layer; the pooling layer (this study uses max pooling) is used to reduce the dimension of the feature map; the fully connected layers are used to classify input images 
into labels.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the project. In this case, some possible postprocessing steps include calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, creating saliency maps to visualize the important features learned by the model, and generating a confusion matrix to evaluate the performance of the model.

According to Fig. 4, the accuracy comparison of different pixels was conducted, and the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of the final selected 21 pixels were calculated. Additionally, a confusion matrix of the 21 pixels was generated to further assess the performance of the model. These postprocessing steps provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the model and help improve its overall performance.
