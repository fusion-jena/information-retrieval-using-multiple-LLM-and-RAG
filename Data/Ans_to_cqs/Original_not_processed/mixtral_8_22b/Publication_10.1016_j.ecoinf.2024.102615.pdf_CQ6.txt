After reviewing the literature, the default model was determined as 
the starting point for exploring MLP modeling. The specific structural 
parameters  of  the  default  MLP  model  can  be  referred  to  (Fine  et  al., 
2020). After optimization, the optimal MLP model was used to predict 
soil  Mn  content.  Table  2  briefly  summarizes  the  optimal  network 
structure  and  parameters.  Briefly,  the  batch  normalization  technique 
was used to accelerate the learning process (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015), 
after which the dropout was employed to mitigate model overfitting. To 
train the MLP model, we applied the Adam optimizer with a learning 
rate of 0.0001, and used a batch size of 32 (Khan et al., 2020). The ReLu 
activation function was used in the network architecture and the early 
stopping mechanism was used to minimize overfitting (Prechelt, 1998).

2.3. Model optimization 

The model performance optimization process is broadly divided into 
two stages, as shown in Fig. 3. The R value of the validation set is used as 
the performance indicator during the optimization process, whereby R is 
maximized  using  the  grid  search  method.  During  the  first  stage,  the 
neural network structure and the number of neurons in the hidden layers 
are  adjusted.  In  total,  60  sets  of  combinations,  including  one  to  five 
hidden layers and neurons with a range of 64â€“2048 (nth  power of 2), 
were considered. The second stage involves adjusting the percentage of 
the dropout layers, the learning rate, and the batch size, to achieve a 
total of 192 combinations (4*4*3*4).

ment ranges were determined based on a review of existing literature 
(Chien, 1994; Peng et al., 2022; Shen et al., 2022; Srivastava et al., 2014; 
Wilson and Martinez, 2001; Zhang et al., 2019). The following hyper-
parameters  were  selected  to  optimize  the  MLP  network  architecture: 
number  of  neural  network  layers,  number  of  neurons  per  layer,  per-
centage values of the dropout layers, learning rate, and batch size. The 
specific tuning ranges of these hyperparameters are shown in Table 1. 
Each  set  of  parameters  in  Table  2  was  trained  based  on  a  set  of 
training data (80%) and verified using validation data (10%). The re-
sults of each group of parameters represent the average of ten experi-
ments (Tsimpouris et al., 2021), and the data were shuffled each time. 
Because the calculations are binary, the number of neuron nodes in the 
network architecture was set to the nth  power of 2 (Peng et al., 2022). In

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model such as the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model mentioned in the given context, several preprocessing steps may be involved depending on the nature of the dataset. However, based on the provided information, two main preprocessing techniques have been utilized:

1) Normalization: The text mentions the use of the 'Batch Normalization' technique, which is a type of normalization method used in deep learning models. This technique helps to stabilize the learning process and reduce the training time by normalizing the inputs in every mini-batch. It does this by making the mean activation close to zero and the activation variance close to one.

2) Dropout: Dropout is another preprocessing step used in deep learning models to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data due to memorizing the training data instead of generalizing from it. By randomly dropping out or ignoring some neurons during training, dropout encourages the network to distribute the learned features across all neurons, thereby reducing overfitting.

While not explicitly stated in the provided context, other common preprocessing steps might include data cleaning (removing missing or inconsistent data), feature scaling (adjusting the scale of independent variables so they fall within a similar range), and encoding categorical variables (converting qualitative data into quantitative data). These steps help improve the accuracy and efficiency of the deep learning model.
