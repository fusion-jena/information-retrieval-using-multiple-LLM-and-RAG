The second approach we used to extract embeddings was from the 
pre-trained  BirdNET  model.  The  original  version  of  the  model  was

We used three different deep-learning architectures to extract em-
beddings from the female calls. The first that we used, VGGish, is a CNN 
based upon Configuration A of the VGG image classification model with 
11 weight layers (Simonyan, 2015). VGGish was trained by Google to 
perform  general-purpose  audio  classification  using  a  preliminary 
version of the YouTube-8 M dataset (Abu-El-Haija et al., 2016). Once 
trained,  the  final  classification  layer  was  removed  from  the  network, 
leaving  a  128-dimensional  acoustic  feature  embedding  as  the  CNN 
output. To input the sound files into the VGGish model, we converted 
the  waveforms  to  Mel-spectrograms  (Rabiner  and  Schafer,  2010),  a 
signal representation derived from the spectrogram that substitutes the 
normal frequency scale with the nonlinear Mel scale, taken from 20th- 
century  psychoacoustics  studies  that  explored  the  relationship  be-

We expected higher performance of the embeddings, but a possible 
limitation to our study may be the use of pre-trained CNNs. This may 
have limited the potential performance of using embedding from neural 
networks.  Interestingly,  higher  classification  accuracy was  seen  when 
using  BirdNET,  a  CNN  trained  on  audio  data  of  bird  vocalizations  in 
comparison  with  VGGish  and  Wav2Vec  2.0,  two  models  trained 
respectively on a vast Youtube audio dataset and a human speech audio 
dataset. This suggests that training a model with data input of gibbon 
vocalizations might result in an even better performance of neural net-
works for individual gibbon discrimination. However, such data training 
requires a large dataset and is very computationally costly, hence why 
we chose to test pre-trained CNNs.

contribute  to  larger  data  input  for  future  training  of  deep  learning 
models (Best  et  al., 2023).  Accordingly, the  rapid growth of  artificial 
intelligence  and  deep  learning  methods  could  bring  about  important 
innovations related to feature extraction and classification with the aim 
of overcoming the current challenges halting the use of PAM for indi-
vidual acoustic discrimination and succeeding in a sustained and non- 
invasive monitoring of animal populations.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't any explicit mention of specific data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotation, or scaling being applied in the given context. Data augmentation techniques are often employed to increase the amount of training data available by applying random transformations to existing data, thereby creating new samples. These techniques can help improve the robustness and generalization capabilities of machine learning models. However, without more information, it cannot be confirmed whether these particular techniques were utilized in this case.
