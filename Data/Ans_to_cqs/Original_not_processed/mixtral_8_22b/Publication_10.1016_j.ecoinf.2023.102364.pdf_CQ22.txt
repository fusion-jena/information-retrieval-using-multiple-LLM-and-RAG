and its meaning. Whereas individual model fits and predictor ranks, for 
instance, are less relevant for defining a real-world synergy relationship 
between predictor and response variables; it’s inference is widely biased 
(e.g. Humphries et al., 2018 and citations within). Categorical predictors 
tend to be favored in such ranking exercises, with “greedy” algorithms 
grabbing most of the variance before considering continuous predictors 
(Friedman, 2002). In the meantime, the socio-ecological predictors act 
on the U.S. census block scale and show less spatial resolution and thus, 
power. This deserves a re-visit with more fine-scaled data.

3.3. Model assessment 

Model  performance  was  assessed  internally  (ROC  curves)  and 
externally (field testing dataset). Internally, the model ROC curves for 
each  individual algorithm  range between  75  and  85%  (Table  4).  The 
average ROC value across the ensemble is 71%. Externally, we mapped 
the 2013 Presence/Absence data cube on the rasterized heatmap. A vi-
sual  assessment  can  be  made  by  comparing  actual  presence/absence 
data points to predicted RIO scores, with a general alignment of the two, 
indicating a robust, moderate-high model performance (Fig. 10). 

Put  Table  4  app  here:  ROC  values  for  algorithms  of  the  machine 

learning ensembles. 

Put Fig. 10: a) Model assessment data of alternative 80 locations for 
spring  2013  (Fig.  3)  overlaid  over  the  predicted  RIO  for  Short-billed 
Gulls based on a machine learning ensemble (Fig. 4). b) Map as below 
but binary classification (black is presence, grey is absence).

Helpful Answer:
The article mentions that the performance of the model was evaluated both internally and externally. For internal evaluation, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were used for each individual algorithm, ranging from 75% to 85%. The average ROC value across the ensemble was 71%. For external evaluation, the 2013 Presence/Absence data cube was mapped onto the rasterized heatmap. Visual assessment was done by comparing actual presence/absence data points to predicted Relative Importance Output (RIO) scores. The alignment of these two indicated a robust, moderate-high model performance. However, the article does not explicitly mention the use of specific metrics like accuracy, precision, or recall for evaluating the performance of the deep learning model.
