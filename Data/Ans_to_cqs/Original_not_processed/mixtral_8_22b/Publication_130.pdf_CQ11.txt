tlenecks preventing the application of deep learning for individual identification 

is the need to collect and identify hundreds to thousands of individually labelled 

pictures to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

Philetairus socius, the great tit Parus major and the zebra finch Taeniopygia guttata, 

representing both wild and captive contexts.

allowing the construction of training datasets consisting of hundreds of images per

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The article does not explicitly mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the setup details are available at <https://github.com/AndreCFerreira/Bird_individualID>. This GitHub repository might contain the necessary code and instructions for implementing the described methods. Please note that I am an AI language model and cannot directly access or verify links. It would be best to check the mentioned URL for further information.
