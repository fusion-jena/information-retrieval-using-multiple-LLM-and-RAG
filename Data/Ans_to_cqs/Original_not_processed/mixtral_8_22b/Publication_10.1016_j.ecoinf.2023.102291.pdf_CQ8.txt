size of 32. The most suitable architecture was chosen based on the best 
validation accuracy (proportion of all correct predictions) and precision 
(number of true positives divided by true positives and false positives) 
obtained during training. The model training and prediction procedures 
were  executed  on  Microsoft  Azure  using  instance  NV12s  v3  with  12 
vCPUs and 112 GB RAM. The CNNs were implemented using Tensor-
Flow (Abadi et al., 2016) and Python 3. The Ubuntu 20.04 operating 
system was used and obtained via the Ubuntu 20.04 Data Science Virtual 
Machine  on  Microsoft  Azure.  The  algorithm  scripts  are  available  in 
Supporting Information B.

Question: %INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the provided pieces of context to answer the query in less than 400 words. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

%Query
Query: "Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information regarding the specific code repository where the deep learning pipeline is available is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. However, it does state that the algorithm scripts are available in Supporting Information B. This suggests that the code might be included within the supplementary materials accompanying the research paper or article. Unfortunately, without further details, I cannot provide a direct link to the code repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. It would be necessary to access the original source material or contact the authors directly for more precise information about the location of the code repository.
