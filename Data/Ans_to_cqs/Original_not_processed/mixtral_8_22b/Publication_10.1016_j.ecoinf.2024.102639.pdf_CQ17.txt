Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, it appears that the study primarily focuses on using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and a Principal Component Analysis-Support Vector Machine (PCA-SVM) hybrid approach for analyzing zebrafish and rat movements within T-maze environments. However, the context does not provide explicit information about the use of regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization in the deep learning pipeline.

Nevertheless, based on the broader knowledge of deep learning techniques, we can discuss some common regularization methods used to prevent overfitting:

1. Dropout: A technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps reduce interdependent learning among neurons.

2. L2 Regularization: Also known as weight decay, this method adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of all the weights in the network. It encourages smaller weights, leading to simpler models and reduced overfitting.

3. Early Stopping: Monitoring the validation set performance during training and stopping when the performance starts degrading is another way to prevent overfitting.

However, since the context does not explicitly mention any of these regularization methods being employed in the deep learning pipeline, it cannot be confirmed if they were utilized in this particular study.
