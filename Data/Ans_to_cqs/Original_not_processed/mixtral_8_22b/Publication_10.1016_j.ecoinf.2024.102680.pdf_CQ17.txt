However,  using  large  kernel  convolutions  usually  leads  to  over-
whelming computational complexity, resulting in a sharp increase in the 
number  of  network  parameters  and  network  computational  load.  To 
overcome this issue, we used dilated convolution (Yu and Koltun, 2016) 
and depthwise separable convolution to reduce computations. Dilated 
convolution can increase the receptive field of the convolution kernel by 
inserting “holes”  without adding parameters or increasing the compu-
tational load. The equation for calculating the receptive field of dilated 
convolution  is  shown  in  Eq.  (4),  where  n  represents  the  size  of  the 
receptive field and d represents the dilation rate.

Boosting R-CNN (Song et  al., 2023) utilizes  a reweighting strategy to 
adjust the classification loss based on the errors in the region proposal 
network,  effectively  addressing  the  challenges  specific  to  underwater 
environments, such as blurriness, low contrast, and mimicry. However, 
these  methods  generally  require  considerable  computational  power, 
which  may  limit  their  practical  applicability  in  resource-constrained 
scenarios.

Helpful Answer:
The authors do not explicitly mention any regularization techniques like dropout or L2 regularization in the given text. However, they discuss two strategies to overcome issues related to overwhelming computational complexity and overfitting. First, they use dilated convolution and depthwise separable convolution to reduce computations and maintain a larger receptive field without increasing the number of parameters or computational load. Second, they employ Boosting R-CNN, which uses a reweighting strategy to adjust the classification loss based on errors in the region proposal network. This method helps address challenges specific to underwater environments but requires significant computational resources. Although these strategies help improve model performance and efficiency, they do not directly correspond to traditional regularization techniques like dropout or L2 regularization.
