Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

A.1.2. Loading the pre-trained module 

By default, LaDeco employs the deeplabv3 þ resnet269 model. The deeplabv3 part is a semantic segmentation algorithm developed by Google 
(Chen et al., 2018), and Resnet269 is a 269-layer Resnet neural network (Zhang et al., 2020). Users can switch to other pre-trained models as needed 
(Please refer to https://cv.gluon.ai/api/model_zoo.html#). 

A.1.3. Setting the threshold 

The primary function of LaDeco is to calculate the pixel percentage of each landscape element in the image. Users can set a threshold to filter out 

negligible values; for example, values below 1% can be rounded to zero. This threshold is customizable.

2.2. Semantic segmentation 

Semantic  Segmentation  is  a  technology  used  in  image  recognition 
that assigns specific objects to each pixel of an image (Guo et al., 2018; 
Yu  et  al.,  2018).  This  is  illustrated  in  Fig.  2.  An  SS  model  generally 
comprises two main components: a downsampling network, which de-
tects objects within an image, and an upsampling network, which as-
signs each pixel to its corresponding object. 

Semantic  segmentation  has  matured  into  the  field  of  Artificial  In-
telligence. Several open-source platforms offer SS functionality. Among 
these, MXNet, managed by the Apache Software Foundation, offers the 
most extensive selection of SS models. According to research conducted 
by  Ho  and  Ho  (2022),  models  trained  on  the  ADE20K  dataset  are 
particularly  well  suited  for  landscape-based  applications.  However,

Helpful Answer:

The given context does not provide explicit information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that LaDeco uses the deeplabv3+resnet269 model, which is a semantic segmentation algorithm. Semantic segmentation is a technique used in image recognition that assigns specific objects to each pixel of an image. It involves labeling every pixel with a class or category. Therefore, one could infer that the data annotation technique used in this case might involve pixel-wise labeling or tagging.

Bounding box annotation and instance segmentation are different from semantic segmentation. Bounding box annotation involves drawing a rectangle around an object to identify its location in an image, while instance segmentation involves identifying individual instances of objects and their boundaries. These techniques are often used in object detection tasks rather than semantic segmentation tasks.

In conclusion, without more specific details about the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context, it is difficult to definitively state what data annotation techniques were used. However, given that semantic segmentation was employed, it is likely that some form of pixel-wise labeling or tagging was utilized.
