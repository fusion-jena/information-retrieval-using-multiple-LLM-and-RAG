Fig. 3. Morphological characters of the training set used by the classiﬁer in CNN models at species, genus, and subfamily level of taxonomic identiﬁcation. Gradient-weighted
Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) generated heat maps with the relevant characters for each of the three models (red = most important region for classiﬁcation). The
percentages indicate proportion of the respective morphological trait used for successful classiﬁcation in the training set. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this
ﬁgure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

In previous studies, deep learning neural networks were applied
to a wide variety of animal taxa (zooplankton, macroinvertebrates,
corals, ﬁshes, insects, and even mammals), where careful selection
of network architecture has substantially diminished the level of
classiﬁcation error compared to human identiﬁcations (Wäldchen
and Mäder, 2018). For example, Cheng et al. (2017) demonstrated
an error of only 1.3% obtained in a model based on 10 species and
55 specimens per species of pest insects using ResNet-101.
Raitoharju et al. (2016) showed a higher error for macroinverte-
brates (14.4%) but with a different network architecture and more
complex image dataset (higher number of classes/taxa). The vari-
ability of accuracy between CNN models appears to be due to three

The implementation of the CNN classiﬁer was done in Python
programming language (https://www.python.org/), using the
Keras high level deep learning library (https://keras.io/), and Ten-
sorFlow with graphical processing unit (GPU) execution as the
back-end engine (https://www.tensorﬂow.org/). The regions of
the images most informative for the decision making process in
the deep learning model were visualized using Gradient-
weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM; (Selvaraju et al.,
2017)). As an output, heatmaps were generated that indicated
important aspects of the each head capsule used to determine
the taxonomic decision-making process of the model.

3. Results

3.1. Classiﬁcation results

The classiﬁcation accuracy based on our CNN approach is the
highest (99.47% for the species model and 100% for genus and sub-
family models) ever demonstrated since CNNs have been used for
such purposes. The high level of accuracy was achieved by using a
transfer learning approach where training was split into two
phases (e.g., Shao et al., 2014; Yosinski et al., 2014). The ﬁrst phase
relied on features extracted from ResNet-50 encoder that was pre-
trained on ImageNet dataset (Russakovsky et al., 2015), while the
training only applied to the top classiﬁer (i.e., parameters of the
fully connected layer). The validation accuracy was >98% on spe-

Helpful Answer:
The primary metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this study is classification accuracy. This can be seen throughout the given text, such as when it mentions "The classification accuracy based on our CNN approach is the highest...ever demonstrated" or when discussing specific percentages like "99.47% for the species model and 100% for genus and sub-family models." Additionally, the term 'accuracy' is mentioned multiple times in relation to both training and validation datasets. However, there is no explicit mention of other common evaluation metrics like precision or recall. Therefore, we can conclude that the main metric used to assess the performance of the deep learning model in this case is classification accuracy.
