Helpful Answer:

From the given context, it appears that the article discusses a methodology for identifying Hedychium Coronarium, an invasive vegetation species in Brazilian natural flora using U-Net architecture. However, there isn't any explicit information about the specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training.

Typically, when working with deep learning models like U-Net, several strategies can be employed to monitor their performance during training. These include tracking metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and Jaccard index on both the training and validation datasets after each epoch or batch update. Additionally, visualizing loss curves over time can provide insights into how well the model is learning from the data. Other techniques involve using tools like TensorBoard or similar libraries to track various statistics and visualize them interactively.

Without more detailed information regarding the implementation of this particular project, I cannot definitively state which strategy was used here. Nonetheless, based on common practices in machine learning projects involving image classification tasks, one could infer that some combination of these methods might have been applied.
