Table 1 shows the modified GoogleNet model with
the batch normalization added outside the Inception
modules. Just like the original GoogleNet, the model is
comprised of several inception modules, however Batch
Normalization is added inside each inception module for
faster convergence right after each pooling layer. Figure 1
shows how the modified Inception module is comprised.
The model was implemented by using the Caffe frame-
work [37]. A batch size of 16 images was used for each
iteration, with a learning rate of 0.0075 with images of
224×224 resolution. Simple crop and resize data augmen-
tation was used with the default settings of Caffe.

Experiments and results
All experiments measured the top-1 and top-5 accu-
racy of the trained deep learning model under different
circumstances, i.e., herbarium specimens classification
(“Herbarium specimen classification” section, Table 3),
transfer learning across herbarium data from differ-
ent regions (“Cross-Herbaria transfer learning” section,
Table 4), and transfer learning from herbarium data to
non-dried plant images (“Transfer learning from herbar-
ium to non-dried plant images” section, Table 5).

For each of these experiments, table columns are

defined as follows:

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The paper uses a modified version of the GoogleNet model, which is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This model includes batch normalization added outside the Inception modules and inside each inception module for faster convergence right after each pooling layer. The implementation was done using the Caffe framework.
