One hundred replicates were generated for each set pres_UNB and

pres_B and for each value of k.

2.5. Parameterization of the correction methods

The knowledge found in the literature and provided by experts of
the ecology of the An. darlingi species were used to parameterize the
correction methods described in paragraph 2.1 (Table S1 summarizes
the key aspects of such parameterizations).

equally biased (Phillips et al., 2009). This is achieved by transforming
the model input data using four approaches which can be categorized
according to two criteria: i) the dataset concerned with the transfor-
mation (presence sites or background sites); and ii) the implementation
spaces of the transformation (geographical or environmental space).
When the presence dataset is considered, the authors aim at modifying
its distribution to tend toward a uniform distribution, and the back-
ground set is obtained via a uniform random selection. The im-
plementation space of such an approach is either the geographical space
(see for example Boria et al., 2014; Kramer-Schadt et al., 2013) or en-
vironmental feature space (see Fourcade et al., 2014; Varela et al.,
2014). This approach seems to be eﬀective, but requires many presence
sites (Fourcade et al., 2014). When the background set is considered, it
is built according to a selection bias that reﬂects the same sampling bias

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Correction methods

Four correction methods were considered to represent the four main
approaches described in the introduction. Only the method proposed by
Moua et al. (2017) is fully described hereafter since it has not yet been
described in detail in the literature. The three other methods are brieﬂy
described; the reader is invited to consult related references for more
details.

Two methods consisting of estimating the sampling eﬀort to adapt

the background set were implemented.

Helpful Answer:
After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements and goals of the analysis. Here are some common postprocessing steps:

1. Model Evaluation: After training, evaluating the performance of the model is crucial. Common evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curves, etc. These metrics help assess how well the model performs on unseen data.

2. Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix is a table layout that allows visualizing the performance of an algorithm. Each row of the matrix represents the instances in an actual class while each column represents the instances in a predicted class. It provides information about true positives, false negatives, false positives, and true negatives.

3. Saliency Maps: In image classification tasks, saliency maps highlight areas of the image that contribute most significantly to the final prediction. They provide insights into what features the model focuses on when making predictions.

4. Feature Importance: For non-image datasets, understanding which features have the greatest impact on the model's decision-making process can be valuable. Techniques like SHAP values, Gini importance, or permutation importance can be employed to quantify this.

5. Hyperparameter Tuning: Post-training, hyperparameters may need adjustment to improve model performance further. Grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, etc., are commonly used techniques for tuning hyperparameters.

6. Ensemble Methods: Combining multiple models can often lead to improved predictive power. Bagging, boosting, stacking, etc., are popular ensemble methods.

7. Model Interpretability: Explaining why a model made certain decisions can be important, especially in sensitive domains. LIME, SHAP, partial dependence plots, etc., are tools used to interpret complex machine learning models.
