5. Conclusions 

This study evaluates the ability of EnMAP simulated data coupled 
with machine learning algorithms to predict two critical water quality 
properties  for  inland  waters  (i.e.,  Chl-a  and  TSS).  To  this  end,  water 
samples were collected from several lakes and ponds in the south of the 
Czech  Republic  concurrent  to  the  hyperspectral  AISA  Eagle  airborne 
imaging campaign. EnMAP simulation data also was generated based on 
the  AISA  Eagle  airborne  data  using  EeteS.  As  demonstrated,  the 
enhanced  spectral  resolution  of  EnMAP  permitted  the  prediction  of 
biochemical properties of small inland waters with acceptable accuracy. 
Additionally, results indicate that Vis/NIR hyperspectral imaging from 
orbit combined with machine learning algorithms has the potential to be 
used as  a  rapid and accurate method  for predicting and  mapping the

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide specific information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or setting random seed values. However, some common strategies to manage randomness include fixing the random seed value before training models, which ensures reproducibility by generating the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers each time the code is run. Another strategy involves performing multiple runs with different initializations and averaging the results to reduce variability caused by random initialization. Additionally, techniques such as cross-validation and bootstrapping can help assess the robustness of models against variations due to random sampling.
