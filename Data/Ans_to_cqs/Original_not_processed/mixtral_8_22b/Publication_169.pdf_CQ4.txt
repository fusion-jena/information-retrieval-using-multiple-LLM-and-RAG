They vary considerably in sharpness, noise, 
illumination patterns, and shadows. Since the 
dataset is not large enough for deep learning 
to overcome the problem of overfitting, data 
augmentation was used to enlarge the dataset

Generally, the proposed network system has 
20  layers:  12  convolutional  layers,  five 
pooling  layers,  one  Fully  Connected  layer, 
one LSTM layer, and one output layer with 
the  softmax  function  for  classification.  The 
convolutional  layer  with  a  size  of  3  ×  3 
kernels is used for extracting feature and it is 
activated  by  the  ReLU  function.  The  max-
pooling layer with a size of 2 × 2 kernels is 
applied to reduce the dimensions of an input 
image. In the last part of the architecture, the 
function map is shifted to the LSTM layer to 
for 
information

classification  purpose.  Using  the  reshape 
method,  the  input  size  of  the  LSTM  layer 
becomes (196,512). After analyzing the time 
features,  the  model  sorts  the  plant  species 
images  through  a  fully  connected  layer  to

propagation  of  the  tensors  along  the  skip 
connections.  The  proposed  network  learnt 
around 100K parameters to  detect  the type 
of leaf image and if it belongs to  a  certain 
class,  which  is  comparatively  less  than  the 
existing  deep  learning  approaches  reported 
in  the  literature.  Because  of  this  least 
number  of  parameters,  we  performed  data 
augmentation to allow for in deep features to 
be  extracted  and 
to 
accurately  identify  the  classes.  We  also 
performed  benchmark  experiment  with  the 
three  state-of-the-art  approaches  of  plant 
species  recognition.  The  empirical  results 
indicate that the proposed CNN-LSTM was 
able to  classify the particular class  of each 
image  with  an  accuracy  of  95%  far  better 
than all the three combatants. This indicates 
that the proposed system could be expanded 
to  support  an  integrated  plant  species 
identification  system  to  operate  in  real 
ecosystem services.

In  this  work,  a  combined  architecture  is 
proposed  where  by  the  CNN  layer  is 
embedded with the long short-term (LSTM) 
memory  layer  to  pass  those  significant 
features extracted in the initial layers to the 
deeper layers of the network. This supports 
effective  aggregation  of  feature  maps  for 
precise classification and ultimately accurate 
recognition.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide specific details about the exact data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that data augmentation was used to enlarge the dataset training and overcome network overfitting. Common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, and shifting images. These techniques help increase the diversity of the dataset without actually collecting new data, thus improving the generalization ability of the model.
