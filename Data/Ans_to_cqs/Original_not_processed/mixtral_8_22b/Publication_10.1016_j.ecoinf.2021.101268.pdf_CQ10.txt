Deep Learning (DL) methods are at the top of the state-of-the-art on 
feature representation for different domains; albeit, DL lacks interpret-
ability. According to Doshi-Velez and Kim (2017), interpretability lets 
human specialists understand what a model is learning, making them 
flexible  real-world  solutions.  Given  such  topics,  this  paper  has  three 
significant contributions:  

1.  The  paper  introduces  the  first  Peruvian  Amazon  Forestry  Dataset, 
including  its  detailed  metadata  and  the  acquisition  protocol 
description. The dataset collects 59,441 samples from ten of the most 
profitable  and  endangered species (Finer  et al., 2014; Pinedo-Vas-
quez et al., 1992). Further-more, we employ six different commercial 
cameras  to  ensure  variability  and  to  develop  any  flexible  solution 
with real-world conditions in the future.

Too  et  al.  (2019)  fine-tune  CNN-based  models  (VGG,  ResNet, 
Inception,  and  DenseNet)  for  plant  species  classification  and  disease 
detection. Qian et al. (2020) monitor invasive plant species in the wild 
by  fine-tuned  models  (Alexnet,  VGG,  and  GoogLeNet).  Chulif  et  al. 
(2019) classify 10,000 plant species by using pre-trained InceptionNet 
models. Kaya et al. (2019) analyze deeply the effect of four different TL 
models on four publicly leaf datasets. (BarrÂ´e et al., 2017) visualize that 
the  first  convolution  layers  learn  to  extract  leaf  venations  and  edges, 
while deeper layers derive high-level feature abstractions.

6. Discussion 

Traditionally, ResNet-101, and DenseNet-201 have been considered 
inside the top-models for general feature extraction task, especially the 
ones related with ImageNet Kornblith et al. (2019). Nevertheless, our 
quantitative  and  qualitative  evaluations  evidence  that  AlexNet  and 
VGG-19 are superior for The Peruvian Amazon Forestry Dataset since 
both derive high-quality abstractions. 

AlexNet achieves to extract shape, texture, and venation with some 
noise,  while  VGG-19  focus  strongly  in  shape  and  venation.  Conse-
quently,  VGG-19  has  remarkable  results  in  different  leaf  image  pro-
cessing tasks (Lee et al., 2017; Rizk, 2019; Thanh et al., 2018).
