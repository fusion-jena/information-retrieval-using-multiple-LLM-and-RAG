2.4. Feature selection

The performance of machine learning models was evaluated by four 
criteria:  coefficient  of  determination  (R2),  NSE  (Nash  and  Sutcliffe, 
1970), Kling–Gupta efficiency (KGE) (Gupta et al., 2009), and correla-
tion coefficient (COR) (Sardoei et al., 2024).

Helpful Answer: Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be taken to improve the quality of data and enhance the model's performance. These may include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing or correcting any inconsistent, incorrect, or missing values within the dataset. It also includes handling outliers, which could negatively impact the model's accuracy if not addressed properly.

2. Normalization/Standardization: Deep learning algorithms often work better when input features have similar scales. Therefore, it is common practice to normalize or standardize the data so that all features fall within a specific range, such as between 0 and 1 (normalization) or have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 (standardization).

3. Feature Scaling: Similar to normalization and standardization, feature scaling ensures that each attribute has the same effect on the final result. Common methods used for this purpose are Min-Max scaling and Z-score normalization.

4. Encoding Categorical Variables: Since deep learning models cannot process categorical variables directly, they need to be converted into numerical form using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

5. Dimensionality Reduction: High dimensional datasets can lead to overfitting and increased computational complexity. Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) can help reduce the number of dimensions without losing significant information.

6. Data Augmentation: To increase the size of the dataset and prevent overfitting, synthetic samples can be generated through various transformations, such as rotation, zooming, flipping, etc. However, these techniques mainly apply to image data.
