layer 5 and a batch normalization layer after hidden layer 2 increased the testing accuracy
of the model. These additional layers—dropout and batch normalization—reduce the
over-ﬁtting of the model on the training data and increase generalization on testing data.
The hyperparameters in this network—the learning rate, number of epochs, and batch
size—were further tuned such that the testing accuracy and the kappa were the best among
all models. The optimized hyperparameter values for learning rate and batch size were
0.007 and 48, respectively.

[42]. The RBF kernel requires tuning of two parameters—C and γ. Choice of the C parameter in-volves a trade-off between correct classification and maximization of the margin. Thus, a smaller C value will result in a wider margin and thus a lower accuracy. The γ value con-trols the radius of influence of the training samples. Thus, a greater value will result in a model that overfits on the training data and poor generalization on the testing data. The best values for C and γ were optimized using GridSearchCV (scikit-learn 0.24) and were found to be 1000 and 1, respectively. 2.5. Random Forest (RF) The RF algorithm constructs multiple decision trees (DTs), or classifiers, that each predict a class [43]. Each tree within the RF is created using different training data subsets, which are selected through repetition and replacement of the original training dataset. This repetition and replacement create a ‘bagged’ dataset for each of the decision trees within the random forest. The

The quantity of training data derived from ground data collection in 2018 was limited.
A U-Net implemented with Keras produced a low training and testing accuracy with
segmentation results on testing data differing between repetitions. Implementing a U-Net
model within the arcgis.learn module of the ArcGIS API for Python [39] removed the
requirement for a quantitatively massive dataset. Additionally, the U-Net implemented
through argis.learn is pretrained on ImageNet to further improve classiﬁcation accuracies.
This reduces the time and resources spent on ground truth data collection. Hyperparameter
tuning was done to select the best U-Net model [31,34,40]. Based on hyperparameter
optimization, it was found that the best model uses an input patch size of 64 × 64 pixels
and a ResNet-50 backbone [31,34,40].

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there are several strategies implemented to monitor the model performance during training. For the Deep Neural Network (DNN) model, dropout and batch normalization layers were added to reduce overfitting and increase generalization on testing data. Furthermore, hyperparameters like learning rate, number of epochs, and batch size were tuned to achieve the best testing accuracy and kappa score. Specifically, the optimized hyperparameter values for learning rate and batch size were 0.007 and 48, respectively.

For the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, the RBF kernel was used, requiring tuning of two parameters - C and γ. A smaller C value would result in a wider margin but lower accuracy, while a larger γ value would lead to overfitting on the training data and poor generalization on the testing data. The best values for C and γ were optimized using GridSearchCV and found to be 1000 and 1, respectively.

In the case of the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, multiple decision trees were constructed, each predicting a class using different training data subsets selected through repetition and replacement of the original training dataset. This process creates a 'bagged' dataset for each decision tree within the random forest.

Lastly, for the U-Net model, hyperparameter tuning was performed to select the best model. It was found that the best model uses an input patch size of 64 x 64 pixels and a ResNet-50 backbone.
