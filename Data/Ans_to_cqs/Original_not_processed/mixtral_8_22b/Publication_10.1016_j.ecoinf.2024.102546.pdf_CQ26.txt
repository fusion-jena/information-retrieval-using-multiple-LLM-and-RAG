3.1. Dataset curation

Data  distribution  shifts  are  commonly  encountered  in  deploying 
machine learning systems, manifested as degraded model performance 
(Koh et al., 2021). This is conceivably true for weed recognition models

Helpful Answer:
The materials and methods section discusses the issue of data distribution shifts in machine learning systems, which can lead to degraded model performance. However, it does not explicitly mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Nevertheless, based on the literature cited, some common techniques used to address data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same class proportions in both sets. Oversampling increases the number of instances in the minority class by duplicating existing samples or creating synthetic ones using techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). Undersampling reduces the number of instances in the majority class by randomly removing samples or using more sophisticated techniques like Tomek links or NearMiss. Diverse data collection aims to collect data from various sources, environments, and conditions to ensure that the model is robust and generalizes well to new data.

In summary, several techniques can be employed to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. The choice of technique depends on the nature of the data and the problem being addressed.
