Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided sources do not contain information about which specific hardware resources were used for training a deep learning model. The sources primarily focus on topics such as principles of irrigation scheduling, understanding soil water content thresholds, visualization tools for decision support, modeling of plant architecture, node-based programming, and multiobjective mixed integer programming. None of these sources discuss or mention any details regarding the use of hardware resources like GPUs or TPUs for training deep learning models. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a helpful answer to this query based on the given sources.
