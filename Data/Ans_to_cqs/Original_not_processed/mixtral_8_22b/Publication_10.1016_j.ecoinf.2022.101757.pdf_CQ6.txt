the weights were obtained from an already trained implementation of 
DeeplabV3+ (https://github.com/zllrunning/deeplab-pytorch-crf) with 
the COCO dataset. COCO is a dataset that has 121,408 images and a total 
of 883,331 object annotations divided in 184 classes. COCO is a widely 
used  dataset  to  train  computer  vision  models  and  sets  a  baseline  to 
benchmark their performance. Since we want to derive common objects 
below the skyline, we inference without training the model directly on 
the landscape photos. A typical example of the masks obtained with such 
a semantic segmentation is provided in Fig. 3.

To extract meaningful information for the purpose of our study, the 
delineation  of  the  skyline  has  to  be  highly  detailed.  The  detection  of 
edges or object boundaries in semantic segmentation tends to be blurry 
as the loss of effective spatial resolution associated with the learning of 
contextual  information  by  the  net  diminishes  high-frequency  details 
(Hariharan et al., 2015; Shelhamer et al., 2017). We address this prob-
lem by applying a Conditional Random Fields (CRF) (Kr¨ahenbühl and 
Koltun,  2011).  The  ability  to  capture  fine  details  with  a  CRF 

compensates the limited performance of these kind of nets to generate 
precisely delineated objects. 

To  measure  the  increase  in  detail  of  the  skyline  using  CRF,  we 
calculated the length of the signals extracted with and without CRF and 
evaluated the gain length as:

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model like DeeplabV3+. However, generally speaking, some common preprocessing steps include data normalization, scaling, cleaning, and augmentation. Data normalization involves rescaling the input features so they fall within a specific range, often between 0 and 1. Scaling can also help ensure that all features contribute equally to the final output. Cleaning refers to removing any irrelevant or redundant data points, while augmentation involves creating new samples through transformations like rotation, flipping, or cropping. These techniques aim to improve the model's generalizability and prevent overfitting. In the case of DeeplabV3+, the authors mention using an already trained implementation with the COCO dataset, but do not elaborate on any specific preprocessing steps applied to the dataset prior to training.
