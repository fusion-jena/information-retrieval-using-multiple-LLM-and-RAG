A deep learning process with CNNs successfully classiﬁed mor-
phologically very similar chironomid specimens with high accu-
racy to species level. While this is a pioneering demonstration of
the use of this technique, the potential for automatic identiﬁcation
of chironomids and other difﬁcult to identify taxa in bioassessment
is high. Machine learning extracted a similar suite of features to
those used in conventional identiﬁcation keys. The data acquisition
protocol and deep learning architecture of this study offers a
unique design which can be applied to chironomid identiﬁcation
as well as other macroinvertebrate groups. Such an approach will
consequently increase the efﬁciency of routine monitoring pro-
grams. Since non-biting midges are a group that is characterized
with a large diversity of morphological characters, future research
should focus on increasing the number of entities (species) in the
model as well as testing the accuracy along a geographical scale.

factors: network architecture, protocol type of image acquisition
(Martineau et al., 2017), and robustness of input matrix (number
of entities and replicates). Our choice to use a ResNet-50 network
architecture, in combination with transfer learning, data augmen-
tation, and dropout proved appropriate for the current number of
taxa in our demonstration dataset. ResNet-50 network architecture
represents a midsize solution in the ResNet palette (18, 34, 50, 101,
152 layers) that combines both representation power and lower
complexity that allows relatively fast training of the models. How-
ever, the protocol for image acquisition inﬂuences the complexity
of features, which will be processed by CNNs. Controlled object
position during the collection of images can also govern the level
of feature variability. Our dataset was constructed under the lab-
based protocol of image acquisition with fully controlled position
of the larvae (ventral point of view). This was not the case in pre-

identiﬁcation. Methods Ecol. Evol. 9, 2216–2225.

ImageNet) (Russakovsky et al., 2015). Since 2012, there has been
signiﬁcant improvement in deep learning CNN architectures that
have led to better classiﬁcation results in the ImageNet challenge.
Here lies an opportunity to use a similar structure and approach
for targeted application in biomonitoring studies that could incor-
porate high-resolution information from the Chironomidae in
inferences of ecosystem integrity.

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it does discuss some techniques used in the deep learning process for chironomid specimen classification. These include using a ResNet-50 network architecture, transfer learning, data augmentation, and dropout.

Transfer learning involves leveraging knowledge gained from one task to improve generalization in another related task. In this case, it might have helped manage randomness by providing a more informed starting point for the model rather than completely random initialization. Data augmentation generates new training samples by applying transformations like rotation or scaling to existing ones, potentially reducing overfitting due to randomness in the original dataset. Dropout is a regularization method where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, helping prevent overreliance on particular features and improving overall performance.

While these methods do not directly address handling randomness in terms of seed values, they contribute to creating a more robust and reliable deep learning pipeline. To specifically tackle issues related to random seeds, common practices include setting fixed seed values for reproducibility, averaging results across multiple runs with different seeds, or employing techniques like ensemble learning to combine predictions from various models trained with distinct initializations.
