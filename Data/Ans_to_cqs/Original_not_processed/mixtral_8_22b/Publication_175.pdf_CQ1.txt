a new task with a very limited dataset, usually only 1–5 thumbnails per 
class.

There are two ways to tackle this problem of lack of data. The first 
one  consists  of  directly  addressing  the  data  itself,  through  data 
augmentation (Van Dyk and Meng, 2012; Wang and Perez, 2017; Wong 
et al., 2016). The second option is to change the classification algorithm. 
Few-shots learning (FSL) algorithms (Fei-fei et al., 2006; Fink, 2005) are 
designed to compute a classification task (query, noted Q) with only a 
few  thumbnails  to  train  (Support  Sets,  noted  SS),  and  it  has  been 
increasingly studied since 2017 (Finn et al., 2017). Few-shots learning 
methods are divided into three main approaches. Metric-based methods 
are embedding both queries (Q) and support sets (Ss), before assigning to 
the query a class, according to distances computed between Q and Ss 
(Sung et al., 2018; Victor and Bruna, 2018; Yanbin et al., 2019). The 
second approach consists of 1) training a model on a large database, and

performed by divers. Although dive visual censuses provide a great deal 
of  information  on  some  shallow  habitats,  there  are  many  limitations. 
First, divers are limited by depth and can hardly perform long dives to 
count fish below 30 m, ignoring mesophotic habitats and deeper eco-
systems. Second, divers are limited by time and generally focus their 2–4 
dives per day in the most speciose hard-substrate habitats, and ignore 
less rich and often immense adjacent soft-bottom habitats. Third, dive 
surveys provide data at a slow rate so that the compilation of global fish 
biodiversity  database  takes  decades  of  efforts  by  multiple  teams  of 
highly skilled taxonomic divers (e.g. (Cinner et al., 2020; Stuart-smith 
et  al.,  2013)).  This  is  a  major  restriction  to  the  necessary  temporal 
monitoring of global marine ecosystems, although a few time series exist 
in some countries1 (Heenan et al., 2017).

Helpful Answer:
The context does not explicitly mention specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does allude to certain challenges faced when using traditional methods such as dive visual censuses performed by divers. These challenges include limitations in terms of depth, time constraints, and the slow rate of data collection. Despite these limitations, dive visual censuses have still been used to gather a significant amount of information about shallow habitats. Additionally, the context mentions the use of large databases for training models, which could potentially be public datasets or other sources of pre-existing data. It also references studies related to oceanography and marine mammal species detection, suggesting that sensor data may play a role in gathering raw data for deep learning applications in these areas. Overall, while the exact methods used for collecting raw data are not specified, the context implies that various techniques such as dive visual censuses, public datasets, and possibly sensor data may be employed depending on the specific application.
