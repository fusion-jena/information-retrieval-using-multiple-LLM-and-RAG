In the pursuit of enhancing our comprehension of aquatic systems, 
the SMARTLAGOON project has been a pivotal initiative. Through this 
project,  an  innovative  satellite  data  collection  tool  was  developed, 
which systematically collects water quality data from public Application 
Programming  Interfaces  (APIs)  of  major  space  agencies  including  the 
European Space Agency (ESA) and the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration  (NASA).  This  tool  is  engineered  to  meet  the  needs  of 
users and third-party applications, providing historical and current data 
insights,  thus  constructing  an  organized  and  coherent  time  series  of 
varied  variables  obtained  by  Satellite  Remote  Sensing  (SRS)  services. 
The  architecture  of  this  sophisticated  tool  is  divided  into  two  core 
components as shown in Fig. 2. The first component focuses on acquiring 
satellite  imagery  for  predefined  geospatial  coordinates  over  a  deter-

solar  radiation  reflected  by  the  Earth  in  21  spectral  bands  at  spatial 
resolution of 300 m. It is important to note that this work focuses on 
these Sentinel-3-related products as they offer daily data from the same 
world  region  around  the  same  hour  (see  Table  2)  and  having  a  high 
temporal  resolution  is  essential  for  the  development  of  a  monitoring

Helpful Answer:

In the context of the SMARTLAGOON project, the method used for collecting raw data involves utilizing a crawling tool specifically designed to gather historical and near real-time data from various Satellite Remote Sensing (SRS) products. This tool obtains water quality data from public APIs of major space agencies like the European Space Agency (ESA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The collected data includes crucial parameters such as reflectance, Aerosol Optical Thickness (Kd940), Chlorophyll-a concentrations, and more. The primary focus of this work revolves around using Sentinel-3 related products due to their ability to provide daily data from the same world region around the same hour, which is essential for developing a monitoring system. Additionally, in situ data sources like CSIC-IEO and CARM contribute to the overall dataset with sampling dates ranging from 2016 to 2022.
