similarities. It is widely used to visualize high-dimensional data (van der 
Maaten  and Hinton, 2008). Here the  method has been applied to the 
fc1000 activation vectors returned by ResNet-50. 

4.2. Classifier model 

The labeled dataset was split 70/30 into training and testing data-
sets.  For  model  selection  and  parameter  optimization  50%  of  the 
training data were held-out for validation (see Supporting Information). 
The final classification model, a SVM with a cubic polynomial kernel, 
was trained using the ResNet-50 fc1000 activations of the full training 
dataset. A 10-fold cross-validation was then used to define the score-to- 
posterior-probability transformation function (Platt, 2000), which pro-
vides a basis for estimating the posterior probability for new observa-
tions. Fig. 9 shows a confusion matrix for the test data not seen during 
training.

These  spectrogram images  are  input  into  the  ResNet-50  deep  (50- 
layer) convolutional neural network (CNN), which was developed and 
pre-trained using millions of label images in over 1000 categories (He 
et  al.,  2015).  Although  ResNet-50  was  not  explicitly  trained  on  spec-
trograms, many studies have shown that CNNs pre-trained for one task 
can  extract  meaningful  features  distant  from  the  original  training 
dataset  (e.g.,  Almabdy  and  Elrefaei,  2019;  Bousetouane  and  Morris, 
2015; Copiaco et al., 2019; Razavian et al., 2014). A suite of features is

3.2. Cataloging overview 

The  description  below  assumes  that  the  acoustic  waveforms  have 
been  sampled  (or  re-sampled)  at  a  rate  of  24  kHz,  demeaned,  and 
pressure  corrected.  The  approach  utilizes  a  multi-stage  workflow. 
Candidate signals are identified by matching a suite of harmonic kernels 
using spectrogram cross-correlation (modified after Ricci et al., 2017a). 
Machine learning is then used to mitigate the false alarm rate associated 
with  the  detection  stage  (e.g.,  Balantic  and  Donovan,  2020;  Bohnen-
stiehl, 2023a). Frequency-reassigned spectrogram images are generated

when weights are used, the range of the kernels receiving full weight 
should be set larger than the confidence interval of the prediction.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the type of optimizer employed. However, it does mention that a SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier with a cubic polynomial kernel was used as the final classification model. Additionally, it states that a 10-fold cross-validation was utilized to determine the score-to-posterior-probability transformation function. These details suggest that some form of tuning or optimization may have taken place, but without explicit mention of the hyperparameters used, we cannot definitively state what they were.
