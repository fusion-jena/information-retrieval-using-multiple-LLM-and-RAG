Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information about the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some commonly used techniques include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting is a technique where the dataset is divided into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes or labels in both sets. This helps prevent any class imbalance from affecting the model's performance.

Oversampling involves increasing the number of instances in the minority class by duplicating existing samples or creating synthetic ones. Undersampling, on the other hand, reduces the number of instances in the majority class by randomly removing samples or selecting only those that contribute most to the model's performance. Both methods aim to balance the dataset and reduce bias towards the majority class.

Diverse data collection involves collecting more varied and representative data to improve the generalizability of the model. This can help mitigate biases introduced by limited or unrepresentative datasets.

Without further context, it cannot be determined which of these techniques were employed in this particular study.
