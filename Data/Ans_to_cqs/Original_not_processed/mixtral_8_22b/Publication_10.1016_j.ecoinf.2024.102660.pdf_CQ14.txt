Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

2.6. Evaluation metric 

This  study  employed  five  metrics,  namely  Accuracy  (A),  Precision 
(P),  Recall  (R),  F1-score  (F1),  and  Intersection  over  Union  (IOU),  to 
assess the effectiveness of the proposed model (Giles et al., 2021). Their 
calculation formulas are shown below:

2.5. Parameter setting 

The Res_AUNet network was constructed using the PyTorch library. 
The experiments were conducted on a Dell workstation with an Intel(R) 
Xeon(R) Gold 6248R CPU (3.00GHz) and 512GB of memory, along with 
an NVIDIA RTX A6000 graphics card with 48GB of memory. During the 
network training process, the input images underwent random rotations, 
flips,  and  other  image  augmentation  operations  to  enhance  the  net-
workâ€™s robustness. Training persisted for 120 epochs, with a batch size 
set to 8. The initial learning rate was set to 0.001, and the learning rate 
was  adjusted  using  the  equal-interval  adjustment  strategy  (StepLR), 
halving the original rate every 10 epochs of iteration.

The proposed network was compared on the WSGD test dataset with 
the current state of the art model: UNet used by Giles(Giles et al., 2021) 
and seed pixel region growing used by Chong (Chong et al., 2022), and 
several  classic  semantic  segmentation  networks  (PSPNet,  HRNet  and 
UNet++). The quantitative results of the neural network are shown in 
Table  2,  and  the  qualitative  results  of  the  seed  pixel  region  growing 
algorithm and the neural network are shown in Fig. 7. 

It can be concluded from the table above, the Res_AUNet network 
achieved  the  best  performance,  followed  by  UNet  and  UNet++ net-
works. The F1-score of UNet++ network reached 0.8107, IOU reached 
0.7124, while HRNet and PSPNet had the worst performance, with an 
Accuracy of less than 70%.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it is not explicitly stated how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, during the network training process, the input images underwent random rotations, flips, and other image augmentation operations to enhance the network's robustness. Additionally, the initial learning rate was set to 0.001, and the learning rate was adjusted using the equal-interval adjustment strategy (StepLR), halving the original rate every 10 epochs of iteration. These details suggest that some level of optimization or tuning may have been performed, but without specific mention of methods like grid search or random search, we cannot definitively determine the exact method used for hyperparameter optimization.
