(3)  As a contextual constraint, bioclimatic data (see above) was fed into the CNN with the same model and 
data configuration including Plasticity in a mixed data approach (‘Worldclim’ in Fig. 2, setup 3 in Fig. 1). 
4) We tested an Ensemble approach, in which two more state-of-the-art model architectures, namely 
 Xception51 and MobileNetV2, the latter with halved number of trainable  parameters52, were trained on the 
configuration of setup 3, and their predictions were subsequently averaged (’Ensemble’ in Fig. 2, setup 4 in 
Fig. 1). These models differed strongly in their number of trainable weights, resulting in a different depth. 
The final model performance was assessed using a 3-fold cross-validation, with three different training, 
validation and test splits. To enable a comparison of model performance across traits, the resulting mean 
absolute error (MAE) was normalised by division over the range of the target values of the respective test

extracted a random sample of 10% of the dataset of each trait before model training. This ‘test dataset’ was not 
involved in the training process and exclusively served for the independent evaluation of the trained models. 
The remaining data was split into ’training dataset’ and ’validation dataset’ by a ratio of 4:1 (Table 1). The train-
ing dataset was employed to train the weights of the CNN model, whereas the validation dataset indicated the 
training progress after each full training cycle (’epoch’).

Conclusion and outlook
Following the urgently needed transition of ecology towards a data-sharing scientific  discipline15,44 and the call for 
integration of powerful datasets in  ecology44, we built upon this revolution of Big Data provided by professional 
and citizen science alike. Therefore, we exploited the potential of Convolutional Neural  Networks44 to produce 
generic models generalising across all biomes and regions around the globe to extract a set of plant functional 
traits from simple RGB photographs. Thus, the burden of limited geographical coverage of trait databases might 
be lifted by the worldwide coverage of the iNaturalist plant photograph database. The traits referring to the models 
with the highest predictive performance cover the primary axes of plant form and function 13, which are plant and 
organ size (GH, LA) as well as the leaf economics spectrum (SLA). Despite of the disputable model performance

Helpful Answer:

The text does not explicitly mention specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it refers to several datasets relevant to the study. One key dataset mentioned is the 'WorldClim' dataset, which provides bioclimatic data used as input for the CNN model. Additionally, the study uses a dataset of plant photographs from the iNaturalist platform. Although these datasets may not be as widely recognized as those commonly used in computer vision tasks like MNIST or ImageNet, they play a crucial role in this particular research project focused on plant functional traits prediction.
