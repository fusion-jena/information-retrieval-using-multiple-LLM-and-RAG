Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

An alternative approach to enhancing the accuracy of LULC maps is 
to leverage deep learning techniques. These techniques operate patch- 
wise,  where  each  patch  incorporates  sophisticated  features  extracted 
from satellite imagery. This enables them to recognize intricate patterns 
effectively.  Particularly,  Convolutional  Neural  Networks  (CNNs)  are 
highly  effective  for  LULC  classification.  These  models  automatically

best models in terms of OA and KC. SVM and CART had lower perfor-
mance  but  still  provided  meaningful  results.  It  is  noteworthy  that 
ensemble  methods,  such  as  RF  and  GTB,  outperformed  individual 
methods,  highlighting  the  effectiveness  of  ensemble  methods  in 
handling complex relationships for LULC classification.

%Query
Query: "What is the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline used for land use and land cover (LULC) classification. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to this query based on the available context.
