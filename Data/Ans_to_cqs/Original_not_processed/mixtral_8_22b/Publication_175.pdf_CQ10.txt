3. Results 

The  deep  ResNet  model  trained  on  the  large  AT0  dataset  (3458 
natural thumbnails in average per species) during the first experiment 
obtained a mean accuracy (i.e. percentage of correct classification) of 
78.00%  (standard  deviation  (SD)  of  15.16%)  on  T2  test-dataset 
(Table  2).  With  this  model,  accuracy  varied  among  species  between 
54.14% (Naso brevirostris) and 99.07% (Abudefduf vagiensis). The same

Fig. 1. Relationship between the number of natural thumbnails per species for training and the accuracy of deep-learning and few-shot learning models. Non-linear 
mixed effects asymptotic model fit for (a) DL architecture at the fixed-effect level, and for FSL architecture at (b) the fixed-effect level and (c) the random-effect level. 
Grey areas represent 95% CI in fixed-effects estimates. Dotted lines represent the NLME estimate of the number of images per species required to reach the 99% 
asymptote value. We obtained similar magnitude with the 95% asymptote value, reached with 750 images for DL and 5 with FSL. 

T1 corresponded more to a real use case scenario.

Accuracy of our ResNet deep-learning (DL) and Reptile few-shots learning (FSL) models trained on T0 or T1 thumbnails datasets for different number of shots. Accuracy 
is the % correct classification of models on T2 test dataset. DL models were trained from T0 and T1 after data augmentation (AT0 and AT1).
