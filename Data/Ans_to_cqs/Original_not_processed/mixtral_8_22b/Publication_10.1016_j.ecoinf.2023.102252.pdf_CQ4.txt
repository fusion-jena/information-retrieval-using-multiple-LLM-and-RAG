In Section 6, we discuss the advantages and limitations of the model and 
future work. And finally, we summarize the main findings in Section 7.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to this specific query. However, some common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, padding, and adding noise. These techniques help increase the size and diversity of training datasets, which can improve the performance and generalization ability of machine learning models.
