This is the ﬁrst study to our knowledge to investigate the pheno-
logical features in improving the performance of deep learning. As re-
vealed in our results, we have seen great potential in developing phe-
nological knowledge based deep learning methods. Recent literature
has documented the applications and beneﬁts of deep learning, a new
branch of machine learning, in various ﬁelds (LeCun et al., 2015).
However, it is still a controversial topic whether deep learning is more
suitable than traditional machine learning methods for Landsat image
classiﬁcation (Heydari and Mountrakis, 2018; Li et al., 2016). Never-
theless, this study aims to evaluate the hypotheses that applying phe-
nological knowledge as input data of deep learning can improve the
performance in the detection of invasive S. alterniﬂora. A comparison
experiment between SAE and SVM with six diﬀerent types of Landsat
images was conducted (see Table 2). The best performance was

(sowing), green (emergence and full growth) and bare soil (harvest).
Capturing these three stages with spectral data should further enhance
the spectral separability between paddy rice and others.

1.3. Classiﬁer

Although the pixel-based phenological feature may augment the
spectral separability between invasive and native species, another
contributing factor aﬀecting S. alterniﬂora mapping is the development
of an eﬀective classiﬁer. Currently, most mainstream classiﬁers in re-
mote sensing applications are based on machine learning (Mather and
Paul, 2009). Artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) was initially proposed in 1956
for the purpose of constructing a machine to mimic human thinking.
Machine learning emerged in the 1980s to implement AI algorithms.
Deep learning, as a new branch of machine learning, has achieved
successful applications in various ﬁelds since 2012, e.g. computer vi-
sion, speech recognition, and remote sensing classiﬁcation (LeCun
