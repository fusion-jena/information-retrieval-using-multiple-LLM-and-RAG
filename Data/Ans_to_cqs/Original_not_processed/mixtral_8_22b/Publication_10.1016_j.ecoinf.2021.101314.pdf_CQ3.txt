Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Redescription  mining  typically  outputs  a  large  number  of  re-
descriptions, each holding on a subregion within the dataset. Subregions 
can  overlap,  and  the  same  subregion  can  potentially  be  described  by 
different variables. Analysts might manually sift through individual re-
descriptions. However, it is not practical to analyze large collections of 
redescriptions, since many of them contain similar information. There-
fore,  computational  means  are  needed  to  remove  redundant  (very 
similar)  redescriptions  and  identify  the  most  informative  (distinct) 
patterns.

The  first  run,  with  strict  explicit  constraints,  generated  271  re-
descriptions while the second run, with stringent threshold on accuracy 
gains,  generated  188  redescriptions.  Either  run  took  about 50  min  to 
complete on a commodity laptop. 

We filter the two collections separately, ranking the redescriptions 
by  decreasing  accuracy  and  removing  any  redescription  having  more 
than 90% of its support in common with a higher-ranked one. That is, a 
redescription Rx is removed from the set of results if it contains a more 
accurate redescription Ry such that

we  tailored  for  biogeographic  analyses.  See  (Galbrun  and  Miettinen, 
2017) for more details about the method. Fig. 3 (bottom) schematically 
illustrates and summarizes the main concepts of redescription mining. 

4.1. Concepts and definitions

The method requires manually setting several parameters, described 
in more details in the user guide.7 In particular, about half a dozen pa-
rameters allow to set thresholds on the size of the support of the output 
redescriptions and to control the length and complexity of their queries. 
We required that at least 1% of localities satisfy both queries (Min-
SuppIn) and that at least 30% of localities satisfy neither of the queries 
(MinSuppOut). In other words, the intersection of the supports of the 
two  queries  (the  support  of  the  redescription)  and  their  union  were 
required to contain at least 1% and at most 70% of all localities. This is 
an inclusive choice, not overly restrictive, that aims at capturing local 
patterns. Increasing the upper threshold further would jeopardize the 
local aspect of the analysis, and would lead to something more akin to 
non-linear regression. For a redescription to be informative, its support

Helpful Answer: The given text does not provide specific information regarding the use of data annotation techniques in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct answer based solely on this context. However, generally speaking, some commonly used data annotation techniques in deep learning include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and labeling or tagging. These techniques help train machine learning models by providing labeled examples, which enable the model to learn patterns and relationships between input features and corresponding labels.
