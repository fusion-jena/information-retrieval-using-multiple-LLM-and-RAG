cells along with associated uncertainties (Dubayah et al., 2022).

We evaluated the model performance utilising leave-one-out cross- 
validation, (LOOCV) approach. In the LOOCV approach, one observa-
tion at a time is extracted from the dataset and the model parameters are 
estimated  using  the  remaining  (n-1)  observations.  The  model  is  then 
applied to the extracted observation. 

3. Results 

The  GEDI  data  and  the  available  field  data  did  not  coincide 
geographically or in size. Thus, we have compared the GEDI L4A AGBD 
footprint values with AGBD estimated from the Sentinel-2 models. We 
also compared the relationship between tree height and AGBD for field 
data and GEDI data, respectively to understand the relationship between 
GEDI AGBD and height with respect to the corresponding field based 
values at the two study area.

3.2. Modelling AGBD using Sentinel-2 data 

We  used  linear  regression  to  model  AGBD  (field  measured)  as  a 
function  of  Sentinel-2  spectral  data  in  both  test  areas.  As  mentioned 
above, the selected model in the Betul area included bands 2, 5 and 6 
(B2, B5 and B6), and had a root mean square error (RMSE) of 11.27 ton/ 
ha  and  an  R2  of  0.90.  Inspections  of  residual  plots  indicate  that  the 
model  is  good  and  the  validation  of  the  model  using  a  leave-one-out 
cross-validation  (LOOCV)  approach  show  an  RMSE  of  13.93  ton/ha, 
an R2 of 0.88, a mean absolute error (MAE) of 10.77 and a bias of (cid:0) 0.28. 
The selected bands B2, B5 and B6 have been successfully used in recent 
studies to estimate forest biomass (Chen et al., 2021; Xi et al., 2022).

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Answer: Based on the given context, it appears that the authors utilized a leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) approach to evaluate their model performance. This method involves extracting one observation at a time from the dataset and estimating the model parameters using the remaining (n-1) observations. Then, the model is applied to the extracted observation. However, the context does not explicitly mention any specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based solely on the information given.
