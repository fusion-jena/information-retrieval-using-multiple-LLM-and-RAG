Because the accuracy
(97.3%) of our method is higher than that of human vol-
unteers (96.6%; Norouzzadeh et al. 2018), it can be applied
to actual ecological monitoring projects. Second, the time
and personnel costs of labeling small‐scale training sets are
much lower than that of million‐scale training sets. Note
that to manually label ~5.5 million images, nearly 30,000
persons have spent ~14.6 years with a 40‐hour work week
(Swanson et al. 2015, Norouzzadeh et al. 2018), which
means that manually labeling a training set containing

memory, we used the incremental training mode to train
and test the DCNN model. On another Dell PowerEdge
C4130 rack server with two Tesla K80 GPUs and 256 GB
of memory, we used the zero‐start and the incremental
training modes to train and test models, respectively.

RESULTS
The incremental training mode performed consistently with
the zero‐start training mode when the training sample size

STUDY AREA
Our study area (28°14′‐28°22′N, 99°4′‐99°17′E) was located
at the Baimaxueshan Mountains (BMXSM), which were
part of the Hengduan Mountains in China (Fig. 1). The
Hengduan Mountains region, also known as the Mountains
of Southwest China, was identiﬁed as a global biodiversity
hotspot (Myers 1988, 1990, Myers et al. 2000). The altitude
changes from about 2000 m to higher than 4600 m above
sea level.

METHODS

Adaptive Incremental Training Method
To reduce the demand for computing resources for
model training, we proposed an adaptive incremental
training method (Fig. 2). In our method, we carried the
training process of the DCNN model in stages. The
model training starts with a smaller training set, and
then the trained model can be applied to the practical
ecological
In practical applications,
users can expand the previous training set by adding

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information regarding the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, considering the nature of the research and its application to ecological monitoring projects, one could infer that the raw data might include images or videos collected through various means such as camera traps, drones, or other remote sensing devices commonly employed in wildlife studies. Additionally, the mention of a large dataset consisting of approximately 5.5 million images suggests that publicly available datasets may also contribute to the pool of raw data. Nevertheless, without further details, this remains speculative.
