Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Models were trained and tested by tuning the number of required 
epochs and then inspecting the model outputs and error outcomes for 
signs of overfitting. If the model focuses excessively on data fitting, it 
may imitate insignificant noise rather than the broad properties of in-
terest, resulting in overfitting.

cation  studies,  a  lack  of  data  is  the  greatest  challenge  and  limitation 
researchers encounter (Schneider et al., 2019). With the data collection 
compiled  in  this  work,  we  contribute  the  largest  fully  labeled  snow 
leopard dataset for deep learning research. In addition, we anticipate 
that our novel deep learning methods will encourage other academics to 
contribute  more  datasets  to  Whiskerbook.org  for  the  purpose  of 
continuously curating and enhancing the data used to improve the deep 
learning pipeline. Comparing these results to those of an earlier study by 
Johansson et al. (2020) that depended on human manual classification, 
without  AI  or  software,  determined  that  observers  significantly  over-
estimate  the  true  abundance.  AI-based  individual  ID  within  Whiske 
rbook.org  has  demonstrated  the  potential  to  enhance  the  precision 
and  efficiency  of  manual  observers,  approaching  more  accurate  esti-

versity.  Machine  learning  advancements  used  in  this  study  were 
partially funded by a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Founda-
tion. A Microsoft Sponsorship supported Azure-based development and 
model deployment in Whiskerbook.org.

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide explicit information about the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, there are some clues that suggest possible steps taken during the deployment phase. For instance, the mention of Azure-based development and model deployment in Whiskerbook.org indicates that the cloud computing service offered by Microsoft, called Azure, might have been utilized for deploying the models. This implies that the models may have undergone model serialization, which involves converting them into a format suitable for storage or transmission, before being deployed onto the platform. Additionally, since the researchers contributed their dataset to Whiskerbook.org, it is likely that the platform was selected for hosting and sharing the developed deep learning models with other researchers. Nevertheless, without further details regarding the exact deployment procedure, one cannot definitively state the precise steps involved in the process.
