However,  although  research  on  the  urban  AE  gained  traction  in 
recent years, sophisticated methods to quantify its complex properties 
on  a  larger  scale  are  still  scarce.  This  is  especially  true  for  big  audio 
datasets, which are so extensive that listening to the files becomes no 
longer  feasible.  To  date,  few  approaches  have  been  used  to  quantify 
large datasets of the urban AE. Classical approaches reach their limits 
when  it  comes  to  analyzing  longer  recording  periods  (e.g.  several 
months) (Gage et al., 2017). In recent years, sound event classification 
using  machine  learning  approaches  became  more  popular  (Phillips 
et al., 2018; Sethi et al., 2022; Stowell et al., 2019; Ulloa et al., 2018), 
but is still not ready to be deployed unconfined (Alcocer et al., 2022). In 
psychoacoustics, mostly smaller field studies have been conducted (Hall 
et  al.,  2013;  Ma  et  al.,  2021;  Montoya-Belmonte  and  Navarro,  2020;

In this work, we (i) describe all necessary steps of how CNs can be 
constructed from large-scale acoustic data and (ii) evaluate this process 
on approx. one million minutes of audio recordings from 23 different 
sites  in  Bochum,  Germany.  Here,  the  foundation  for  constructing

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the given context, we can infer that the authors might have used audio recordings from various devices placed at different locations in Bochum, Germany. The dataset consists of approximately one million minutes of audio recordings from 23 different sites. It is also mentioned that these recordings cover longer recording periods, such as several months. Therefore, it can be assumed that the authors collected raw data using some form of audio sensors or microphones installed at specific locations. Unfortunately, there is no further information available regarding the exact nature of these sensors or any other details related to the collection of raw data.
