et al., 2015; Zoffoli et al., 2020). In the second set, the response variable 
was  the  training dataset divided in  4 classes  according to  the species 
present, namely (1) Z. marina, (2) N. noltei, (3) C. nodosa, (4) absence 
(hereafter  indicated  as  species  meadows).  The  species  presence  was 
considered if its cover was >20% (Buia et al., 2004). For each dataset, 4

of a plethora of runs with different number of trees (Probst et al., 2019). 
For  the  best  split  selection  measurement,  the  Gini  Index  was  used 
(Breiman,  2001).  The  number  of  variables  used  for  each  node  (mtry) 
were  automatically  selected  by  using  repeated  cross  validations  per-
formed  with  10  folds  and  10  repetitions  for  the  seagrass  meadow 
models, while 5 folds and 5 repetitions were used for species meadow 
models. The available validation dataset was used to create a confusion 
matrix for image classifications. Based on the confusion matrix, metrics 
as  overall  (O.A.),  producer  (P.A.)  and  user  (U.A.)  accuracy  for  each 
classified class were calculated (Congalton, 1991). O.A. represents the 
proportion  of  correctly  classified  validation  samples  (found along  the 
diagonal in the error matrix) to the total number of validation samples, 
irrespective of class. P.A. quantifies the proportion of accurately clas-

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions that multiple runs with different numbers of trees were performed, suggesting that some form of iterative process or convergence criterion might have been employed. Additionally, the use of cross-validation techniques indicates that model performance was evaluated during training. Nevertheless, without further details, we cannot definitively state what exact criteria were used to decide when training should be stopped.
