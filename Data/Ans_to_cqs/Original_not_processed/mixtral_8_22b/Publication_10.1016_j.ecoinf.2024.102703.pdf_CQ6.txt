Build a three-layer back propagation (BP) artificial neural network 
using MATLAB R2014b (Lin et al., 2021). The first layer (i.e. the input 
layer) corresponded to the aCDOM(254) and Fn(355) respectively. The 
intermediate layer (i.e. hidden layers) and the last layer (i.e. the output 
layer)  comprised  a  single  neuron,  that  corresponded  to  the  predictor 
(TSI). Set the maximum training times to 10,000 and the training error 
to 0.001. 64 water samples were utilized for model calibration, with the 
remaining  used  for  validation.  Validation  accuracy  was  assessed  by 
calculating the coefficient of determination (R2) and root-mean-square 
error (RMSE) between the measured and predicted TSI. The RMSE was 
determined using Eq. (6).

The BP neural network is among the most widely used neural net-
works. Due to its self-adaptability, self-organization, and fault tolerance, 
this  model  is  highly  effective  in  simulating  the  relationship  between 
spectral reflectance and water composition. It’s worth considering that 
aCDOM(254) still yielded a higher R2 value (R2 = 0.76) when predicting 
TSI, whereas Fn(355) still produced a higher R2 value (R2 = 0.71) when 
predicting TSI. We believe that the prediction results of the two models 
can be used as strong evidence for predicting TSI using DOM. This novel 
approach overcomes the limitations of traditional methods by utilizing 
DOM optical parameters, particularly the CDOM absorption coefficient, 
for  accurate  eutrophication  prediction.  It  was  also  mentioned  that 
aCDOM(254)  is  related  to  water  quality  parameters  such  as  DOC  and

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps may be necessary depending on the nature of the data. These steps help improve the performance and efficiency of the model. Some common preprocessing techniques include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing or correcting erroneous data points, handling missing values, and eliminating outliers. Properly cleaned data ensures better model performance and prevents misleading predictions.

2. Normalization: In this step, the range of independent variables is adjusted to a standard scale without distorting differences in the ranges of values or losing information. Common normalization techniques include Min-Max Scaling, Z-score normalization, and Log Transformation. Normalizing the data helps prevent any one feature from dominating the others due to its larger numerical values.

3. Feature Selection: Selecting relevant features from the dataset reduces dimensionality and improves computational efficiency. Techniques like correlation analysis, mutual information, and recursive feature elimination can be employed for selecting important features.

4. Data Augmentation: To increase the size of the dataset artificially, various transformations like rotation, zooming, flipping, etc., can be applied to existing images. This technique is commonly used in image classification tasks.

5. Encoding Categorical Variables: For categorical variables, encoding them into numerical form is essential for feeding them into machine learning algorithms. Label encoding and One-Hot encoding are popular techniques for converting categorical variables into numbers.

These preprocessing steps ensure that the data fed into the deep learning model is clean, normalized, and ready for efficient processing. However, it should be noted that not all these steps might be required for every problem; the choice depends on the specific requirements and constraints of each case.
