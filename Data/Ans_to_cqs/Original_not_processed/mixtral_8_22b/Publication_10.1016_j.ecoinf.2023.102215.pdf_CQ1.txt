networks often fail in extracting global information from shallow layers 
because of the small receptive fields (Liu et al., 2019b; Liu et al., 2021). 
For  creating  feature  maps  with  much  global  information,  multiple 
dilated convolutions are used for shallow layers (Zhao et al., 2020)— 
which, however, entail more computation resources. U2-Net defines a 
two-level  nested  model  (i.e.,  a  stack  of  nested  encoder-decoder)  to 
capture the contextual information in different scales at a moderate level 
of computation cost.

of dilated convolution with various dilated rates to enlarge the receptive 
field, which not only extracts richer global information but also saves 
significant time and memory resources.

We use different global-feature extractors at different levels for the 
following two reasons. First, a deeper global feature extractor at shallow 
levels  facilitates  reserving  continuous  information.  To  extract  global 
context,  a  straightforward  approach  is  to  enlarge  the  receptive  field, 
which  is  often  achieved  through  dilated  convolution.  If  the  dilated 
convolution is directly conducted on the high-resolution feature maps, 
however,  the  continuous  information  contained  in  them  will  be  lost. 
Thus,  we  apply  more  convolution  and  pooling  operations  at  shallow 
levels before conducting dilated convolution to extract as much original 
continuity information as possible. Second, a series of dilated convolu-
tions at deeper levels facilitates extracting richer global context infor-
mation. At deeper levels, the input feature map’s resolutions are small in 
comparison to those of the shallow layers. Thus, we directly use a group

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific method or source for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the authors might have used publicly available datasets or collected their own dataset using sensors or other means based on the nature of their research. For instance, they could have used sensors like cameras to capture images for tasks such as image classification, object detection, or semantic segmentation. They may also have used existing datasets like ImageNet, COCO, or Pascal VOC for training and evaluating their models. Nevertheless, without explicit information about the data collection process, this remains speculative.
