chlorophyll under the three coverage conditions. The improvements of 
our rice LCC estimation model based on crop coverage compared with 
previous models are mainly the following two points.

%Query
Query: "How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific details about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether a grid search or random search method was used for optimization.
