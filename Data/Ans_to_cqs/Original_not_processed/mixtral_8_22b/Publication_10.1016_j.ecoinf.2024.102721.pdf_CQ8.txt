%Query
Query: "Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The article does not provide information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The authors mention using TensorFlow, Keras, and Scikit-learn libraries but do not specify any specific repositories or links to their code. Therefore, it is not possible to determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available based solely on this article.
