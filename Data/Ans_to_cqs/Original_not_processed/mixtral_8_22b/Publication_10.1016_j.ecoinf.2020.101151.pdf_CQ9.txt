for the FWI and FFMC data layers with a spatial resolution of 1 × 1 km.
The nine-cell approach, the results of which are shown in this paper, led
to slightly better prediction results of the variants, likely because it
smoothed existing data inaccuracies within single grid cells.

The FWI and its sub-indices are estimated by the Austrian Central
Institute of Meteorology and Geodynamics
für
Meteorologie und Geodynamik, ZAMG), using the INCA approach
(Integrated Nowcasting through Comprehensive Analysis). INCA pro-
vides short-term forecasts and analysis of temperature, relative air
humidity, rainfall, and other parameters on a spatial resolution of
1 × 1 km nationwide (ZAMG, 2019). The model requires topographic
information for a realistic description of the local weather conditions.
However, as the resolution is limited to 1 × 1 km, effects of aspect or
slope inclination cannot be depicted at a fine-scale. Wind is the most
crucial factor regarding fire propagation (Chuvieco et al., 2010). Yet,
there is no reliable high-resolution wind model for the mountainous
region of Austria available that could be used to model fire behavior.
Therefore, the factor wind was excluded in the current approach.

mean a “very low” (1) fire danger, yellow “low” (2) and orange “moderate” (3). (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is

and the FFMC was the underlying index in 2019. All cells with a danger
class of 3 to 5 were evaluated as false alerts. Data grid cells above
timberline and in non-burnable areas were excluded from this in-
vestigation.

We applied Pearson's chi square tests to test for significant differ-
ences in the performance of the FWI, the FFMC and the variants of the
IFDS. We applied linear regressions to analyze the relationship between

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given information, there is no mention of where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It does not specify any repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I am unable to provide the requested information.
