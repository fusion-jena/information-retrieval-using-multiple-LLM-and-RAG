Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

2.3. Algorithm training and testing 

We trained all algorithms on a random subset of 5256 pictures (80% 

of  the  6570-picture  dataset).  To  gauge  performance  consistency,  the 
training-testing  process  was  repeated  10  times  for  each  algorithm;  in 
each of these (pseudo-)replicate runs, all five algorithms used the same 
training and testing picture subsets.

We  also  tested  four  ‘classical’  machine-learning  algorithms:  Ada-
Boost Multi-Class Adaptive Boosting (‘AB’ hereafter), Gradient Boosting 
(‘GB’  hereafter),  Histogram-based  Gradient  Boosting  (‘HB’  hereafter), 
and  a  linear  discriminant  model  (‘LD’  hereafter).  Instead  of  directly 
taking  pictures  as  input,  these  algorithms  use  numerical  ‘features’ 
extracted from, and representing attributes of, those pictures. We used 
Inovtaxon (Bambil et al., 2020) to extract 226 picture features (namely, 
36  colour  features,  135  shape  features,  and  55  texture  features)  that 
were used as input to feed the algorithms (see Bambil et al., 2020 and htt 
ps://github.com/DeborahBambil/Inovtaxon  for  details;  see  also  Hu, 
1962;  Zhao  and  Pietikainen,  2007;  Flusser  et  al.,  2009;  Deniz  et  al., 
2011; Nascimento et al., 2023).

2. Methods 

2.1. Bug-picture database

database into training (80%) and testing sets (20%), and then trained and tested a convolutional neural network 
(AlexNet,  AN);  three  boosting-based  classifiers  (AdaBoost,  AB;  Gradient  Boosting,  GB;  and  Histogram-based 
Gradient Boosting, HB); and a linear discriminant model (LD). We assessed identification accuracy and speci-
ficity with logit-binomial generalized linear mixed models fit in a Bayesian framework. Differences in perfor-
mance across algorithms were mainly driven by AN’s essentially perfect accuracy and specificity, irrespective of 
picture angle or bug position. HB predicted accuracies ranged from ~0.987 (Panstrongylus, dorsal-oblique) to 
>0.999  (Triatoma,  dorsal-flat).  AB  accuracy  was  poor  for  Rhodnius  (~0.224–0.282)  and  Panstrongylus 
(~0.664–0.729), but high for Triatoma (~0.988–0.991). For Panstrongylus, LD and GB had predicted accuracies

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based solely on the provided context. However, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and landmark annotation. These techniques help label the data and train the deep learning models effectively.
