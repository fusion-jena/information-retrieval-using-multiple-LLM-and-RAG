The Random Forest model  is an  ensemble learning  technique that 
combines  multiple  decision  trees  to  make  predictions.  In  regression 
tasks, the Random Forest Regression (RFR) algorithm constructs several 
independent  decision  trees  by  randomly  sampling  data  and  features. 
Each  tree  generates  predictions,  and  the  final  regression  result  is  ob-
tained by aggregating predictions from all trees in the forest. Notably, 
the RFR model exhibits strong noise resilience and reduces the risk of 
overfitting. The RFR method is particularly advantageous in nearshore 
bathymetry  studies,  as  it  doesn’t  require  prior  knowledge  of  water 
properties  or  seabed  type,  enhancing  accuracy  in  predicting  water 
depths.  To  implement  the  RFR  model,  we  utilized  the  Python  pro-
gramming  language,  importing  the  RFR  algorithm  from  the  ‘sklearn’ 
library.  Fine-tuning  the  model  parameters  -  such  as  ‘n_estimators’,

by selecting features and thresholds that minimize the variance of the 
target  variable  within  each  subset.  This  iterative  process  employs  a 
greedy  algorithm,  gradually  building  the  tree  until  specific  stopping 
conditions  are  met.  The  key  components  of  CART  involve  feature  se-
lection, tree generation, and pruning. For our implementation, we uti-
lized the Python programming language to build the CART model. The 
CART algorithm was imported from the ‘sklearn’ library in Python. To 
optimize the regression decision tree for efficiency and suitability, we 
fine-tuned  specific  model  parameters  such  as  ‘max_depth’,  ‘min_sam-
ples_leaf’, and ‘max_leaf_nodes’. Ultimately, we set these parameters to 
8,  5,  and  20,  respectively.  These  parameter  values  were  selected  to 
prevent overfitting and minimize cross-validation error in our model.

Helpful Answer:
In the context of the given information, there isn't any direct mention of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, specifically regarding random seed values. However, some general strategies can be applied to manage randomness in machine learning models like Random Forest Regression (RFR).

Randomness in RFR comes mainly from two sources: bootstrap samples used to train individual trees and the random selection of features during node splitting. To control this randomness, one common strategy is setting a fixed seed value before training the model. By doing so, the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers will be generated every time the code runs, ensuring reproducibility and consistency across different executions.

Additionally, techniques like k-fold cross-validation can help assess the performance of the model on unseen data while reducing variability caused by randomness. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into 'k' folds, where each fold serves as a test set once, while the remaining folds form the training set. This approach provides a more robust estimate of the model's performance compared to a single train-test split.

Lastly, hyperparameter tuning plays a crucial role in optimizing the performance of RFR models. Grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization methods can be employed to find the best combination of hyperparameters, including the number of estimators ('n_estimators'), maximum depth ('max_depth'), minimum samples per leaf ('min_samples_leaf'), etc. Proper tuning of these parameters helps reduce overfitting and improves the overall stability of the model.
