Acknowledging  that  water  quality  observations  from  monitoring 
stations are limited to specific scenarios, and with the aim of applying 
CNN  for  detailed,  small-scale  predictions,  a  carefully  defined  spatial 
extent was essential. Initially, a radius of 500 m (25 pixels) was selected 
for the CNN's training and testing phases, and the accuracy for sizes both 
larger and smaller than 25 pixels was evaluated. In the end, the image 
with 21 pixels had the highest accuracy (a measure of the overall cor-
rectness),  reaching  83.87%  (Fig.  4a).  Additionally,  metrics  such  as 
precision (a measure of how many correctly predicted positive instances 
there are among all instances predicted as positive), recall (measures the 
ability of the model to capture all the positive instances), F1 score (the 
harmonic mean of precision and recall) and confusion matrix (Fig. 4b) 
were computed for 21 pixels, and the coverage area of 21 pixel size in

the study area is shown in Fig. 5. The CNN structure, depicted in Fig. 3, 
comprises five convolutional layers, one pooling layer; three fully con-
nected  layers,  and  three  water-quality  level  labels  including  Class  I, 
Class II, and Class III. To enhance model reliability, a dropout function 
was incorporated between the fully connected layers. Parameters were 
set with a kernel size of 3, stride of 1, and a dropout rate of 50% post the 
fully connected layer. The training was conducted over 500 epochs with 
(cid:0) 4, momentum at 0.9, with the learning rate 
an initial learning rate of 10
halved  every  20  rounds  to  optimize  performance,  culminating  in  the 
selection of the most effective model weights for each cycle.

features; ReLU (The Rectified Linear Unit) refers to the activation function, which is used to perform nonlinear mapping of the output results of the convolutional 
layer; the pooling layer (this study uses max pooling) is used to reduce the dimension of the feature map; the fully connected layers are used to classify input images 
into labels.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, several metrics are used. These include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Accuracy measures the overall correctness of the model by comparing the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions made. Precision measures the proportion of true positives (correctly identified positive instances) out of all instances predicted as positive. Recall measures the ability of the model to capture all the positive instances. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances these two factors. In this case, the authors also use a confusion matrix to further assess the performance of their model.
