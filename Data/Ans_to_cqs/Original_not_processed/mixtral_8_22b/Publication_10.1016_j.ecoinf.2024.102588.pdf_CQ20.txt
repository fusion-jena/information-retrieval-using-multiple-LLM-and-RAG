biases (Chen et al., 2020). The weight share of a kernel can reduce the 
large number of parameters required to extract features from complex 
data (Garland and Gregg, 2018). The addition of several kernels enables 
the  CNN model to learn extra-complicated features from multidimen-
sional inputs (Alzubaidi et al., 2021). The operation of the convolutional 
layer is as follows:

12.282, and 13.897 for the validation (Fig. 5a-f). Table 3 lists the mean 
and standard deviation values of the NSE and RMSE driven by the 10- 
fold  cross-validation  of  the  deep  learning  models.  The  CNN  model 
with  the  autoencoder  showed  better  estimation  performance  for  TDI, 
BMI, and FAI than the CNN model estimation without the autoencoder

This  study  used  evaluation  metrics  to  estimate  aquatic  ecosystem 
health  indices  (Moriasi  et  al.,  2007).  The  Nash–Sutcliffe  efficiency 
(NSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and percentage bias (PBIAS) 
were  used  to  measure  the  accuracy  of  the  performance  of  the  deep 
learning  models, including the  CNN model and  CNN with an  autoen-
coder, and conventional machine learning models with ANN, SVM, RF, 
and  XGBoost  for  estimating  TDI,  BMI,  and  FAI  values.  The  NSE  is  a 
commonly  used  score  in  hydrological  and  environmental  models  and 
measures the relative magnitude of the residual variance, indicating the 
degree  of  1:1  line  fitness  of  the  observed  versus  estimated  data  plot 
(Moriasi  et  al.,  2007;  Nash  and  Sutcliffe,  1970).  NSE  ranges  from 
negative infinity to 1, and the mean observed value is used as a refer-
ence.  In  other  words,  an  NSE  below  zero  implies  that  the  estimation

2.4.2. Convolutional neural network 

CNN is a type of deep learning algorithm primarily used for image 
recognition and processing tasks (Chauhan et al., 2018). It’s composed 
of multiple layers, including convolutional layers that apply kernels to 
extract  features  from  input  images,  followed  by  pooling  layers  that 
reduce  the  spatial  dimensions  of  the  features.  CNNs  are  designed  to 
automatically learn hierarchical representations of data, making them 
highly effective for tasks like object detection, image classification, and 
even natural language processing (Khan et al., 2020). That is, the CNN 
architecture  was  designed  to  efficiently  process  complex  datasets 
(Alshehhi et al., 2017). Convolutional layers adopt internal kernel op-
erations that calculate nonlinear features using trainable weights and
