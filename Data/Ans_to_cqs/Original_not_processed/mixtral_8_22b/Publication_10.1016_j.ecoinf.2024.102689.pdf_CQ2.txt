Helpful Answer:
The papers mentioned in the given context primarily focus on various aspects of deep learning applications in marine life research, including fish recognition, underwater target detection, and fish feeding action recognition. Based on these sources, it can be observed that several types of data formats are utilized in the deep learning pipelines.

In terms of visual data, many studies employ image datasets derived from MRI scans or digital photography for tasks such as fish classification, individual zebra identification, and underwater target detection. For instance, Lei et al. (2022) use YOLOv5, which is a real-time object detection model designed for images, while Lu et al. (2020) utilize deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) for identifying the species of harvested tuna and billfish using images. Similarly, Tamou et al. (2018) work on recognizing live fish in water using deep learning models trained on image datasets.

Moreover, some researchers also incorporate video data into their deep learning pipelines. Spampinato et al. (2008) propose a method for detecting, tracking, and counting fish in low-quality unconstrained underwater videos. Tseng and Kuo (2020) develop a DCNN-based approach for detecting and counting harvested fish and identifying fish types in Electronic Monitoring System (EMS) videos. Additionally, Måløy et al. (2019) introduce a spatio-temporal recurrent network for recognizing salmon feeding actions from underwater videos in aquaculture.

Audio data has been explored as well in the context of marine life research. Laplante et al. (2021) present a study on fish recognition in underwater environments using deep learning and audio data. They combine both acoustic and visual information to improve the accuracy of fish species identification.

While not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, other common data formats like CSV files could potentially be used in preprocessing stages or for storing metadata related to the primary dataset. However, the main focus of the discussed papers revolves around utilizing image, video, and audio data within the deep learning frameworks.
