Further  discussions  analyze  IFTL  and  FTL  for  their  abilities  to 
improve learning by restricting overconfidence (controlling hesitancy) 
during TL by considering GRNN and SVR as the TUR. Overconfidence in 
ELM,  GRNN,  or  SVR  arises  when  they  make  predictions  on  a  dataset 
(target  domain) that has a huge data distribution difference from the 
source domain data on which they are trained. In this scenario, they just 
use their training experience to make predictions during testing without 
considering the distribution divergence in the testing dataset from the 
training  dataset.  We  conclude  this  section  with  the  execution  time 
analysis of the approaches.  

a)  GDP prediction using only CO2 emission data2

We have found that the proposed approach efficiently captured the 
uncertainty produced by extreme variations in data distribution or the 
predictive tasks across the source and target data. It suitably restricted 
overconfidence  for  better  learning  while  transferring  the  learned 
knowledge. IFTL outperformed FTL, where the training and testing do-
mains (including labels) have huge data distribution differences. This 
validated  the  effectiveness  of  hesitancy  in  restricting  overconfidence 
during TL. IFTL is also thoroughly analyzed for its asymptotic compu-
tational complexity and execution time. The limitation of IFTL is that it 
adds  additional  computation  by  calculating  membership,  non- 
membership,  hesitancy  margin  of  each  feature,  and  the  distance 
metric for refining the output labels predicted by other ML approaches.

impact of refinement in Eq. (19) is controlled by γ (gamma). The value of 
γ if chosen too high, then the importance of good prediction by the TUR 
model is not optimally utilized, and if γ is too small, then IFTL will give 
results nearly equivalent to that of the prediction of ML approaches.

calculating intuitionistic hesitation degree by utilizing the variance 
of the data differences among different domains. 

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Related research works 
in TL and domain adaptation are discussed in Section 2. In Section 3, 
essential mathematical preliminaries are explained. Section 4 explains 
the  proposed  IFTL  approach  and  a  novel  procedure  for  selecting  an 
intuitionistic  hesitation  degree.  Section  5  discusses  the  experimental 
results of our approach. Finally, Section 6 concludes with a discussion of 
the work and highlights some future research scopes.

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, we can infer that the authors might use common machine learning practices such as monitoring the validation loss or accuracy to decide when to stop training.

In general, training is often stopped when the model performance on the validation set stops improving significantly or starts degrading. This could be indicated by a plateau or increase in the validation loss, or a decrease in validation accuracy. Additionally, early stopping techniques may be employed to prevent overfitting, where training is halted once the validation error begins to rise even though the training error continues to fall.

However, since these details aren't explicitly mentioned in the provided context, it would be best to refer to the original paper or related literature for more precise information regarding the completion criteria for training in this particular case.
