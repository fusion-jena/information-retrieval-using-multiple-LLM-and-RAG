artificial neural networks (ANN) (Men et al., 2022). The efficacy of these 
algorithms exhibits considerable variation across diverse aquatic envi-
ronments. For instance, the Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of 
Spectral  Hypercubes  (FLAASH)  model,  originally  developed  for  land 
pixels,  has  proven  effective  in  AC  for  aquatic  environments  utilizing 
Sentinel-2  and  SPOT-6  imagery  (Rotta  et  al.,  2016;  Li  et  al.,  2023a, 
2023b, 2023c, 2023d). Additionally, the FLAASH algorithm mitigates 
the  spatial  proximity  effect  by  employing  an  internal  pixel  averaging 
technique, which is essential for attaining high-quality AC (Wang et al., 
2021).  In  investigations  of  lacustrine  environments  using  Advanced 
Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) AVNIR-2 data, the efficacy of AC al-
gorithms  predicated  on  the  single  scattering  approximation  has  been 
significantly enhanced (Matsui and Kageyama, 2022). The Atmospheric

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific purpose of a deep learning model used in this study. However, it mentions several algorithms and models used for atmospheric correction (AC) in various aquatic environments, such as the Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes (FLAASH) model and algorithms based on the single scattering approximation. These methods are employed to improve the quality of remote sensing data obtained from sensors like Sentinel-2, SPOT-6, and Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) AVNIR-2.

Additionally, there is mention of a paper titled "A comparative evaluation of deep convolutional neural network and deep neural network-based land use/land cover classifications of mining regions using fused multi-sensor satellite data" (Kumar & Gorai, 2023), which suggests that deep learning models may be used for land use/land cover classification purposes. However, without more context or direct reference to a specific deep learning model within this research, we cannot definitively state its purpose.
