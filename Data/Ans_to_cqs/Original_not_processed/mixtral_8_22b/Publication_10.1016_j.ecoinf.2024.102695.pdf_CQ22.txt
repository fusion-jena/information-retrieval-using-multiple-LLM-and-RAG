model, originates from hydrology and related environmental sciences. 
This metric provides an overall performance evaluation by considering 
the correlation, variability, and bias of the tested model.

rate of 0.05 is implemented. Throughout the training process, a learning 
rate of 0.0001 is used, with 300 training epochs and 24 data instances 
processed  per  batch.  To  prevent  data  snooping  bias,  the  dataset  is 
divided chronologically: 70% for the training set, 10% for the validation 
set, and 20% for the test set. This allocation strategy better simulates 
real-world scenarios, ensuring that the data in the validation and test 
sets differ from the training set data, thereby enhancing the generaliz-
ability of the model. All the tests are run on a Windows 11 operating 
system  using  Python  3.8,  with  specific  hardware,  including  a  laptop 
possessing a 12th-Gen Intel Core i7-12700H GPU at 2.30 GHz and an 
NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 GPU. Due to the early stopping strategy, the 
training process converges before the last epoch, preventing overfitting 
issues.

prediction performance. Finally, the multi-information dependence and 
nonlinear trend  of DO data make key features dynamically related at 
multiple  time  scales  and  data  scales.  Existing  attention  mechanisms 
usually perform attention calculations in a single time domain or fre-
quency  domain,  which  overlooks  fine-grained  and  multiscale  feature 
information  in  long-term  prediction  tasks,  thereby  reducing  the  pre-

Helpful Answer: The text does not explicitly mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does state that the model's performance is evaluated using an overall performance metric that considers the correlation, variability, and bias of the model. This suggests that the evaluation may include metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), or similar measures that assess these aspects of the model's predictions. It also mentions that a learning rate of 0.0001 is used during training, which could indicate the use of some form of gradient descent optimization algorithm. Additionally, the text notes that the dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets, suggesting that cross-validation techniques might be employed to further evaluate the model's performance.
