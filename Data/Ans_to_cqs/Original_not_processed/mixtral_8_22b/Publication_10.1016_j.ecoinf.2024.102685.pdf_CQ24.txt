2.4.1. Random forest classification

Random  Forest  is  a  machine  learning  method  combining  decision 
trees  and  bootstrapping.  Developed  by  Breiman  (2001),  RF  has  been 
found to be insensitive to overtraining, small or noisy datasets. Every 
decision tree in the implemented RF algorithm is trained with a boot-
strapped sample of the training data and, at every split node, a subset of 
randomly  selected  features  is  utilized.  Then  for  each  pixel,  the  final 
classification  is  obtained  by  a  majority  vote.  RF  has  proven  to  be  an 
effective tool for mapping coastal and seagrass habitats (Fauzan et al., 
2021; Traganos and Reinartz, 2018b; Wicaksono et al., 2019). Two sets 
of RF models were performed using the multispectral images retrieved in 
2010. In the first set, the response variable was the presence/absence of 
the total seagrass meadows (hereafter identified as seagrass meadows), 
where areas with <20% seagrass cover were considered absence (Valle

intervals) between years by making the years as uniform as possible or 
(ii) by developing of a methodological approach that allows the annual 
characterization of seasonal intervals.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information about specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it discusses the use of Random Forest, a machine learning method that combines decision trees and bootstrapping. Bootstrapping involves creating multiple subsets of the original dataset and building separate models for each subset, which can help manage randomness and improve model performance. Additionally, Random Forest uses randomly selected features at every split node, further introducing variability into the modeling process. These techniques may indirectly address some aspects of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
