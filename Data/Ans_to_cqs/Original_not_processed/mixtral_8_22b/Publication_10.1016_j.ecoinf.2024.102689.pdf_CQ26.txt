distillation methods, which have been surveyed extensively and proven 
effective  in  model  compression  through  distillation  and  quantization 
(Gou  et  al.,  2021;  Polino  et  al.,  2018  preprint:  not  peer  reviewed). 
Through this comprehensive suite of improvements and optimizations, 
we aspire to develop lightweight yet powerful fish individual recogni-
tion algorithms, thereby providing robust technical support for intelli-
gent aquaculture and marine ecological protection initiatives.

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it is important to note that these techniques can be crucial in ensuring fairness and accuracy in machine learning models.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same proportions of target classes in each set. This helps prevent skewed results due to imbalanced class distributions. Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to balance datasets by either duplicating examples from the minority class (oversampling) or removing examples from the majority class (undersampling). These methods help mitigate the impact of class imbalance on model performance. Lastly, diverse data collection refers to gathering data from various sources and populations to ensure that the model generalizes well across different scenarios.

While the given context does not directly discuss these techniques, they remain relevant considerations when developing deep learning pipelines for tasks like fish individual recognition and aquatic ecosystem management.
