Appendix B. Species representativeness analysis (SRI) 

For each cell (i), the SRI is the simple ratio between the observed number of species Sobs and the expected number of species (Sobs): SRIi = Sobs/Sexp. 

Maps for the smallers resolution analyzed (∼ 1

) are in Fig. A.2.

Fig. A.1. Classification of SRI values based on its frequency distribution. This histogram displays the frequency distribution of SRI (Species Richness Index) values 
and the corresponding class selection thresholds. Cells are categorized as follows: SRI < 0.6 are classified as low representativeness (L), SRI falling in the range (0.6, 
0.85) as medium representativeness (M), and SRI > 0.85 as high representativeness (H).

The Species  Richness Index (SRI)  is  used as a  metric to assess the 
databases accuracy in depicting actual species richness. Consequently, 
we propose a systematic categorization of cells into three classes, “low”, 
“medium”  and  “high”,  based  on  the  frequency  distribution  of  SRI,  as 
illustrated in Fig. A.1. Cells with only one record are identified as having 
insufficient  records  (IR)  for  estimating  Sest.  Those  with  an  SRI  in  the 
range  (0,  0.60)  are  categorized  as  low,  while  those  falling  within  the 
interval (0.60, 0.85) may be characterized as having a medium level of 
representativeness. Furthermore, cells within the range (0.85, 1.00) are 
identified  as  high,  meaning  an  adequate  representation  of  species  di-
versity.  Fig.  A.2  show  maps  illustrating  the  raw  values  for  observed 
species richness (Sobs), expected species richness (Sexp), and SRI values.

scales associated with data collection (Zizka et al., 2020). Due to these 
disparities,  scholars  recommend  a  thorough  examination  and  refine-
ment  of  these  data  repositories  (Bonnet-Lebrunm  et  al.,  2023).  To 
enhance the quality and reliability of the information, a comprehensive 
series  of  filters  has  been  systematically  applied  to  our  analysis.  To 
minimize errors associated with the public usage of GBIF and OBIS re-
positories,  we  curated  the  dataset  following  Zizka  et  al.  (2020)  and 
filtered the dataset by the columns labeled “scientific name”, “family”, 
“year”, “longitude” and “latitude”. We retained all taxonomic informa-
tion down to the species level and removed records with NA in these 
columns. We also removed all duplicate records with identical latitude

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide any information about the use or evaluation of a deep learning model. Therefore, it is impossible to determine which specific metrics were used to evaluate the performance of such a model. However, common metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, and area under the curve (AUC). These metrics help measure how well the model performs in predicting outcomes or classifying data. Without further context, I cannot specify which metrics were used in evaluating the performance of a deep learning model.
