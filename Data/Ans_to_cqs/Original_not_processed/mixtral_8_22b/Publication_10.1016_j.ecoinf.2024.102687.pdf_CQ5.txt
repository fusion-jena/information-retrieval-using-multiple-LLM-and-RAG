Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

pretrained DenseNet might fit the Darksound dataset well, but there are 
no  guarantees  that it  will  work  on  another  dataset in  the  exact  same 
manner. All the CNN backbones used in this experiment were previously 
trained on the ImageNet database, a large but very general dataset. It has 
been recently shown that using features extracted from models trained 
on smaller but more specific datasets, that bird sound datasets, leads to 
higher quality classification (Ghani et al., 2023; McGinn et al., 2023). 
Consequently, using features extracted from a model trained on spec-
trograms of bird sounds (e.g.  BirdNET algorithm (Kahl et  al., 2021)), 
could  improve  the  parameter  initialization  of  UML  algorithms  of  the 
MEC method.

The original feature extraction part of the meta-learning algorithms 
was replaced with a CNN backbone, that is ResNet18 (He et al., 2016), 
VGG16 (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2014), DenseNet121 (Huang et al., 
2017) and AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012). Transfer learning was used 
to  benefit  from  the  good  feature  extraction  capabilities  of  the  CNN 
previously trained on the ImageNet database (Deng et al., 2009). The 
ImageNet database contains 1000 object classes with 1,281,167 training 
images, 50,000 validation images, and 100,000 test images. Although 
this database does not contain spectrograms, its use in the context of 
ecoacoustics with DL is common and has allowed the learning of a va-
riety of image features useful for spectrogram classification (Florentin 
et al., 2020; Lasseck, 2019).

As  a  result,  fine-tuning  a  pretrained  DenseNet  on  the  Darksound 
dataset returned the highest DBCV scores in all cases, except RN com-
bined  with  AlexNet  fine-tuned  on  5  way-5  shot  tasks  (Table  4.3).  In 
addition, highest ARI and AMI scores were obtained in all cases using a 
pretrained  DenseNet,  except  with  MN  combined  with  ResNet18  fine- 
tuned  on  5  way-1  shot  tasks  (Table  4.2).  This  illustrates  the  impor-
tance of the DBCV score for determining the optimal CNN backbone for 
fine-tuning  the  model  without  knowledge  of  the  ground  truth  labels. 
Note  that  the  backbone  VGG16  never  performed  well  whatever  the 
configuration. 

Training  the  model  for  100  epochs  consumed  more  energy  when 
fine-tuning was performed on 5-way 5-shot tasks than on 5-way 1-shot 
tasks. The pretrained DenseNet consumed the most energy in 5 out of 6 
cases (Fig. 8).

Fig. 8. Estimation of the energy consumption related to the training of the models. This corresponds to the sum of CPU energy, GPU energy and RAMenergy in 
kilowatt-hour (kWh). Fine-tuning of four CNN backbones (i.e. ResNet18, VGG16, DenseNet121 and AlexNet) were accomplished on 5 way-1 shot (Left) and 5 way-5

Helpful Answer:
Two main datasets were mentioned in the given context. The first one is the ImageNet database, which was used to train various convolutional neural network (CNN) backbones such as ResNet18, VGG16, DenseNet121, and AlexNet. The ImageNet database consists of 1000 object classes with over 1 million training images, 50,000 validation images, and 100,000 test images. However, it should be noted that the ImageNet database does not contain spectrograms.

The second dataset mentioned is the Darksound dataset, which was used to fine-tune the pretrained DenseNet. The results showed that fine-tuning a pretrained DenseNet on the Darksound dataset returned the highest DBCV scores in almost all cases, indicating the importance of selecting the appropriate dataset for fine-tuning the model.

Additionally, recent studies have suggested that using features extracted from models trained on smaller but more specific datasets can lead to higher quality classification. For instance, using features extracted from a model trained on spectrograms of bird sounds could potentially improve the parameter initialization of unsupervised machine learning (UML) algorithms of the maximum entropy classifier (MEC) method.
