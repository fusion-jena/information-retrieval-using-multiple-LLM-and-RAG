4.3. Model performance 

All algorithms were evaluated using the same dataset, and five EL 
models were established for both the Chla concentration and turbidity: 
RF,  GBDT,  LightGBM,  XGBoost,  and  CatBoost.  Before  tuning  each 
model, we established a benchmark model with default parameters to 
evaluate  whether  parameter  adjustments  had  a  beneficial  impact  on 
model performance. Hyperparameter optimisation was performed using 

both the random grid search and Bayesian optimisation methods, which 
were  implemented  using  GridSearchCV  from  Scikit-learn  and  the 
Hyperopt  library (version 0.2.7).  We selected the best  parameters  for 
each model and compared the results.

L). Overall, the performance of RF and GBDT was weaker than that of 
CatBoost. However, in our experiment, the training and hyperparameter 
optimisation times for CatBoost were significantly longer than those of 
the  other  models,  which  may  be  due  to  the  complex  internal  feature 
processing  of  the  model  and  the  fact  that  we  did  not  use  a  GPU  for 
training. For Nansi Lake, XGBoost demonstrated the highest robustness 
for estimating the water Chla concentration and turbidity.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps used after model training. However, it can be inferred that some common postprocessing steps might have been employed given the nature of the study. These could include metrics calculation such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score to evaluate the performance of the models. Additionally, confusion matrices might have been generated to visualize the performance of the classifiers. The study also mentions the use of hyperparameter optimization techniques like random grid search and Bayesian optimization, suggesting that cross-validation might have been used during this process. Lastly, since the study focuses on tracking changes in chlorophyll-a concentration and turbidity, saliency maps might have been utilized to understand the importance of different features in predicting these variables.
