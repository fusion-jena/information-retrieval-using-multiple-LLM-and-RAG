Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

• No-overfitting. In this setting, the optimization algorithm of CNNs is 
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), with a learning rate of 0.0001 
and a weight decay of 0.5. The batch size is set to 32, the number of 
training epochs to 200 and finally the batch-norm and dropout (0.5) 
are used to reduce the overfitting level.  

• Overfitting.  We  use  the  same  hyperparameters  setting  as  the  no- 
overfitting  but  we  remove  the  use  of  batch-norm,  weight  decay 
and dropout techniques to ensure that the model overfits.

Camera traps, specialized stationary camera configurations and un-
controlled video recordings represent valuable visual data sources for 
monitoring,  species  identification,  and  individual  animal  recognition 
through  the  utilization  of  machine  learning  models  (Schneider  et  al., 
2019). Neural networks, including in particular Convolutional Neural 
Networks  (CNNs),  have  recently  witnessed  significant  progress, 
becoming the preferred choice for various image processing tasks (Nazir 
and  Kaleem,  2021),  including  image  classification  (He  et  al.,  2016a), 
image segmentation (Pollicelli et al., 2020) and face recognition (Taig-
man  et  al.,  2014),  following  the  groundbreaking  from  the  work  of 
Krizhevsky,  Sutskever  and  Hinton  (Krizhevsky  et  al.,  2012).  Further-
more,  machine  learning approaches  have  been  applied  for animal  re- 
identification  such  as  elephant  (Kulits  et  al.,  2021),  snow  leopard

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the data format used is images or videos since the text discusses using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image processing tasks like image classification, image segmentation, and face recognition. Additionally, the context mentions utilizing machine learning models for monitoring, species identification, and individual animal recognition through the utilization of camera traps, specialized stationary camera configurations, and uncontrolled video recordings. Therefore, it can be concluded that the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are primarily images and videos.
