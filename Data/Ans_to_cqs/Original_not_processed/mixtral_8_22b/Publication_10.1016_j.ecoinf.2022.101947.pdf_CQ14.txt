4.5. Comparative material costs for implementation of FIT

Whilst the basic approach of the pugmark technique led to inaccur-
acies of population estimates, we have demonstrated in this study that a 
robust  and  statistically  valid  approach  such  as  FIT,  if  included  in  a 
methodological  framework  that  can  satisfy  sampling-based  survey 
methodology requirements (Gopalaswamy et al., 2019), has the poten-
tial to be a useful tool to provide optimal census and monitoring capa-
bility through tiger ranges. When FIT is used by data collection teams 
that have even rudimentary tracking skills, it can overcome the reser-
vations put forward about the use of footprints for conservation moni-
toring (Karanth et al., 2003). For  example, field operatives with very 
basic  training  or  accompanied  by  trackers  can  identify  left  and  right 
hind footprints and collect images according to the FIT protocol (an app 
is being developed to collect the necessary images with smartphones).

mean of the predicted test set size diverges from the actual test set size. 
Optimal classification accuracy was obtained when the test set size 
was smallest relative to the training set. However, even when the test to 
training set  ratio  was  32:12, the  predicted value  was  close  to the  ex-
pected value, demonstrating the robustness of the model.

Query: "How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide information on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. Therefore, I cannot determine whether they were optimized using methods like grid search or random search.
