2.3. Data scaling 

The final step refers to data scaling, and intrinsically to gap filling 
and data matching levels required by the user. Different scaling domains 
have been suggested by Fritsch et al. (2020). As the interest relies on 
aggregating  data  across  scales  prior  to  modelling,  our  approach  con-
forms  to  a  “pre-modelling  scaling”  protocol  (Fritsch  et  al.,  2020). 
Sequential  processes  were  implemented  within  GEE  for  scaling  up 
environmental  time  series  from  one  spatial  and/or  temporal  scale  to 
another during data extraction.

2.1. Data filtering

environmental  data  to  ecological  processes  (Chave,  2013;  Pettorelli 
et al., 2014).

The last step (data scaling) concerns  spatial and temporal scaling. 
Spatial scaling regards the scaling process applied to each metric of the 
time  series,  and  is  exemplified  below  by  a  parametrizable  function, 
namely addTexture_3 × 3_Mean, which includes neighbourhood opera-
tions  by  applying  spatial  moving  windows  (Fig.  1),  here  with  a  size 
(bandwidth) of 3 pixels, and the aggregation formula given by the mean 
(but see also addTexture_3 × 3_stdDev and NDVI_GLCM16bit functions in 
GEE_xtract codes).

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not contain information about any specific deep learning models or their development, including details regarding measures taken to ensure the generalizability of such models. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate response based solely on this context.

Based on the provided context, it appears that the authors are discussing environmental data processing steps, specifically focusing on data filtering and scaling. They mention using sequential processes within Google Earth Engine (GEE) for scaling up environmental time series from one spatial and/or temporal scale to another during data extraction. However, there is no reference to any deep learning models or techniques used for modeling purposes. Consequently, I am unable to determine what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, as none are mentioned in the provided text.
