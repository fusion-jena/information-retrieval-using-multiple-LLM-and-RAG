2.5. Model description 

2.5.1. MLPnn-MC modelling 

MLPnn-MC  modelling  integrates  the  multi-layer  perceptron  (MLP) 
algorithm  and  Markov  chain,  which  unravels  robust  future  LULC 
simulation (Gebresellase et al., 2023; Nasiri et al., 2019). The novelty of 
this model lies in the fact that it utilises deep machine learning to learn 
the model in automated mode in less calibration time through complex, 
multivariate, and non-linear relationships to create several transitions 
and predict unseen data within the model at a single time by compre-
hending the hidden relationships (Kumar and Agrawal, 2023). MLP is 
the  most  prevalent  machine  learning  algorithm  in  ANN  (Artificial 
Neural Network) modelling (Alla et al., 2021; Band et al., 2020), which 
uses  back  propagation  (BP)  or  the  reverse  method  of  automatic

of ecosystems (Nguyen et al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2016). In recent ad-
vances,  several  LULC  simulation  models,  including  the  MLP  neural 
network-Markov chain (MLPnn-MC) model (Nasiri et al., 2019; Vass and 
Elofsson, 2016; Vinayak et al., 2020), SD-CLUE-S model (Liang et al., 
2017), Logistic-CA-MC model (Guan et al., 2019), FLUS model (Liang 
et al., 2018), SLEUTH model (Kumar and Agrawal, 2022), PLUS model 
(Tao  et  al.,  2023)  and  others,  integrated  with  carbon  mapping  and 
valuation model, i.e., InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Ser-
vices  and  Tradeoffs),  have  emerged  as  reliable  techniques  providing 
promising results for stakeholders and decision-makers.

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The pipeline uses a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model, which is a type of feedforward artificial neural network. This model is part of the broader category of deep learning models but differs from other types such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or Transformers. The MLP model is characterized by its multiple layers of interconnected nodes, or neurons, where each node in one layer connects to every node in the next layer. It uses a process called backpropagation to adjust the weights and biases of these connections based on the error of the output compared to the desired result.
