In  our  study,  we  utilized  data  from  the  third  and  fourth  natural 
environment surveys, incorporating various environmental variables, to 
assess  the  impact  of  urban  development  on  species  distribution.  To 
achieve  this,  we  employed  seven  different  machine  learning  models, 
extracting the Area Under the Curve (AUC) values for each model both 
before and after urban development (Fig. 3). The AUC value, a critical 
measure of model performance, indicated that the Generalized Linear 
Model  (GLM)  and  Random  Forest  (RF)  models  had  the  highest  AUC 
value  of  0.85,  while  the  Classification  and  Regression  Tree  (CART) 
model  had  the  lowest  at  0.79.  On  average,  the  models  demonstrated 
robust performance with an average AUC value of 0.84, underscoring 
their overall effectiveness in species distribution modeling. Despite the 
methodological similarities among the models, their distinct character-

the species distribution model results were land cover, vegetation (forest

Slope,  and  TWI),  and  distance  (distance  to  water,  distance  to  forests, 
distance to agricultural land, distance to grassland, distance to roads, 
and distance to urban areas) (Kwon, 2014; Song and Kim, 2012). We 
conducted a correlation analysis of the variables before model imple-

required to achieve accurate parameterization (Hanski et al., 2000). The 
method proposed in this study can overcome the limitations of the IFM 
model  because  it  analyzes  the  species  distribution  model  results, 
focusing on species that are comparatively more difficult to monitor.

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, or validation sets. However, based on common practices in machine learning and deep learning, some possible ways to split the data could be:

1. Random splitting: This involves randomly dividing the dataset into three subsets - training set, validation set, and testing set. Typically, the ratio used is 60:20:20 or 70:15:15, but it depends on the size of the dataset and other factors.

2. Stratified sampling: In cases where the target variable has multiple classes, stratified sampling ensures that each subset contains approximately the same proportion of samples from each class. This helps prevent any bias towards certain classes during training.

3. Time series splitting: For time series datasets, it is important to maintain temporal order when splitting the data. One approach is to use a rolling window method, where the first n observations form the initial training set, followed by one observation for validation, then another observation for testing, and so on.

Without specific information about the nature of the data used in the study, it is impossible to determine which method was used. Nevertheless, these are some commonly used methods for splitting data in deep learning applications.
