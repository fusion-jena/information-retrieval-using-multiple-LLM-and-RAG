Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge, some common techniques include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting is a method where the dataset is divided into training and testing sets while maintaining the same class proportions in both sets. This ensures that the model learns from a representative sample of each class.

Oversampling involves duplicating examples from the minority class to balance it with the majority class. Undersampling, on the other hand, reduces the number of examples in the majority class to achieve balance. Both methods aim to prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.

Diverse data collection refers to gathering data from various sources to ensure that the dataset represents different scenarios and conditions. This helps to reduce bias caused by using data from only one source or condition.

These techniques can be applied individually or combined depending on the nature and complexity of the data bias.
