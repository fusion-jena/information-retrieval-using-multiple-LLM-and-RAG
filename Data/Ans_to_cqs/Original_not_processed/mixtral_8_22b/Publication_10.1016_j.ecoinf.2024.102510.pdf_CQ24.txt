The utilization of an imbalanced dataset for training a deep learning 
model may introduce inherent biases and limitations (Dong et al., 2018). 
It  is  important  to  acknowledge  that  the  dataset  used  may  not  fully 
capture  the  diverse  range  of  bird  populations  present  in  the  wild 
(Gregory and van Strien, 2010). This can result in a biased representa-
tion, potentially impacting the accuracy and generalization ability of the 
model. Factors such as geographical bias, limited sample sizes, or un-
derrepresentation of certain bird species can all contribute to this issue 
(Devenish-Nelson et al., 2019). Therefore, it is crucial to consider the 
limitations and potential biases of the training dataset when interpreting 
the results and making inferences about real-world bird species recog-
nition.  Additionally,  efforts  should  be  made  to  collect  more  compre-
hensive  and  diverse  datasets  that  better  reflect  the  true  variability  of

This study follows a hyperparameter optimization approach known 
as  the  Hybrid  Hyperparameter  Optimization  Scheme  (HHOS),  which 
combines  manual  and  random  search  methods  sequentially.  The  first 
step is manual search, which aims to identify optimal hyperparameter 
values  and  reduce  the  search  space.  This  is  achieved  by  selecting 
frequently used hyperparameter configurations that show effectiveness 
in  related  studies,  after  understanding  the  problem  at  hand.  Next, 
random  search  iteratively  samples  various  combinations  of  hyper-
parameter values identified in the manual search, trains the models with 
each set and identifies the hyperparameter configuration that yields the 
highest accuracy. 

The current study contributes to the field by:  

• Effectively utilizing transfer learning as a feature extractor and fine- 

tuner to train multiple classifiers

Helpful Answer:
In the context of the given information, there isn't any explicit mention of specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, particularly regarding random seed values. However, we can infer some possible approaches based on the described methodology.

Firstly, the use of the Hybrid Hyperparameter Optimization Scheme (HHOS) suggests that the authors have taken steps to mitigate the effects of randomness. By combining manual and random search methods, they aim to strike a balance between exploring the hyperparameter space effectively while also reducing the risk of missing optimal configurations due to subjectivity or randomness.

Secondly, the process of manually searching for frequently used hyperparameter configurations implies that the researchers have attempted to limit the scope of their investigation to those parameters that have shown promise in previous studies. This could help minimize the influence of random factors since these selected configurations would likely have been tested under different conditions and still yielded positive results.

Lastly, although not explicitly stated, one common strategy to address randomness in deep learning pipelines is fixing the random seed value. Fixing the random seed ensures reproducibility by generating consistent results across experiments. While this technique is not mentioned in the provided context, it remains a viable option for handling randomness in similar scenarios.
