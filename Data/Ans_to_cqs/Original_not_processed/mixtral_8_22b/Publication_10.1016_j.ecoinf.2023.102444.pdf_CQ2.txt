To our knowledge, this is the first application of UMAP to directly 
estimate species distribution based on an analysis of bioclimatic vari-
ables.  Other  studies  have  used  DRM  to  visualize  results  from  deep 
learning models; e.g., Deneu et al. (2022) used tSNE (another DRM) to 
visualize input data and the results of applying a convolutional neural 
network to model the distribution of species at a fine resolution. On the 
other hand, we applied clustering to identify groups containing species 
and near background points to highlight how bioclimatic heterogeneity 
between clusters in the reduced dimension translates to geographic re-
gions, i.e., to show that groups in the reduced dimension have similar 
bioclimatic  properties  within  a  group,  but  differ  among  groups  (see 
Figs. 6, 7). This behavior underlines the nature of UMAP in that back-
ground points near species samples share similar bioclimatic properties

The  volume  of  multivariate  data  increases  as  more  information  is 
generated in fields such as genomics, image analysis, population ecol-
ogy, and text processing. Dealing with multivariate data is a complex 
task that may lead to the curse of dimensionality; i.e., redundant or non- 
significant variables, degradation of model performance, and difficulty 
in visualizing the relationships between features (Anowar et al., 2021). 
To  address  these  problems,  dimensionality  reduction  methods  (DRM) 
provide tools to explore linear and non-linear featured relationships and 
help select and extract these from a multivariate space. Some examples 
of  linear  DRM  are  Principal  Components  Analysis,  Single  Value 
Decomposition,  and  Singular  Value  Decomposition  (Ayesha  et  al., 
2020).  However,  linear  DRM  cannot  address  more  complex  relation-
ships,  and  non-linear  DRM  have  thus  gained  importance  in  research.

(Parra-Hern´andez et al., 2020), and for classification of the structure of 
ecological communities (Miloˇsevi´c et al., 2022). Recent applications of 
UMAP  have  aimed  to  visualize  the  color  representation  of  Koi  fish 
(Kuncheva et al., 2023), identify acoustic features for monitoring bird 
communities (Morales et al., 2022), and discriminate vocalizations of 
the Crested Ibis (Zhao et al., 2023). Most of the applications of UMAP 
and other non-linear DRM help to visualize complex multivariate data 
sets through the reduction of dimensions, identification of clusters, and 
separation of classes.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that various types of data formats were utilized in different studies. For instance, one study mentioned using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to model species distributions, which typically use image data as input. Another study analyzed bird songs, suggesting the use of audio data. Additionally, there was a reference to dealing with multivariate data, which could imply the use of structured data like CSV files. Therefore, while the exact data formats used in each case are not specified, it appears that multiple formats including images, audio, and possibly structured data might have been employed depending on the specific requirements of each study.
