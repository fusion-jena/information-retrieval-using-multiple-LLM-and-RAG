their  convolutional  kernels  and  pooling  layers.  Regarding  this  issue, 
Zhang  et  al.  (2019)  incorporated  a  long  short-term  memory  (LSTM) 
network to develop a 3DCNN-LSTM model as a classifier, making the 
network more sensitive to the temporal changes in birdsong informa-
tion. It is important to note that the use of RNNs such as the CRNN model 
requires  more  computing  resources  for  training,  and  performance 
improvement is not always guaranteed. Another common approach to 
addressing  the  limitations  of  CNNs  is  to  introduce  attention  mecha-
nisms.  For  example,  Soundception  (Sevilla  and  Glotin,  2017)  was 
developed  by  introducing  time  and  time-frequency  attention  mecha-
nisms to Inception V4; the resulting model achieved first place in the 
BirdCLEF  2017  Competition.  Fu  et  al.  (2023)  proposed  an  improved 
ACGAN model named DR-ACGAN based on the residual structure and an

propagation. Then, the specific hierarchical features Fh,k(⋅) are obtained 
and  transmitted  to  the  classification  module.  This  module  consists  of 
parallel  K  fully-connected  layers  followed  by  a  softmax  activation 
̂
S = {̂s1, ̂s2, ⋯, ̂sK},  repre-
function,  which  generates  predicted  scores 
senting the probability of each class within the K classification levels. 
Finally, a path correction scheme is utilized to generate the predictive 
labels ̂y. Our primary objective is to learn the model parameters, namely 
θ = {θa, θb, θc}, through end-to-end training to enable the model for bird 
sound identification. More specific technical details are elaborated on in 
the subsequent sections.

The study of bird populations is crucial for biodiversity research and conservation. Deep artificial neural net-
works  have  revolutionized  bird  acoustic  recognition;  however,  most  methods  overlook  inherent  relationships 
among bird populations, resulting in the loss of biological information. To address this limitation, we propose the 
Phylogenetic  Perspective  Neural  Network  (PPNN),  which  incorporates  hierarchical  multilevel  labels  for  each 
bird. PPNN uses a hierarchical semantic embedding framework to capture feature information at different levels. 
Attention  mechanisms  are  employed  to  extract  and  select  common  and  distinguishing  features,  thereby 
improving classification accuracy. We also propose a path correction strategy to rectify inconsistent predictions. 
Experimental results on bird acoustic datasets demonstrate that PPNN outperforms current methods, achieving

The model’s activation positions tended to be more dispersed and in 
the long-range in the order and family branches. Conversely, the acti-
vation positions in the genus and species branches exhibited a higher 
degree of concentration and more similarities. However, the model oc-
casionally  detected  some  background  noise.  Overall,  this  shows  the 
model’s proficiency in accurately identifying bird vocalizations despite 
the  need  for  further  research  to  effectively  mitigate  background 
interference. 

5. Discussion 

Previous research has scarcely explored the integration of biological 
information into deep learning classifiers for bird acoustics. This study 
investigated the capability of deep learning algorithms to improve bird 
acoustic  identification  by  leveraging  hierarchical  structures,  with  a 
particular focus on discerning subtle differences in birdcalls within the 
same branch based on the phylogenetic “tree”.

Helpful Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is primarily for classification tasks. Specifically, it aims to identify bird sounds using a Phylogenetic Perspective Neural Network (PPNN). The model employs a hierarchical semantic embedding framework to capture feature information at different levels, utilizing attention mechanisms to enhance its ability to distinguish between various bird calls. The ultimate goal is to train the model to recognize bird sounds accurately, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling complex audio data.
