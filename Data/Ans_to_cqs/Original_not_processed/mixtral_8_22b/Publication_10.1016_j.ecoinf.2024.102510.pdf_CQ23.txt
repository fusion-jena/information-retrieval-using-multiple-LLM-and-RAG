The utilization of an imbalanced dataset for training a deep learning 
model may introduce inherent biases and limitations (Dong et al., 2018). 
It  is  important  to  acknowledge  that  the  dataset  used  may  not  fully 
capture  the  diverse  range  of  bird  populations  present  in  the  wild 
(Gregory and van Strien, 2010). This can result in a biased representa-
tion, potentially impacting the accuracy and generalization ability of the 
model. Factors such as geographical bias, limited sample sizes, or un-
derrepresentation of certain bird species can all contribute to this issue 
(Devenish-Nelson et al., 2019). Therefore, it is crucial to consider the 
limitations and potential biases of the training dataset when interpreting 
the results and making inferences about real-world bird species recog-
nition.  Additionally,  efforts  should  be  made  to  collect  more  compre-
hensive  and  diverse  datasets  that  better  reflect  the  true  variability  of

search  tests  various combinations of  the hyperparameters  identified in  manual  search and  trains the selected 
models to achieve the maximum possible accuracy through multiple iterations. Experimental analysis revealed 
that the Fine-tuned EfficientNetB0 model exhibited superior performance, achieving an accuracy of 99.12%. In 
contrast, the performance of the ResNet18 model was disappointing with an accuracy of 93.24%, while other 
models outperformed it.

Helpful Answer: The authors acknowledged the importance of considering the limitations and potential biases of the training dataset when interpreting the results and making inferences about real-world bird species recognition. They recognized that the dataset used might not fully capture the diverse range of bird populations present in the wild, which could lead to a biased representation and impact the accuracy and generalization ability of the model. To address these concerns, they employed several strategies to improve the generalizability of their deep learning model. Firstly, they utilized a 60:40 split of training and testing data, ensuring that the model had sufficient exposure to both seen and unseen data during its development. Secondly, they compared the performance of eight different pre-trained models, including MobileNetV2, EfficientNetB0, GoogleNet, DenseNet201, InceptionV3, ResNet18, InceptionResNetV2, and NASNetMobile, each with varying architectures and feature extraction capabilities. By selecting the best performing model based on validation accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, they aimed to minimize overfitting and enhance the robustness of their final solution. Lastly, they conducted a comprehensive hyperparameter optimization process, involving both manual and automated searches, to fine-tune the chosen model further. Through these combined efforts, the authors sought to create a deep learning model capable of accurately recognizing bird species across diverse environments and conditions.
