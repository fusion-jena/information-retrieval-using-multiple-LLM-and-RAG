factors: network architecture, protocol type of image acquisition
(Martineau et al., 2017), and robustness of input matrix (number
of entities and replicates). Our choice to use a ResNet-50 network
architecture, in combination with transfer learning, data augmen-
tation, and dropout proved appropriate for the current number of
taxa in our demonstration dataset. ResNet-50 network architecture
represents a midsize solution in the ResNet palette (18, 34, 50, 101,
152 layers) that combines both representation power and lower
complexity that allows relatively fast training of the models. How-
ever, the protocol for image acquisition inﬂuences the complexity
of features, which will be processed by CNNs. Controlled object
position during the collection of images can also govern the level
of feature variability. Our dataset was constructed under the lab-
based protocol of image acquisition with fully controlled position
of the larvae (ventral point of view). This was not the case in pre-

ImageNet) (Russakovsky et al., 2015). Since 2012, there has been
signiﬁcant improvement in deep learning CNN architectures that
have led to better classiﬁcation results in the ImageNet challenge.
Here lies an opportunity to use a similar structure and approach
for targeted application in biomonitoring studies that could incor-
porate high-resolution information from the Chironomidae in
inferences of ecosystem integrity.

The implementation of the CNN classiﬁer was done in Python
programming language (https://www.python.org/), using the
Keras high level deep learning library (https://keras.io/), and Ten-
sorFlow with graphical processing unit (GPU) execution as the
back-end engine (https://www.tensorﬂow.org/). The regions of
the images most informative for the decision making process in
the deep learning model were visualized using Gradient-
weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM; (Selvaraju et al.,
2017)). As an output, heatmaps were generated that indicated
important aspects of the each head capsule used to determine
the taxonomic decision-making process of the model.

2014), which is suggested for relatively small datasets such as ours
(Ng et al., 2015; Peng et al., 2018). The CNN model (Fig. 2) is trained
using a two-stage process. In the ﬁrst stage only a top classiﬁer
(fully connected layer) is trained based on features extracted from
processing images with a pretrained convolutional part of the net-
work. In the second stage, an adjustment of the network in a ﬁne-
tuned manner (using smaller learning rates) is done by training it
as a whole. A two phase approach was used to speed up the process
by preserving pretrained encoder weights in the ﬁrst phase of the
training and achieve optimal model performance using the second
phase. We also applied data augmentation by randomly deforming
input images in each training cycle due to the small sample size.
Additionally, dropout techniques (Hinton et al., 2012) were applied
to extracted features to enhance model robustness.

Helpful Answer:

The given context does not provide explicit details about the specific data annotation techniques used in their deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer some possible methods based on the described tasks and tools.

In this study, the researchers employed Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for classification tasks involving Chironomidae larval head capsules. They utilized a ResNet-50 network architecture, along with transfer learning, data augmentation, and dropout techniques. To train their model, they used a two-stage process where initially only a top classifier was trained based on features extracted from processing images with a pretrained convolutional part of the network. Subsequently, fine-tuning of the entire network was performed using smaller learning rates.

Given these details, one might assume that the researchers used either bounding box annotation or semantic segmentation for labeling their dataset. Bounding boxes would have allowed them to draw rectangles around individual head capsules within the images, while semantic segmentation would involve pixel-level labeling of different parts of the head capsules. Both approaches could help the CNN learn relevant features for accurate classification.

Moreover, the authors mentioned using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to visualize important aspects of each head capsule used in determining the taxonomic decision-making process of the model. This suggests that the researchers focused on identifying key areas within the head capsules rather than outlining the entire objects themselves. Therefore, it seems more likely that they used semantic segmentation or even instance segmentation, which involves assigning labels to individual pixels belonging to distinct instances of objects within an image.

However, without explicit mention of the exact data annotation technique used in this research, we cannot definitively state whether bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, or instance segmentation was employed.
