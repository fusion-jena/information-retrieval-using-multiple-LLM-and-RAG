whole image. Thus, it may minimize the dilution effect and reduce the 
required amount of training data.

The mixed audio clips are then converted into spectrograms as input 
images for model training. The clips are transformed by applying the 
short-time Fourier transform (STFT) with a window size of 1600 sam-
ples,  hop  size  of  400  samples  (75%  overlap),  and  240  mel-scale  fre-
quency bins.  Each spectrogram thus  has a height  of 438 pixels  and a 
width of 436 pixels (Appendix S1: Fig. S4a).

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention or discussion about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some general strategies used in machine learning and deep learning pipelines to manage randomness include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, employing cross-validation techniques, and utilizing ensemble methods. These strategies help ensure consistent results across different runs and improve the robustness of models.
