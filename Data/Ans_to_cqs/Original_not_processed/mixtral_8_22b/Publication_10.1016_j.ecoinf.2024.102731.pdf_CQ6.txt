portional to permeability, so the following scoring scale was used: very
low – 0.00, low – 0.25, medium – 0.50, high – 0.75 and very high: 1.00.
Once these values were set, they were converted into raster format to
enable determining the mean scores per climate pixel.

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be taken to improve its performance. These include data normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization is the process of rescaling numeric columns to a standard range, typically between 0 and 1. This helps prevent attributes from dominating others due to their larger ranges and improves convergence during gradient descent. Scaling involves transforming features to have zero mean and unit variance, which ensures all features contribute equally to the final output. Cleaning refers to handling missing or inconsistent data points by either removing them or imputing appropriate values based on other available information. Other common preprocessing techniques involve encoding categorical variables using one-hot encoding or label encoding, feature extraction through dimensionality reduction methods like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and augmenting datasets via rotations, translations, or noise addition. The choice of preprocessing technique depends on the specific dataset and problem being addressed.

The given context does not provide direct information about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it mentions various land cover types such as urban areas, sparse vegetation, croplands, mosaics, and tree covers. In this case, if we consider these land cover types as input features for a deep learning model, some possible preprocessing steps could include normalizing the area covered by each land cover type, converting categorical labels into numerical representations, and handling any missing or inconsistent data points. Additionally, depending on the specific task, further processing might be required, such as extracting relevant features or augmenting the dataset.
