EfficientnetV2 is an efficient, lightweight feature extraction network. 
The  EfficientNet  series  comprises  a  set  of  lightweight  convolutional 
neural networks. In the EfficientNetV1 series, Google’s focus was pre-
dominantly on optimizing the accuracy, parameter count, and compu-
tational  requirements  of  the  model  (Tan  and  Le,  2019).  The 
EfficientNetV2  series  further  reduces  the  number  of  parameters  and 
computations  while  preserving  the  accuracy  of  the  model,  leading  to 
significant  decreases  in  model  training  and  inference  duration. 
Furthermore, the EfficientNetV2 network uses an improved progressive 
learning approach that dynamically adjusts the regularization method 
based on the training image size. This method can improve the training 
speed  and  accuracy  of  the  network.  Compared  with  some  previous 
networks, the experimental results of this method show that the training

EfficientNetV2 uses the MBConv block from EfficientNetV1. Fig. 2(a) 
shows that the MBConv block is a linear bottleneck layer (Sandler et al., 
2018) with inverted residuals and depth-wise separable convolutions. A 
basic  MBConv  block  consists  of  a  1  × 1  Conv  for  dimensionality 
expansion,  Depthwise  Convolution  (Chollet,  2017),  which  performs 
deep convolution operations on the feature map after expansion with 
either a 3 × 3 or 5 × 5 filter size, SENet (Hu et al., 2018), which en-
hances important channel features and weakens non-important channel 
features, and a 1 × 1 Conv for dimensionality reduction and dropout. 
This block enables the feature extraction network to focus on important 
information  features  and  distinguish  them  from  the  background.  The 
inverted residual structure of this block not only improves the efficiency 
of feature extraction but also reduces the memory required for inference.

quirements are even larger when training with high-resolution images. 
BoTNet uses a convolutional layer to extract effective information and 
low-resolution  feature  maps  before  inputting  them  for  self-attention, 
thereby  avoiding  excessive  memory  and  computational  resource  con-
sumption. Fig. 3 shows the structure of the BoTNet.

In recent years, with significant improvements in computer perfor-
mance,  deep  learning  technology  has  undergone  large-scale  develop-
ment.  Deep 
learning  does  not  require  separate  selection  and 
transformation of features. Instead, inputting data into the model allows 
the model to provide suitable classification features (Yue et al., 2019). 
Deep learning-based image algorithms are widely used in various fields. 
For  example,  Zhu  et  al.  employed  an  improved  YOLOv7-CSAW  algo-
rithm  for  target  recognition  on  the  sea  surface  to  facilitate  maritime 
search and rescue operations (Zhu et al., 2023). Wang et al. utilized an 
enhanced YOLOv5 algorithm for smoke detection to reduce the occur-
rence of fires (Wang et al., 2022a). In underwater target detection, deep 
learning-based visual algorithms can significantly improve the accuracy 
and efficiency of underwater target detection (Xu et al., 2023a). Liang

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline discussed here is images. The text mentions EfficientNetV2, a type of convolutional neural network designed primarily for image processing tasks such as object detection and image classification. Furthermore, the context discusses techniques like depth-wise separable convolutions and inverted residuals, both of which are commonly used in image processing applications. However, it should be noted that while the context focuses on image data, deep learning pipelines can use various other types of data formats including audio, video, and structured data like CSV files depending on the specific application and problem being addressed.
