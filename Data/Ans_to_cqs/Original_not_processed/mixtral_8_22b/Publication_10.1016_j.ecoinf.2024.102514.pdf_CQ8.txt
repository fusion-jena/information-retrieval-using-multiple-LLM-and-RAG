Question: %INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the provided pieces of context to answer the query in less than 400 words. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

%Query
Query: "Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not include any reference to a specific code repository or version control system such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, it is not possible to determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available based solely on this information. Further research would be required to locate the relevant code repository.
