field-collected data and machine learning methods on developing AGB 
models.  Moreover,  the  quality  of  training  samples  and  the  layout  of 
sampling  points  are  crucial  for  constructing  accurate  and  reliable 
models for biomass estimation (Morais et al., 2021). In this study, owing 
to  the  insufficiency  of  high-quality  training  samples,  we  employed  a 
method with low data dependency that integrates forest inventory data 
with remote sensing imagery for biomass estimation.

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no information available in the given context about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily discusses the use of field-collected data and machine learning methods for developing Above Ground Biomass (AGB) models, as well as the importance of high-quality training samples and sampling point layout for accurate and reliable biomass estimation. Additionally, it mentions the integration of forest inventory data with remote sensing imagery for biomass estimation due to insufficient high-quality training samples. However, without further details regarding the deep learning pipeline, it is not possible to determine which data annotation techniques were utilized.
