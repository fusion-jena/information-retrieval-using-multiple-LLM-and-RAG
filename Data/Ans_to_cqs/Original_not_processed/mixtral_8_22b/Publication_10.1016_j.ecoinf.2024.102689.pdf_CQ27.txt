GPU  and  utilizes  CUDA  version  11.4.  Python  3.6  serves  as  the  pro-
gramming language, and Pytorch version 1.8.0 is used in conjunction 
with  the  virtual  environment  function  of  Anaconda3.  Optimization  is 
carried out using the Adam optimizer with a Momentum of 0.9 and a 
Batch size of 16. Images are processed at a resolution of 1024 × 1024, 
with an initial learning rate set at 0.001 and a minimum learning rate of 
0.0001. The descent mode is step, and training spans 300 epochs.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide specific information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, it mentions that the programming language used is Python 3.6, along with PyTorch version 1.8.0 within the Anaconda3 virtual environment. This suggests that the model could be deployed using these tools or similar ones compatible with them. Additionally, the use of GPU and CUDA version 11.4 implies that the deployment platform should also support GPU acceleration for optimal performance. Unfortunately, without further details, it is impossible to determine the exact steps taken for model deployment.
