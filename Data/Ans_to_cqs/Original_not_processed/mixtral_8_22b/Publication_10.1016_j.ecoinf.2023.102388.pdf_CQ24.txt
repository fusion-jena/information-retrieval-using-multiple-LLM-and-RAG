• No-overfitting. In this setting, the optimization algorithm of CNNs is 
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), with a learning rate of 0.0001 
and a weight decay of 0.5. The batch size is set to 32, the number of 
training epochs to 200 and finally the batch-norm and dropout (0.5) 
are used to reduce the overfitting level.  

• Overfitting.  We  use  the  same  hyperparameters  setting  as  the  no- 
overfitting  but  we  remove  the  use  of  batch-norm,  weight  decay 
and dropout techniques to ensure that the model overfits.

distribution” for the non-members in the attack dataset. In practice, this 
can have a big impact in the situation in which the target dataset is of 
limited size and we do want to sacrifice some of its data to build the 
attack dataset.

inference, we randomly selected specific supervised samples to serve as

The traditional way of training machine learning models normally 
aims at avoiding the overfitting phenomenon (Ravoor and T.S.B., 2020; 
Santos and Papa, 2022). Indeed, the main concern about overfitting is 
that it occurs when the model performs well on the training data but 
generalizes  poorly  on  unseen  samples  (i.e.,  test  set).  In  the  privacy 
domain,  overfitting  has  also  been  shown  to  make  the  model  more 
vulnerable to privacy attacks as it results in the model memorizing more 
information  about  the  training  set  (Shokri  et  al.,  2017;  Song  et  al., 
2019).

Helpful Answer:

In the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing the random seed value. However, based on common practices in deep learning, here are some strategies that can be employed:

1. Fixed Random Seed: One common strategy is to fix the random seed value before running experiments or training models. By fixing the random seed, one can reproduce the exact same sequence of random numbers, ensuring consistency across different runs of the experiment or model training process.

2. Multiple Runs: Another approach is to perform multiple runs of the experiment or model training using different random seeds. This helps in understanding the variability in performance due to randomness and provides a better estimate of the expected performance.

3. Cross-Validation: To further mitigate the effects of randomness, cross-validation techniques like k-fold cross-validation can be employed. These techniques involve splitting the dataset into multiple folds and performing multiple rounds of training and evaluation, where each fold serves as the validation/test set once. This ensures that the model is evaluated on different subsets of the data, providing a more robust estimate of its performance.

4. Ensemble Methods: Ensemble methods combine the predictions of multiple models trained with different random initializations or different subsets of the data. Averaging the predictions from these models can help reduce the variance caused by randomness and improve overall performance.
