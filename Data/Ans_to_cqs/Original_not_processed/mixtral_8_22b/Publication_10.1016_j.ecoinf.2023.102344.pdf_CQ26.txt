the  shortcut  connections  within  the  network  that  makes  the  training

layer  for  dimension  reduction,  3  × 3  convolution  layer  for  feature 
extraction, and another 1 × 1 convolutional layer for dimension resto-
ration;  shortcut  connections  which  allows  gradients  to  flow  directly 
through  the  network  due  to  the  input  added  directly  to  the  output; 
global  average  pooling  (GAP)  which  computes  spatial  average  of  the

Approach  2  utilized  the  raw  bivalve  images  as  inputs  to  the  opti-
mized pre-trained networks of EfficientNet-B0, ResNet101, MobilNetV2, 
and InceptionV3. Unlike Approaches 1 and 3, Approach 2 has no PCA- 
NCA  integration  as  the  extraction  of  features  was  not  manually  per-
formed, rather the built-in architecture of these four pre-trained deep 
networks  (Fig.  3)  extracted  millions  of  possible  features  that  are  not 
visible to human eyes for visual discrimination. Despite this supposedly 
advantageous  aspect  of  the  image-based  pre-trained  network,  only 
EfficientNet-B0 and InceptionV3 resulted in a 1.135 and 1.009 increase

(Table  1).  This  resulted  in  InceptionV3  being  the  most  accurate  and 
sensitive  model  in  Approach  2  with  scores  of  90.13%  and  87.45% 
respectively (Table 1, Fig. 9). The 9.87% Hamming loss of InceptionV3 is

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide specific details on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, common techniques include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets based on class labels or characteristics to ensure each subset maintains the same distribution as the original dataset. Oversampling increases the number of instances in minority classes by duplicating existing samples or generating synthetic ones. Undersampling reduces the number of instances in majority classes by randomly removing samples or selecting those closest to the decision boundary. Diverse data collection aims to gather a wide range of examples representing different scenarios, conditions, and populations to minimize biases caused by limited or skewed datasets. These methods can help improve model performance and generalization by reducing overfitting and increasing robustness against outliers and noise.

Based on the given context, it cannot be determined if any of these techniques were applied during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, further information would be required to accurately answer the query.
