Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

discriminant rules are illustrated in Fig. 3. Finally, we employed deep 
learning techniques to predict the types of landscapes in the case study 
area. The classification process based on deep learning encompasses the 
following stages.

In recent years, deep learning has made rapid progress in the field of 
image  recognition,  thus  greatly  improving  computer  processing. Con-
volutional neural network (CNN) is a popular deep learning architecture 
applied to image classification with good performance in the extraction 
of underlying abstract features (Meng et al., 2022). Convolution layers, 
pooling layers, fully connected layers, and nonlinear operations consti-
tute the CNN model (Attri et al., 2023). We fine-tuned several state-of- 
the-art  CNN  architectures,  including  the  Visual  Geometry  Group 
(VGG)  (Simonyan  and  Zisserman,  2014),  Inception  (Szegedy  et  al., 
2016), and residual network (ResNet) (He et al., 2016) CNNs, using the 
training dataset, and we evaluated their respective  performances. We 
selected from these networks the most effective model to create the rural

as deep learning methods to promote a deeper understanding of rural 
landscapes.

To ensure the stability of the proposed models, we randomly divided 
the  dataset  into  three  parts:  training  (60%),  validation  (20%),  and 
testing  (20%)  (Meng  et  al.,  2022).  This  division  was  performed  in  a 
stratified manner to maintain class proportions across all of the parts. 
The dataset was randomly divided into a training set (2880 images), a 
validation set (961 images), and a testing set (958 images). The models 
were trained on an NVIDIA 3090 GPU with a 256 Ã— 256 image input 
size. After parameter tuning, the learning rate, batch size, and number of 
epochs were set to 0.0001, 8, and 30, respectively.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that they selected the best performing model among VGG, Inception, and ResNet CNNs for creating the rural landscape classification model. It also states that the models were trained on an NVIDIA 3090 GPU with a 256 x 256 image input size, and after parameter tuning, the learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs were set to 0.0001, 8, and 30, respectively. These details suggest that some form of hyperparameter optimization or regularization might have been applied during the model development process, but without explicit mention of regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization, I cannot confirm which ones were used.
