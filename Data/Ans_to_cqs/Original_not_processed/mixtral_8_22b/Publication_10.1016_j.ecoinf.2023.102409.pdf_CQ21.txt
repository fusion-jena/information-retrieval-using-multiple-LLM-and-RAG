2023; Yuan et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2023c). The model’s initial learning 
rate was set to 0.01, further refined via iterative testing. The number of 
iterations was 150, with a batch size of 4, downsampling multiplier set 
at 8, and utilized SGD optimizer, ReLu activation function, and Dice loss 
function.

to augment the feature map size, aligning with the encoder’s pooling 
layer.  Each  decoder  module  concatenates  its  output  with  the  corre-
sponding encoder output. The final decoder tensor undergoes convolu-
tion and then traverses through a softmax layer, normalizing the output 
probabilities for two classes at each pixel (Gao et al., 2022; He et al., 
2022;  Qiu  et  al.,  2023).  The  model’s  initial  learning  rate  was  set  to 
0.0001, subsequently fine-tuned through iterative testing. The number 
of iterations was 150, the batch size was configured as 2, utilizing the 
Adam optimizer, ReLu activation function, and Dice loss function.

(1)  Unet.  By  incorporating  an  encoder-decoder  structure  that  es-
tablishes shortcut connections, Unet model extended upon FCN’s end-to- 
end concept (Ronneberger et al., 2015). The input to the network is a 
512  × 512  pixels  image  (Fig.  3).  The  encoder  (left  dashed  square) 
downsamples the input tensor and encodes it into a vector with reduced 
dimensions. It consists of multiple convolutional blocks, each including 
a  3  × 3  convolutional  kernel  layer,  batch  normalization,  and  an

in  segmenting  densely  distributed  vegetation  areas  but  struggles  in 
recognizing sparse vegetation patches. The pyramid pooling module of 
Pspnet  model deeply analyzes the  semantically rich high-dimensional 
feature layer,  enabling global and  local connections for the  final pre-
diction. However, during the parsing process, it primarily extracts high- 
dimensional features for different-sized small vegetation patches, inev-
itably resulting in blurred segmentation due to the loss of image details 
(Ngugi et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2022b).

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer based on the given context. However, generally speaking, postprocessing steps can vary depending on the type of deep learning task and the desired outcome. For example, in object detection tasks, non-maximum suppression might be used to eliminate redundant bounding boxes. In classification tasks, calculating accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curves, etc., could be part of the postprocessing steps. Visualizations like saliency maps or heatmaps may also be generated to understand which parts of the input contributed most to the prediction. Ultimately, the choice of postprocessing steps depends on the requirements and goals of the project.
