The extraction of crop-growing areas is a prerequisite for estimating 
the  crop  chlorophyll  content  in  the  field  scale.  Zhang  et  al.  (2020) 
pointed out that the end of July in Northeast China is the peak growth 
period of different crops, during which the physiological parameters of 
crops are at their peak (e.g., greenness and water content), which is the 
best  time  window  for  crop  classification.  In  addition,  classification 
methods, this study verifies the optimality of random forest classifica-
tion  by  comparing  multiple  mainstream  machine  learning  methods 
(including random forest classification, support vector machine classi-
fication, decision tree classification) (You et al., 2021). Therefore, for 
the Sentinel-2 images from 21 July 2022, we selected the random forest 
classification  method  to  extract  the  rice-growing  area  of  Qian  Gorlos 
County with a classification accuracy of over 90% (Fig. 1). Because rice

rice canopy coverage with the largest error in C3 and the smallest error 
in C2 (Fig. 8). These results indicate that RF is a machine learning model 
that is suitable for LCC estimation, but the estimation accuracy of the C1 
and  C3  regions  still  require  to  be  improved.  The  study  area  can  be 
divided according to crop coverage, and the overall estimation accuracy 
of the study area can be improved by searching for suitable VIs that are 
sensitive to LCC under different coverage conditions.

and  verification  sets  in  a  ratio  of  3:1.  Five  modelling  methods  were 
selected: random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), multi-layer 
perceptron (MLP), extreme gradient boosting (XGboost), and multiple 
linear  regression  (MLR)  (Abdali  et  al.,  2023;  Fang  et  al.,  2024;  Khan 
et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2023; Xiao et al., 2023b; Xiao et al., 2024). First, 
the model with the highest accuracy was selected to estimate the rice 
LCC and crop coverage degree in the entire study area without consid-
ering the differences in crop coverage. The rice LCC model based on crop 
coverage was then used for estimation, and its accuracy was compared 
with the chlorophyll estimation model without considering differences 
in crop coverage.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any direct mention of specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does provide some clues about how the authors approached their modeling process. They divided their dataset into training and validation sets in a ratio of 3:1 and used five modeling methods: Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). After selecting the model with the highest accuracy, they estimated the rice Leaf Chlorophyll Content (LCC) and crop coverage degree in the entire study area. This suggests that the authors might have used the performance of the model on the validation set as one of the criteria to decide when the training is complete. Typically, training continues until the validation loss stops improving or starts increasing, indicating overfitting. But without explicit information, it cannot be confirmed if these exact criteria were applied in this case.
