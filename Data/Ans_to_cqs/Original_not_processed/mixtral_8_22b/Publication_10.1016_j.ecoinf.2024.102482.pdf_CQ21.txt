Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

2.4.4. System structure 

We endeavored to design the model structure as simple as possible to 
ensure its usability on devices with limited computing power and enable 
real-time predictions, as long as the performance was not significantly 
reduced. Our aim was to create a model that balances performance and 
efficiency.  The  selected  system's  structure  consists  of  an  input  layer, 
three LSTM hidden layers, one dropout layer, and one dense layer. In the 
case of binary classification, a dense layer with a single output is used, 
and σ is employed as the activation function. For tasks involving more 
than two classes, the dense layer has multiple outputs and the softmax 
function is used as the activation function. The overall structure of the 
model is depicted in Fig. 5.

The input layer receives two-dimensional data of size [observation 
time (s) × 4, 1]. As mentioned (section 2.4.3), the output vector sizes of 
the three LSTM layers were set to 32, 32, and 16, respectively, and a 
dropout rate of 50% was applied during training. The number of stacked 
LSTM layers, the size of the output vectors, and other necessary model 
hyperparameters were selected through various experiments to achieve 
optimal performance. 

We have summarized the components of the proposed system into an 
overall  learning  and  testing  procedure  of  the  monitoring  system  in 
Fig. 6. During the learning stage, features are extracted from the training 
data set using the previously introduced feature extraction algorithm, 
and the  model is  trained. After the training is  completed, the trained 
model  is  used  to  predict  water  conditions  and  analyze  performance 
using the test data set that was not employed during the learning stage. 

2.4.5. Performance metrics

An  HMM-based monitoring system  consists of  a number of HMMs 
corresponding to the number of classes of problems to be solved. In a 
binary  class  problem,  two  models  are  learned,  and  in  a  ternary  class 
problem,  three  models  are  learned  using  the  data  for  each  class.  The 
learned monitoring system uses the given pattern sequence sample as 
input  to  each  HMM  to  calculate  probability  values  and  compares  the 
probability values to determine contamination or contaminants.

Helpful Answer:
After the model training, there are several postprocessing steps that can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the task. However, based on the provided context, it does not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, confusion matrices, or metric calculations. Nevertheless, we can infer some potential postprocessing steps based on the information available.

Firstly, since the model is designed for real-time predictions, it would require some form of preprocessing step before making predictions. This could involve normalizing the input data or applying any relevant transformations to ensure that the input data is compatible with the model architecture.

Secondly, once the model has been trained, it can be evaluated using various performance metrics. Based on the context, it appears that the authors use accuracy as their primary evaluation metric. They also mention that they employ different activation functions depending on whether the task involves binary or multi-class classification. Therefore, it can be assumed that they perform some form of metric calculation to evaluate the performance of the model.

Thirdly, while the context does not explicitly mention the creation of confusion matrices, this is often a common postprocessing step when evaluating the performance of machine learning models. A confusion matrix provides a visual representation of the model's performance by comparing predicted labels against actual labels. It allows researchers to identify areas where the model may be performing poorly and adjust accordingly.

Lastly, while the context does not specifically mention the generation of saliency maps, these can be useful for understanding which parts of the input data contribute most to the final prediction. Saliency maps highlight regions within the input data that have the greatest impact on the model's decision-making process. While not explicitly mentioned in the context, generating saliency maps could potentially provide valuable insights into how the model makes its predictions.
