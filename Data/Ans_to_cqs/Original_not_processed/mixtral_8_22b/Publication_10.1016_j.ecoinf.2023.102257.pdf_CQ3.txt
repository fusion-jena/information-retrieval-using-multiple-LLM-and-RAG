2.1. Objective 1: perform tagging efficiency experiment

et  al.,  2023;  Cunha  et  al.,  2023).  Validating  bounding  boxes  through 
manual annotation is needed to ensure the cropped images used to train 
classification models are accurate, and so understanding the trade-offs in 
effort  for  labelling  bounding  boxes  with  a  variety  of  methods  is 
increasingly important.

Maine, USA (January–September 2022) using three tagging methods (one with ML bounding box assistance and 
two  without  assistance).  We  used  a  generalized  linear  mixed  model  to  examine  the  influence  of  ML  model 
performance  and  tagging  method  on  tagging  efficiency.  We  found  that  ML  bounding  boxes  offer  significant 
improvement in tagging efficiency when labelling data compared to unassisted tagging. Additionally, the time 
taken to label with bounding boxes was not statistically different from an unassisted tagging approach. However, 
we  found  that  gains  in  efficiency  are  contingent  on  the  ML  algorithm’s  performance  and  that  incorrect  ML 
predictions, particularly the 4.2% false positive and 3.6% false negative predictions, can slow the tagging process 
compared to a non-hybrid approach. These findings indicate that although practitioners usually forgo the pro-

duction of bounding boxes when selecting a data labelling process due to the increased effort, ML bounding box- 
assisted tagging can offer an efficient method for labeling. More broadly, ML-assisted data labelling offers an 
opportunity to accelerate the analysis of trail camera imagery, but an assessment of the ML model’s performance 
can illuminate whether the hybrid-tagging approach is ultimately a help or hinderance.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The study examines the use of machine learning (ML) bounding box models to assist in the data labelling process, specifically for tagging wildlife in trail camera imagery. This suggests that one of the data annotation techniques used in this deep learning pipeline is bounding box annotation. Bounding box annotation involves drawing a rectangle around an object in an image to identify its location and size. In this case, it is used to accurately crop images of wildlife for training classification models. The study also mentions the need for manual validation of these bounding boxes, indicating that human input is still required in the annotation process. It does not mention any other specific data annotation techniques such as instance segmentation.
