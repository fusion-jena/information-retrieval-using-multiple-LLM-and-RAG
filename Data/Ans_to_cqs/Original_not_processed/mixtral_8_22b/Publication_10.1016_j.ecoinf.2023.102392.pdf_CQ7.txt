inference system with ABC optimization technique to enhance the pre-
diction modelâ€™s performance. In a prior study conducted by Pham et al. 
(2023), the ACO-NFS model was utilized to estimate the extent of forest 
fire in the Bo Trach district, Quang Binh province. However, the authors 
of that study solely focused on one specific type of forest cover without 
addressing  the  susceptibility  of  different  forest  types  to  wildfires. 
Considering these limitations, our experiment aims to integrate a hybrid 
model  for  predicting  forest  fires  vulnerability  with  a  deep  learning 
model-based approach for forests classification.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it is not explicitly stated what criteria were used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. Typically, the dataset is divided randomly into three subsets: training set, validation set, and testing set. The training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Finally, the testing set is used to evaluate the final model's performance. However, since there is no explicit mention of how the data was split in this case, we cannot provide a definitive answer based on the available information.
