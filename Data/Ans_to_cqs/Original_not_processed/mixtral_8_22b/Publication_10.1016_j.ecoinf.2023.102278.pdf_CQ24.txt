The  ResNet50  architecture  (He  et  al.,  2016)  was  modified  and 
trained with transfer learning using pre-trained weights from ImageNet 
(Smith,  2018).  Models  trained  with  transfer  learning  outperformed 
models trained with random weights with an increase of 4% in the F1-

monitoring  globally  and  for  efficient  pest  management  (Preti  et  al., 
2021). Deep-learning methods are increasingly used for classification in 
many fields and are emerging in entomology (Høye et al., 2021). Such 
methods require large training datasets to provide robust predictions, 
which has so far been a limiting factor in entomological applications. 
Specifically,  insects  are  very  diverse  and  their  abundance  is  highly 
variable,  which  often  results  in  unbalanced  datasets  with  numerous 
classes  nested  inside  each  other  in  a  taxonomic  hierarchy.  As  these 
methods mature and are implemented in monitoring programs, the de-
mand for greater taxonomic resolution of classifications will increase. So 
far, the level of fine-grained classification is still rather limited, not least 
because classification models rely on training data where images have 
species labels assigned to them.

The concept of semi-supervised deep learning and threshold-based 
anomaly  tagging  is  used  to  detect  ‘unsure  anomalies’.  Often,  softmax 
is the last layer in a classification neural network, where the maximum 
value determines the predicted class. Instead, we will analyse the output 
distribution  without  the  softmax  layer  to  determine  the  outliers  and 
predict the classes. The distribution of the output Rlj  Eq. (2) for each 
predicted jth class in the lth level follows a normal distribution Rlj ∼ N (μ,
σ2).  The  output  distribution  is  shown  in  Fig.  3  is  generated  on  the 
training dataset for correct classified inputs. The Gaussian approxima-
tion of the underlying probability density function is shown for three 
levels of two classes from each level. If the output value Rlj  is below a 
threshold of th = μ (cid:0) 2σ, we will tag the input as an outlier. Theoreti-
cally, an ideal normal distribution means that approximately 2.1% of

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that one strategy employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline is the use of dropout regularization in the forward pass during training. Dropout regularization involves randomly dropping out units (neurons) along with all its incoming and outgoing connections during training. This helps prevent overfitting and improves generalization performance. Additionally, the choice of optimization algorithm can also impact the handling of randomness. In this case, the Adam optimizer was chosen over stochastic gradient descent (SGD) due to improved accuracy. However, there is no explicit mention of how random seed values were handled in the given context. It should be noted that setting a fixed random seed value can help ensure reproducibility of results across different runs of the same model.
