Some model parameters were modified from the default configura-
tion to balance use of resources and training speed. We retained a res-
olution of 704 × 704, batch size 64, 32 subdivisions and trained up to 
6000 iterations. Other parameters were kept to default or set according 
to guidance by the developers (https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet).

3.1. Model evaluation and selection 

The number of iterations for which the CNN was trained has a strong 
influence on its performances as well as on the confidence it gives to its 
predictions (Fig. 2). In general, longer model training past 1000 itera-
tions tended to give higher recall but lower precision.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given information, there isn't any direct mention of the specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the research. However, one reference mentions a link related to darknet (<https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet>), which might suggest that the researchers utilized some components from this open-source project. To find the exact code repository link, further investigation would be required, such as checking the authors' personal websites or contacting them directly.
