(of 94.5%) using the deep learning–based CNN model. Martin-Abadal 
et  al.  (Martin-Abadal  et  al.,  2018)  estimated  seagrass  meadows  by 
applying  an  encoder  decoder-based  model  (VGG16FCN8).  They  ach-
ieved a precision of 96.57% and an accuracy of 96.81% on their dataset. 
Meanwhile,  Weidmann et  al.  (Weidmann et  al., 2019) found  that the 
deep  learning–based  DeepLabv3+ model  achieves  the  highest  perfor-
mance  (with  a  mean  intersection  over  union  (mIoU)  of  87.78%) 
compared  to  the  fully  convolutional  networks,  dilated  convolution 
networks (dilNets) and U-Net on the ‘LookingForSeagrass’ dataset.

where wi  is a learnable weight that can be a scalar (per feature), a 
vector (per channel) or a multi-dimensional tensor (per pixel) and Ii  is 
the  number  of  layers.  However,  the  unbounded  scalar  weight  could 
cause  training  instability,  Therefore,  weight  normalisation  is  used  to 
bound the value range of each weight.

The  softmax  activation  function  is  applied  to  each  weight  to 
normalise  all  weights  to  be  a  probability  within  a  range  of  0  to  1. 
However,  the  extra  softmax  function  leads  to  a  slowdown  on  GPU 
hardware resources.

A  novel  compound  scaling  method  was  proposed  in  EfficientNet, 
which  uses  a  compound  coefficient  ϕ  to  scale  uniformly  and  adjust 
dynamically three parameters’  depth α, width β  and resolution γ  in a 
principled way: 

depth : d = αϕ
width : w = βϕ
resolution : r = γϕ
s.t. α.β2.γ2 ≈ 2 α ≥ 1, β ≥ 1, γ ≥ 1.

(6) 

where constant α, β and γ is determined by the grid search operation. 
User-specified coefficient ϕ  controls the available resources for model 
scaling, while constant α, β and γ identify the way to assign these extra 
resources to network width, depth and resolution, respectively. 

3. Methodology 

The procedure of the proposed approach for H. ovalis detection can 
be divided into four steps: dataset description; dataset processing and 
labelling; model training; and performance evaluation. These steps are

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning models discussed. It primarily focuses on the architectures and performance metrics of various deep learning models used for tasks like seagrass meadow estimation and semantic segmentation for visual coverage estimation. To find out about the exact hyperparameters used in those studies, one would need to refer to the original research papers mentioned in the context.
