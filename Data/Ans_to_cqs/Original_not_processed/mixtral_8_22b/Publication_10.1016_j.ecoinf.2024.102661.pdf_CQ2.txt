Hyperparameters  are  instrumental  in  shaping  the  architecture  of 
deep  learning  models and  steering  the  learning  process  (Bischl et  al., 
2023).  The  TPEBO  algorithm  stands  out  for  its  strategic  approach  to 
hyperparameter optimization. Beginning with an exploratory phase of 
random  searches  for  feasible  hyperparameter  configurations,  TPEBO 
progressively narrows down its focus to zones within the search space 
where a local optimum is identified, thereby approximating the global 
optimum  with  increasing  precision.  This  methodological  approach  is 
particularly  beneficial  for  fine-tuning  LSTM  models,  known  for  their 
intricate  structures.  By  automating  the  hyperparameter  adjustment 
process,  TPEBO  not  only  enhances  the  model's  efficiency  but  also 
significantly  curtails  the  time  traditionally  spent  on  manual  tuning, 
making the modeling workflow more efficient. The process is succinctly

xi  is the input independent variable value, 
n is the number of groups of forecasted variables, 
̂yi  is the forecasted value, 
yi  is the actual value, 
λ is the L2 regularization parameter (λ > 0), 
wj  is the weight of each layer in the LSTM neural network,

The  input  dataset,  hyperparameter  search  range,  optimization 
objective  function,  and  algorithm  predefined  are  integrated  into  the 
TPEBO-LSTM  model.  The  model  undergoes  a  training  process 
comprising 10,000 iterations. During each iteration, the model logs the 
chosen  hyperparameter  combinations,  associated  training  times,  and 

loss  values.  This  systematic  recording  aims  to  pinpoint  the  hyper-
parameter sets that deliver optimal performance upon completion of the 
calculations.

Machine learning and deep learning methods have shown remark-
able stability and effectiveness in big data analytics (Bai et al., 2019; 
Bhardwaj  and  Khaiter,  2023).  Recently,  these  techniques  have  been 
increasingly  applied  to  carbon  emission  forecasting,  showcasing  their 
broad utility (Table 1). Among these, Backpropagation Neural Networks 
(BPNN) stand out for their widespread use and notable forecast accuracy 
(Lin et al., 2021; Niu et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2023). Yet, more recent 
studies have highlighted that Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural 
networks  outperform  other  models  in  both  forecast  accuracy  and 
training  efficiency  (Kumar,  2023;  Liu  et  al.,  2024b;  Shi  et  al.,  2023). 
Furthermore,  LSTM  have  been  recognized  for  their  ability  to  adeptly 
handle multiple time-variable inputs, exhibiting superior accuracy and 
stability compared to traditional machine learning models (Gokul et al.,

4. Conclusions 

The  primary  objectives  of  this  research  are  to  develop  a  compre-
hensive methodology for calculating ACE and to establish an effective 
deep learning approach for accurately forecasting ACE. Specifically, the 
main findings of this research include:  

(1)  Calculation of ACE for 31 provinces in mainland China from 1993 
to 2021, covering four main agricultural activities: farm opera-
tion,  crop  growth,  enteric  fermentation,  and  manure  manage-
ment. Using these data, the TPEBO-LSTM model based on deep 
learning methods demonstrates superior performance, indicating 
the  potential  of  this  novel  methodology  to  adeptly  manage 
diverse data types and enhance ACE forecasting.  

(2)  Forecasting  of  ACE  peaking  before  2030  in  24  provinces,  with 
notable exceptions. The study identifies significant contributors 
to  ACE  and  predicts  future  high-ACE  provinces,  implications 
critical for developing low-carbon agricultural policies.

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily uses structured numerical data, specifically in the form of CSV files. This can be inferred from the mention of input independent variable values (xi), forecasted values (̂yi), actual values (yi), weights of layers in the LSTM neural network (wj), and the L2 regularization parameter (λ). These elements suggest that the data being processed is likely tabular or vectorized data, which is commonly stored in CSV format. However, there is no explicit mention of other data formats such as images, audio, or video. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning pipeline discussed here predominantly utilizes CSV data format.
