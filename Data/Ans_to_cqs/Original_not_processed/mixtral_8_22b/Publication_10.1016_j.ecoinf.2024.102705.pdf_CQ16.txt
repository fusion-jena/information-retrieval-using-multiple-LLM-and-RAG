Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

3.1. Implementation details 

The training protocol outlined by (Redmon and Farhadi, 2018) was 
followed during the training process. The YOLOv3 model served as the 
baseline for all experiments. To expand the training dataset, various data 
augmentation  techniques  were  employed,  including  random  adjust-
ments to image size, image flipping, cropping, and conversion. The AIP- 
OD  model  was  trained  using  the  Adam  optimizer  (Kingma  and  Ba, 
2014). The training process consisted of 150 epochs with a batch size of 
(cid:0) 4and gradually decreased to 
4. The learning rate initially started at 10
over  the  course  of  training.  The  experiments  were  conducted  using 
Tensorflow 1.14 and executed on a GTX2080Ti GPU. 

3.2. Evaluating indicator 

The evaluation of models commonly utilizes Average Precision (AP) 
as a mainstream performance metric. AP represents the area under the 
precision-recall curve, denoted as P (precision) and R (recall) at different 
thresholds.

feature representations, which are crucial for predicting the threshold of 
image  processing  algorithms  (Wang  et  al.,  2018).  In  this  study,  we 
propose a compact network incorporating a non-local layer capable of 
extracting  long-distance  features  to  predict  parameters  for  the  image 
processing module. Additionally, we introduce a joint training approach 
for image adaptive enhancement modules and deep learning models to 
ensure  that  the  image  processing  results  contribute  to  improved  per-
formance  of  the  deep  learning  model.  The  proposed  method  demon-
strates superior performance across a diverse range of environments. it 
enables  expedited  transitions  from  field  surveys  to  reporting,  even  in 
challenging circumstances, thereby facilitating efficient data collection 
and analysis on a larger scale.

2.2. Proposed method 

In  this  section,  we  describe  the  AIP  module  and  downstream 
ecological tasks introduced in this study, as illustrated in Fig. 3. For the 
AIP  module,  we  detail  a  non-local-based  parameter  predictor  (NLPP) 

The proposed DIP module is designed to simulate the techniques of 
professional  photographers,  adjusting  lighting,  color,  and  sharpening. 
These three steps contain 5 image mapping functions listed in Table 3, in

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, the training process consists of 150 epochs with a batch size of 4, and the learning rate starts at 10^-3 and gradually decreases over the course of training. However, there is no explicit mention of specific criteria used to determine when training is completed, such as reaching a certain number of epochs or achieving a desired level of validation loss. Therefore, based solely on the information provided, I cannot definitively state what criteria are used to determine when training is complete.
