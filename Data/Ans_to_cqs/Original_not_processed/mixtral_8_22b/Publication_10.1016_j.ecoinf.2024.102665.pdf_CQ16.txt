cluster but a lower purity would be partially contained in other clusters 
from  the  posterior  probabilities.  Purity  measures  are  computed  as  an 
average  for  each  cluster  and  associated  site  data  and  as  an  overall 
average across all site data and associated cluster states of a latent factor 
variable. The supporting material contains these purity  measures and 
other statistics related to the clusters and resulting network (Table S4). 
The cluster analysis was constrained to a maximum of five states with 
a minimum of two, but low purity measures can exclude some candidate 
clusters. The optimal number of cluster states and the data contained in 
each  was  identified  using  an  automated  expectation-  maximization 
process, described above, based on a random walk with 300 steps for 
minimizing the MDL score. The final ten steps were used to check for 
stability  with  the  number  of  clusters  chosen  for  each  taxon.  A  stable

data.  The  maximization  step  uses  the  imputations  from  this  step  to 
realign the conditional probabilities in the network from the data. This 
process is repeated until convergence (no change) or a stopping point is 
reached.

outcome would have the same number of clusters for all ten final steps. 
The contingency table fit (CTF), a network performance indicator rep-
resenting the quality of the fit to the data, provides a normalized mea-
sure from 0 to 100% with 0% (poorest fit) having the data representation 
skill of an unconnected network and 100% having the joint probability 
representation  of  the  data  of  a  completely  connected  network  (best 
possible fit) (Conrady and Jouffe, 2014; Gerassis et al., 2019). The CTF 
was extracted for the individual taxa factor networks as well as the meta- 
factor network.

Increasing  the  dimensions  used  in  the  assessment  through  additional 
variables can therefore be useful (Peterson and Evans, 2019). Due to the 
restrictions in MWST, the representation of data might not be as high as 
other  learning  methods  (Kekolahti  et  al.,  2015).  However,  the  con-
straints (only one incoming connection per node) allow only the nodes 
with the strongest associations to be connected.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions that the process is repeated until convergence (no change) or a stopping point is reached. This suggests that the training continues until there are no further changes in the model parameters, indicating that the model has converged to a stable state. Additionally, the mention of a stopping point implies that there may be predefined conditions or thresholds set to halt the training process if certain criteria are met. Unfortunately, without more detailed information, it is not possible to specify the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete.
