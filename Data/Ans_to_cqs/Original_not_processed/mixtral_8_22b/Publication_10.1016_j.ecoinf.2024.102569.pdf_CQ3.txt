where species are observed outside of their suitable habitats, such as in 
cultivation or captivity contexts (Botella et al., 2018). These scenarios 
are  common  issues  in  crowdsourcing  data  analysis.  To  remove  such 
heterogeneous  observations,  the  time-consuming  manual  checking  by 
experts  is  required  (Belbin  et  al.,  2013;  Mesibov,  2013).  If  such  pro-
cedure is not fully executed, our proposed method is expected to miti-
gate  the  impact  of  heterogeneous  observations  and  achieve  better 
predictions than ordinary methods. 

In  the  understanding  of  ecological  processes,  there  are  situations

such as eBird, Pl@ntNet, iNaturalist, and Observation.org, available on 
the  Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), are accessible  for 
use. However, the analysis of PO data from such sources requires special 
attention, compared to PA data obtained through designed surveys, due 
to the potential for issues such as species identification errors and local 
over-aggregation of records.

To simultaneously carry out shrinkage estimation and variable se-
lection,  we  employ  the  penalized  loss  function  with  an  L1  penalty 
(Tibshirani, 1996), defined as follows: 

lϕ
Ξ(θ) = lΞ(θ) +

where lΞ  is the loss function minimized by solving the estimating eqs. (2) 
=
and (3), and is given by eq. (10) in Appendix A. We set ϕ0
ϕ (k ∕= 0, ϕ ≥ 0) as a constant tuning parameter. The loss function has no 
penalties for the intercept parameter β0 of the intensity function and the 
coefficient  paramter  α  for  the  detection  probability  model.  We  can 
compute the L1  penalized estimates using the gradient ascent method 
(Goeman,  2010).  The  detailed  computation  algorithm  is  provided  in 
Appendix C.

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not directly discuss specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Instead, it focuses on the use of presence-only (PO) data from various citizen science platforms like eBird, Pl@ntNet, iNaturalist, and Observation.org, which are available on the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF).

However, when dealing with PO data, one must consider potential issues such as species identification errors and over-aggregation of records. In this case, the authors propose a method to handle these challenges by employing a penalized loss function with an L1 penalty for simultaneous shrinkage estimation and variable selection. This approach helps minimize the impact of heterogeneous observations and improve predictions compared to traditional methods.

While the context doesn't explicitly mention data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines, it highlights the importance of addressing data quality concerns in ecological studies. Proper data annotation techniques, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, play a crucial role in ensuring accurate labeling and improving the performance of machine learning models.
