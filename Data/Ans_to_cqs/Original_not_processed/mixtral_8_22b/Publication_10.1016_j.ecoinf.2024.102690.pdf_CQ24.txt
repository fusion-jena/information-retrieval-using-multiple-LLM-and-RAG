Identification of optional ecological sources 

The SOFM is an unsupervised learning neural network approach that 
combines dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis to allocate 
research units into different ES bundles based on spatial similarities. The 
ES bundles were divided using SOFM (using the R package kohonen) 
based on the results of the reconstructed ESV, and the ideal number of 
bundles  was  established  by  calculating  the  Davis-Boldin  Index  (DBI), 
which was used as the basis for identifying ecological sources and setting 
scenarios. Furthermore, this study used hotspot analysis (Getis-Ord G*
i ) 
to  analyze the  spatial clustering of  ESV and  considered  hotspot areas 
with a significance level of 90% or more as optional ecological sources.

learning neural network characterized by the topographic map structure 
of  the  input  scenario.  This  algorithm  overcomes  the  shortcomings  of 
linear dimensionality reduction techniques and can objectively classify 
ecosystem functions according to a predefined setting and automatically 
form weights among the elements, avoiding the subjectivity of weight 
setting  (Zhao  et  al.,  2023).  Consequently,  applying  SOFM  to  identify 
ecological sources can effectively analyze the geographical variability 
and similarity of ESs while also uncovering the dominant service func-
tions and ecological values of the land-use types where the ecological 
sources  are  located.  This  study  combined  the  SOFM  algorithm  with 
traditional  ESP  construction  paradigms,  which  emphasize  the  consid-
eration of the capacity of different regions to provide dominant ESs, and 
can  provide  a  new  idea  for  the  construction  and  optimization  of

As depicted in Fig. 6b, Scenario A exhibited 66 pinch points, which 
were  narrow  strips  of  cropland  concentrated  in  the  ecological  leisure 
corridors north of the city and recreational footpath corridors along the 
Pearl River in the south-central part of the city. In Scenario B, 33 pinch 
points were identified, consisting of water bodies and croplands along 
the river in the north-central part of the city. Scenario C had the highest 
number  of  pinch  points  (175).  These  pinch  points  are  composed  of 
natural  landscapes,  such  as  water  bodies  and  woodlands,  located  in 

waterways in the south-central part of the city.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, several strategies can be employed. One common strategy is to use fixed random seeds during model training and evaluation. By setting a specific seed value, researchers can ensure reproducibility of their experiments and eliminate any potential bias introduced by random initialization. Another strategy is to perform multiple runs with different random seeds and report average performance metrics. This helps to reduce the impact of outliers and provides a more robust estimate of the model's performance. Additionally, some deep learning frameworks offer deterministic algorithms that do not rely on random numbers, providing another way to mitigate the effects of randomness. However, it should be noted that these strategies may not completely eliminate all sources of randomness, and careful consideration must still be given to factors such as data sampling and hyperparameter tuning.

Based on the provided context, there is no information regarding handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to the query.
