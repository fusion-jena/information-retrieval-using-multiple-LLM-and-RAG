Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for this study. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based solely on the provided context. However, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. These methods help label or classify objects within images or videos, which can then be used to train machine learning models.
