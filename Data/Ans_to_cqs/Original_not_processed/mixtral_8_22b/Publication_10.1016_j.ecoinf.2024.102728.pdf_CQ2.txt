%Query
Query: "What data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., image, audio, video, CSV)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the references cited, it can be inferred that the primary data source is related to remote sensing and aerial imagery. For instance, Petrovska et al. (2020) discuss using deep learning for feature extraction in remote sensing, specifically focusing on aerial scene classification. Additionally, QGIS (2023) provides geographic information system software, which often deals with spatial data such as images or maps. Furthermore, Saltz et al. (1999) assess land cover changes using satellite imagery, suggesting that the data format used in their study might have been raster images. Therefore, it can be concluded that the most likely data format used in this deep learning pipeline is image data, particularly from remote sensing applications.
