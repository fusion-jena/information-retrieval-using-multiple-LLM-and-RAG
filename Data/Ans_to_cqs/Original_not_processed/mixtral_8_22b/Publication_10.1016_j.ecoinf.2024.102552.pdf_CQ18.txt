Finally, even if uncertainty can be quantified in all stages of analysis, 
which  we  attempted  to  do  (see  Appendix  B),  a  method  needs  to  be 
developed to incorporate all these sources of uncertainty into the final 
result (Comber et al., 2012). In the end, it was only possible to quali-
tatively  connect  our  results  back  to  ground  truthing  data.  This  was 
enough for our purposes but future work may be able to improve on the 
accuracy of the analysis as well as the propagation of uncertainty.

There may also be ways to include information from online spectral li-
braries  or  other  remote  sensing  products  with  more  detailed  spectral 
information and coarser spatial detail to refine classifications with the 
help of machine learning tools. We do caution, however, that though 
machine  learning  methods  have  great  potential  for  automatic  or  su-
pervised classification, they are still limited by the quality of their inputs 
(both  imagery  and  training  data):  using  NAIP  and  massive  training 
datasets, they can perform well, but they may not succeed for historical 
imagery with its wildly variable characteristics (e.g. blurriness, distor-
tion). More testing is necessary.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific strategies used to monitor the model performance during training. However, there are some relevant points regarding the use of machine learning tools for image classification and the need for high-quality input data. It appears that the authors used NAIP (National Agriculture Imagery Program) and massive training datasets for their models, which could potentially lead to good performance. They also mentioned the importance of considering the limitations of machine learning methods, particularly when dealing with historical imagery that might have varying characteristics like blurriness and distortion. To ensure accurate results, the authors emphasized the necessity of further testing. Nevertheless, without explicit details about monitoring strategies, one cannot definitively state what approach was taken to evaluate the model performance during training.
