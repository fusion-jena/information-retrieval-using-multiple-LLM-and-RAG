Authors' contributions 

LC  and  SAC  conceived  the  ideas  and  designed  the  methodology. 
DWM conceived the larger framework on which the study is based and 
¨
secured the funding. Individual field teams led by AJH, EA, 
OEC, PC, 
GRC, IAH, PPK, JHM, AR and CKWT collected the data. HMB helped 
collating  the  final  dataset.  LC  analysed  the  data  with  substantial 
contribution  of  SAC.  LC,  with  substantial  contribution  of  SAC,  DWM, 
AJH and ZK interpreted the results. LC led the writing, with substantial 
contribution of SAC, DWM, AJH and ZK. All authors contributed criti-
cally to the drafts and gave final approval for publication. 

Funding 

The majority of the team, as well as the data, were part of the core 
WildCRU  effort  supported  principally  by  Robertson  Foundation  and 
Panthera grants to DWM.
