Models were trained and tested by tuning the number of required 
epochs and then inspecting the model outputs and error outcomes for 
signs of overfitting. If the model focuses excessively on data fitting, it 
may imitate insignificant noise rather than the broad properties of in-
terest, resulting in overfitting.

cation  studies,  a  lack  of  data  is  the  greatest  challenge  and  limitation 
researchers encounter (Schneider et al., 2019). With the data collection 
compiled  in  this  work,  we  contribute  the  largest  fully  labeled  snow 
leopard dataset for deep learning research. In addition, we anticipate 
that our novel deep learning methods will encourage other academics to 
contribute  more  datasets  to  Whiskerbook.org  for  the  purpose  of 
continuously curating and enhancing the data used to improve the deep 
learning pipeline. Comparing these results to those of an earlier study by 
Johansson et al. (2020) that depended on human manual classification, 
without  AI  or  software,  determined  that  observers  significantly  over-
estimate  the  true  abundance.  AI-based  individual  ID  within  Whiske 
rbook.org  has  demonstrated  the  potential  to  enhance  the  precision 
and  efficiency  of  manual  observers,  approaching  more  accurate  esti-

and left-right mirroring data augmentation techniques, which reduced 
the  issue  of  overfitting,  and  strengthened  the  algorithms  capacity  to 
match individuals based on pelt patterns rather than the background. 
The  snow  leopard  training  pipeline  described  here  may  be  repur-
posed rather quickly to train new models if more users utilize the system 
and  additional  data  is  submitted.  The  existing  model  may  also  help 
bootstrap that data-curation process. There is a considerable possibility 
for  regional  and  global  research  collaborations  with  snow  leopard 
research  institutions  to  curate  and  independently  identify  data  that 
would advance these existing models toward greater sophistication and 
improved performance. Deep learning systems have the ability to sur-
pass humans in the re-identification of animals, even in the absence of 
obvious patterns and markings, if sufficient datasets and collaboration

Image classification 

To assess the efficacy of the various techniques, we compute the top- 
k accuracy on a test set, where k = 1, 5, and 10 represents the position of 
the correct match (i.e., an annotation of the same individual represented 
by a query annotation) within a list of proposed matches. Consequently, 
a top-1 rank is an accurate result supplied by the algorithm as the most 
probable match for a candidate annotation. A top-5 rating indicates that 
the correct answer might be any of the top-5 values among the returned 
options, and so on.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning before training a deep learning model. However, some general practices can be inferred from the text. For instance, the authors mention using data augmentation techniques like left-right mirroring to reduce overfitting and improve the algorithm's ability to match individuals based on pelt patterns. This implies that image manipulation could be part of their preprocessing routine. Additionally, they discuss collecting and contributing large, fully labeled datasets for deep learning research, suggesting that labeling and organizing data would likely precede training. Nevertheless, without direct evidence from the passage, one cannot definitively state what exact preprocessing steps are taken before training the deep learning model.
