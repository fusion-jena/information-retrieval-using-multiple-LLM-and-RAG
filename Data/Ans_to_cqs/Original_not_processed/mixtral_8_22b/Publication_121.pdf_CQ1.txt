CNN comes with the disadvantages of a huge number
of labelled training samples requirement for weighting pa-
rameters and powerful GPUs for a faster learning process.
With limited training samples, learning too many parameters
directly will result in overﬁtting even after using over-ﬁtting
prevention techniques such as Dropout [7]. Overﬁtting of a
machine learning model includes more terms and uses more
complicated approaches than necessary [8]. To make deep
CNN ﬁt for small datasets while keeping high accuracy is
a challenge. To overcome this challenge, transfer learning [9]
offers the solution, which implies reusing previously attained
knowledge in similar tasks. Some studies analyzed the use
of transfer learning for many deep learning algorithms. These
evaluations [10] concluded that transfer learning improves the
accuracy of deep learning models, which apply deep features
and ﬁne-tuning.

A. Transfer Learning from Pre-trained Models

When data used to train deep learning networks is not
enough, and it is expensive to create labelled data, transfer
learning, a promising paradigm,
is applied to acquire the
knowledge learned in previous settings. The most common
strategies of transfer learning are feature extraction and ﬁne-
tuning. For feature extraction, input data is provided to the
pre-trained model, and activation values of many layers are
stored to use as features. For ﬁne-tuning, the initial layers
of the model are ﬁxed, and the ﬁnal layers of the model

models, pre-trained on 1.4M images from 1000 classes. First,
the intermediate layer of all the models was selected to use
for feature extraction. For this purpose, the output of the last
layer (bottleneck layer) is commonly used prior to the ﬂatten
operation. The reason is that all the fully connected layers
are specialized to the task network was trained on; thus, the
features learned by these layers will not be useful for the new
task. The bottleneck features are more generic. Therefore, the
base models were frozen, loaded with weights trained on the
ImageNet dataset and used as a feature extractor. We added
a dropout layer with a dropout rate of 0.2 to reduce the
overﬁtting of the model. Finally, the top classiﬁer softmax
layer was added for predicting the class for an input image.
The model with the base model of MobileNetV2 was compiled
and optimized with Adam optimizer. The other with the base
model of MobileNetV3 were optimized with Gradient descent

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, generally speaking, there are several ways to collect raw data for deep learning applications. These include but are not limited to:

1. Surveys or Questionnaires: This method involves gathering data through direct interaction with individuals. It can be done online or offline and is often used when human insights are required.

2. Sensors: In various fields like IoT, robotics, autonomous vehicles, etc., sensor data is widely used. Sensors can capture real-time data, including visual, auditory, temperature, pressure, motion, etc.

3. Public Datasets: Many organizations and institutions release their datasets publicly for research purposes. These datasets cover a wide range of topics and can be very beneficial for training deep learning models. Examples include ImageNet for computer vision tasks, MNIST for handwritten digit recognition, etc.

4. Web Scraping: This technique involves automatically extracting large amounts of data from websites. It can be particularly useful when dealing with textual data.

5. APIs: Application Programming Interfaces allow developers to access data from different platforms and services. They can be used to gather data from social media, search engines, databases, etc.
