2.3.2. LST retrieval 

LST is a valuable source of data that provides insights into the cli-
matic, environmental, and physical characteristics of the Earth’s surface 
(Çolak and Sunar, 2020; Jimenez-Munoz et al., 2009; Tang et al., 2021). 
It can be estimated from satellite data or direct ground-truth measure-
ments. In this study, we derived the LST dataset from infrared radiations 
measured on channels 31 and 32 using the MODIS-TERRA sensor. The 
data  was  obtained  from  the  MOD11A2  product,  which  offers  8-day 
temporal  and  1  km  spatial  resolutions  covering  2005–2018.  It  is 
important to note that LST can only be accurately measured under clear- 
sky conditions. To calculate LST from MODIS Terra MOD11A2, we uti-
lised an equation provided below by Artis and Carnahan in 1982 (Artis 
and Carnahan, 1982).

NDBI:  A  valuable  method  for  monitoring  changes  in  urban  areas 
over  time  involves  using  near-infrared  (NIR)  and  mid-infrared  (MIR) 
bands. This method relies on a significant indicator that calculates the 
difference  ratio  between  the  spectral  reflectance  values  in  these  two 
bands, as shown in Eq. (2) (Zha et al., 2003).

The study used Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS NDBI data from 2014 to 2018, 
applying machine  learning to explore correlations  between NDBI  and 
various parameters.

2.3.3. Modelling 

Artificial  neural  networks  are  a  successful  method  in  modelling 
studies and are frequently discussed in the literature. Essentially, neural 
networks learn from past and present data, uncover hidden relationships 
among  the  data,  and  utilise  them  to  make  predictions  for  future  sce-
narios. Among the various types of artificial neural network models, the 
NARX model is widely employed. In this study, the NARX feedback ANN 
model  was  utilised  to  define  vegetation  biomass  density  for  2030.  A 
hybrid  model  was  developed  by  combining  wavelet  analysis  and  the 
NARX ANN algorithm to enhance the performance of the NARX ANN 
model.
