drilled down on the results using another high-quality model (BirdNET)

Question: %INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the provided pieces of context to answer the query in less than 400 words. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any information about which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot determine whether they used AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or any other deployment platform.
