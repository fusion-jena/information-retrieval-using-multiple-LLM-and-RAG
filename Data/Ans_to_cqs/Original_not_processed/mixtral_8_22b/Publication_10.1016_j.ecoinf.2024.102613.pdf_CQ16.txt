Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not contain any specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, generally speaking, some commonly used criteria include reaching a certain number of epochs, achieving a desired level of accuracy or performance on a validation set, observing a plateau in the validation loss, or meeting other specified stopping conditions. It is important to note that these criteria may vary depending on the specific task, dataset, and model being trained. Without additional context, it cannot be determined which criteria would be appropriate for this particular case.
