LiDAR GEDI derived tree canopy height heterogeneity reveals patterns of 
biodiversity in forest ecosystems

2022),  biomass  density  (Duncanson  et  al.,  2022),  forest  fuels  classifi-
cation (Hoffr´en et al., 2023) and surface elevation (Quir´os et al., 2021) 
which are key components for a global monitoring of forest ecosystems. 
Limitations at local scale arise because of the generalized footprint and 
the  sparse  sampling  design  (Liu  et  al.,  2022).  To  extrapolate  GEDI 
samples  for  continuous  information  on  vegetation  structure,  multiple 
approaches  have  been  developed  fusing  GEDI  samples  with  passive 
optical images in machine learning models (Liu et al., 2022; Rishmawi 
et al., 2021; Kacic et al., 2021). At global scale, Potapov et al. (2021) 
made use of machine learning algorithms to compute and derive a global 
forest  canopy  height  map  (hereafter  “Potapov30m”)  at  30  m  spatial 
resolution fusing GEDI and phenology metrics based on Landsat 8 OLI 
imagery. More recently Lang et al. (2022), Lang et al. (2022), produced a

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, generally speaking, some common postprocessing steps include generating saliency maps, calculating evaluation metrics such as accuracy or F1 score, creating confusion matrices, and visualizing results using various techniques like heatmaps or scatter plots. These steps help assess the performance of the trained model and provide insights into its strengths and weaknesses. It is important to note that these postprocessing steps may vary depending on the type of problem being solved and the chosen modeling approach.

Based on the given context, it appears that the study involves using LiDAR data from NASA’s Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) mission along with other datasets to analyze forest ecosystems. The authors discuss how they used machine learning algorithms to create a global forest canopy height map by combining GEDI data with phenology metrics based on Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery. They also mention limitations of working with GEDI data due to its large footprint and sparse sampling design. However, there is no explicit discussion about postprocessing steps taken after model training. Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed answer regarding this aspect based solely on the provided context.
