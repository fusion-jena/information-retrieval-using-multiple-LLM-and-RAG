validation data, with the network featuring two hidden neurons and the 
lowest error being chosen. The output layer contained a single neuron 
representing carbon stock outputs.

During  the  MLPNN  training  phase,  initial  arbitrary  connection 
weights were assigned. Inputs were forward-fed from the input to the 
hidden  layer.  Hidden  neurons  multiplied  inputs  by  weights,  summed 
products,  and  processed  sums  through  a  transfer  function.  Results 
propagated  to  the  output  layer,  with  output  values  compared  to  ex-
pected  values  for  error  computation.  Iterative  error  back-propagation 
adjusted  connection  weights  until  reaching  a  target  minimal  error. 
The network then accurately estimated carbon stocks for both training 
and new input data without training data. This required tests to deter-
mine optimal learning rate (0.01), momentum (0.18), and training it-
erations  (500).  The  trained  network  was  subsequently  used  for  feed- 
forward predictions on continuous spatial data.

effective learning. Among ANN architectures, the multi-layer perceptron 
(MLP) neural network stands out as the most used.

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training include using validation data for choosing the lowest error during the Multi-Layer Perception Neural Network (MLPNN) training phase. In this case, the network featured two hidden neurons. Additionally, the context mentions that the network requires tests to determine optimal learning rate, momentum, and training iterations. However, the specific criteria for splitting the data into training, testing, and validation sets are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

In general, when working with deep learning models like MLPNN, data is often divided into three subsets: training set, validation set, and test set. The training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set is used to tune the parameters and prevent overfitting. Finally, the test set is used to evaluate the performance of the fully-trained model. Common practices for dividing the dataset include using 60-70% of the data for training, 15-20% for validation, and 15-20% for testing. However, these percentages can vary depending on the size and nature of the dataset.
