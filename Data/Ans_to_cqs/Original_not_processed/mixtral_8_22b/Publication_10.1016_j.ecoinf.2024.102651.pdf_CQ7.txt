classify  objects  of  different  sizes.  The  results  obtained  are  shown  in 
Table 3.

The proposed classification network in this paper demonstrates su-
perior performance on the dataset, as indicated by the results presented 
in Table 3. In each classification network, the accuracy for the “medium” 
is consistently higher than that for the “small”. Besides, the experimental 
data in Table 3 also indicates that the classification network proposed 
achieves the highest classification accuracy among the “medium”  and 
“small”.  In  our  proposed  model,  the  classification  accuracy  for  both 
“medium”  and “small”  is improved by 3.56% and 2.93% respectively, 
compared to the ResNet50 and ViT. Additionally, the classification ac-
curacy for the “medium” is 5.6% higher compare with the “small” in the 
CA-Hybrid network.

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, or validation sets. However, it is common practice in machine learning to use a random stratified sampling method to ensure that all classes have equal representation across the splits. This helps prevent overfitting and ensures that the model generalizes well to unseen data. Other methods include using a fixed percentage split, such as 80/20 or 70/30, where 80% or 70% of the data is used for training and the remaining 20% or 30% is used for testing. Cross-validation can also be used to further evaluate the model's performance on multiple subsets of the data.
