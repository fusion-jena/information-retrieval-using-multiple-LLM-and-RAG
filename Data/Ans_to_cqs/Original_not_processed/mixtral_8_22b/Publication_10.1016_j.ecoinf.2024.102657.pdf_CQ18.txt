3.3. Test 3: Training on 80% of data and adding in 2 new dialect classes

grams, and created the metadata .csv file necessary for training the CNN 
and k-NN. Identical in structure to the metadata file outlined above, this 
file contained the metadata for the training set as opposed to the met-
adata for the entire dataset. 

No additional preprocessing was applied to the spectrograms as the 
goal was to do the least amount of preprocessing possible in order to 
demonstrate  the  power  of  human-machine  teaming.  Further,  when 
assessing the accuracy of the CNN on noise-filtered data versus raw data, 
the accuracy levels were similar: after 10 trials, the CNNâ€™s accuracy on 
the  filtered  data  averaged  to  99.22%  and  the  accuracy  on  the  non- 
filtered data averaged to 99.25%.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions that the goal was to apply minimal preprocessing to demonstrate the power of human-machine teaming. Additionally, it states that the accuracy of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was assessed by comparing its performance on noise-filtered data vs. raw data, resulting in similar accuracy levels. This suggests that monitoring the model performance might have involved evaluating the accuracy of the CNN using different types of input data. Nevertheless, without more specific details, it cannot be definitively stated what exact strategy was employed to monitor the model performance during training.
