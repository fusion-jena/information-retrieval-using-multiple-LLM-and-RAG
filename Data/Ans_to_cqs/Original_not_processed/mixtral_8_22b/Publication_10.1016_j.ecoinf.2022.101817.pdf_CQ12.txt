model was designed based on the VGG architecture. Unlike conventional 
VGG16 or VGG19 models (the numeric value corresponds to the number 
of layers), our CNN model contained only 12 layers (see Fig. 3).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The pipeline uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classification tasks. Specifically, the model employed is based on the VGG architecture, which is known for its strong performance on the ImageNet dataset. However, unlike traditional VGG16 or VGG19 models, this particular implementation consists of only 12 layers. This customized CNN model has been chosen because of its effectiveness in handling various environmental conditions present in terrestrial images.
