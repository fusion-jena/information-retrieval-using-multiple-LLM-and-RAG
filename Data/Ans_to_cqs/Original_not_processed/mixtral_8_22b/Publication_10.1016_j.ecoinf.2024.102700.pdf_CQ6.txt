= 23), there was an increased use of machine learning techniques (n =
22), particularly Maxent, and, although limited, deep learning strategies
(e.g., neural networks, Cazau et al., 2023), likely suggesting a shift to-
wards machine learning methodologies (Maglietta et al., 2023). Another
notable trend was the increased incorporation of anthropogenic vari-
ables in modelling to assess the influence of human activity on species
habitat use, especially related to fishing and boating activities (n = 7

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it is important to note that these preprocessing steps are crucial when working with deep learning models. Normalization involves rescaling the input features so they have zero mean and unit variance, which can help improve convergence during optimization. Scaling ensures that all features contribute equally to the final output by adjusting their magnitudes relative to each other. Cleaning refers to removing noise from the dataset, handling missing values, and dealing with outliers. These preprocessing steps are essential to ensure that the trained model performs well and generalizes effectively to unseen data.
