Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

landscapes  unit  provision  based  on  expert  data  from  the  literature 
against  those  from  a  field  survey.  Both  models  used  the  Nova  Scotia 
Forest  Ecosystem  Classification  at  10  m  resolution.  The  main  result 
highlighted that the output map informed with field data was 8% more

Based on this evaluation, we performed a cross-comparison based on 
our ApisFis model and validation data. Fig. 17 presents the result of the 
matching comparison for the 12 sites. For each, the field estimations are 
close to the outcome of our model. For sites 2 & 4 & 6 & 8 and 12 the 
outcome  of  the  field  campaign  is,  respectively,  low,  moderate,  and 
suitable. Our model yields very similar results to the field estimations for 
these sites. However, for some sites, the field estimations were higher 
than our model prediction (Sites 1 &  3 and 7) and for other sites, the 
field estimations were lower than the Apis-FIS model outcomes (Sites 5 
& 9 & 10 & 11).

The approach we propose proved to be both reliable and effective 
through a validation process. Additionally, we noticed that the area of 
vegetation, particularly land use change, and the availability of floral 
resources  have  a  major  influence  on  honey  bee  productivity.  This 
research  demonstrated  that  when  the  culture  map  in  our  model  was 
updated  and  compared  to  field  data  obtained  during  validation,  it 
became clear that data is essential for this decision-making instrument. 
Beekeepers need this information to be able to quickly adapt to their 
requirements. Results can also be useful in taking immediate action after 
an  unexpected  event  or  when  making  decisions  about changes  in  the 
environment or on land use. Data gathering should happen through a 
collaborative  approach  between  conservationists,  decision-makers, 
farmers, and other stakeholders.

The rules for this Apis-FIS subsystem are: 
IF (LCWTSuit is VL) THEN (ApisSuit is VLS). 
IF (LCWTSuit is L) OR (DistSuit is UP) THEN (ApisSuit is LS). 
IF (LCWTSuit is M) THEN (ApisSuit is MS). 
IF (LCWTSuit is H) OR (DistSuit is AP) THEN (ApisSuit is HS). 
IF (LCWTSuit is HS) THEN (ApisSuit is HS). 
To  implement  our  FIS  models,  we  use  the  fuzzy  logic  toolbox  of 
Matlab 2023b. This toolbox provides large capabilities to choose several 
membership functions and to build any desired set of inference rules.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide a detailed response regarding the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, generally speaking, strategies to monitor model performance during training often involve techniques such as using validation datasets, tracking metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or loss function values, visualizing learning curves, or employing methods like cross-validation. In this case, since the text mentions a validation process and compares the model's outcomes with field estimations, it suggests that a form of validation dataset might have been employed to assess the model's performance during training.
