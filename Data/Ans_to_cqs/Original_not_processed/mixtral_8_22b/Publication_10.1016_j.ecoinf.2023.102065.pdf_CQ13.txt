LeBien et al., 2020; Ruff et al., 2021; Stowell et al., 2019; Zhong et al., 
2020). Tuning of the network hyperparameters and convolutional filters 
provides automated feature learning, thereby removing an obstacle of 
earlier  machine  learning  methods  (Gupta  et  al.,  2021).  Sound  data 
include frequency, amplitude and temporal information, and there are 
different  approaches  to  express  these  data  in  CNN  architectures.  One 
approach is to represent sound data as amplitude-time waveforms, then 
train  1-dimensional  neural  network  architectures,  such  as  Recurrent 
Neural Networks (RNNs) to identify distinct patterns (Sang et al., 2018; 
Weninger and Schuller, 2011; Zhang et al., 2021). Another approach is 
to  train  CNNs  to  classify  2D  image  spectrograms  (Kahl  et  al.,  2021; 
LeBien et al., 2020; Ruff et al., 2021; Stowell et al., 2019; Zhong et al., 
2020).  A  popular  extension  is  to  use  mel-spectrograms  from  human

2.5. CNN fine-tuning data from ROIs 

We randomly sampled 50 ROIs per species with “presence” to form a 
held-out test set for accuracy assessment (Section 2.8.1). The remaining 
ROIs with species presence were used to fine-tune the CNN models. We 
randomly sampled 100 of these ROIs per species to form a validation set 
and the remaining formed a training set, which had on average 887 per 
species (min = 349, max = 3094). ROIs that were >2 s in duration were 
used in their entirety. For those that were <2 s in duration, we expanded 
the start/stop (i.e., padded) equally on each side of the ROI to total 2 s. 
Different vocalizations for a given species were combined into a single 
class per species. If any ROIs were overlapping in time from different 
pattern-matching runs for a given species, we placed those ROIs in the 
training set to avoid temporal autocorrelation in our validation and test 
data.

out set of sample data from the same dataset as the training/validation 
data (i.e., ROIs) greatly overestimates performance of CNN models.

%Query
Query: "What are the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model (e.g., learning rate, optimizer)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. However, it does state that tuning of the network hyperparameters was performed, indicating that various hyperparameters were adjusted during the development process. Unfortunately, without more detailed information about the specific hyperparameters used, it is impossible to provide a precise answer to this query based solely on the provided context.
