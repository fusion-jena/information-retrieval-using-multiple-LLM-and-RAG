racy assessment requires these parameters to calculate the total number of 
training samples required for the image classified using Eq. 1.

For  the  simulations  the  infiltration  capacity  was  quantified  in  a 
parameter  derived  by  the  Soil  Conservation  Service  (SCS)  called  CN. 
This parameter determines the runoff over an area based on soil type, 
soil cover and the hydrological group of the soil (Cronshey, 1986). The 
figure calculated for sub-basin 1 is 80.1, for sub-basin 2 it is 78.5, for 
sub-basin 3 it is 77.3, for sub-basin 4 it is 74.0, for sub-basin 5 it is 76.1 
and for sub-basin 6 it is 81.0. To better assess the possible effects of using 
NBS,  four  hypothetical  scenarios  were  chosen.  These  scenarios  were 
based on changing the land use from agriculture to forestry. According 
to  Perpi˜na  Castillo  et  al.  (2020),  Galicia  has  one  of  with  the  highest 
percentages of abandoned agricultural land of any region in Spain, with

Images were then classified out via Random Forest (RF). This is a 
specific  machine  learning  technique  based  on  the  iterative,  random 
creation  of  decision  trees.  First,  the  input  features  and  classes  were 
defined. RF calculates several random decision trees based on (1) the 
number of training samples and (2) the number of trees. The more trees 
there are, the more accurate the model is, but the longer the calculation 
time is. RF creates several decision trees randomly using the Gini coef-
ficient to split them. A model based on the decision trees is thus created 
and used to classify all the pixels. A pixel is classified according to the 
majority vote of the decision trees. The number of training samples was 
5000 and the number of trees was 500.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information about the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it mentions that images were classified using the Random Forest (RF) method, which is a machine learning technique based on decision trees rather than a deep learning model such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers. Therefore, no specific deep learning model is mentioned in the given context.
