Following

The study employs the HRNet model due to its high accuracy and 
stability. HRNet effectively performs semantic segmentation by simul-
taneously  merging  high-resolution  and  low-resolution  convolution 
computations (Sun et al., 2019). By using HRNet to model social media 
image data in PyCharm software for semantic segmentation processing, 
in combination with graphics processing software for proofreading, the 
greenness, blueness, and sky openness index can be derived using the 
formulas described by Wu et al. (2023). G indicates the level of greenery 
in  the  panoramic  image;  PGreenness  is  the  total  number  and  amount  of 
pixels  corresponding  to  vegetative  and  green  spaces  identified  in  the 
semantic segmentation process; PTotal  represents the overall number of 
pixels specified in the image; O represents the level of openness in the 
panoramic image; PSky denotes the percentage of identified sky elements

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The papers referenced do not explicitly mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in their deep learning pipelines. However, common regularization techniques used in deep learning include dropout, L1 regularization, and L2 regularization. Dropout randomly sets a fraction of input units to 0 during training time, which helps prevent overfitting. L1 regularization adds an absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients to the loss function, while L2 regularization adds a squared magnitude of the coefficient to the loss function. These methods help reduce overfitting by adding constraints to the complexity of the learned models.
