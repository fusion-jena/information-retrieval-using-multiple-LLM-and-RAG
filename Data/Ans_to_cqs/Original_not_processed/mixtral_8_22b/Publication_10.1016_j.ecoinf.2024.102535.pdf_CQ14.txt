Appendix A. Network architectures 

The network architectures of the models evaluated in the experiments are described in detail in Fig. 9. The light green areas in that figure represent 
feature extractor modules based on the different architectures, i.e., VGG, ResNet, and Xception. The orange area represents the architecture of the 
classifier module, to which the outputs of each feature extractor are submitted.

In  the  figure,  each  column  contains  results  for  each  substratum 
characterization criteria, i.e., the amount of S/W fragments, Fig. 7(a)(d) 
(g)(j)(m)(p); lithology, Fig. 7(b)(e)(h)(k)(n)(q); and morphology, Fig. 7 
(c)(f)(i)(l)(o)(r).  Each  row  represents  a  different  site  combination  for 
training  and  testing  the  CDC,  which  permits  the  assessment  of  the 
generalization  capacity  of  the  ensemble  in  cross-site  evaluations.  The 
dark blue curves represent the accuracy and uncertainty of the ensemble 
when it was trained and tested using images from the same site. The light 
blue  curves  represent  cross-site  combinations  in  which  the  CDC  was 
trained with data from one site and evaluated with data from a different 
site.

Table 4 shows the CDC results in terms of F1-scores for all substratum 
characterization criteria and sites. The table shows the average F1-score 
of three rounds of experiments as in the previous experiments. Similarly, 
the bold values represent the best results obtained with the committee. 
In general, the ensemble of networks reached similar scores to those 
obtained by each network individually. Specifically, considering eval-
uations in sites where the classifiers were trained, i.e., results described 
in the diagonal of Table 4, CDC reached results that are superior to most 
of those obtained with the individual models.

Query: "How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no information available regarding how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. The given context does not provide any details about whether grid search, random search, or any other method was used for hyperparameter optimization. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful response to this query.
