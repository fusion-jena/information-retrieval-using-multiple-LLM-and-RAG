iable importance for each potential predictor. To obtain a high level of 
predicted  accuracy,  the  RF  model,  a  regression  tree  method  uses 

bootstrap aggregation and randomisation of predictors (Rigatti, 2017). 
The  model  works  by  using  the  training  dataset  containing  both  the 
response  and  predictor variables,  associated  distance matrix,  and  dis-
tance  thresholds  (Benito,  2021).  The  distance  threshold  is  simply  a

2) What are the relative roles of these drivers in determining the rich-

ness and abundance of invasive alien species in the region?  

3)  Does the relative importance of these drivers differ between the two 

diversity metrics (i.e., species richness and abundance)?

Similarly, the species abundance initially showed a progressive decrease 
with increasing slope and then increased continuously and reached its

abundance  of  invasive  species  showed  a  stabilizing  effect  with 
increasing  population  density  up  to  500,  after  which  it  started  to 
decrease with an increase in population till it reach about 750, beyond 
which it again showed stabilizing effect upto the population density of 
about  2700,  after  which  it  exhibited  a  steep  increase  with  increasing 
population density (Fig. 7). Furthermore, species abundance displayed a 
stabilizing  effect  with  increasing  soil  water  content  up  to  a  level  of 
approximately  29%,  after  which  it  showed  a  sharp  increase  with 
increasing soil water content.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the provided context, the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete are not explicitly mentioned. However, generally speaking, common criteria used to determine when training is complete include reaching a certain number of epochs or iterations, achieving a desired level of performance on a validation set, observing a plateau in the validation loss, or meeting some predefined stopping condition such as early stopping based on no improvement in validation error over a specified number of epochs. In this case, since the Random Forest (RF) model was used, the training process may have been stopped once the out-of-bag error rate stabilizes or reaches a satisfactory level. Additionally, cross-validation can be employed to evaluate the generalization performance of the trained model and help decide when to stop training.
