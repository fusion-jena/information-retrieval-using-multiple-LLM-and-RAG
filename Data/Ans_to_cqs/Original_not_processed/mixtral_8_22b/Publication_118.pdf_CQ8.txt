3.3. Network architecture 

The architecture used was a heavily modified version of that used in 
“Unsupervised Deep Learning with Pytorch” by github user “eelxpeng” 
(eelxpeng, 2018). As the size of our audio spectrograms has been con-
strained to 128 × 128 pixel RGB images with values repeated in each 
color channel to produce a greyscale image. For this initial experiment 
testing  the feasibility of using an auto-encoder-generated feature rep-
resentation for ecoacoustic analysis, we chose a basic auto-encoder ar-
chitecture  to  minimise  the  complications  that  may  be  introduced  by 
more advanced architectures. A rectified linear unit (ReLU) based acti-
vation function was be used, to help mitigate the vanishing/exploding 
gradient  problem  (Xu  et  al.,  2015).  Networks  using  implicit  pooling 
(determined using pytorch) and explicit max-pooling were used.

For  deep  learning  tasks  you  often  start  from  a  point  of  labelling 
training your data. However this can be slow and problematic. It can be 
useful to have a general representation for machine learning, that does 
not  rely  on  labeled  data  or  domain  specific  features.  This  paper  will 
focus on the use of auto-encoders for automatic feature extraction. First 
we  will  explore  the  relevant  literature,  then  explain  our  method  for 
automatically learning features, our method for comparing with other 
feature  representations,  results,  and  finally  our  discussion  and 
conclusions. 

The outcome of this research is an alternative method for analysing 
eco-acoustic  data.  It  will  be  of  significance  to  the  fields  of  Machine 
Learning and Soundscape Ecology. This research will be of direct benefit

The autoencoder based on explicit max-pooling consists of a 128x128x3 
input layer, and 4 convolutional layers using 3 × 3 pixel kernels, stride 
of 1 pixels and zero padding of 1 pixel on each but the first layer, and 4 
max-pooling layers using 4 × 4 pixel kernels, stride of 2 pixels and zero 
padding of 1 pixel. The encoder’s output is then flattened to produce a 
384x1x1  feature  vector.  The  decoder  network  accepts  the  384x1x1 
feature vector produced by the encoder network as its input, and consists 
of 4 convolutional layers with a 3 × 3 kernel, stride of 1 pixel and zero 
padding of 1 pixel on each layer except the last, and 4 max-unpooling 
layers using 4 × 4 pixel kernels, stride of 2 pixels and zero padding of 
1 pixel, which produces a 128x128x3 output.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it mentions that the architecture used was a heavily modified version of that used in "Unsupervised Deep Learning with Pytorch" by Github user "eelxpeng". Therefore, one might infer that the code could potentially be found in the same location or related repositories. Nevertheless, without further information, it cannot be definitively stated where the exact code repository is located.
