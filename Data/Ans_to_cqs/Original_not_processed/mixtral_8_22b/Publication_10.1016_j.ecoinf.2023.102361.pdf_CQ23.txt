2.2. Split the datasets 

In this research, the datasets were randomly divided into three parts 
for training, validation and testing. Here, 60% of the data was used to 
train the deep learning models, and 20% of them was kept to validate the 
models. The remaining 20% data was used to evaluate the performance 
of the models. Table 1 show the number of data in the dataset and how 
they are separated for training, testing and validation.

2.6.4. Model training with selected patches 

We trained the same deep learning models as mentioned in Section 
2.5. For training, we resized all the patches of images to a resolution of 
256 × 256 pixels. Although after dividing the image into patches, there 
were images with lower resolution, i.e., 64 × 64 and 128 × 128 pixels, 
they were converted into a uniform size. 

2.6.5. Evaluation of the models 

An image was divided into patches first to predict its class label. Then 
the important patches were selected using the approach mentioned in 
Section 2.6.3. After that, the model predicted the class label for each 
patch. The weighted majority voting technique was used to predict the 
class label of the image from the predicted labels.

2.4. Performance metrics 

The  performance  of  image  classification  models  can  be  evaluated 
using several metrics which can provide valuable insights about their 
effectiveness.  The  choice  of  metrics  depends  on  the  specific  re-
quirements and characteristics of the task. In our study, we have chosen 
the  following  commonly  used  metrics  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  of  the 
deep learning models: 

• Accuracy: Accuracy measures the proportion of correctly classi-
fied images out of the total number of images. The metric provides a 
general overview of model performance. 

Accuracy=

TruePositives+TrueNegatives
TruePositives+True Negatives+FalsePositives+FalseNegatives

.

In these metrics, true positives are correct positive predictions, true 
negatives  are  correct  negative  predictions,  false  positives  are  incorrect 
positive  predictions,  and  false  negatives  are 
incorrect  negative 
predictions.

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning models, several measures were taken during the research process. Firstly, the datasets were randomly divided into three parts for training, validation, and testing. This division allowed the models to learn from a diverse set of data, preventing overfitting and improving their ability to generalize to unseen data. Specifically, 60% of the data was used for training, while 20% was allocated for validation and another 20% for testing. This distribution ensured that the models could effectively learn patterns from the training data and then be validated and tested on separate sets of data.

Secondly, the use of various deep learning models such as MobileNetV2, VGG16, VGG19, ResNet-50, Inception-V3, Inception-ResNetV2, Xception, DenseNet121, DenseNet169, and DenseNet201 contributed to the generalizability of the results. Each of these models has unique architectures and strengths, allowing them to capture different features and patterns within the data. By employing multiple models, the researchers aimed to increase the robustness and reliability of their findings.

Lastly, the experimental setup included evaluating the performance of the models using precision, recall, and F1 score metrics. These metrics provided a comprehensive assessment of the models' abilities to accurately classify images. Precision measured the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions, recall calculated the proportion of true positive predictions among actual positive instances, and the F1 score represented the harmonic mean of precision and recall. By considering these metrics, the researchers could better understand the strengths and weaknesses of each model and select the most suitable one(s) for their application.

Overall, the combination of diverse datasets, multiple deep learning models, and rigorous evaluation methods helped ensure the generalizability of the deep learning models in this research.
