Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

4.5. Sample thinning 

Sample  thinning  had  very  little  effect  on  accuracy  or  variable 
importance,  or  mapped  models,  indicating  no  clear  benefits  for 
tampering  with  samples  that  may  provide  information  about  species 
characteristics and responses to the environment. It is not necessary to 
add another modeling step that involves many choices, although thin-
ning  may  be  beneficial  if  thousands  of  samples  were  taken  from  one 
study site. An outcome of reducing samples is that minimum sample size 
thresholds need to be lowered to maintain the same species pool. Sample 
thinning does provide a confirmation that sample size is not as critical as 
capturing ecological amplitude for species distribution. 

5. Conclusions

Accuracy  metrics  occurred  on  separate  testing  data,  or  withheld 
known classes, to determine how well the classifier assigned classes using 
predictor  variables.  The  testing  data  were  25%  of  samples  for  this 
modeling, a randomly sampled split that is standard modeling practice 
(performed through the createDataPartition function in the caret pack-
age). The true positive rate or sensitivity is a measure of the number of 
predicted observations that were accurately assigned to a class, while the 
true negative rate or specificity is a measure of the number of predicted 
observations where the response variable of interest did not occur. 

2.4. Variable reduction for correlation

1.4. Modeling approaches 

Modeling also includes selection of the classifier (or probability of 
occurrence estimator), which encompasses hundreds of different options 
(FernÂ´andez-Delgado  et  al.,  2014),  although  general  linear  models, 
MaxEnt,  and  random  forests  are  among  the  most  commonly  applied 
classifiers  (Santini  et  al.,  2021).  For  the  selected  classifier,  modeling 
package  options  enable  automated  tuning  for  parameters  through 
resampling and standard default values to reach the most accurate final 
model configuration. Multiple methods may be applied to detect over-
lapping outcomes, allowing some strength of evidence within a study 
rather  than  only  comparing  support  from  other  studies,  but  multiple 
methods may be too burdensome when hundreds or thousands of models 
are generated due to numerous species, predictor variable combinations, 
and time intervals.

overall  accuracy  was  nearly  identical  at  0.967  for  thinned  samples 
compared to 0.968 for all samples. Equally, ranking of summed variable 
importance was almost identical, with a reversal between the eighth and 
ninth important variables and a different ordering of the tenth, twelfth, 
and thirteenth important variables, when 78 models of thinned samples 
were compared with either 78 or 80 models with all samples.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention any use of deep learning models. However, it discusses several practices used to improve the robustness and reliability of their models. These include the use of separate testing data and withholding known classes to evaluate the performance of the classifier. This approach is similar to cross-validation, where a portion of the data is held back during training and then used to test the model's ability to generalize. In this case, 25% of the samples were used as testing data, which is a common practice in machine learning. Additionally, the text mentions the use of resampling techniques and automated parameter tuning to optimize the final model configuration. While these practices do not directly address the diversity of the dataset, they contribute to improving the model's ability to generalize by preventing overfitting and ensuring optimal model parameters.
