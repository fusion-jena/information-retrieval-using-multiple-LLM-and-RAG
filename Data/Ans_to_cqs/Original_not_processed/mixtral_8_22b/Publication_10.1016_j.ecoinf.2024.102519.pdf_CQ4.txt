research  on  artificial  intelligence  (AI).  Traditional  linear  program-
ming, nonlinear programming, dynamic programming, modern genetic 
algorithms  (GA),  particle  swarm  optimization  algorithms,  and  deep 
learning have achieved great success in both theoretical and practical 
applications. Mohammadi (2023) modeled various drought timescales 
by  combining  artificial  neural  networks  with  firefly  algorithms. 
Emamgholizadeh  et  al.  (2023)  used  enhanced  machine  learning 
methods to predict soil cation exchange capacity in the southern region 
of China. Ghezelbash et al. (2023a) combined the GA and firefly opti-
mization  algorithm  with  the  K-means  clustering  method  for  copper- 
related geochemical footprints of porphyry and skarn in the Baft area 
of Kerman, Iran, and achieved good research results. Ghezelbash et al. 
(2023b) added GA to K-means and SVM to construct GIS-based mineral 
prospecting maps, and the results showed that the SVM model based on

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, some common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, and adding noise. These techniques help increase the amount of training data available and improve the generalization performance of a deep learning model by introducing variations into the input data.

Based on the context, it can be inferred that X. Wu et al. conducted research using AI methods such as traditional linear programming, nonlinear programming, dynamic programming, modern genetic algorithms (GA), particle swarm optimization algorithms, and deep learning. They also mentioned that these methods have been successful in both theoretical and practical applications. However, there is no mention of any specific data augmentation techniques used in their study or the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query based solely on the given context.
