where AUCcorrected  and Dcorrected represent the accuracy of the corrected 
model, AUCbiased  and Dbiased  represent the accuracy of the uncorrected 
model,  the  range  of  ΔAUC  and  ΔD  is  from  negative  infinity  to  1,  a 
negative value indicates that the performance of the corrected model is 
worse than the uncorrected model, and a positive value indicates that it 
is better than the uncorrected model, 1 indicates that the model has been 
perfectly corrected.

on environmental covariates. Essentially, the sampling bias caused by 
the environment (variables) is presented by mapping the environmental 
space to the geographic space. Therefore, this study proposes that cor-
recting sampling bias in environmental spaces is beneficial yet requires 
further testing (El-Gabbas and Dormann, 2018).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, common methods used for hyperparameter optimization include grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and gradient-based optimization. Grid search involves defining a set of possible values for each parameter and then evaluating all combinations of these parameters. Random search randomly samples points within the defined ranges for each parameter. Bayesian optimization uses a probabilistic approach to find the optimal combination of parameters based on previous results. Gradient-based optimization techniques use gradients or derivatives to iteratively update the parameters towards their optimal values. Without further information, it cannot be determined which specific method was used for hyperparameter optimization in this case.
