A key point in machine learning is represented by the data, not only 
by the algorithms. The structure of the training data can have profound 
and critical effects on the outcomes of models trained with the RF al-
gorithm. While this is an important point which is worthy of evaluation, 
our dataset was limited to a collection of camera trap data on several 
species which makes it difficult to comprehensively compare the effects 
of the data and its structure. We note that this is better explored with 
simulation, as in a recent paper from our group (Kumar et al., 2021) 
which  indeed  showed  that  the  spatial  pattern  and  shape  of  the  envi-
ronmental manifold itself affects performance of GLM and RF. 

5. Conclusions

For the second approach (hereafter bootstrapped RF), we subsampled 
the entire camera trap dataset by randomly selecting 20% of the pres-
ence  and  of  the  absence  locations.  We  then  trained  RF  with  the  sub-
sampled  dataset  and  produced  the  species  distribution  probability 
surface. We reiterated this framework 100 times, replacing each time the 
data used to train the models, and produced 100 different probability 
surfaces.  We  then  obtained  the  final  species  distribution  probability 
surfaces  by averaging the  100 probability surfaces, independently for 
each  felid.  Each  individual  RF  was  produced  by  bagging  the  training 
data, a procedure automatically implemented in the algorithm to reduce 
the variance that might otherwise characterise decision trees. Therefore, 
by bootstrapping also the training data of each RF, we implemented a 
two-stage bagging procedure. 

2.4.2. Random forest – model validation

Independently for each felid, we investigated the most representative 
scale for each covariate by performing univariate Random Forest (RF), 
using  the  full  camera  traps  dataset  and  the  presence-absence  data  as 
response  variable.  For  each  covariate,  we  selected  the  scale  whose 

univariate RF showed the lowest Out-Of-Bag (OOB) error. 

2.4.1. Random forest – model training 

Similar to the GLM approaches, for RF we used two different training 
data selection frameworks. For the first one (hereafter non-bootstrapped 
RF), we trained the RF by using the same training dataset used for the 
non-bootstrapped GLM, composed of randomly selected 80% of camera 
trap locations, and produced species distribution probability surfaces for 
each felid.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information about a deep learning model or its purpose. However, based on the given context, the study focuses on using machine learning techniques, specifically Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms, for species distribution modeling. These methods are applied to analyze camera trap data on several felid species.

Two main approaches were employed in this research: non-bootstrapped RF and bootstrapped RF. In both cases, the goal was to produce species distribution probability surfaces for each felid species. The difference between these approaches lies in how they handle the training data.

In the non-bootstrapped RF method, the researchers used the same training dataset as the non-bootstrapped GLM, consisting of 80% of the camera trap locations. This allowed them to generate species distribution probability surfaces for each felid species.

On the other hand, the bootstrapped RF approach involved subsampling the entire camera trap dataset by randomly selecting 20% of the presence and absence locations. They then trained the RF with the subsampled dataset and created the species distribution probability surface. This process was repeated 100 times, each time replacing the data used to train the models, resulting in 100 different probability surfaces. Finally, the researchers obtained the final species distribution probability surfaces by averaging the 100 probability surfaces independently for each felid species.

Therefore, while the text does not explicitly mention a deep learning model, it discusses the use of machine learning techniques for species distribution modeling, focusing on GLMs and RF algorithms.
