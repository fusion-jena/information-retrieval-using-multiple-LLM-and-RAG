2.1. Operational workflow 

The whole process of data acquisition and processing, reported in the 
following  section,  is  called  Knowledge  Discovery  in  Databases  (KDD) 
(Kotu and Deshpande, 2015); it is a process of identifying patterns or 
relationships  within  a  dataset  useful  to  make  important  decisions 
(Hammad and AbouRizk, 2014). This process does not involve applying 
data-mining  techniques  but  requires  more  actions  to  reach  the  final 
result. 

The KDD sequence applied in our case study included the following 

steps:  

• identification of the aim for a specific study area;  
• pre-selection of useful data to achieve the objective;  
• analytical determinations for the detection of PPPs in Puglia surface 

water bodies;  

• optimisation and elaboration of the obtained results through:

In short, data mining ensures that starting from “cryptic” information 
scattered without apparent order in a database, we arrive at knowledge 
that can be exploited for various purposes (Kotu and Deshpande, 2015). 
It is also possible to implement (Online document, 2022b) an automatic 
elaboration  workflow  with  open-source  software  without  using  an 
operator who reprocesses the data each time. Data mining can be sup-
ported  by well-known  and  widely applied  data  processing techniques 
such as verifying or interpreting results (Hamdi et al., 2022).

Different data processing techniques were integrated, relying on an 
operational  workflow based  on the KDD  paradigm to obtain as much 
helpful information as possible from big spatiotemporal data to report to 
regional decision-makers in the agricultural and environmental sectors. 
Following the discussion of the obtained results, we can affirm that 
cultivation in northern Puglia is very intensive and critically impacts the 
aquatic environment of regional rivers. In the central and southern areas 
of Puglia, whose geology is characterised by permeable rocks that do not 
allow the presence of extensive rivers, it is necessary to extend analytical 
activities to monitor the residues of plant protection products on the soil 
matrix, especially in the presence of permanently irrigated crops.

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, there isn't explicit mention of the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, some clues can be derived from the text. For instance, the operational workflow mentioned includes steps such as 'identification of the aim for a specific study area,' which suggests that the collection of raw data might have been guided by a particular research focus or goal. Additionally, the phrase 'analytical determinations for the detection of PPPs in Puglia surface water bodies' implies that some form of sampling or measurement was conducted to gather this data. Furthermore, the reference to 'big spatiotemporal data' could suggest the use of sensor networks or other forms of automated data collection over time and across different locations. Nevertheless, without further clarification, it cannot be definitively stated what exact methods were employed for gathering raw data in this context.
