Machine-learning models have been democratized in environmental 
science  over  the  past  few  years.  Several  ML-based  models  can  be 
grouped  based  on  their  architecture.  The  topic  of  neural  networks  is 
addressed in the following section. In this section, we focus on a model 
based on a tree structure. The RF model, which is based on tree struc-
ture, has been frequently used for ENSO (Gibson et al., 2021; Pal et al., 
2020). We compared its performance in forecasting ENSO with that of 
the  Lasso  model. The RF  models are  often  associated  with “ensemble 
learning,”  which is derived from the aggregation of tree structures or 
trees created during the learning phase RF models. Notably, the number 
of trees was defined downstream, and all our models were composed of 
200 trees.

Our  findings  also  revealed  a  significant  reduction  in  computation 
time when ML models, along with preselection, were used. Unlike ex-
pected, pre-selection lowered the accuracy of the results, which likely 
indicates  a  loss  of  information  in  the  database  transformed  using  the 
signature method. As we expected that the Lasso model, in the absence 
of the signature method, would not provide convincing results; there-
fore, we only retained this analysis to maintain consistency in compar-
ison with the ML models. Though it is possible to extract PDPs from RF 
runs  coupled  with  the  signature  method,  their  interpretation  is  not 
possible because of this transformation. The amount of input data, or in 
our case, the size of the time series used during the learning phase of an 
ML  model,  can  have  a  non-negligible  influence  on  predictive  perfor-
mance (Bustillo et al., 2022; Derot et al., 2020b). In other words, a long

To  construct  the  LSTM  model,  we  used  KERAS  (version  2.9.0),  a 
Python  package,  and  scaled  the  data  using  “MinMaxScaler()”  in  the 
Python Scikit-Learn package to improve model performance. In partic-
ular, “MinMaxScaler()” usually scales the attributes to a specific range 
[0,1]; therefore, the smallest value was converted to 0 and the largest 
value was 1; thus, all attributes ranged between 0 and 1, which is useful 
for regression analysis. The LSTM models were built with one layer of 65

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, some common practices to ensure the generalizability of machine learning models include using diverse datasets, cross-validation, and stratified splitting. These techniques help prevent overfitting and increase the robustness of the model by ensuring that it performs well on unseen data. It is important to note that the authors did compare the performance of different models, including the Random Forest (RF) model and the Lasso model, in forecasting ENSO. They also mentioned that the number of trees in the RF models was defined downstream, and all their models were composed of 200 trees. This suggests that they may have implemented some form of parameter tuning or cross-validation to optimize the performance of their models. However, without more explicit details about the specific steps taken to ensure generalizability, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer.
