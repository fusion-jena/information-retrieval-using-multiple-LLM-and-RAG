Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

5.2. Result analysis 

The datasets are divided into training set and test set according to the 
ratio of 8:2. And the number of test samples and training samples are 
3094 and 12,340, respectively. The classification models are built with 
the training set, and accuracy on test set is used as indicator to evaluate 
performance of classification models. 

5.2.1. Classic CNN model 

The three features of F1, F2 and F3 are input into CNN model, and 

their classification performance on the test set is shown in Table 6.

5.2.3. Proposed models

features,  and  combines  these  features  to  build  classification  models 
with strong generalization performance to enrich the representational 
capacity of single feature and improve the accuracy of bird classifica-
tion.  The  proposed  method  and  performance  evaluation  will  be  dis-
cussed in the following sections.

shown in the Fig. 6. 

The network is designed with four convolution kernel pooling layers 
to extract deep features. After the convolution pooling, the data enters 
the fully connected layer for connection. The network adds a dropout 
layer  to  the  fully  connected  layer  to  reduce  network  parameters.  A 
Dense_1 layer is added after flatten to reduce the dimension of the deep 
features, and sets the parameter to 500, which is the parameter of the 
deep feature dimension extracted from different views. 

4.2. Feature selection

In recent years, deep learning has an excellent performance and is 
also widely used in computer vision, speech recognition and other fields. 
Xie et al. used Chirplet transform, STFT and Mel cepstrum transform to 
obtain the spectrogram, and combined with the bird species recognition 
method of deep learning, classified and recognized 18 species of birds 
(Xie et al., 2018). Since 2015, many research teams have exploited deep 
learning to classify birdsong in the LifeCLEF bird recognition challenge. 
For example, Piczak used deep learning to identify South American birds 
in the BirdCLEF 2016 competition (Piczak, 2016). T´oth et al. used CNN 
for feature learning in the same competition, and achieved good results 
(T´oth  and  Czeba,  2016).  Based  on  Xception,  extracted  logmel  or  log-
linear  spectra  as  features  in  BirdCLEF  2020,  Bai  et  al.  used  data 
enhancement technology to improve the detection performance of bird

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it appears that the dataset was split into a training set and a test set using an 8:2 ratio. The training set consisted of 12,340 samples, while the test set had 3094 samples. Classification models were then constructed using the training set, and their performance was evaluated based on their accuracy on the test set. However, there is no explicit mention of any specific strategies employed to monitor the model performance during training. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the monitoring strategy used during the training process.
