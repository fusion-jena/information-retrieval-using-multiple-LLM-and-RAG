outliers and removed from the dataset for subsequent analyses.

Collecting  data  on  rare  species  that  occur  over  large  areas  can  be 
logistically difficult and expensive, especially at a population scale. In 
such  circumstances  biologists  often  rely  on  non-invasive  sampling 
techniques  such  as  camera  traps,  acoustic  recorders,  non-invasive  ge-
netic  sampling  (scat,  hair,  urine,  feathers)  or  track  collection.  While 
these  methods  provide  a  cost-effective  option  for  species  detection, 
identifying sex can be challenging. For example, determining sex using 
non-invasive genetic samples can be cost-prohibitive, require access to a 
laboratory  for  analysis,  or  be  limited  by  DNA  quantity  and  quality. 
Methods  to  identify  individual  or  sex  from  camera  trap  images  have 
been developed for some species with unique pelage patterns (Rowland

Helpful Answer:
The text provides insight into the use of non-invasive survey methods for collecting data on rare species occurring across large areas. These methods include FIT, camera traps, acoustic recorders, non-invasive genetic sampling (scat, hair, urine, feathers), and track collection. The authors emphasize the importance of expanding non-invasive survey data beyond just species presence/absence to sex identification, which is crucial for conservation efforts. They also mention the challenges associated with identifying sex using non-invasive genetic samples due to factors like cost, laboratory access, and DNA quantity and quality. However, they do not explicitly discuss the application of these methods within a deep learning pipeline. Nonetheless, it can be inferred that these non-invasive survey methods could serve as sources of raw data for deep learning models aimed at species and sex discrimination, among other tasks related to wildlife conservation.
