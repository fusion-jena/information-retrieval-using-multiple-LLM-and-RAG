study and larger datasets do not necessarily produce more precise
models as the use of too much data can lead to model overtraining and
precision loss (Sj¨oberg and Ljung, 1995). Additionally, water quality
datasets are composed of a large number of parameters that often
represent redundant information (Haghiabi et al., 2018; Muharemi
et al., 2019). Despite these known issues, detailed analysis of historical
variation in a dataset is rarely employed for selecting training data
subsets prior to developing predictive models. It is anticipated that their
implementation may improve the training step and, therefore, lead to
improved predictive outputs. For these reasons, analyzing historical
trends in water quality is necessary to find the most variable and
representative scenarios useful for machine learning model training.

Network algorithms, obtaining significantly higher prediction accuracy
compared to SVM and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural net-
works (Chen et al., 2023). Other approaches include a previous data
transformation to optimize the response of the predictive algorithm
applied. For example, variational mode decomposition was applied to
decompose water quality data into a series of relatively stable compo-
nents used to train a LSTM neural network (Wang et al., 2023). This
approach produced higher prediction accuracy compared to a single
LSTM and Recurrent Neural Network.

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not directly mention specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the issue of overfitting in general and its impact on model precision.

Overfitting occurs when a model learns the detail and noise in the training data to the extent that it negatively impacts the performance of the model on new data. This means that the noise or random fluctuations in the training data is picked up and learned as concepts by the model. The problem is that these concepts do not apply to new data and negatively impact the model’s ability to generalize from the training data to unseen data.

In the context of deep learning pipelines, there are several regularization methods used to prevent overfitting. Dropout is one such method where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to make the model more robust and prevents overfitting. Another common method is L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, which adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the sum of the squares of all the weights in the network. This encourages smaller weights, leading to simpler models that generalize better.

Other techniques mentioned in the context include using a subset of the available data for training, rather than the entire dataset, to avoid overtraining and precision loss. Data transformation methods, such as variational mode decomposition, have also been used to decompose water quality data into stable components for training a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network, resulting in improved prediction accuracy.
