validation error, thereby enhancing model precision.  

• The  selection  of  the  distance  metric,  typically  Euclidean,  was 
predicated on the data’s characteristics and the specific analytical 
prerequisites.  

was dictated by the explained variance ratio, to ensure the distilled 
dataset retained the majority of the original data’s variance.  
• The  SVM  model  was  thereafter  trained  on  this  dimensionally 
reduced  dataset,  with  hyperparameters  refined  as  delineated 
above.

• The  regularization  parameter  (‘C’)  and  the  kernel  type  (linear) 
were  calibrated  through  a  synergistic  application  of  grid  search 
and  cross-validation,  aiming  to  mediate  the  balance  between 
model complexity and its generalization prowess.

In animal behavior studies, the integration of Machine Learning (ML) 
and  Deep  Learning  (DL)  methodologies  represents  a  significant  para-
digm  shift.  Traditionally,  these  advanced  computational  techniques, 
renowned for their predictive accuracy in fields such as artificial intel-
ligence  (Marar,  2024),  image  processing  (Zhang  et  al.,  2015),  neuro-
science (Dixon and Polson, 2020), and genomics (Xiao and Segal, 2009), 
have not been extensively harnessed for modeling or predicting animal 
movement. Such approaches extend the application of these technolo-
gies beyond their conventional domains and aim to transcend the mere 
prediction  of  behavior.  The  objective  is  to  craft  a  methodology  that 
utilizes machine learning to forecast behavioral patterns and intricately 
map animals’ actual movement trajectories.
