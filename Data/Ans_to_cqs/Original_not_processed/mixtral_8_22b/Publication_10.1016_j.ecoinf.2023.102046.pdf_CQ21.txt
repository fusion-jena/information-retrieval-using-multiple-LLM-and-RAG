training.  The  classification  accuracy  of  the  CLIP  regression  model 
rapidly  increased  until  the  training  dataset  size  reached  200  images. 
When  the training dataset size increased  further, the  accuracy slowly 
increased.  When  the  training  dataset  size  reached  650  images,  it 
appeared that the model was still learning as the classification accuracy 
was still increasing. When fine-tuning the ViT model the classification 
accuracy rapidly increased until the size of the training dataset reached 
300 images. With increased training dataset size after 300, the accuracy 
did not grow as rapidly as before. Using 100 training samples the CLIP 
regression  model  surpassed  the  Inception  models  trained  on  a  full 
training set. Figs. D.1–D.3, in Appendix D, show the learning curves for

Recent progress in few-shot learning has been based on transformers. 
These  models were first  applied  successfully  in  natural language  pro-
cessing (NLP), and are used in popular language models such as Bidi-
rectional  Encoder  Representations  from  Transformers  (BERT,  Devlin 
et al., 2019). They have also been implemented in vision models, such as 
the Vision Transformer (ViT) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2023). The transformer 
architecture,  introduced  by  Vaswani  et  al.,  2017,  uses  an  attention 
mechanism  such  that  the  model  can  learn  what  parts  of  the  input  it 
should attend to. This allows it to outperform state-of-the-art models in 
NLP  tasks  without  using  recurrence  in  the  model  architecture.  Doso-
vitskiy et al., 2023 showed that convolutions are not necessary for state- 
of-the-art  performance  in  image  classification  tasks,  and  that  trans-
formers can perform well on these tasks when applied to image patches.

3.3. Comparison with other models 

Fig. 10 shows the plaice test set accuracy for the CLIP models and the 
fine-tuned  models.  The  CLIP  regression  model  performs  the  best 
achieving 55.9% accuracy with RMSE of 0.70 years, and 97.05% accu-
racy when allowing a ±1 year margin of error like presented in Table 4. 
The Inception models reached a considerably lower accuracy than 
the other models, and we found it overfitting the training data consid-
erably  faster  compared  to  ResNet  and  ViT.  Overall  the  CLIP  models 
performed considerably better than the fine-tuned models. Comparing 
the CLIP regression model to the ViT fine-tuning we see a 5.6% increase 
in accuracy and a 0.19 decrease in the RMSE value.

Helpful Answer:
After the model training process, several postprocessing steps may be involved depending on the specific requirements of the task or project. Here are some common postprocessing steps:

1. Model Evaluation: After training, evaluating the model is crucial to understand its performance. Common evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC AUC, etc. These metrics help determine how well the model generalizes to unseen data.

2. Hyperparameter Tuning: Based on the initial evaluation results, hyperparameters might need adjustment to improve the model's performance. Techniques like Grid Search, Random Search, Bayesian Optimization, etc., can be employed for this purpose.

3. Visualizing Results: To gain insights into the model's predictions, visualizations like confusion matrices, ROC curves, Precision-Recall curves, etc., can be created. These visualizations provide a clear understanding of the model's strengths and weaknesses.

4. Saliency Maps: For deep learning models, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), saliency maps can be generated to highlight important features contributing to the final prediction. This helps interpret the model's decision-making process.

5. Ensemble Methods: Combining multiple models to create an ensemble can often lead to improved performance. Postprocessing steps might involve creating ensembles through techniques like bagging, boosting, stacking, etc.

In summary, postprocessing steps after model training typically involve model evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, visualizing results, generating saliency maps, and potentially employing ensemble methods. However, the exact steps depend on the specific use case and objectives.
