In the proposed study, an attempt is made to use convolution features 
to extract high-level visual information from RGB plant images by using 
a ResNet18 architecture (Gao et al., 2021). The procedure begins with 
the input image being subjected to a sequence of operations and length 
in both the X and Y axes. After that, there is a max-pooling layer with a 
kernel size of 3 × 3, a stride length of 2, zero padding of (1), a batch 
normalization layer, and ReLU activation. In addition, we set up specific 
training settings to maximize the model’s efficiency which include 64 
batches, momentum  of 0.95,  learning rate of 0.012,  Adam optimizer, 
weight  decay  of  0.01,  and  epsilon  of  ε  = 0.000001.  In  the  proposed 
study, the training settings of the hyperparameters represent the entire 
training setup and are not specific to the residual blocks. After that, we 
perform  downsampling  by  incorporating  four  residual  blocks,  each

leaf-based  plant  species  classification.  However,  medicinal  plants  are 
not the primary focus of this work, and also considered high-resolution 
images for classification tasks. In a recent study (Chulif et al., 2023), 
deep  learning  models  are  used  for  detecting  diseases  in  single  crop 
species by considering real-time field challenges during image acquisi-
tion.  In  a  different  work  (Barhate  et  al.,  2023),  VGG-16  and  dimen-
sionality reduction with ESPCA is adapted to classify thirty-two plant 
species  with  hyperparameter  tuned  and  batch  updated  stochastic 
gradient descent technique. Later, (Ganguly et al., 2022), utilized the 
ResNet-50  architecture  to  capture  the  leaf  feature  patterns  via  fusion 
learning  and  is  trained  on  three  benchmark  datasets  to  showcase  the 
effectiveness of the model. The aforementioned studies do not directly 
focus  on  the  classification  of  a  large  group  of  Indian  medicinal  plant

Helpful Answer:
The papers mentioned in the given context do not explicitly state the specific datasets used in their respective deep learning pipelines. However, some general insights about the data used can be derived from the descriptions. For instance, Gao et al. (2021) worked with RGB plant images, while Barhate et al. (2023) focused on classifying thirty-two plant species. Additionally, Chulif et al. (2023) dealt with detecting diseases in single crop species, and Ganguly et al. (2022) employed the ResNet-50 architecture to capture leaf feature patterns via fusion learning, utilizing three unnamed benchmark datasets. Unfortunately, without explicit mention of the datasets used, it cannot be confirmed if popular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet were part of these research works.
