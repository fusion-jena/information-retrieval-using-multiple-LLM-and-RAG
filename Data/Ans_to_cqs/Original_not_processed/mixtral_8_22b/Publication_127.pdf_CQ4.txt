A landmark architecture for deep learning winning ILSVRC
2012 challenge (31).
Network in Network (NiN) is one of the ﬁrst architectures
harnessing innovative 1 × 1 convolutions (49) to provide
more combinational power to the features of a convolutional
layers (49).
An architecture that is deeper (i.e., has more layers of
neurons) and obtains better performance than AlexNet
by using effective 3 × 3 convolutional ﬁlters (26).
This architecture is designed to be computationally efﬁcient
(using 12 times fewer parameters than AlexNet) while offering
high accuracy (50).
The winning architecture of the 2016 ImageNet competition
(25). The number of layers for the ResNet architecture can be
different. In this work, we try 18, 34, 50, 101, and 152 layers.

25% (757,000) nonempty images and randomly selected 757,000
empty images. This dataset was then split into training and
test sets.

Deep Learning. Deep learning (17) allows computers to automat-
ically extract multiple levels of abstraction from raw data (Fig.
3). Inspired by the mammalian visual cortex (18), deep convolu-
tional neural networks (deep CNNs) are a class of feedforward
DNNs (17) in which each layer of neurons (to be “deep,” three
or more layers) uses convolutional operations to extract informa-
tion from overlapping small regions coming from the previous
layers (13). For classiﬁcation, the ﬁnal layer of a DNN is usu-
ally a softmax function, with an output between 0 and 1 per class
and with all of the class outputs summing to 1. These outputs
are often interpreted as the DNN’s estimated probability of the
image belonging in a certain class, and higher probabilities are
often interpreted as the DNN being more conﬁdent that the
image is of that class (19). DNNs have dramatically improved
the state of the art in many challenging problems (13), including

Helpful Answer:
Data augmentation techniques are used in the deep learning pipeline to increase the amount of training data available for creating models, thereby improving model robustness and generalization capabilities. Some common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, zooming, shearing, and color space transformations.

Flipping involves horizontally or vertically reversing an image, effectively doubling the size of the dataset without adding any new information. Rotation involves rotating an image by a specified angle, allowing the network to learn features invariant to orientation changes. Scaling adjusts the size of an image, enabling the network to recognize objects regardless of distance or scale. Cropping removes parts of an image, forcing the network to focus on important features within the remaining area. Zooming magnifies portions of an image, helping the network identify fine details. Shearing distorts an image along a particular axis, simulating perspective changes. Color space transformations alter the colors of an image, such as converting it to grayscale or applying filters, encouraging the network to rely on shape rather than color when making predictions.

These data augmentation techniques can be applied individually or combined to create even more diverse datasets. However, care must be taken not to introduce unrealistic variations that could negatively impact model performance. Ultimately, the choice of data augmentation techniques depends on the specific problem domain and desired outcomes.
