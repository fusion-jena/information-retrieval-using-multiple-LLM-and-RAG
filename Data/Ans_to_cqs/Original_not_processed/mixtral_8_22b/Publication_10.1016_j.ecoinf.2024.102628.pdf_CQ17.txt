2.5.1. Classification problem (Q1): Deep learning applied to 2D LiDAR 
images for Forest classification 

We  employed  the  fast.ai  platform  (Howard  and  Gugger,  2020)  to 
train and validate models for the classification of 2D point cloud images, 
utilizing  a  LOGO  (Leave-One-Group-Out)  cross-validation.  In  this 
approach, our target classes were "Plateau", "White-sand", and "Ripar-
ian",  designated  as  "p",  "w",  and  "r"  respectively.  In  each  iteration,  a 
complete 450 m multitemporal transect was omitted from the training 
process  (the  grouping  factor  giving  the  lack  of  independence  in  the 
multi-temporal data) and subsequently tested. This approach ensured an 
assessment  of  the  model’s  performance,  accounting  for  our  data  con-
straints and guaranteeing that every multitemporal transect undergoes

both training and testing. A critical point to highlight is that models are 
retrained  for  each  fold,  preventing  previous  fold’s  information  from 
being transferred. We utilized the pretrained ResNet-34 (Which consists 
of  a  34-layer  convolutional  neural  network)  architecture  which  is  a 
variant of the ResNet (Residual Network) family, widely used for deep 
learning tasks, particularly in computer vision (He et al., 2016). ResNet- 
34 was used inside the fast.ai framework (Howard and Gugger, 2020) to 
leverage  existing  knowledge,  this  is  particularly  useful  in  our  dataset 
since its small size. Transfer learning generally consists in using a model 
pre-trained  on  broad  datasets,  like  ImageNet  (Deng  et  al.,  2009),  to 
specialized tasks with more limited data. As part of the cross-validation 
of the Leave-One-Group-Out approach, the test directory containing the 
multitemporal transect was temporarily moved to test, and DataLoaders

The Convolutional Autoencoder and its variations extracts the most 
critical features and minimizes noise within the training data (Kingma 
and Welling, 2019, Zhao et al., 2019, Bank et al., 2023). This process 
results  in  a  compact  and  informative  feature  matrix,  which  is  subse-
quently fed into the PLSR or any regression model. PLSR is particularly 
suitable  for  datasets  that have  undergone  Convolutional Autoencoder 
processing,  where  the  output  is  a  flattened  vector  representing  each 
image, and each vector element is a variable in a tabular form. PLSR 
excels in these scenarios with numerous correlated variables (Carrascal 
et al., 2009). In our case the final matrix is transformed into a vector that 
represents each image with a vector with over 8000 values, each one 
representing one variable as a tabular form. The image dataset is orga-
nized into 18 folders, one for each of the 450 m transects (150 m *3). The

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization being used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that some form of regularization might have been implemented due to the use of transfer learning and the pretrained ResNet-34 architecture.

Transfer learning involves utilizing a pretrained model on a large dataset and fine-tuning it on a smaller, specialized dataset. By leveraging the learned features from the larger dataset, the risk of overfitting on the smaller dataset is reduced. Additionally, the ResNet-34 architecture itself has built-in mechanisms to mitigate overfitting, such as skip connections and batch normalization. These techniques help improve the generalization capabilities of the model by reducing the vanishing gradient problem and promoting faster convergence during training.

While not explicitly mentioned, other common regularization techniques could also have been employed, such as early stopping, weight decay (L2 regularization), or even dropout. Early stopping involves monitoring the validation loss during training and halting the process once the validation loss starts increasing, indicating potential overfitting. Weight decay adds a penalty term to the loss function, encouraging smaller weights and thus simpler models. Dropout randomly sets a fraction of input or hidden units to zero during training, effectively creating an ensemble of multiple thinned networks and improving overall robustness.

In summary, while the context does not provide direct evidence of specific regularization methods being used, it is likely that some combination of transfer learning, architectural design choices, and potentially additional regularization techniques were employed to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
