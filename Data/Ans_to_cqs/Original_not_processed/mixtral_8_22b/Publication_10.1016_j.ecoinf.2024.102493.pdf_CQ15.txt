time variable, and kNDVIj represents the maximum kNDVI value in the 
jth  year.  A  positive  slope  denotes  a  vegetation  improvement  trend 
(kNDVI greening), while a negative slope indicates a degradation trend 
in  vegetation  (kNDVI  browning).  The  significance  of  the  trends  was 
evaluated using the F test. Following the criteria outlined in Table 3 and 
derived from prior studies(Lai et al., 2023; Ren et al., 2023b), the kNDVI 
trends were categorized into four types.

The subsequent statistical analysis of the OPGD data was conducted 
using  the  “GD”  package  in  RStudio  4.2.2  (https://CRAN.R-project.or 
g/package=GD).  The  “optidisc”  function  of  the  “GD”  package  was 
used to select the optimal parameters for discretizing continuous data. 
The analysis revealed that as the grid scale increases, the 90% quantile 
of the Q-values for each driver reaches its maximum at the 2 km * 2 km 
grid scale, followed by a decreasing trend. Therefore, the optimal spatial 
scale for OPGD was determined to be 2 km * 2 km (Fig. 3a). 

We further calculated the Q values for the continuous data sample 
points  collected  at  the  2  km*2  km  scale  (Fig.  3b)  and  compared  the

(i)  Optimal scale and discretization parameters 

As OPGD requires continuous data to be discretized before further 
analysis,  choosing  appropriate  discretization  parameters  (i.e.,  the 
number and method of discretization breakpoints) is crucial for accurate 
identification  of  driver  explanatory  power.  The  discretization  process 
involved  five  methods:  standard  deviation  (SD),  natural  breaks  (NB), 
equal  interval  (EI),  quantile  (QU),  and  geometric  interval  (GI)(Song 
et al., 2020). Following previous studies (Li et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 
2023), we considered that too many or too few breakpoints would result 
in  information  redundancy  (insufficiency).  Therefore,  the  number  of 
breakpoints was configured to range from 4 to 13 in this study.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no direct mention of any specific optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) being applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that some form of optimization technique might have been employed during the machine learning processes mentioned in the text. For instance, when discussing the use of the "GD" package in RStudio 4.2.2, it could imply the usage of gradient descent algorithms, which are commonly used optimization techniques in machine learning models. Additionally, the reference to selecting optimal parameters for discretizing continuous data suggests the application of hyperparameter tuning, another common optimization technique in machine learning pipelines. Nevertheless, without explicit details about the specific optimization techniques used, one cannot definitively state whether SGD, Adam, or other optimization techniques were utilized in the deep learning pipeline.
