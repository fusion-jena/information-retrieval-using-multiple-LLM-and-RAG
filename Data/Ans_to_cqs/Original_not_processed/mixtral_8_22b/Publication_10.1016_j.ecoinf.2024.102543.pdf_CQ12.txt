We  also  consider  Params  and  FLOPs  to  evaluate  the  model.  The 
“Params”  metric  in  a  neural  network  model  refers  to  the  number  of 
learned variables used for making predictions. It is an essential metric 
for  evaluating  the  model's  complexity  and  computational  efficiency. 
Models  with  more  parameters  generally  require  more  resources  for

It is worth noting, however, that increasing the network depth also 
comes with some potential downsides, such as increased computational 
complexity and a greater risk of overfitting the model to the training 
data. So, adding the P2 layer to the YOLOv8 architecture is a tradeoff 
that needs to be carefully balanced with other considerations, such as 
model size and performance requirements. In this sense, we proposed in 
this work a modification in the C2f layer due to its importance in the 
general architecture of YOLOv8, in the sense of making it lighter and 
counterbalancing  the  increase  obtained  with  the  addition  of  the  P2 
feature level layer. In our work, we call this new layer C2f2.

On the positive side, a smaller model might generalize better on data 
from previously unseen domains or categories, with a reduced capacity 
to  memorize  training  data;  the  model  may  focus  on  learning  more 
generic  features  that  can  be  useful  across  different  datasets  (Seema-
kurthy et al., 2022). As we will see later, this is a goal we seek in our 
model. 

A reduction in the number of filters can lead to faster inference times. 
Using  smartphone  applications,  the  model  may  process  images  more 
quickly, making it suitable for real-time applications or scenarios that 
demand rapid detection, such as NBSB detection and counting (Diwan 
et al., 2023). However, care must be taken, as if the number of filters is 
decreased,  the  model  might  become  more  prone  to  overfitting  the

The  YOLOv8  algorithm  offers  a  range  of  network  structures, 
including  YOLOv8n,  YOLOv8s,  YOLOv8m,  YOLOv8l,  and  YOLOv8x. 
While they differ in width and depth, they follow the same principles 
and can be chosen according to specific needs. The deeper the structure, 
the higher the precision, but the slower the training and inference speed. 
YOLOv8n was chosen as the base structure to prioritize speed without 
compromising  accuracy,  with  further  enhancements  to  improve 
performance. 

Adding the P2 feature level to the YOLOv8 architecture makes the 
network  deeper  because  an  additional  layer  is  added  to  the  overall 
network structure. The YOLOv8 architecture already includes a series of 
convolutional  layers  and  a  neck  section  that  combines  features  from

Helpful Answer:

The pipeline uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically the YOLOv8 algorithm. This algorithm is known for object detection tasks and provides various network structures like YOLOv8n, YOLOv8s, YOLOv8m, YOLOv8l, and YOLOv8x. These structures differ in width and depth but share the same principles. For instance, YOLOv8n was selected as the base structure to emphasize speed without compromising accuracy. Furthermore, modifications were made to the C2f layer, which plays a significant role in the overall architecture of YOLOv8. This modified layer is referred to as C2f2.
