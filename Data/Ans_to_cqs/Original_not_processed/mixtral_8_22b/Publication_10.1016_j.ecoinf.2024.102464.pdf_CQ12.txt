In  our  study,  we  utilized  data  from  the  third  and  fourth  natural 
environment surveys, incorporating various environmental variables, to 
assess  the  impact  of  urban  development  on  species  distribution.  To 
achieve  this,  we  employed  seven  different  machine  learning  models, 
extracting the Area Under the Curve (AUC) values for each model both 
before and after urban development (Fig. 3). The AUC value, a critical 
measure of model performance, indicated that the Generalized Linear 
Model  (GLM)  and  Random  Forest  (RF)  models  had  the  highest  AUC 
value  of  0.85,  while  the  Classification  and  Regression  Tree  (CART) 
model  had  the  lowest  at  0.79.  On  average,  the  models  demonstrated 
robust performance with an average AUC value of 0.84, underscoring 
their overall effectiveness in species distribution modeling. Despite the 
methodological similarities among the models, their distinct character-

the species distribution model results were land cover, vegetation (forest 
type, age class, diameter, and density), terrain (Dem, Aspect, Hill Shade, 
Slope,  and  TWI),  and  distance  (distance  to  water,  distance  to  forests, 
distance to agricultural land, distance to grassland, distance to roads, 
and distance to urban areas) (Kwon, 2014; Song and Kim, 2012). We 
conducted a correlation analysis of the variables before model imple-
mentation  to  enhance  the  predictive  performance  of  the  model  and 
mitigate the risk of overfitting.

Second,  a  species  distribution  model  was  constructed  using  seven 
machine-learning  techniques.  This  model  leveraged  environmental 
variables  and  species  data  to  generate  model  input  variables  and  a 
landscape matrix for landscape connectivity. An ensemble model was 
employed to minimize the uncertainty in species occurrence, which is 
essential for implementing the IFM-LCONS. Third, we extracted map-
ping results and AUC values from the ensemble model. The results of the 
species distribution models were then used as input data for the IFM- 
LCONS, considering any grid with a value above the threshold of 0.74 
as  an  input  variable  (number  of  species  observations).  Fourth,  we 
calculated the least-cost distance using the habitat suitability map for 
landscape connectivity analysis. Finally, the IFM-LCONS was developed,

a  landscape.  A  minimum  of  10  occupied  patches  in  the  study  area  is 
required to achieve accurate parameterization (Hanski et al., 2000). The 
method proposed in this study can overcome the limitations of the IFM 
model  because  it  analyzes  the  species  distribution  model  results, 
focusing on species that are comparatively more difficult to monitor.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information about the use of deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers in the pipeline. Instead, it mentions the use of several machine learning models like Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Random Forest (RF), and Classification and Regression Tree (CART) for species distribution modeling. These models do not fall under the category of deep learning models. Therefore, based on the given context, no specific deep learning model has been mentioned as being part of the pipeline.
