in a few seconds in the cloud computing system, saving all
required hardware resources.

training and testing steps, respectively. The training hyperpa-
rameters of Faster R-CNN are carefully chosen to achieve
accurate identiﬁcation of pests using Stochastic Gradient Des-
cent (SGD) optimizer with the momentum value of 0.9. The
initial value of learning rate is set to 0.001 and decreases to
0.0004 after 40 K steps.

Helpful Answer:
The deep learning model used in this study is Faster R-CNN. The training hyperparameters of Faster R-CNN are carefully chosen to achieve accurate identification of pests. The Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer is used with a momentum value of 0.9. The initial value of the learning rate is set to 0.001 and decreases to 0.0004 after 40K steps.
