Hyperparameters  are  instrumental  in  shaping  the  architecture  of 
deep  learning  models and  steering  the  learning  process  (Bischl et  al., 
2023).  The  TPEBO  algorithm  stands  out  for  its  strategic  approach  to 
hyperparameter optimization. Beginning with an exploratory phase of 
random  searches  for  feasible  hyperparameter  configurations,  TPEBO 
progressively narrows down its focus to zones within the search space 
where a local optimum is identified, thereby approximating the global 
optimum  with  increasing  precision.  This  methodological  approach  is 
particularly  beneficial  for  fine-tuning  LSTM  models,  known  for  their 
intricate  structures.  By  automating  the  hyperparameter  adjustment 
process,  TPEBO  not  only  enhances  the  model's  efficiency  but  also 
significantly  curtails  the  time  traditionally  spent  on  manual  tuning, 
making the modeling workflow more efficient. The process is succinctly

xi  is the input independent variable value,

yi  is the actual value, 
λ is the L2 regularization parameter (λ > 0), 
wj  is the weight of each layer in the LSTM neural network,  

(3)  Optimizing iteration and result optimization. 

The  input  dataset,  hyperparameter  search  range,  optimization 
objective  function,  and  algorithm  predefined  are  integrated  into  the 
TPEBO-LSTM  model.  The  model  undergoes  a  training  process 
comprising 10,000 iterations. During each iteration, the model logs the 
chosen  hyperparameter  combinations,  associated  training  times,  and 

loss  values.  This  systematic  recording  aims  to  pinpoint  the  hyper-
parameter sets that deliver optimal performance upon completion of the 
calculations.

The hyperparameter optimization process for LSTM neural networks 
is conceptualized as a black-box function where diverse hyperparameter 
combinations are the inputs and the optimization targets are the outputs 
aimed at minimizing the objective metric. This black-box approach fa-
cilitates the establishment of a direct link between hyperparameter sets 
and the network's optimization goals.

specifying  the  bounds  within  which  the  algorithm  will  explore 
various hyperparameter values. Key hyperparameters include: 

Number  of  hidden  layers:  This  hyperparameter  is  crucial  for  the 
network's performance, helps the model capture complex patterns. The 
range for the number of hidden layers is set between 1 and 3, based on 
initial tests.

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, it can be assumed that common practices were followed such as splitting the data into training, testing, and validation datasets. Typically, this division is done randomly or using stratified sampling techniques to maintain class balance if dealing with classification problems. In some cases, temporal or spatial partitioning might be applied depending on the nature of the problem. For instance, when working with time series data, one could use a sliding window technique to create overlapping segments for training and testing purposes. Nevertheless, without specific details from the context, these assumptions remain speculative.
