classification is described as:

/

[l3 ∈ l1]*1

c

(12)

Where l1l3a is the average of all l3 capture values in l1 classes, l1s is
the l1 class number (1(cid:0) 32), c is the number of captured l1 classes by l3
classification. The lower-level classification (l3) is represented as an
element (∈) of the higher-level classification (l1). Next, all l1 classes
were sorted according to MI & LI, placed in l2 bins, and all l1l3a values
were averaged again within each l2 bin (Eq. 13). The bins represent the
l2 classes (n = 6) in MI and LI areas and are l2-oriented so that results can
be applied to landscape ecology. The l1 classes not skewed to either MI
or LI areas are included for both MI and LI bins as LTA (cid:0) LU0. Sorting
and averaging is represented as:

Where U is the union of l1 and l2 classification, such that the higher-
level classification (l1) with more classes (n = 32) is represented as el-
ements (∈) of the lower-level classification (l2) with fewer classes (n =
6), the nested classification between l1 & l2 is the reclassification of the
thematic spectral classes of l1 into the information classes of l2. Based on

a simple linear regression, the l1 / l2 crosstabulation results proved
insufficient to distinguish between MI and LI LTA-LU shrub community
configurations.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit details about the postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, based on general machine learning practices, some common postprocessing steps include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, and creating confusion matrices.

Saliency maps help visualize which parts of the input data were most important for the model's predictions. This can be useful for understanding how the model makes decisions and identifying potential biases or errors.

Calculating metrics involves evaluating the performance of the model using various measures such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc. These metrics help quantify the effectiveness of the model and compare it against other models or baselines.

Creating a confusion matrix provides a summary of the model's predictions versus actual labels. It shows the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives, allowing us to calculate additional metrics like sensitivity, specificity, and ROC curves.

In the given context, there is no mention of these specific postprocessing steps. Instead, the focus seems to be on describing the methodology used for classification and sorting of classes (l1, l2, l3) based on certain criteria (MI & LI). Therefore, without further information, we cannot definitively state what postprocessing steps were taken after model training in this case.
