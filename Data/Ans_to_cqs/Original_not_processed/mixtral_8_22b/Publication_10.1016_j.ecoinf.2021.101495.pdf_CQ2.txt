2.3. Fish classification by species 

A classifier based on deep neural networks was also used for this task. 
In this case, the chosen architecture is a residual neural network, whose 
main characteristic is that it can skip some of its layers (He et al., 2016). 
In particular, the implementation of ResNet50V2 model in TensorFlow

Fig. 1. Diagram of our methodology. There are four main modules: Preprocessing of historical images (purple, sec. 2.1), model training and validation (red, sec. 2.2 
and sec. 2.3), prediction making (green, sec. 3.1 and sec. 3.3) and ground truth validation (orange, sec. 2.5 and sec. 3.4). The original image database (dark purple) 
and the training set (dark red, sec. 3.2) are also highlighted. Data used in each module is specified in Table 1. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this

Query: "What data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., image, audio, video, CSV)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not explicitly state what specific data format is used in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer that the primary data format used is likely image files since the study focuses on fish segmentation and classification tasks using deep neural networks. Additionally, the paper mentions using the ImageNet dataset, which consists mainly of labeled images, further supporting the assumption that the primary data format used is images.
