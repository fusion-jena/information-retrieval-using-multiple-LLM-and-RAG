Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

2.5. Model selection procedure 

The model selection procedure was performed as follows (Capinha 
et  al.,  2021;  Van  Kuppevelt  et  al.,  2020):  we  randomly  generated  5 
models for each of the four available deep-ANN architecture types (20 
models in total) and trained each one with a small subset of the training 
data  (data  partition  At)  for  4  epochs  (an  “epoch”  corresponds  to  the 
complete training dataset being passed forward and backward across the 
network  one  time;  Capinha  et  al.,  2021).  The  accuracy  of  candidate 
models,  as  provided  by  mcfly  (i.e.,  the  “proportion  of  cases  correctly 
classified”), was then compared using a left-out validation data set (data 
partition Av) and the model with the highest performance was selected 
for training on the full training data (data partition Bt; Bt = At + Av) for 
up to 30 epochs.

deep learning models and their outputs has yet to be improved (Reich-
stein et al., 2019). This is being now tackled by the field of “explainable 
artificial intelligence” to understand how the models work and explain 
their outcomes (Shickel and Rashidi, 2020; Siddiqui et al., 2019).

3.2. Deep learning model accuracy, predictive performance, and predictor 
importance 

Concerning the performance of the candidate models, the best vali-
dation accuracies were achieved by model 12 in all the years (accuracy 
= 0.833 ± 0.005; mean of years ± sd) (Fig. 2), a model having a Deep 
Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (DeepConvLSTM) architecture. 
Model  19,  also  with  a  DeepConvLSTM  architecture  had  high  vali-
dation accuracies too (accuracy = 0.829 ± 0.003; mean of years ± sd), 
followed  by model 14, a Convolutional Neural Network  (CNN) archi-
tecture reaching a validation accuracy of 0.821 ± 0.005 (mean of years 
± sd).

Helpful Answer:

The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, based on the information provided about the model selection procedure, it can be inferred that the deep learning models are used for classification tasks. Specifically, the text mentions that the accuracy of candidate models is measured by the proportion of cases correctly classified. Additionally, the table lists parameters for various deep learning models such as Extreme Gradient Boosting Tree, Random Forest, Neural Network, and Deep Neural Network, which are commonly used for classification tasks. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning models discussed here are likely used for classification purposes.
