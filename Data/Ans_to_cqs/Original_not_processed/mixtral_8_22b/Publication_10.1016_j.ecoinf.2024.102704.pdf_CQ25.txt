several  times  higher  than  those  of  other  operations  (Li  et  al.,  2018). 
Therefore,  reducing  memory  access  is  the  key  to  further  enhancing 
model  performance.  By  reconfiguring  the  computation  sequence  of 
‘convolutional layer + batch normalisation + activation layer on NVI-
DIA TESLA V100 GPUs, Wang et al. (2019) reduced memory access by 
33%,  22%,  and  31%  for  the  ResNet-50,  Inception  V3,  and  DenseNet 
models,  respectively,  leading  to  increases  in  the  computational  effi-
ciency  of  20.5%,  18.5%,  and  18.1%.  Lowering  the  memory  access  in 
models can accelerate operations across the three main layers of CNNs, 
thus fully harnessing the model's strengths and more effectively utilising 
the computational resources provided by the embedded devices (Gilan 
et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2015). Therefore, by reducing the number of 
layers  in  the  network  model,  the  number  of  convolutions  and  data

2.4. Model training 

The  experiments  were  conducted  on  a  Windows  10-based  mobile 
laptop  equipped  with  an  Intel(R)  i7-11800H  CPU  and  a  GeForce 
RTX3080  GPU  with  16GB  of  video  memory.  The  PyCharm  software 
platform was utilised to carry out the experiments, employing Python 
3.8 and the Pytorch 1.9 deep learning framework for training purposes. 
The  details  of  the  specific  environmental  configurations  and  model 
training parameters are listed in Table 1. To enhance detection accuracy, 
this study established detection thresholds of IoU = 0.3 and score = 0.3, 
indicating that a bounding box with a likelihood of containing a fish of 
30% or higher was considered valid and thus retained.

Impact of C1 module on network layer and inference time

(n), small (s), medium (m), large (l), and extra-large (x). These scales 
meet the requirements of various scenarios and tasks. As scale increases, 
so does the network depth and width of the model; therefore, ‘n’  rep-
resents the smallest and fastest scale, whereas ‘x’ is the largest and offers 
the  highest  accuracy.  Although  the  accuracy  improves  as  the  model 
depth increases, this also leads to changes in the number of parameters, 
amount  of  computation,  and  detection  speed,  with  correspondingly 
higher demands on the hardware configuration. To delve deeper into the 
underlying causes of enhancing model lightweight and inference speed, 
we utilised LigObNet, YOLOv5, YOLOv6, YOLOv7, and YOLOv8 to train 
across  four  scales:  n,  s,  m,  and  l.  As  Fig.  9  illustrates,  reducing  the 
number  of  parameters  in  the  various  models  does  not  enhance  the 
processing speed. The total parameter count, representing the combined

parameters of all the model layers, is linked to the required disk space

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it appears that the deep learning model used in this research is primarily designed for object detection. This conclusion is drawn from several indications throughout the text. Firstly, the mention of 'bounding boxes' suggests that the model is being employed to locate objects within images, which aligns with the task of object detection. Secondly, the establishment of detection thresholds using Intersection over Union (IoU) and confidence scores further supports this interpretation. Lastly, the comparison between different versions of YOLO (You Only Look Once), a well-known real-time object detection algorithm, reinforces the idea that the primary goal of the model is object detection. However, without explicit confirmation, we cannot definitively rule out the possibility that the model may also be utilized for additional tasks such as image classification or semantic segmentation.
