NN, a powerful and widely utilized machine learning model, excels 
in tasks such as classification and regression (Arbib, 2003; Niroumand- 
Jadidi  et  al.,  2022).  Comprising  interconnected  nodes  (neurons)  ar-
ranged  in  layers,  NN  processes  and  transforms  input  data  to  produce 
desired  outputs  (Goodfellow  et  al.,  2016;  Niroumand-Jadidi  et  al., 
2022). The fundamental structure encompasses an input layer, one or 
more hidden layers, and an output layer (Hardesty, 2017). The number 
of  neurons  in  the  input  layer  aligns  with  the  count  of  input  features, 
whereas  in  this study, only  wind  speed  is  considered. The number of 
neurons  in  the  output  layer  corresponds  to  the  number  of  outputs  or 
classes  (Hardesty,  2017).  An  essential  consideration  of  NN  design

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the research paper "Lake total suspended matter retrieval by wind speed: A machine learning model trained by time-series satellite imagery" by Ashkan Noori et al. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a direct link to the code repository. However, if you are interested in exploring similar work or related resources, you can search for open-source projects on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket using relevant keywords such as "total suspended matter," "satellite imagery," "wind speed," or "neural networks."
