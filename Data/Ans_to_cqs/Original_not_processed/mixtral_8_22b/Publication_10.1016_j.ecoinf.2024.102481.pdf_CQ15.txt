are  influencing  the  reproductive  process  ought  to  be  considered.  The 
incorporation  of  covariates  on  the  reproductive  process  requires 
analytical tools beyond the simple description of gonadal development. 
During  the  last  decade  the  application  of  Machine  Learning  (ML) 
techniques has grown in many research areas, serving to model complex 
relationships in ecology, genetics, and climate change (Lindegren et al., 
2020;  Rolnick  et  al.,  2022;  Schrider  and  Kern,  2018;  Smoli´nski  and 
Radtke, 2017). Machine learning algorithms use computational methods 
to  “learn”  directly  from  data  without  relying  on  a  carefully  defined 
function  as  a  model  -  in  contrast  to  a  linear  model  say,  where  the 
function must be made explicit. They are generally predictive models 
and characterised by having few assumptions and little dependency on 
the  classic  statistical  assumptions  of  conventional  models  (e.g.  error

Knowledge of reproductive traits in exploited marine populations is crucial for their management and conser-
vation. The maturity status in fish is usually assigned by traditional methods such as macroscopy and histology. 
Macroscopic analysis is the assessing of maturity stages by naked eye and usually introduces large amount of 
error. In contrast, histology is the most accurate method for maturity staging but is expensive and unavailable for 
many  stocks  worldwide.  Here,  we  use  the  Random  Forest  (RF)  machine  learning  method  for classification  of 
reproductive  condition  in  fish,  using  the  extensive  data  from  Chilean  hake  (Merluccius  gayi  gayi).  Gonads 
randomly collected from commercial industrial and acoustic surveys were classified as immature, mature-active 
and  mature-inactive.  A  classifier  for  these  three  maturity  classes  was  fitted  using  RFs,  with  the  continuous

distributions,  collinearity).  In  recent  years,  different  algorithms  have 
been successfully applied in fisheries biology, such as Boosted Regres-
sion Trees to assess the relative importance of environmental and har-
vesting  effects  on  herring  growth  (Lyashevska  et  al.,  2020),  as  well 
predicting bycatch on a demersal crustacean fishery in Chile (Montero 
et al., 2020). Random Forest have been applied for stock differentiation 
in pink cusk-eel using morphometric measurements of sagittal otoliths 
(Wiff  et  al.,  2020),  as  well  as  investigating  the  influence  of  environ-
mental and density-dependent factors on the growth of North Sea sprat 
(Lindegren  et  al.,  2020).  Convolutional  Neural  Networks  have  been 
widely applied to analyse salmon scale images for growth determination 
(Vabø et al., 2021). Random Forests (RFs) are one of the most popular 
machine learning techniques for both classification and regression, and

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, it mentions that Random Forests (RFs) are widely used in machine learning for both classification and regression tasks. While this doesn't directly address the query regarding optimization techniques in deep learning pipelines, it highlights the popularity of RFs in machine learning applications. Unfortunately, without additional context, I cannot provide further details on optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines.
