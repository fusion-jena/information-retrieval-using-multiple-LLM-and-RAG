Ratio between the number of patches and

Percentage of each patch that is core area
(a cell is core area if it has no neighbor
with a different value than itself)
Spatial connectedness of cells in patches
(orthogonally contiguous cells have more
weight than diagonally contiguous cells)
Distance to the nearest neighboring patch
of the same class (patch isolation)

Distance from each cell to the patch
centroid (patch area and compactness)
Ratio between the actual perimeter of

portional to permeability, so the following scoring scale was used: very
low – 0.00, low – 0.25, medium – 0.50, high – 0.75 and very high: 1.00.
Once these values were set, they were converted into raster format to
enable determining the mean scores per climate pixel.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: After completing the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be taken to evaluate and interpret the results. Here are some common methods:

1. Saliency Maps: These visualize which parts of the input data had the most significant impact on the model's output. They help identify important features for predictions and improve understanding of how the model makes decisions.

2. Metrics Calculation: Various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC AUC, etc., can be calculated to quantify the model's effectiveness. This helps compare models and select the best one based on specific requirements.

3. Confusion Matrix: It provides a summary of prediction results by comparing actual vs predicted classes. The confusion matrix shows true positives, false negatives, false positives, and true negatives, enabling further analysis like calculating precision, recall, and other derived metrics.

4. Model Interpretation: Techniques like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations), and others can explain individual predictions made by complex machine learning models.

5. Hyperparameter Tuning: Postprocessing may involve fine-tuning hyperparameters to optimize the model's performance further. Grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and other techniques can be employed for this purpose.

6. Ensemble Methods: Combining multiple models using ensemble methods like bagging, boosting, stacking, etc., can lead to improved overall performance compared to individual models.

These postprocessing steps depend on the problem statement, available resources, and desired outcomes. Not all steps might be necessary or feasible for every project.
