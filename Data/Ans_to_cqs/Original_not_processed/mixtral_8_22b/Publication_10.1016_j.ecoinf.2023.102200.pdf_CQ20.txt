3.3. Effect of LiDAR point density on the CHM quality

Individual  mangrove  trees,  low  shrubs,  and  other  classes  were 
labelled  manually  on  the  BEV  images,  and  the  BEV  images  with 
bounding  box  labels  were  used  to  train  the  Faster  R-CNN  detector. 
During the detector operation, the Faster R-CNN network with a Resnet- 
101 backend was trained for 20,000 iterations using Stochastic Gradient 
Descent (with momentum), with a learning rate of 0.003, momentum of 
0.9,  and  a  batch  size  of  1.  The  network  was  initialised  with  weights 
developed from training based on the MS COCO dataset.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models mentioned in the papers. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether GPUs, TPUs, or any other hardware resources were utilized during the training process.
