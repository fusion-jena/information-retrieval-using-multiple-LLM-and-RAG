2)  adapt  this  model  to  a  new  task  with  few  examples,  while  not 
forgetting  the  concepts  learned  previously  (Gidaris  et  al.,  2018;  Har-
iharan et al., 2017). Finally, optimization-based methods are designed to 
adapt quickly to new tasks, hence able to learn a classification task with 
few examples (Finn et al., 2017; Nichol and Schulman, 2018; Sun and 
Chua, 2018). Optimization-based algorithms showed promising results 
in  deep  learning  few-shot  classification  (Finn  et  al.,  2017;  Jamal  and 
Cloud, 2019; Wang et al., 2019). Such methods propose to pre-train (or 
“meta-train”)  a  model  with  existing  databases  (e.g.  MiniImageNet 
(Russakovsky et al., 2015), Ominglot (Lake et al., 2019)) on different 
tasks so it can adapt easily to a new one. For object identification, a task 
is defined by the classes the model has to discriminate. Once this model, 
called “meta-model” has been trained, it can then be tuned to operate on

There are two ways to tackle this problem of lack of data. The first 
one  consists  of  directly  addressing  the  data  itself,  through  data 
augmentation (Van Dyk and Meng, 2012; Wang and Perez, 2017; Wong 
et al., 2016). The second option is to change the classification algorithm. 
Few-shots learning (FSL) algorithms (Fei-fei et al., 2006; Fink, 2005) are 
designed to compute a classification task (query, noted Q) with only a 
few  thumbnails  to  train  (Support  Sets,  noted  SS),  and  it  has  been 
increasingly studied since 2017 (Finn et al., 2017). Few-shots learning 
methods are divided into three main approaches. Metric-based methods 
are embedding both queries (Q) and support sets (Ss), before assigning to 
the query a class, according to distances computed between Q and Ss 
(Sung et al., 2018; Victor and Bruna, 2018; Yanbin et al., 2019). The 
second approach consists of 1) training a model on a large database, and

raw data instead of augmented data in few-shot learning paper is that 
with very few training samples and few conditions, the risk of overfitting 
by using the same image modified multiple times is far greater than in 
classic approaches with important datasets with many conditions.

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide specific information about regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that optimization-based methods like those proposed by Finn et al. (2017) and others are designed to adapt quickly to new tasks, allowing them to learn a classification task with few examples. These methods involve pre-training a model with existing databases on different tasks so it can adapt easily to a new one. This process helps prevent overfitting by exposing the model to diverse data during training. Additionally, the context discusses data augmentation techniques (Van Dyk and Meng, 2012; Wang and Perez, 2017; Wong et al., 2016) which can also help reduce overfitting by increasing the amount of available training data.
