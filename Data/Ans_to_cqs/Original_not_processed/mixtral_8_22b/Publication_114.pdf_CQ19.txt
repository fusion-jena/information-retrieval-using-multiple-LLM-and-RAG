kernels. GoogLeNet adopted the Inception module, which is easy to use for network modification. It also removed the fully connected layers to reduce the number of parameters. Moreover, it used two auxiliary classifiers to accelerate network convergence. As a consequence of the auxiliary classifiers, GoogLeNet is not as scalable as VGG. On the other hand, the depth of networks is a crucial factor that influences CNN performance [39]. Richer features of different levels can be extracted from deep CNN layers, whereas deep models are not easy to optimize. In many studies, batch normalization (BN) is employed to hamper vanishing/exploding gradients in deep CNNs. However, the accuracy often becomes saturated and then degrades (degradation problem) in the training phase, even though BN layers are used. ResNet [41] addressed the degradation problem by using shallow layers and identity mapping for network construction. Two shortcuts (i.e., identity and projection shortcuts) have been

In the past few years, CNNs have been a hot topic in the ﬁeld of image classiﬁcation. Since the
publication of AlexNet [38], a number of classical CNN architectures have been proposed, including
VGG [39], GoogLeNet [40], and ResNet [41]. VGG can be considered as a deepened version of AlexNet,
which employed small convolutional kernels. GoogLeNet adopted the Inception module, which is
easy to use for network modiﬁcation. It also removed the fully connected layers to reduce the number
of parameters. Moreover, it used two auxiliary classiﬁers to accelerate network convergence. As a
consequence of the auxiliary classiﬁers, GoogLeNet is not as scalable as VGG. On the other hand, the
depth of networks is a crucial factor that inﬂuences CNN performance [39]. Richer features of diﬀerent
levels can be extracted from deep CNN layers, whereas deep models are not easy to optimize. In
many studies, batch normalization (BN) is employed to hamper vanishing/exploding gradients in deep
