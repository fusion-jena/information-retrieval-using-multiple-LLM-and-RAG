%Query
Query: "Which hardware resources are used for training the deep learning model (e.g., GPUs, TPUs)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no information about the specific hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether GPUs, TPUs, or other types of hardware were utilized.
