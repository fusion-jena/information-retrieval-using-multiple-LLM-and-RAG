creating labeled datasets of different sizes from SS data. To con-
duct transfer learning, we ﬁrst trained on the ImageNet dataset
(59) and then further trained the network on a small simu-
lated camera-trap dataset. ImageNet has 1.3 million labeled
images for 1,000 categories (from synthetic objects such as bicy-
cles and cars to wildlife categories such as dogs and lions). This

dataset is commonly used in computer vision research, includ-
ing research into transfer learning (32). Training on images from
the real world can be helpful, even if the classes of images
are dissimilar, because many lower-level image features (e.g.,
edge detectors of different orientations, textures, shapes, etc.)
are common across very different types of images (32, 33, 58).

An architecture that is deeper (i.e., has more layers of
neurons) and obtains better performance than AlexNet
by using effective 3 × 3 convolutional ﬁlters (26).
This architecture is designed to be computationally efﬁcient
(using 12 times fewer parameters than AlexNet) while offering
high accuracy (50).

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, it is mentioned that the researchers conducted transfer learning by first training on the ImageNet dataset and then further training the network on a small simulated camera-trap dataset. ImageNet has 1.3 million labeled images for 1,000 categories, including both synthetic objects and wildlife categories. This dataset is commonly used in computer vision research, including research into transfer learning. Additionally, the researchers created labeled datasets of different sizes from SS data. However, no other specific datasets like MNIST or CIFAR are explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
