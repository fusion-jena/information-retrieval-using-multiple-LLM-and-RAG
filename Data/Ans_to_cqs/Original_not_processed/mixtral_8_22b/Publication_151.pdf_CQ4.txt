Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Embedding size. The Layer and Rhodes (2017) (LR)
formulation requires n
1 dimensions, which introduces
some challenges. According to the theory, the number of
dimensions needs to increase by one after inserting the
query. Our supervised learning formulation does not
allow that (the embedding size is ﬁxed after training).
Thus, there is no guarantee that the embeddings remain
correct after addition, even if they are before addition.
However, we note that, in LR embeddings, adding a
leaf would require simply dividing one of the n
1
dimensions into two dimensions, leaving the rest of the
embeddings intact. Thus, one can hope that having one
less dimension has a minimal practical impact. More
broadly, for large n, training models with n-dimensional
embedding is impractical. Thus, we often set k < n
1,
and the gap can be more than an order of magnitude for
some of our tests described below. In practice, we use a
rule of thumb to select the default k (which the user can

1 and

Placement.—Once the CNN model is trained, we use it to
map a given query sequence q to a vector of distances
D1 ...Dn. For data sets with missing data (gaps), we
compute two sets of distances,
1,
using the models with and without gap reconstruction,
respectively. The ﬁnal distances is set to the weighted
i , where �
sum of the distances, that is, (1
is the proportion of the sites with gaps in the query
sequences. The weighted sum is used to reduce the
impact of reconstructed bases (which are guessed, as
opposed to being observed) on the ﬁnal distance and
will be empirically tested. Given these distances, we then
place q onto T using distance-based placement (Balaban
et al. 2020), which uses dynamic programming to ﬁnd the
dqi(T))2,
placement with the minimum
where dqi(T) represents the tree-based distance between
(cid:30)
the query and each taxon i (Fig. 1).

Evaluation on Simulated Data Sets
DEPP training and parameter sensitivity.—We start by
evaluating DEPP on simulated data sets, testing the
ability to train the CNN model in reasonable times. As
the training epochs advance, the loss function (1) drops
rapidly and stabilizes after around 500 epochs in a typical
case (Fig. S1 of the Supplementary material available on
Dryad). Here, training, which is a one-time process for
each reference tree, ﬁnished in around 20 min for the 200-
taxon data set and 260 minutes for 10,000-taxon data set,
on a machine with one 2080Ti NVIDIA GPU and 8 CPU
cores. Placement of 1000 queries took 4 seconds for the
200-taxon and 30 s for the 10,000-taxon data sets using a
single CPU core. On the small 200-taxon data set, EPA-ng
has an advantage in terms of running time. However, in
the larger HGT data set (10,000-taxon), DEPP placements
are faster than the alternatives with half the running time
of EPA-ng. In terms of the memory usage, APPLES+JC

https://doi.org/10.6076/D14G68, a convolutional layer
applies a set of parameterized kernels by convolving
them across its input (i.e., using the dot product of
the kernel entries and the input). Convolutional layers
are usually used as feature extractors, and multiple
layers are used to detect high-level abstraction from
the input. Here, we use them to enable the model to
go beyond the traditional
i.i.d models of sequence
evolution and capture k-mer signatures. The ﬁrst
layer takes as input L features, each
convolutional
L matrix
encoded as four channels, and outputs an 8
by applying a kernel size of 1 (but applied to all four
layers
input channels). The next two convolutional
each have a kernel size of 5 (i.e., operating on 5-mers).

%Query
Query: "What are the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Fliping, Roating, Scaling)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, or scaling. These techniques are commonly used in image processing tasks within deep learning pipelines but may not necessarily apply to other types of data like sequences or text. Therefore, based solely on the information provided, I cannot determine what data augmentation techniques were applied in this case.
