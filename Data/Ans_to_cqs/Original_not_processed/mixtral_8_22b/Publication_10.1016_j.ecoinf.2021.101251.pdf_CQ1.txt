enables advanced search of data across the data packages in ESS-DIVE

are required to submit data to ESS-DIVE for long-term stewardship.

The most significant challenge in implementing data collections is 
ensuring that the datasets included in a collection receive appropriate 
credit for papers citing the collection (primary  rather than secondary 
citations). Ideally, paper(s) citing the collection should also propagate to 
the citation counts of underlying datasets. There is little or no support 
for data collection creation and usage in the current data repository and 
publisher infrastructure. Other challenges involve deciding authorship 
for a data collection (the collection creators, the authors of the under-
lying  datasets,  both,  or  nobody),  and  ensuring  that  usage  licenses  of 
underlying datasets allow that they be compiled into a collection (e.g. 
compliance with dataset attribution requirements). Potential solutions 
to  the  issue  of  collection  authorship  may  include  implementing  the 
CRediT  (https://casrai.org/credit/)  roles  for  authors  involved  in

project. The resulting citation for the data collection can then be used to 
cite all of the resources in the collection.

As  data  becomes  more  accessible,  data  consumers  are  able  to 
incorporate data from many data packages into an analysis. However, 
when a large number of data packages have been used, properly citing 
the data in the reference section without going over page limits can be 
difficult. For example, a paper based on the data from all the AmeriFlux 
sites, all of the NGEE-Tropics data packages, or all of the WFSFA data 
packages would need to include 350, 70, and 96 citations, respectively, 
in the references section. This large number of required citations often 
leads to the citations for the data being provided in the supplementary 
materials, within data/metadata files, or as a table of identifiers. In all of 
these cases, it is difficult to programmatically find the citation of the 
data and thus is unlikely to be counted in the data’s citation metrics. A 
solution to this challenge would be to provide a single citation that can

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer some possible methods from the context.

In the context of ESS-DIVE, which enables advanced search of data across its data packages, it's mentioned that projects like AmeriFlux are required to submit their data for long-term stewardship. This suggests that one method of data collection could be direct submission by researchers or organizations.

Furthermore, the mention of AmeriFlux sites implies that sensor data might be collected. Sensors are commonly used in various fields to collect real-time data, and AmeriFlux, being a network of PI-managed sites measuring ecosystem CO2, water, and energy fluxes using micrometeorological methods, likely uses such sensors.

However, it's important to note that these are assumptions based on the given context. The actual methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline could vary widely depending on the specific application and field. These methods could range from manual data entry, use of IoT devices, web scraping, APIs, surveys, experiments, simulations, etc.

Therefore, while we can speculate that direct submissions and sensor data might be part of the data collection process in the context of ESS-DIVE, a definitive answer regarding the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline cannot be provided based solely on the given context.
