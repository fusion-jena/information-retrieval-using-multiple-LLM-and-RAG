resolution at the landscape scale. To achieve this, we use predictive models based on machine learning algo-
rithms and a fungal database resulting from the sampling of more than 100 permanent sampling plots over 20 
years. We estimate that current and future productivity patterns differ among species, under different climate 
change scenarios and bioclimatic regions. Our results suggest that optimal productivity areas may be shifted to 
higher  elevations,  making  those  species  with  higher  productivity  at  higher  elevations  the  most  affected  by 
climate change. This would mean that some species with high socioeconomic value, such as Lactarius deliciosus 
and Boletus edulis, could be negatively affected in their total productivity in the study area. This study highlights 
the need to anticipate the potential effects of climate change on fungal productivity and in particular on high

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The papers cited do not directly discuss specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, and shifting images. These techniques help improve model performance and prevent overfitting by increasing the amount of training data available. It is important to note that the choice of data augmentation technique depends on the nature of the dataset and the problem being addressed. For instance, flipping or rotation might not be suitable for datasets where orientation matters, while scaling can introduce distortions if not done carefully. Therefore, it is essential to consider the characteristics of the dataset before applying any data augmentation technique.
