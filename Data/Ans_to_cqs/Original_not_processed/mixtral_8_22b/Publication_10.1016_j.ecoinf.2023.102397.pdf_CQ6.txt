over which the quality measures and results fail to continue improving. 
Benkendorf and Hawkins (2020), analyzing the effect of sample size on 
deep neural networks, similarly concluded that by increasing the num-
ber of hidden layers, which can be interpreted as adding more training 
recordings in our software, the neural network can largely improve the 
performance of the model.

All the parameters used for all the recognizers are shown in Table S2. 

2.6. Data analysis: Target set 

The analyses of the target set aimed to detect possible differences 
among the software programs in evaluating the results with regard to 
two different aspects: (1) the possibility that different habitats produce 
more or fewer song detections per day and (2) the possibility that great 
tits in different habitats have different times of vocal activity, regardless 
of the total number of songs. Given that the days and sites used to obtain 
the  data  for  the  training  and  target  sets  were  the  same  for  all  three 
software programs, any differences among the software programs must 
be exclusively due to differences or biases in their detection patterns. On 
the other hand, for the general comparison of the software, we measured 
the  time  each  software  spent  on  analyzing  the  entire  target  dataset 
(32,640 recordings).

2.3. Data processing 

In  this  study,  we  reproduced  the  usual  steps  of  a  single-species 
bioacoustics  study: (1)  we  optimized  a  recognizer  via  automated  and 
manual processes; (2) we applied it to a set of manually validated re-
cordings  to  evaluate  its  performance;  and  finally  (3)  we  applied  the 
recognizer to a large set of recordings, which usually is the real aim of 
the  study.  For  this,  we  created  eight  different  subsets  of  recordings 
(Table 1): six different training sets that included varying amounts of 
cases, a test set, and a target set of recordings. The same sets were always

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't specific information about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, generally speaking, common preprocessing steps include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and augmentation. Normalization scales the input features to a range between 0 and 1, while scaling rescales the values to have zero mean and unit variance. Cleaning involves removing noise from the data, such as outliers or missing values. Augmentation generates new samples by applying transformations like rotation, flipping, or zooming. These techniques help improve the accuracy and efficiency of the deep learning models.
