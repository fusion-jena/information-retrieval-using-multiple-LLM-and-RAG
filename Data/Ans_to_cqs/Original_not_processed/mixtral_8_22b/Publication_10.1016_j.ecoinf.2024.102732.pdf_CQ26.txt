scenarios. The study showed the suitability of the SVR algorithm for
making predictions with restricted datasets, a finding that aligns with
previous research investigations (Kaveh et al., 2023; Mehmood et al.,
2024a; Zhang et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2022). An important conclusion
is derived from Fig. 6. It highlights that MLR heavily depends on pre-
dictor variables, demonstrating a more pronounced reliance on these
elements than machine learning methods. Furthermore, it is worth
noting that relying solely on spectral bands to predict AGB is unlikely to
produce favorable outcomes. Integrating these spectral bands with other
variable sets, including those produced from the Shuttle Radar Topog-
raphy Mission Digital Elevation Model (SRTM DEM) and vegetation-
derived indices, will lead to more favorable outcomes.

indices to measure variable importance in XGBoost include “Gain” and
“Frequency” (Gertz et al., 2020; Li et al., 2023; Luo et al., 2024; Meh-

appropriate kernel function and optimizing the “C” parameter, which
balances margin width and misclassification tolerance. The versatility of
SVR allows it

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some commonly used techniques to address data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting is a technique where the dataset is divided into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes or labels in both sets. This ensures that the classifier learns from a representative sample of each class.

Oversampling is a method used when there is a significant imbalance in the number of samples belonging to different classes. Oversampling increases the number of minority class examples by duplicating them or creating synthetic examples using interpolation techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).

Undersampling is another approach to dealing with class imbalance, but instead of increasing the size of the minority class, it reduces the size of the majority class. Random undersampling removes random instances from the majority class until the desired balance is achieved. More sophisticated approaches like NearMiss use distance measures to selectively remove majority class instances close to the minority class boundary.

Diverse data collection aims to gather a wide range of data points representing various scenarios, conditions, and populations. By collecting diverse data, the model can better generalize and perform well across different situations.

These techniques help mitigate data bias and improve the overall performance of deep learning models.
