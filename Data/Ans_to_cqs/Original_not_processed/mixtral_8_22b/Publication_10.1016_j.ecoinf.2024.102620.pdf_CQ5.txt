The NDVI data utilized was the MOD13Q1.006 dataset, an L3 image 
product with a spatial resolution of 250 m, updated every 16 days. The 
NDVI value is the monthly maximum value synthesized by the maximum 
value synthesis method. The vegetation type data was reclassified into 
nine  categories:  evergreen  needle-leaved  forest  (ENF),  deciduous 
needle-leaved  forest  (DNF),  deciduous  broadleaved  forest  (DBF), 
mingled  forest  (MF),  shrub,  grassland,  wetland,  arable  land  and  non- 
vegetation.  The  Google  Earth  Engine  (GEE)  platform  was  utilized  to 
obtain and crop the NDVI and vegetation type data. The DEM data was 
obtained from the Resource and Environmental Science and Data Center 
of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, using the SRTM V4.1 dataset after 
resampling.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the research paper does not discuss any deep learning pipelines or datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the paper focuses on ecological informatics and uses various datasets related to environmental science. These include the MOD13Q1.006 dataset for NDVI, vegetation type data, DEM data, temperature, precipitation, radiation, road data, GDP data, and population data. Therefore, I cannot provide information about the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline based on this context.
