The parameter setting method of SVM in this study was done ac-
cording to the sensitivity analysis method in (Heydari and Mountrakis,
2018). The “kernelType” was set to “RBF” (Gaussian function). For the
“gamma” parameter in the RBF kernel, we tested values of 0.01, 0.1,
0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, and 300. For the “cost” parameter in SVM,
we tested values of 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, and 50. We randomly se-
lected 50% reference data for parameter optimization. By selecting the
highest overall accuracy achieved from diﬀerent parameter combina-
tions, this study set “gamma” and “cost” to 2 and 10 respectively.

This is the ﬁrst study to our knowledge to investigate the pheno-
logical features in improving the performance of deep learning. As re-
vealed in our results, we have seen great potential in developing phe-
nological knowledge based deep learning methods. Recent literature
has documented the applications and beneﬁts of deep learning, a new
branch of machine learning, in various ﬁelds (LeCun et al., 2015).
However, it is still a controversial topic whether deep learning is more
suitable than traditional machine learning methods for Landsat image
classiﬁcation (Heydari and Mountrakis, 2018; Li et al., 2016). Never-
theless, this study aims to evaluate the hypotheses that applying phe-
nological knowledge as input data of deep learning can improve the
performance in the detection of invasive S. alterniﬂora. A comparison
experiment between SAE and SVM with six diﬀerent types of Landsat
images was conducted (see Table 2). The best performance was

(sowing), green (emergence and full growth) and bare soil (harvest).
Capturing these three stages with spectral data should further enhance
the spectral separability between paddy rice and others.

5.2. Deep learning with Ppf-CM

achieved with Ppf-CM based SAE method, suggesting SAE beneﬁted
more than SVM from combining data in the two phenological stages
using Ppf-CM (Table 4). This was mainly because, compared to the
traditional machine learning method (SVM), deep learning method
(SAE) can easily capture and exploit more complex information with its
deep network structure and strong self-learning ability (Penatti et al.,
2015; Xie et al., 2015).

Helpful Answer:

In the given context, there is no explicit mention of the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model such as learning rate or optimizer. However, it does provide some details about the parameters used in the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, which is also a type of machine learning algorithm. In the case of SVM, the 'kernelType' was set to 'RBF', and different values were tested for the 'gamma' and 'cost' parameters. The optimal values found were 'gamma' = 2 and 'cost' = 10.

As for the deep learning model, the context mentions that a Stacked Autoencoder (SAE) was used, but it doesn't specify any particular hyperparameters like learning rate or optimizer. Instead, it focuses on comparing the performance of SAE with SVM when using different types of Landsat images and phenological knowledge. It suggests that SAE benefited more than SVM from combining data in the two phenological stages using Phenology Profile Combination Method (Ppf-CM).

Therefore, without additional context, I cannot provide the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
