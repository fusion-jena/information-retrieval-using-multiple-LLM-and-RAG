2.6. Model selection 

Since  performance,  accuracy,  key  parameters,  and  sensitivity  for 
prediction vary depending on which method that is used (Diniz-Filho 
et al., 2009; Elith et al., 2006; Qiao et al., 2015), we tested eight different 
machine  learning  algorithms  to  generate  our  predictive  models.  The 
included  algorithms  were:  Generalized  Linear  Model  (GLM),  Support 
Vector  Machine  (SVM),  Multivariate  Adaptive  Regression  Spline 
(MARS),  Random  Forest  (RF),  Flexible  Discriminant  Analysis  (FDA), 
Classification  and  Regression  Trees  (CART),  Generalized  Boosting 
regression Model (GBM) and Maximum-Entropy learning (MAXENT) for 
habitat suitability prediction (Table S5).

The prediction power with machine learning algorithms was tested 
with the package “sdm”  (Naimi and Araújo, 2016), “dismo”  (Hijmans 
et al., 2015), “bioclim” (Booth et al., 2014), and the ensemble modeling 
approach  implemented  in  “biomod2”  (Thuiller  et  al.,  2009;  2014). 
Model mean performances for AUC, ROC, TSS, KAPPA, and COR values 
were extracted using “shiny” packages (Chang et al., 2023) in RStudio 
(RStudio Team, 2020).

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that no specific deep learning model such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers are explicitly mentioned as being used in the pipeline. Instead, the authors have employed various machine learning algorithms including Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS), Random Forest (RF), Flexible Discriminant Analysis (FDA), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Generalized Boosting regression Model (GBM), and Maximum-Entropy learning (MAXENT) for habitat suitability prediction. These algorithms do not fall under the category of deep learning models but rather belong to traditional machine learning techniques. Therefore, based on the information available, it cannot be determined what type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline.
