Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it mentions that different experimental groups were designed for testing the effect of tile size on accuracy, which could be considered a form of validation. The table shows ten experimental groups (EXP1 - EXP10), each employing different combinations of classification models, approaches, and tile sizes. This suggests that multiple configurations were tested to evaluate their impact on performance, contributing to the robustness and reliability of the results. Nevertheless, without further details regarding the dataset used and other potential validation methods applied, it is difficult to definitively state what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
