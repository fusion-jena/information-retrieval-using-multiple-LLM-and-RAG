within the study area for MaxEnt and set up the hyperparameters as in 
Bean et al. (2012). The training settings and hyperparameters used for 
each SDM are described in Table 3.

et  al.,  2021;  Pham  et  al.,  2021).  A  common  approach  is  to  exploit  a 
teacherâ€“student structure in the training process, which refers to use a 
trained teacher model to teach a student model. However, in most cases, 
a single ANN or deep neural network model is used as the teacher model 
to assign labels (Ali et al., 2022; Asghar et al., 2020). When PL based on a 
single-teacher model is used to predict species distributions, the teacher 
model can be easily biased towards specific environmental data, and the 
labeled data by this model may not represent diverse habitat conditions 
of  the  species  and  may  lead  to  overfitting  of  the  student  model.  In 
addition,  predictive  errors  of  a  single-teacher  model  can  accumulate 
during the training process, reducing the general efficiency of PL (Arazo 
et  al.,  2020).  This  can  be  alleviated  by  considering  different  teacher 
models for label generation and using the most promising model among

to the training set for subsequent training of the model. However, pre-
vious studies have several limitations. First, they used PL methods only 
on  raw  images  with  centimeter-level  spatial  resolution.  Ecological 
studies,  on  the  other  hand,  typically  use  preprocessed  environmental 
data at meter- or kilometer-level resolution to effectively model poten-
tial  species  distributions  at  broad  scales.  Second,  they  have  not  been 
tested  in  contexts  where  labeled  observational  data  are  very  scarce, 
which can be a significant drawback in SDM research. Lastly, traditional

As  mentioned  earlier,  the  teacher  model  generates  labels  for  data 
points in DU. Initially, the teacher model is trained using DL whose labels 
are already known. A maximum of 10,000 unlabeled data points (DS) are 
then randomly sampled from DU without replacement and pseudo-labels 
are generated for these data points. Sampling different unlabeled data 
points during each iteration helps to avoid biased predictions.

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does indicate that ecological studies often use preprocessed environmental data at meter- or kilometer-level resolution to effectively model potential species distributions at broad scales. This suggests that some form of preprocessing might occur to transform raw environmental data into a more suitable format for modeling purposes. Additionally, the text mentions that a maximum of 10,000 unlabeled data points are randomly sampled from DU without replacement and pseudo-labels are generated for these data points. This could imply that there might be some initial filtering or selection process to ensure the quality and relevance of the chosen data points for generating accurate pseudo-labels.
