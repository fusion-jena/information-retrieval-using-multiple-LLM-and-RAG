4.3. Advantages and drawbacks 

4.3.1. Model prediction beyond the training ranges

in the basin, based on 180 resident species’ data. As species observation 
data,  we  use  data  from  a  public  authoritative  repository  of  big  data 
(GBIF)  improved  with  reliable  records  we  accurately  and  directly 
observed in the field.

%Query
Query: "What process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model (e.g., Model serialization, Platform selection)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not contain information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful response regarding the specific steps taken to deploy the model, such as model serialization or platform selection.
