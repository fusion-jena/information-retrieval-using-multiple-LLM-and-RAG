Advancements  in  bathymetry  retrieval  methods  have  led  to  the 
development  of  various  models,  including  linear  or  nonlinear  regres-
sion, logarithmic ratio transformation, and machine learning techniques 
such  as  CART,  RFR, and  SVM (Ashphaq et  al.,  2021; Cahalane et  al., 
2019; Lyzenga, 1978; Lyzenga et al., 2006). Gabr et al. (2020) utilized a 
linear model to estimate bathymetry and confirmed the equivalence of 
Landsat images to high-resolution PlanetScope (3 m) predictions. Sun 
et al. (2021) applied two regression tree models (CART and Cubist) to 
retrieve  coastal  bathymetry  and  analyze  vertical  water  environment 
information.  Zhang  et  al.  (2019)  employed  the  SVR  (support  vector 
regression) model to provide technical support for bathymetry data in 
Arctic waters. However, despite several studies, the application of CART 
and  RFR  models  in  nearshore  turbid  waters  for  bathymetry  has  been

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not contain specific information about the hyperparameters used in any deep learning model. The papers mentioned in the context discuss various aspects related to bathymetry retrieval methods, such as linear or nonlinear regression, logarithmic ratio transformation, and machine learning techniques like CART, RFR, and SVM. They also mention the use of different sensors and satellite imagery for estimating bathymetry. However, none of them explicitly state the hyperparameters used in their respective deep learning models. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact hyperparameters used in these models based solely on this context.
