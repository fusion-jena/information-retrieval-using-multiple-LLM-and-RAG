2.6.3. Training process 

To fit into the network, the training set must have its data normalized 
and standardized. For the training network, the batch size was set to 32. 
The purposes for selecting 32 were to not exceed the memory limit and 
to make full use of computer resources. The optimizer used Adam pro-
cessing, and the learning ratio varied with group based on the cosine 
function’s law, often in the range between 0.0 and 1.0. The 100 epochs 
are used with an early stopping function to halt the learning process if 
there is no improvement in accuracy after 20 epochs. The loss function 
used is the cross-entropy loss function (Abd-Ellah et al., 2024).

2.6.2. Modified U-Net network

to construct soil salinity maps, semantic segmentation—the process of 
assigning a category label to each pixel of an image—is applied to the 
image via the MU-NET deep learning method.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't any information available regarding the specific data augmentation techniques applied in this deep learning pipeline. The given text only mentions the normalization and standardization of the training set but does not provide details about any other data augmentation methods such as flipping, rotation, or scaling. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which data augmentation techniques were utilized in this case.
