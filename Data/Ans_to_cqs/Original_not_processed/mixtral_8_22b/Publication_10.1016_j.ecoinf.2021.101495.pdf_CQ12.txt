2.3. Fish classification by species 

A classifier based on deep neural networks was also used for this task. 
In this case, the chosen architecture is a residual neural network, whose 
main characteristic is that it can skip some of its layers (He et al., 2016).

how the model is able to learn in fewer steps and with better accuracy if 
data augmentation is used.

Helpful Answer:
The paper uses two types of deep learning models in their pipeline - one for fish segmentation and another for fish classification. For fish segmentation, they use a convolutional neural network (CNN), specifically the Faster R-CNN model, which is part of the TensorFlow Object Detection API. This model is trained using transfer learning, where the weights are initialized from a pre-trained model on the COCO dataset.

For fish classification, they use a residual neural network (ResNet), specifically the ResNet50V2 model implemented in TensorFlow. This model is also pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. The main feature of ResNet is that it allows skipping certain layers during training, which helps prevent vanishing gradients and improves performance.

Therefore, the pipeline uses both CNN and ResNet models for different tasks within the pipeline.
