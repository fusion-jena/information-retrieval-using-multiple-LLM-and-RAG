layers, pooling layers and fully connected layers (Voulodimos et al.,
2018). The ﬁrst two components are responsible for automatic feature
extraction by applying a large number of diﬀerent ﬁlters on the input
data. This process of feature extraction is performed on multiple levels,
whereby the output of each level is the input to the following. From
level to level, the extracted features increase in complexity - from rather
simple features (e.g. edges) on the lowest level to more complex fea-
tures on the highest level (Gu et al., 2018). By passing large quantities
of labeled training data through the network, the model successively
learns to recognize the relevant features, which are necessary to dis-
tinguish between classes.

Machine learning, and particularly deep learning, has evolved into
the most commonly used approaches for the automatic classiﬁcation of
digital images (LeCun et al., 2015). The major advantage of deep
learning is that the time-consuming and complex step of previous fea-
ture extraction becomes unnecessary. Instead, the model learns and
extracts the relevant features itself during the training process. The
major drawback of deep learning is that large amounts of labeled
training data are required (Kamilaris and Prenafeta-Boldú, 2018).
Among the deep learning architectures, convolutional neural networks
(CNN) are particularly suitable for image analysis due to their ability to
extract spatial features. CNNs have proven to be quite powerful in
performing diﬀerent tasks such as object detection (Everingham et al.,
2010; Tompson et al., 2014), classiﬁcation (Traore et al., 2018, Xu
et al., 2017, Amara et al., 2017, Lu et al., 2017, Han et al., 2018) and

semantic segmentation (Chen et al., 2014; Shelhamer et al., 2016).

Although the use of pre-trained models has proven to be advanta-
geous for many image recognition tasks (Weiss et al., 2016), we decided
to train the model from scratch. We recognized that our speciﬁc clas-
siﬁcation problem was too diﬀerent from the pre-trained networks.
Moreover, we considered the number of labeled samples available
(nearly 30,000 per class) as large enough for training our own network.

We trained the CNN using ReLU activation for the convolutional layers
and an exponential linear unit (ELU) activation on the fully connected
layer (Clevert et al., 2015). As optimizer we chose the adaptive ADAM
(Adaptive Moment Estimation) with a learning rate of lr = 0.0001.
Training was performed with a batch size of 256 over 16,290 iterations
(= 90 epochs).

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some common methods include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of target variables in both sets. Oversampling increases the frequency of minority classes by duplicating examples or creating synthetic ones, while undersampling reduces the majority class instances. Diverse data collection aims to gather a wide range of representative samples to reduce potential biases in the dataset.

In this case, it appears that the authors did not explicitly mention any specific technique to handle data bias but instead focused on training their Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch using nearly 30,000 labeled samples per class. They employed ReLU activation for convolutional layers and ELU activation for the fully connected layer, along with the ADAM optimizer and a learning rate of 0.0001. Training was conducted with a batch size of 256 over 16,290 iterations (or 90 epochs).
