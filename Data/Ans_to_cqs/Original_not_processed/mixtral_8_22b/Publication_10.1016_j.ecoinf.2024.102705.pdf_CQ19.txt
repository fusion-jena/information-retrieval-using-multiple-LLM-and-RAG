The term “deep learning” refers to the utilization of neural networks, 
a statistical model for data representation in solving complex problems 
(LeCun  et  al.,  2015;  Christopher  and  Hugh,  2024).  These  neural  net-
works are constructed through training, involving a large set of inputs 
and  labeled outputs. Comprising layered nonlinear transformations, a 
neural  network  contains  numerous  adjustable  parameters.  Training  a 
neural network requires multiple iterations, during which the network 
may produce incorrect results. The discrepancy between the current and 
expected outputs is calculated as loss values. Optimization algorithms 
such as Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) (Herbert and Sutton, 1951), 
Adaptive Gradient (AdaGrad) (Duchi et al., 2011), Root Mean Square 
Prop (RMSProp) (Tieleman and Hinton, 2012), and Adam (Kingma and 
Ba, 2014) are then employed to assess each parameter’s contribution to

feature representations, which are crucial for predicting the threshold of 
image  processing  algorithms  (Wang  et  al.,  2018).  In  this  study,  we 
propose a compact network incorporating a non-local layer capable of 
extracting  long-distance  features  to  predict  parameters  for  the  image 
processing module. Additionally, we introduce a joint training approach 
for image adaptive enhancement modules and deep learning models to 
ensure  that  the  image  processing  results  contribute  to  improved  per-
formance  of  the  deep  learning  model.  The  proposed  method  demon-
strates superior performance across a diverse range of environments. it 
enables  expedited  transitions  from  field  surveys  to  reporting,  even  in 
challenging circumstances, thereby facilitating efficient data collection 
and analysis on a larger scale.

process. The NLPP network, as shown in Table 4, comprises seven layers 
and encompasses a mere 150 K parameters. To extract environmental 
features effectively, a non-local layer (Wang et al., 2018) is incorporated 
within  the  NLPP  network  to  capture  long-term  dependencies  in  the 
images. The NLPP module is trained to generate more suitable hyper-
parameters for the DIP module.
