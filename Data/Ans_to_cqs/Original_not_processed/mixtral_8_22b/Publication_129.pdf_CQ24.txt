Next, the Region of Interest (RoI) pooling layer takes the
region corresponding to a proposal from the backbone feature
map and dividing it into sub-windows. The maximum pooling
is performed over these sub-windows to give the output of RoI
pooling layer, which has a size of (N, 7, 7, 512), and N is the
number of generated region proposals by the RPN mechanism,
as shown in Fig. 2. After passing through two fully connected
layers (FCs), the features are fed into the classiﬁer and regres-
sor branches as follow. The classiﬁcation layer calculates the
probability of the region proposal contains an object such that
the probability Pi of each element in the feature map i contains
the target object using softmax function. The regions with the
top score of 300 Pi in the total rankings present the detected
target object. In addition, the regressor provides the IoU index

feature maps automatically [20]. A comparative study of
machine learning against deep learning was conducted for
detecting and identifying pests on tomato plants in green-
houses [21]. This study showed that the performance of deep
learning solution is better than the proposed machine learning
techniques to achieve accurate identiﬁcation of tomato pests.
Similarly, Kasinathan et al. [22] compared four machine learn-
ing techniques, namely artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN), sup-
port vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), naive
bayes (NB) with a proposed CNN model to classify insect
pests using the public IP102 dataset. The proposed CNN
model achieved highest classiﬁcation rates of 91.5% and
90.0% for 9 and 24 crop pest classes, respectively. For soybean
ﬁelds, transfer leaning models [23–25] such as Residual Neural
Network (ResNet-50) and Visual Geometry Group Network
(VGG-16 and VGG-19) have been proposed to support

Abstract Agricultural pests cause between 20 and 40 percent loss of global crop production every
year as reported by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Therefore, smart agriculture
presents the best option for farmers to apply artiﬁcial intelligence techniques integrated with mod-
ern information and communication technology to eliminate these harmful insect pests. Conse-
quently, the productivity of their crops can be increased. Hence, this article introduces a new
mobile application to automatically classify pests using a deep-learning solution for supporting spe-
cialists and farmers. The developed application utilizes faster region-based convolutional neural
network (Faster R-CNN) to accomplish the recognition task of insect pests based on cloud comput-
ing. Furthermore, a database of recommended pesticides is linked with the detected crop pests to
guide the farmers. This study has been successfully validated on ﬁve groups of pests; called Aphids,

Helpful Answer:
To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, several strategies can be employed. One common strategy is to use a fixed random seed value across all experiments. By setting a specific seed value, the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers will be generated, ensuring reproducibility of results. Another approach is to perform multiple runs with different initializations or seeds and average the results to reduce variability caused by randomness. Additionally, some frameworks provide options to control the level of randomness during training, such as deterministic mode or disabling certain sources of randomness like data augmentation or dropout layers. However, it should be noted that while reducing randomness can improve consistency, it may also limit the exploration of the search space and potentially lead to suboptimal solutions. Therefore, finding the right balance between controlling randomness and allowing sufficient exploration is crucial for achieving good performance in deep learning applications.
