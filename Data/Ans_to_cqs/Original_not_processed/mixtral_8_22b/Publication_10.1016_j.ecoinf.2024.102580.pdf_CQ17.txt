4.3. Limitations of deep learning methods 

High accuracy was achieved in classifying vegetation and bare sub-
strate, but the classification of the ‘other’  class (reflecting rocks, coral 
and debris) was less successful. This is likely due to fewer pixels of this 
class being present in the images, resulting in lower-quality training data 
for  this  class.  This  limitation  highlights  the  importance  of  quality 
training data in deep learning. Creating accurate annotated imagery for 
training  can  be  time-consuming,  however,  new  tools  are  continually 
being  developed,  which  utilise  artificial  intelligence  to  assist  in  the 
annotation of ground-truth images, such as ©v7 labs (www.v7labs.com) 
and ©AnyLabeling (AI Curious, 2023).

By providing the tools to conduct these analyses, we aim to stimulate the uptake of deep learning for enhancing 
the data obtained from aerial imagery to improve the monitoring and conservation of natural ecosystems.

◦

augmentation  techniques  were  used  to  artificially  create  a  larger 
training  set  by  randomly  flipping  each  input  image  horizontally  and 
vertically with a probability of 0.5 each and rotating the images by up to 
180
.  Weighted  cross-entropy  was  used  as  the  loss  function  and  the 
stochastic  gradient  descent  optimization  algorithm  was  used  to  mini-
mize the loss function. The model accuracy was assessed after each full 
training set iteration (epoch), quantifying the proportion of correct class 
predictions out of the total predictions made. Precision was determined 
as  the  ratio  of  correct  predictions  to  the  total  number  of  predictions, 
encompassing both false and accurate ones. Recall, on the other hand, 
measured the ratio of correct predictions to the total number of pixels 
that should be assigned to that specific class.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on common practices in deep learning, some possible regularization methods include dropout and L2 regularization. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent overfitting by making the network more robust. L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, encouraging smaller weights and reducing the complexity of the model. Other potential regularization methods could include early stopping, weight decay, or batch normalization. Without further details, it is impossible to determine which specific methods were employed in this case.

Based on the given context, the authors did not explicitly mention any regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in their deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the use of dropout, L2 regularization, or any other specific method. However, it is worth noting that regularization methods like dropout and L2 regularization are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to address overfitting issues. These methods help reduce the model's complexity and improve its generalizability. In addition to dropout and L2 regularization, other popular regularization techniques include early stopping, weight decay, and batch normalization. Nevertheless, without additional information, it remains uncertain whether any of these methods were utilized in this particular study.
