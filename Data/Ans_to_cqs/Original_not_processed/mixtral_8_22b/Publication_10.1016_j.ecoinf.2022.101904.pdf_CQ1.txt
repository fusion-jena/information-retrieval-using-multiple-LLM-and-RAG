On the other hand, transformers are the most frequently deployed 
techniques in natural language processing (NLP) (Vaswani et al., 2017). 
Researchers  are now exploring the capability of transformers  in com-
puter  vision  and  remote  sensing,  given  their  huge  success  in  the  lan-
guage domain. They have recently proven to be practical in a variety of 
applications,  including  the  classification  of  remote  sensing  imagery 
(Bazi et al., 2021; D. Hong et al., 2021; J. He et al., 2020). Transformers 
utilize  an  attention-based  approach  rather  than  using  convolutional 
operations utilized by CNNs. As such, transformers, unlike CNNs, can 
acquire global contextual knowledge through self-attention. This means 
that transformers have a better generalization capability as compared to 
CNN algorithms. For example, the state-of-the-art vision transformer of 
Swin Transformer incorporates a hierarchical transformer with shifting

Many  ecosystems,  particularly  wetlands,  are  significantly  degraded  or  lost  as  a  result  of  climate  change  and 
anthropogenic  activities.  Simultaneously,  developments  in  machine  learning,  particularly  deep  learning 
methods, have greatly improved wetland mapping, which is a critical step in ecosystem monitoring. Yet, present 
deep  and  very deep  models necessitate  a greater  number  of  training data, which  are costly,  logistically  chal-
lenging,  and  time-consuming  to  acquire.  Thus,  we  explore  and  address  the  potential  and  possible  limitations 
caused  by  the  availability  of  limited  ground-truth  data  for  large-scale  wetland  mapping.  To  overcome  this 
persistent  problem  for  remote  sensing  data  classification  using  deep  learning  models,  we  propose  3D  UNet 
Generative Adversarial Network Swin Transformer (3DUNetGSFormer) to adaptively synthesize wetland training

dataset to ensure a more precise description of wetlands. The ground-

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does indicate that acquiring a sufficient amount of training data for deep learning models can be challenging due to factors like cost, logistical difficulties, and time constraints. This suggests that the collection process may involve various methods such as field surveys, sensor deployments, or accessing publicly available datasets. In the case of wetland mapping, satellite or airborne remote sensing could potentially be employed to gather image data. Nonetheless, without explicit information on the data collection methods used in this study, I cannot provide a definitive answer.
