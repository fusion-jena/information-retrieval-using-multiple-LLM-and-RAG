among  these  scales.  Generally,  q  values  for  different  driving  factors 
showed an M-shaped pattern as the grid scale increased from small to 
large, with peak values at the spatial scales of 90 m × 90 m and 270 m ×
270  m;  the  q  value  of  the  latter  was  slightly  higher  than  that  of  the 
former. Therefore, the optimal spatial scale threshold for the detection 
of  factors  driving  mangrove  forest  landscape  evolution  was  270  m  ×
270  m.  Based  on  this  optimal  spatial  scale,  the  OPGD  was  used  to 
quantitatively detect the factors influencing mangrove landscape evo-
lution from 1985 to 2020.

where q is the spatial variance of a factor indicator (used in this study to 
detect the factor’s influence on mangrove forest area); N and Nj  are the 
sample sizes of the whole region and the jth (j = 1, 2, …, L) sub-region, 
respectively; and σ2  and σ2
j  are the variance of mangrove forest area in 
the  whole  region  and  jth  sub-region,  respectively.  The  q  value  ranges 
from  0  to  1,  where  higher  q  values  indicate  a  higher  proportion  of 
variance explained (Song et al., 2020).

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. It discusses the use of the Optimal Parameter Grid Division (OPGD) method to quantitatively detect the factors influencing mangrove landscape evolution but does not mention any specific optimization techniques such as grid search or random search.
