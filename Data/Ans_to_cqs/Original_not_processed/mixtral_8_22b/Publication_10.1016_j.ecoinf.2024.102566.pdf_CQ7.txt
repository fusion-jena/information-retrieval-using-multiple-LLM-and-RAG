field-collected data and machine learning methods on developing AGB 
models.  Moreover,  the  quality  of  training  samples  and  the  layout  of 
sampling  points  are  crucial  for  constructing  accurate  and  reliable 
models for biomass estimation (Morais et al., 2021). In this study, owing 
to  the  insufficiency  of  high-quality  training  samples,  we  employed  a 
method with low data dependency that integrates forest inventory data 
with remote sensing imagery for biomass estimation.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, common practices in machine learning include splitting the dataset randomly or stratified based on class labels. Typically, the data is divided into 60-80% for training, 10-20% for testing, and another 10-20% for validation. Cross-validation techniques such as k-fold cross-validation can also be used to ensure robustness and generalization of the model. It should be noted that the specific criteria for splitting the data may depend on factors like the size of the dataset, class imbalance, and the nature of the problem being addressed.
