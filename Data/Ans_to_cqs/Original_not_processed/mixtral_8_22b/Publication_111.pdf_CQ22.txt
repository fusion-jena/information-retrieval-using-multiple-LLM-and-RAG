5.3. Evaluation Metrics. Evaluating the machine learning
algorithms that are being used is a critical component of any
proposed system. Four assessment metrics are used to de-
termine the correctness of this system. +e mean absolute
error (MAE) is one of these metrics that estimate the average
of the diﬀerence between original and forecasted values.
Hence, we can determine how far the predictions diﬀer from
the actual data. Mathematically, MAE is represented as
follows:

MAE �

+e mean squared error (MSE) and the root mean square
error (RMSE), on the other hand, are also deployed to assess
the accuracy of regression problems. +e MSE is the average
of the square of the diﬀerence between actual and predicted

deep learning, and machine learning models for predicting the SSTand SWH on a real dataset obtained from the Korea Hydrographic
and Oceanographic Agency. +en, we proposed comparing these three predictive approaches on four diﬀerent evaluation metrics.
Experimental results have revealed that the deep learning model slightly outperformed the machine learning models for overall
performance, and both of these approaches greatly outperformed the statistical predictive model.

+is paper aims to predict the SST and the SWH for the
Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency dataset.
+e proposed work is motivated by comparing the statistical,
machine learning, and deep learning models to understand
the performance gap of these models. +e results of this
work should provide scientiﬁc evidence on which model ﬁts
better the marine data. To anticipate the marine features
eﬃciently, the employed deep learning model combines the
gated recurrent units (GRU) with the regular neural net-
work. In the proposed architecture, the GRU layer is pre-
ceded by an input layer and followed by a fully connected
layer. As a result, the predicted values can be produced from
the output layer. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst use of a
GRU model architecture for forecasting SST and SWH.
Besides, four diﬀerent ML models have been utilized in the
current study, namely, Linear Regression (LR), Decision
Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random

6. Conclusions

+e huge advances of ocean observation systems yield a large
amount of marine data. +us, this huge data can be utilized
to train predictive models to forecast future marine data. In
this work, we proposed predicting SST and SWH by
implementing machine learning, deep learning, and statis-
tical techniques models. In turn, a comparison of these three
approaches is conducted on diﬀerent evaluation metrics,
namely, MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R2. +e comparison utilized
a real dataset obtained from the Korea Hydrographic and
Oceanographic Agency. +e simulation results show that the
machine learning models are slightly better than the
implemented deep learning model. +e best model that
predicted the SST was the DTs, while the Linear Regression
model was the best model for SWH forecasting. +e sta-
tistical model (i.e., ARIMA) has been conﬁrmed to have the
worst performance.

Helpful Answer: The paper uses four different evaluation metrics to compare the performance of the deep learning model against the machine learning and statistical models. These metrics include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and R2 score. However, it does not mention using traditional classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall. This suggests that the problem addressed in the paper might be a regression task rather than a classification task. Therefore, the mentioned metrics are more suitable for evaluating the performance of the models in terms of their ability to accurately predict continuous variables like Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Significant Wave Height (SWH).
