cover. The interquartile range for observed: Q1 = 65%, Q2 (median) =
86%, and Q3 = 96%, and predicted: Q1 = 63%–69%, Q2 = 83%–87%,
and Q3 = 88% –91%. The minimum and maximum canopy cover for
observed and all the models are 0% and 100%, respectively. Similarly,
the density of the observed and predicted canopy cover is higher in Q3 as
the violin's shape is expanded in those regions.

tible to overfitting; therefore, it is crucial to address this issue by tuning
the hyperparameters.

For machine learning models, the GARI, GI, GNDVI, GREEN, MSR,
NDVI, RDVI, RED, SI2, and VARIg were selected as described earlier in
the methodology sections. The performance of the models is presented
in Table 6. In the testing dataset, it was observed that all models
demonstrated lower coefficients of determination than the training data,
except for the linear and Enet models. Machine learning algorithms
outperformed linear in modelling forest canopy cover. The LightGBM
exhibited the most substantial model training ability (R2 = 0.69), fol-
lowed by SVM, RF and XGboost, each with an R2 value of 0.66. All six
models yielded satisfactory results with an R2 ≥ 0.58 in training data,
meeting our study's canopy cover prediction criteria. Further evaluation
in independent
test samples, considering additional fit statistics,
XGboost and LightGBM demonstrated superior predictive capabilities
with R2 = 0.64, RMSE = 0.16, rRMSE = 22%, and MAE = 0.12, out-

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the project or task. Some common postprocessing steps include:

1. Model Evaluation: This involves calculating various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC AUC, etc., to evaluate the performance of the trained model. These metrics help determine how well the model has learned from the training data and its generalization capability on unseen data.

2. Hyperparameter Tuning: To improve the model's performance further, one might need to tune the hyperparameters of the chosen algorithm. This step involves selecting different values for the hyperparameters and evaluating their impact on the model's performance using cross-validation techniques.

3. Feature Importance Analysis: Analyzing feature importances helps identify which features contribute significantly towards making accurate predictions. Techniques like permutation feature importance, SHAP values, or LIME can be used for this purpose.

4. Visualizations: Creating visual representations of the model's output, such as confusion matrices, ROC curves, or saliency maps, aids in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the model better. For example, a confusion matrix provides insights into false positives and negatives, while saliency maps highlight important areas within input images responsible for generating certain outputs.

In summary, postprocessing steps after model training typically involve evaluating the model's performance through metric calculations, fine-tuning hyperparameters if necessary, analyzing feature importances, and creating visualizations to gain deeper insights into the model's behavior.
