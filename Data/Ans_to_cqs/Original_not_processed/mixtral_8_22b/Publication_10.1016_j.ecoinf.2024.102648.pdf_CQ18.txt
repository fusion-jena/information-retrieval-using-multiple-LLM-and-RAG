Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

dation sets indicated that the BSF model is the best ML model. This can provide technical support for CLCuD 
prediction under field conditions through the designed graphical user interface and further advocate the timely 
application of management interventions to boost cotton productivity in the region.

Previously,  Mosaffaei  and  Jahani  (2021)  have  been  successful  in 
predicting the bark thickness of ash (Fraxinus excelsior) in urban forests 
using 10 ecological variables through ANN and regression models with 
61.6 and 83% accuracy. Shang and Zhu (2021) have also proposed a 
prediction  model  that  combines  the  genetic  algorithm  and  machine 
learning algorithms- ANN - to forecast the occurrence of insect pests. 
Similarly,  Saffariha  et  al.  (2021)  observed  that  for  the  prediction  of 
hypericin  in  Hypericum  perforatum,  the  ANN  technique  -  multi-layer 
perceptron  (MLP)  had  an  advantage  over  radial  basis  function  (RBF) 
and support vector machine (SVM) in varied ecological and phenolog-
ical conditions of habitat with 87, 80 and 54% accuracy, respectively. 
Hence, we too used the ANN techniques and growing degree days (GDD) 
data (temperature as the most important ecological variable) to reduce

2.7. Early stopping 

It is the process that stops growing additional trees/layers/split when 
further addition of more trees/layers/split does  not improve  the vali-
dation statistic in the case of bootstrap forest and boosted tree methods. 
The  validation  statistic  included  the  (R2)  value  for  a  continuous 
response. In the case of the entire machine learning model early stop-
ping  was  enabled  so  that  the  model  would  not  overfit  the  predicted 
percent CLCuD. To address the inclination of neural networks to overfit 
data, the penalty method was employed within the framework of ANN 
models.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is called early stopping. It is a process that stops growing additional trees/layers/splits when further addition of more trees/layers/splits does not improve the validation statistic. In this case, the validation statistic includes the R^2 value for a continuous response. For the entire machine learning model, early stopping was enabled so that the model would not overfit the predicted percentage of Cotton Leaf Curl Disease (CLCuD). Additionally, to address the tendency of neural networks to overfit data, the penalty method was employed within the framework of artificial neural network (ANN) models.
