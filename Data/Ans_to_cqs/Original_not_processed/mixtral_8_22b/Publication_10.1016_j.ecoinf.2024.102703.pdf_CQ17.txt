Build a three-layer back propagation (BP) artificial neural network 
using MATLAB R2014b (Lin et al., 2021). The first layer (i.e. the input 
layer) corresponded to the aCDOM(254) and Fn(355) respectively. The 
intermediate layer (i.e. hidden layers) and the last layer (i.e. the output 
layer)  comprised  a  single  neuron,  that  corresponded  to  the  predictor 
(TSI). Set the maximum training times to 10,000 and the training error 
to 0.001. 64 water samples were utilized for model calibration, with the 
remaining  used  for  validation.  Validation  accuracy  was  assessed  by 
calculating the coefficient of determination (R2) and root-mean-square 
error (RMSE) between the measured and predicted TSI. The RMSE was 
determined using Eq. (6).

where Mea,TSI is the measured TSI and Pre.TSI is the TSI predicted using 
the neural network model.

Due  to  the  increased  complexity  of  the  interactions  between  vari-
ables,  the  selection  of  important  variables  becomes  challenging.  The 
LASSO model was used for variable selection and statistical regulariza-
tion to enhance the prediction accuracy of the model (Mukherjee et al., 
2019). This model states that the impact of nutrient and environmental 
factors on FDOM varies with trophic state. Previous research conducted 
on the Inner Mongolia Plateau has validated the strong positive corre-
lations between the optical properties of DOM and the TSI, suggesting 
that  DOM  is  influenced  by  nutrient  variation  (Wen  et  al.,  2016). 
Regardless of the trophic state, pH consistently correlates with FDOM, 
with the highest pH values found under light-eutrophic conditions. Prior 
research indicated that pH significantly influences DOM photolysis rates 
and absorbance (Timko et al., 2015). pH is also the environmental driver

To quantify the relative parameter contributions of the parameters to 
the characteristics of DOM, the least absolute shrinkage and selection 
operator (LASSO) model was used to investigate the multicollinearity 
between the variables, and the analysis with lars() took place in the R- 
studio lars package. By imposing a penalty on the size of coefficients, the 
LASSO technique shrinks less important variables’ coefficients to zero, 
thus performing variable selection and allowing for the identification of 
the most relevant variables (Mukherjee et al., 2019). This model used

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the use of specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) model for variable selection and statistical regularization to improve the prediction accuracy of the model. LASSO is a type of regularization method that adds a penalty term to the loss function during optimization, which helps reduce overfitting by constraining the weights of the connections between nodes in the neural network. Although not explicitly mentioned, other common regularization techniques like dropout or L2 regularization could have been employed alongside LASSO to further mitigate overfitting.
