The mixed audio clips are then converted into spectrograms as input 
images for model training. The clips are transformed by applying the 
short-time Fourier transform (STFT) with a window size of 1600 sam-
ples,  hop  size  of  400  samples  (75%  overlap),  and  240  mel-scale  fre-
quency bins.  Each spectrogram thus  has a height  of 438 pixels  and a 
width of 436 pixels (Appendix S1: Fig. S4a).

3.4. Model training and evaluation 

3.4.1. Model training 

We  used  YOLOv5s,  the  smallest  weight  of  YOLOv5,  to  build  the 
sound identification model. The model was trained for 100 epochs with 
32 batch size and the input image dimension 640 × 640. We used default 
data  augmentation  including  scaling,  color  space  adjustments,  and 
Mosaic  augmentation  during  the  training  process.  Under  this  setting, 
four  original  spectrograms  were  randomly  selected,  resized,  cropped, 
color jittered (i.e., changes in hue, saturation and exposure) and then 
merged into one big input image for model training. The model training 
was performed using a workstation equipped with the following speci-
fications: Intel Xeon E5–2660 V4 CPU * 2, DDR4 2400 ECC 16GB RAM * 
8, NVIDIA Titan RTX GPU * 2, and WD black AN1500 4 TB NVMePCIe 
SSD * 2. 

3.4.2. Model inference and test datasets

whole image. Thus, it may minimize the dilution effect and reduce the 
required amount of training data.

The  standardized  recordings  are  then  segmented  into  clips  with  a 
fixed duration. There has to be a trade-off between a short clip which 
may include only part of a sound of some species and a long clip which 
increases  the  requirement  of  computing  time  in  model  training.  We 
segment recordings into 3-s clips because the duration of most sound 
classes in our database is less than 3 s. Kahl et al. (2021) used the same 
clip length in their model for identifying the sounds of 984 bird species 
in North America and Europe.

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the use of diverse datasets can help improve the model's ability to recognize various types of sounds accurately. In this case, the model was trained on a dataset containing different sound classes from a wide range of species. This diversity helps prevent overfitting and improves the model's performance when applied to new or unseen data.

Secondly, data augmentation techniques were employed during the training process. These techniques included scaling, color space adjustments, and Mosaic augmentation. Data augmentation helps increase the variety of training examples available to the model without collecting additional data. By artificially creating new training instances through these methods, the model becomes more robust and better able to handle variations in real-world scenarios.

Thirdly, the model was trained for 100 epochs with a batch size of 32. Training for multiple epochs allows the model to iterate over the entire dataset numerous times, improving its understanding of the patterns within the data. A larger batch size enables the model to learn from more examples simultaneously, potentially leading to faster convergence and improved performance.

Lastly, the model was evaluated using test datasets to assess its accuracy and reliability. Although not explicitly mentioned in the given context, cross-validation or stratified splitting could have been employed during the testing phase to further validate the model's performance across different subsets of the data. However, based solely on the provided information, we cannot confirm whether these specific techniques were utilized.
