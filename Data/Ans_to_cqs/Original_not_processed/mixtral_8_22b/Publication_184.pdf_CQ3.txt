Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

In  order  to  train  the  model,  it  is important to provide not only 
the  class  of  the  object  but  also  the  bounding  box  data  of  the 
object  as  correct  answer.  In  this  context,  we  parsed  the  x,  y 
coordinates, width and height of the fish in the annotation of the 
image’s  dataset.  In  addition,  we  used  data  augmentation  to 
extend the amount of data. 

The  model  has  better  performance  as  number  of  epochs 
increases.  However,  when  number  of  epochs  exceeds  200,  the 
network  seems  to  be  overfitted  to  training  data.  As  a  result, 
Table  I  shows  the  hyper-parameters  used  to  train  and  validate 
the Yolo model.

3.  METHODOLOGY

The data augmentation technique was used in this study, which 
help  to  extend  the  amount  of  information  by  adding  adjusted 
copies of already existing data, and it acts as a  regularizer and 
makes  a  difference  to  reduce  the  overfitting.  While  training, 
before input into the model, each image was randomly sampled 
by  one  of  the  following  options;  the  entire  original  image, 
horizontal  flip,  grayscale,  blur,  noise  and  cropping.  So,  each 
image  was  horizontally  flipped,  grayscale  was  applied  to  25% 
of images, blur was up to 10px, noise was up to 10% of pixels, 
and for the cropping operation, a patch with the same size as the 
original  image  was  randomly  cropped  from  image.  Some 
examples of the data augmentation step are illustrated in Figure 
3.

Helpful Answer:

In the given context, the data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline is bounding box annotation. This technique involves providing not only the class of the object but also the bounding box data of the object as the correct answer. The bounding box data includes the x, y coordinates, width, and height of the object in the image's dataset. In this case, the object being annotated is a fish.

Bounding box annotation is a common technique used in object detection tasks where the goal is to identify the presence and location of objects within an image. It is often used in conjunction with other annotation techniques such as semantic segmentation or instance segmentation, depending on the specific requirements of the task.

Semantic segmentation involves labeling every pixel in an image with its corresponding class label, while instance segmentation involves identifying individual instances of objects within an image and assigning them unique labels. These techniques can be more time-consuming and require more expertise than bounding box annotation, but they can provide more detailed and accurate results.

In summary, the data annotation technique used in the given context is bounding box annotation, which involves providing the class of the object along with its bounding box data as the correct answer. Other annotation techniques such as semantic segmentation and instance segmentation may also be used depending on the specific requirements of the task.
