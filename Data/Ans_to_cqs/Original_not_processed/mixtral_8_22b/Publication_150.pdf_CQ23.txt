by class sample size. We used the SGD (stochastic gradient descent) optimizer with an initial learning rate of 
0.01 for all models except MansNet, which was initially set at 0.1. The learning rate was reduced by a factor of 
10 after steps of 30 epochs. We used batch normalization and models were trained for 150 epochs using Nvidia 
Tesla K80 or P100 GPUs.

Table 1.   Comparison of model size, speed, and performance, ordered by top-1 accuracy. Text in bold indicates 
the best value in each category. Wide-ResNet101 has the highest top-1 accuracy and macro precision but 
was substantially slower than the other models. MnasNet-A1 was the fastest model but had relatively poor 
performance. InceptionV3 was relatively fast while maintaining good model performance with the highest 
precision and second highest accuracy and recall.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The paper does not explicitly mention any specific techniques such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning models. However, they do discuss using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization with an initial learning rate of 0.01 for most models and 0.1 for MnasNet. They also employed batch normalization and trained the models for 150 epochs using Nvidia Tesla K80 or P100 GPUs. Additionally, they mentioned using data augmentation, which can help improve the generalizability of deep learning models by increasing the diversity of training samples.
