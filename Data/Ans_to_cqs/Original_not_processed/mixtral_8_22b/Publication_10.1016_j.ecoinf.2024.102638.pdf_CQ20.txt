hyperparameter optimisation process, the performance metrics detailed 
in Section 2.5 are meticulously evaluated using the designated test set. 
Subsequently, based on the performance metrics obtained, we discern 
and  select  the  most  effective  models  for  each  target  variable.  For  an 
illustrative overview of this model selection process, kindly refer to the 
visual representation provided in Fig. 4.

%Query
Query: "Which hardware resources are used for training the deep learning model (e.g., GPUs, TPUs)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware resources were utilized during the training process.
