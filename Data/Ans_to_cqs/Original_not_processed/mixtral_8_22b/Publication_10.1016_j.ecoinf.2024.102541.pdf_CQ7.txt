where  P r(obj) denotes  the  prediction  accuracy  of  the  bounding  box. 
When  P r(obj) = 1,  the  target  class  falls  within  the  grid;  otherwise, 
P r(obj) = 0.  The  degree  of  overlap  between  the  ground  truth  and 
anticipated bounding box is characterized by a metric called the inter-
section over union (IoU), which is expressed by Eq. (6). 

more efficient and rapidly converging loss function (Zheng et al., 2020). 
EIoU integrates IoU, distance, and aspect ratio losses, directly narrowing 
the width and height discrepancy between the anchors and ground truth 
(gt), thus enhancing positional accuracy. This is achieved using the di-
mensions  of  the  smallest  enclosing  box  (hc 
and  wc)  around  both 
bounding boxes. Eqs. (7) and (8) detail the EIoU loss, maintaining the 
advantageous attributes of CIoU loss.

Understanding  the  computational  cost  and  parameters  of  a  single 
layer allows for precise estimation and control of the total requirements 
of our model. Computational complexity is quantified in FLOPs, calcu-
lated considering the convolutional kernel size (k2), the number of input 
Cin  and output Cout  channels, and the feature map’s height (hout) and 
width  (wout).  FPS  measure  the  model’s  speed,  encompassing  pre-
processing, inference, and non-maximum suppression speeds, providing 
an overall assessment of the model’s efficiency in real-time applications.

Helpful Answer:
The query asks about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as splitting it into train, test, and validation sets. However, none of the given context explicitly mentions these specific criteria or methods for splitting the data. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct answer based solely on the information available.

In general, when working with machine learning models like deep learning networks, data is often divided into three main subsets: training set, validation set, and testing set. The training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set helps tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting during the training process. Lastly, the testing set evaluates the final performance of the trained model. Common practices include random sampling or stratified sampling techniques to maintain similar distributions across all subsets.
