2.2. Machine Learning Prediction Models. Machine learning
includes three main categories, namely, supervised learning
(e.g., classiﬁcation or regression), unsupervised learning
(e.g., clustering or association), and reinforcement learning
(e.g., reward-based). In this work, we focus on the ﬁrst
category of the ML ﬁeld, i.e., supervised learning [17]. +e
ultimate goal of the machine learning ﬁeld is to design
models/programs which enable computer
to
mimic the learning process of human beings from the
available data. Any ML-based system consists of three
components, namely, data, models, and learning. +e main
task of designing an ML system is to ﬁt the data to the
model by tuning the model’s hyperparameters. +is task is
called model training; it is accomplished using hypotheses
based on performance criteria. Hyperparameter optimi-
zation aims to determine the ideal collection of the cor-
responding hyperparameters for a ML model. Identifying

+e proposed work is motivated by comparing the statistical,
machine learning, and deep learning models to understand
the performance gap of these models. +e results of this
work should provide scientiﬁc evidence on which model ﬁts

eﬃciently, the employed deep learning model combines the
gated recurrent units (GRU) with the regular neural net-
work. In the proposed architecture, the GRU layer is pre-
ceded by an input layer and followed by a fully connected
layer. As a result, the predicted values can be produced from
the output layer. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst use of a
GRU model architecture for forecasting SST and SWH.
Besides, four diﬀerent ML models have been utilized in the
current study, namely, Linear Regression (LR), Decision
Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random

4.2. Machine Learning Models. One of the main obstacles
for designing machine learning models is tuning the
hyperparameters of the model. +is is because diﬀerent
hyperparameter values can lead to diﬀerent accuracy levels.
In the proposed system, four machine learning models are
employed, which are Linear Regression, Support Vector
Regression (SVR), Decision Tree (DT), and Random Forest
(RF). Each learning model is subjected to a grid search in
order to achieve the optimal parameter tuning. +e
hyperparameters are essential for being one of the primary
sources that inﬂuence the behaviour of a machine learning
model
in general. Hence, determining the optimal
hyperparameters combination is a critical goal which re-
duces a predeﬁned loss function and produces better
outcomes. For instance, the degree, kernel, epsilon, and
gamma are all adjusted in SVR to reach the highest ac-
curacy. In RF, however, grid search is applied to determine

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model used in this research is not explicitly stated as either classification, segmentation, or detection. However, based on the given information, it appears that the deep learning model is designed for prediction purposes. Specifically, the model is intended to predict the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Significant Wave Height (SWH) for the Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency dataset. This suggests that the model may fall under the category of regression tasks within the broader field of supervised learning. Furthermore, the model employs a unique architecture that combines gated recurrent units (GRUs) with a regular neural network. This indicates that the model is likely designed to handle sequential data, such as time series data, which is common in weather and oceanography datasets. Therefore, while the specific type of deep learning task is not directly mentioned, it can be inferred that the model serves a predictive role in estimating continuous variables related to marine conditions.
