%Query
Query: "What is the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the specific link to resources such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF based on the available information.
