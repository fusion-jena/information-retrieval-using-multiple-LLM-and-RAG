Similarly, in [8] hyper-spectral bottom index imagery is used for bottom-type classiﬁca-
tion in coral reef areas. The drawback of this technique is the need for an enormous number
of samples in the dataset for achieving higher accuracy. In [9], they proposed a method
of deep convolutional neural network VGG-19 for corresponding coral classiﬁcation that
needs a massive dataset for better accuracy.

Helpful Answer:
The paper does not provide information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it mentions that a large amount of data is required for achieving higher accuracy in coral classification using methods like hyper-spectral bottom index imagery and deep convolutional neural networks like VGG-19. This suggests that collecting diverse and representative data could be important for reducing potential biases in the training set. Additionally, the use of various feature extraction techniques like LBP, HOG, LETRIST, GLCM, CJLBP, and LTrP may help reduce bias by capturing different aspects of the input images. But again, the paper does not explicitly discuss any specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing.
