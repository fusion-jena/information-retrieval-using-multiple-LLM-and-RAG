2.3.2.3. ANN: artificial neural networks classification. In classifying with 
the MLP ANN model, we used the package “nnet”, which provides pos-
sibilities for adjusting weighted decay and size, thereby countering the 
effects of model overfitting. We used an MLP ANN architecture with 1 
hidden layer established as a default setting within the “nnet” package, 
and with 6 neurons defined for our model inputs. The number of neurons 
in the input layer was equal to the number of used bands (6), and the 
output  layer  had  8  neurons  (representing  8  LULC  classes).  A  back 
propagation learning algorithm was used during the training phase of 
the model. Size and decay were used to define the primary model tuning 
parameters, and the control () function was used to control for model 
runs. As with the kNN approach, we defined the LULC classes of the test 
datasets  as  target  variables  and  the  band  reflectance  values  as  pre-

Control() function helped to evaluate these tuning parameters for model 
performance. Table S3 shows the parameterization settings (i.e. model 
type,  number  of  tuning  parameters/iterations,  tuning  methods  and

and  Kappas,  2017).  The  kNN  model  is  a  non-parametric  model  that 
performs  LULC  classification  based  on  the  distance  between  k  closest 
samples drawn from training datasets. The approach depends on thor-
ough image (predictor) pre-processing so as to reduce sampling bias and 
ensure equal treatment of predictors when computing distance (Kuhn 
and Johnson, 2016). The SVM model uses support vectors (i.e. based on 
a subset of training data points closest to decision boundaries) to locate 
optimal decision boundaries that separate two LULC classes (Cortes and 
Vapnik, 1995; Kuhn and Johnson, 2016). The ANN model is a mathe-
matical model developed as an analogy of the human brain. Using an 
interconnected  group  of  responsive  and  conducting  nodes,  the  ANN 
model  mimics,  in  a  very  simplified  fashion,  the  functionality  of  the 
human brain for knowledge acquisition, recall, synthesis and problem

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. It only discusses the use of the "nnet" package for building an MLP ANN model with one hidden layer containing six neurons, using a backpropagation learning algorithm. The model's hyperparameters, such as size and decay, are adjusted to prevent overfitting. However, there is no mention of how the trained model is deployed or serialized for further use. Therefore, I cannot provide specific details regarding the deployment process.
