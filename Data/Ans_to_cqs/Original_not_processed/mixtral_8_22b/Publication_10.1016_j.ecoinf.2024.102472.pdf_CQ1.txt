During  the  MLPNN  training  phase,  initial  arbitrary  connection 
weights were assigned. Inputs were forward-fed from the input to the 
hidden  layer.  Hidden  neurons  multiplied  inputs  by  weights,  summed 
products,  and  processed  sums  through  a  transfer  function.  Results 
propagated  to  the  output  layer,  with  output  values  compared  to  ex-
pected  values  for  error  computation.  Iterative  error  back-propagation 
adjusted  connection  weights  until  reaching  a  target  minimal  error. 
The network then accurately estimated carbon stocks for both training 
and new input data without training data. This required tests to deter-
mine optimal learning rate (0.01), momentum (0.18), and training it-
erations  (500).  The  trained  network  was  subsequently  used  for  feed- 
forward predictions on continuous spatial data. 

2.5.2. Optimal predictor variable selection

adjusted to optimize the model (Jafarzadeh et al., 2021). Whereas node- 
size  determines  the  smallest  number  of  observations  in  a  tree  subset 
terminal node, and default value is always at 1 (Jafarzadeh et al., 2021; 
Pham et al., 2018). Gradient boosting iteration is a repetition process of 
increasing  or  decreasing  weights  in  a  training  datasets  (Huang  et  al., 
2022). All hyperparameters were tuned with a grid search method.

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer some possible methods based on the mentioned studies and their applications.

In general, remote sensing techniques are widely used for gathering data related to land cover, vegetation, and other environmental factors. These techniques often involve utilizing various types of satellite or airborne sensors, such as optical sensors (e.g., Landsat 8 OLI, Sentinel-2) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems. Some examples include Wang et al.'s study on estimating natural forest biomass using an artificial neural network and remote sensing data, and Domingues et al.'s research on integrating multispectral and SAR data for predicting eucalyptus biomass.

Additionally, field surveys may be conducted to collect ground truth data, which can help validate and improve the accuracy of models developed using remote sensing data. For instance, Douwes et al.'s Buffelsdraai Landfill Site Community Reforestation Project might have involved field surveys to gather relevant data.

Publicly available datasets could also serve as sources of raw data for deep learning pipelines. While not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, these datasets can provide valuable information for various applications, including those related to forest biomass estimation and carbon sequestration.
