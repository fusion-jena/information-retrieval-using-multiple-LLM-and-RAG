where P(D) represents perplexity, D represents the test set in the corpus, 
M represents the number of texts, Nd  represents the number of words in 
text  d,  wd  represents  the  words  in  text  d,  and  p(wd) represents  the 
probability of the occurrence of the word wd  in text d. Sk  represents the 
intensity of the kth topic, and p(θkd) represents the probability of topic k 
appearing in text d. We used Python’s pyLDAvis Library to cluster and 
visualize  topics  in  tweets  involving  contaminated  sites.  The  pyLDAvis 
interface  displays  the  ranking  of  keywords  related  to  each  topic,  for 
which relevance was determined by λ  and could be adjusted between 
0 and 1. The setting λ = 1 indicates ranking themes by frequency, and 
the setting λ = 0 indicates ranking themes based on uniqueness.
