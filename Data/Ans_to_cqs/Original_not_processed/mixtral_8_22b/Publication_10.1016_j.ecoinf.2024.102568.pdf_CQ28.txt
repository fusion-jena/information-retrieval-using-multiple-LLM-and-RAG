4.1. Database structure 

The structure of the database for storing information related to the 
air quality sensors and the legal stations is shown in Fig. 3. The data 
model  was  implemented  following  the  standard  “ISO  19156:2011 
Geographic  information  -  Observations  and  Measurements”  (ISO 
(2011))  and  the  TAQE  model  defined  for  Traffic  and  Air  Quality  Ap-
plications in Smart Cities by Martínez et al. (2022). The database is a 
PostgreSQL database with PostGIS extension to handle geospatial data 
and Timescale extension to make SQL scalable for time-series data (i.e., 
sensor measurements). 

At each moment, every device is described by a status and is located 
at a specific point in the city. The status changes when a device is moved 
from one location to another to collect measurements in the new loca-

In  this  paper,  we  present  HypeAIR,  a  novel  framework  for  LCAQ 
sensor  calibration  based  on  co-location  to  simplify  and  automatically 
manage  the  calibration  process;  the  framework  is  open-source,  easily 
adaptable  to  different  sensors  and  pollutants,  and  enables  real-time 
hyper-local  AQ  monitoring.  We  propose  two  methodologies  for  cali-
bration embedded in HypeAIR: one based on a combination of machine 
learning algorithms that consider the time dependency of observations, 
and one based on the deep learning algorithm Long Short-Term Memory 
(LSTM)  that  was  not  previously  employed  for  LCAQ  calibration.  We 
define an approach to evaluate the performance of the methodologies 
taking into account the life cycle of sensors and the context (e.g., tem-
perature, humidity) in which the observations are collected. Then, we 
compare  the  two  methodologies  for  real-time  sensor  calibration  to

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available from the given context to determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. The text only mentions that the database is a PostgreSQL database with PostGIS extension to handle geospatial data and Timescale extension to make SQL scalable for time-series data. It does not provide any details about where or how the deep learning model was deployed.
