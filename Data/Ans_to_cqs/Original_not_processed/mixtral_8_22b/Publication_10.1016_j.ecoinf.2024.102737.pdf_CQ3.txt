2. on the other hand, a practically reasonable pipeline for recognition
can be achieved despite the problem specification challenges, using a
careful examination of different factors, such as pose handling, while
bearing some surprises to the Computer Vision community, e.g., the
advantage of a feature-extraction enhancement (avoiding data
augmentation) over using augmentation techniques.

Preprocessing the input instead of relying on data augmentation is a
preferred way with significantly better results, seemingly by-passing the
difficulty of the Siamese network to learn similarity in the presence of so
few examples. It could be, however, that there is still a better way to by-
pass this difficulty but also exploit the power of augmentations.

performance of a fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and
showed that the CNN outperforms the traditional classification methods.
Salman et al., (2016) compared traditional classification methods such
as SVM, k-Nearest Neighbours (K(cid:0) NN), and Sparse Representation
Classifier with CNN. They achieve an average classification rate of more
than 90% on the LifeCLEF14 (Joly et al., 2014) and LifeCLEF15 (Joly
et al., 2015) fish datasets using CNN and generally a significantly lower
rate using the traditional methods. Siddiqui et al., (2017) reaches clas-
sification accuracy of 94.3% performance on fish species classification
using a very deep CNN with a cross-layer pooling approach for enhanced
discriminative ability to handle the limited labeled training data prob-
lem. Nepovinnykh et al., (2018) examine two methods of Saimaa ringed
seal identification based on transfer learning: retraining of an existing
convolutional neural network (CNN) versus using the CNN trained for

Still there are issues that should be considered before a specific
detailed framework can be designed. In order to decide on a feature
extraction and recognition detailed steps framework,12 initial experi-
ments were performed on the individuals labeled database. Since we
study a task that has not been studied before, we explore different as-
pects and several directions to tackle them, which naturally, most of
them are abandoned after evaluating the results. Nevertheless, these
initial experiments are important as a base case to study the conditions
that improve the performance, which is the focus of this paper. Based on
the literature survey our initial experiments referred to the following
issues to be decided for the chosen framework: architecture, data
augmentation usage, feature extraction enhancement and handling
different poses. The evaluation of the initial experiments results then
guided our design of the follow-up experiments. The initial experiments,

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that preprocessing the input instead of relying on data augmentation is a preferred way with significantly better results. This suggests that the authors might have focused on improving the quality of the original dataset rather than generating new samples through data augmentation techniques like rotation, scaling, or flipping.

Moreover, the context discusses the use of a fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and compares its performance with traditional classification methods such as SVM, k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), and Sparse Representation Classifier. These methods often require labeled data for training, implying that some form of data annotation was likely used. However, the exact technique (bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, etc.) remains unspecified in the provided context.

Additionally, the context refers to studies that achieved high classification rates on fish datasets using CNNs. While these studies do not directly mention the data annotation techniques employed, they suggest that the datasets may have included labeled images of individual fish species, possibly involving object detection or semantic segmentation techniques during the annotation process.

In conclusion, although the given context does not explicitly state the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it implies that some form of labeling was involved due to the use of supervised machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, the preference for preprocessing the input over data augmentation indicates a potential emphasis on enhancing the original dataset's quality.
