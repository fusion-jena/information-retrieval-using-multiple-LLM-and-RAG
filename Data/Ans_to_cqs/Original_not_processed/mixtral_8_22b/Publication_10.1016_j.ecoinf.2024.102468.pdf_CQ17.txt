WT-HMM using varying dataset sizes over 10 runs.

techniques may enhance classification performance.

Furthermore,  the  comparison  between  recording  months  provides 
valuable insights into the tradeoffs  associated with dataset size  selec-
tion. The superior performance of the WT-HMM in the 8 to 20-h dataset 
size  range  for  both  months  suggests  the  most  suitable  range  for 
achieving  high  accuracy.  This  finding  resonates  with  studies  empha-
sizing the importance of selecting appropriate sample sizes for effective 
model training (Kahl et al., 2021).

The effect of varying dataset sizes on the proposed WT-HMM clas-
sification performance during training and testing is investigated. The 
data subsets, ℓ contain different period of times that include both calls 
and  other  sounds,  which  could  contribute  to  false  positives.  For  the 
Balleny Island 2015 site-year, the dataset from April is randomly divided 
into subsets of ℓ = 5, 10, 15, and 20 h of recordings, while the dataset 
from  May  is  randomly  splitted  to  subsets  of  ℓ = 2,  4,  6,  and  8  h  re-
cordings.  The  WT-HMM  algorithm  involves  random  sampling  during 
training and therefore, the experiment is performed 10 times (i.e. over 
10 runs). For each experimental run, 75% of the dataset subset is utilized 
for training the model, while the remaining 25% of the subset is input 
into  the  trained  WT-HMM  to  assess  the  classification  performance.

Helpful Answer:
Answer: The given context does not provide information about the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses the use of varying dataset sizes and their impact on the performance of a wavelet transform hidden Markov model (WT-HMM) classifier. It also mentions the division of datasets into subsets for training and testing purposes, along with the utilization of 75% of the dataset subset for training the model and the remaining 25% for evaluating its classification performance. Unfortunately, there is no mention of any regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization in this context.
