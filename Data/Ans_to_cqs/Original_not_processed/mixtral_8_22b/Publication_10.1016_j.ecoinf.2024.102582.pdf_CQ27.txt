5.4. Limitations and future studies 

Due to the limitations of data sources and classification methods (Jia 
et al., 2023), this may largely affect the in-deep understanding of various 
mangrove species status in China and globally. In addition, although this 
study  discussed  the  effects  of  governmental  policies  on  long-term 
mangrove  evolution,  it  was  still  difficult  to  quantify  the  contribution 
rate of policies on mangrove conservation and restoration. Future dis-
cussion  and  in-deep  study  of  quantifiable  policy  factors  as  well  as 
improved  image  resolution  and  machine  learning  approaches  toward 
accurate identification of mangrove species will be great significance for 
dynamic monitoring and evaluation of mangrove interspecies evolution. 

6. Conclusions

2000 to 2008. Generally, government understanding of the importance 
of coastal environment protection has lagged behind economic devel-
opment, resulting in a large reduction in mangrove forest.

%Query
Query: "What process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model (e.g., Model serialization, Platform selection)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not contain information about the deployment process of any specific deep learning model. However, common practices for deploying a trained deep learning model include model serialization, which involves saving the model architecture and weights into a file or database, and selecting a suitable platform for hosting the deployed model, such as cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure. Other considerations during deployment might involve optimizing the model for performance, ensuring scalability, and integrating with existing systems or APIs.
