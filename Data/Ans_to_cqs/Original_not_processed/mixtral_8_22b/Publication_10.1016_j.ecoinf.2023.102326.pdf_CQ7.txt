However,  although  research  on  the  urban  AE  gained  traction  in 
recent years, sophisticated methods to quantify its complex properties 
on  a  larger  scale  are  still  scarce.  This  is  especially  true  for  big  audio 
datasets, which are so extensive that listening to the files becomes no 
longer  feasible.  To  date,  few  approaches  have  been  used  to  quantify 
large datasets of the urban AE. Classical approaches reach their limits 
when  it  comes  to  analyzing  longer  recording  periods  (e.g.  several 
months) (Gage et al., 2017). In recent years, sound event classification 
using  machine  learning  approaches  became  more  popular  (Phillips 
et al., 2018; Sethi et al., 2022; Stowell et al., 2019; Ulloa et al., 2018), 
but is still not ready to be deployed unconfined (Alcocer et al., 2022). In 
psychoacoustics, mostly smaller field studies have been conducted (Hall 
et  al.,  2013;  Ma  et  al.,  2021;  Montoya-Belmonte  and  Navarro,  2020;

Fig. C1. 95% Bootstrap intervals of the average shortest path length (ASPL) for each hour by device. For each hour per device, 100 Bootstrap samples were build and 
the 97.5 and 2.5 quantiles of the ASPL values were calculated.

To retrieve information about the frequency spectrum, we calculate a 
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for all recordings of our dataset, sort the 
values into 1024 equally sized bins (from 0 to 22,050 Hz; bin width =
21.5  Hz;  no  spectral  weighting)  and  average  the  values  energetically 
inside each bin (Haselhoff et al., 2022a). As the magnitude of variability 
broadly differs between low and high frequencies, we align them by a 
log-transformation.  Following  previous  research, we  focus on  the  fre-
quency range from 0 to 13 kHz, as frequencies above 13 kHz are only 
rarely  occupied  in  the  urban  AE  (Bradfer-Lawrence  et  al.,  2019; 
Haselhoff et al., 2022a).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information regarding the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (train, test, validation). However, common practices include splitting the data randomly or stratified based on specific features such as land use type or time of day. The typical ratios used for this purpose are 70/15/15 (training/validation/testing) or 80/10/10. Without further details, it cannot be determined if these standard practices were followed in this case.
