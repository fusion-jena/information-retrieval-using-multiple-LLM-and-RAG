The  parameter  selection  was  performed  by  minimizing  the  mean 
squared  error.  The parameter  settings  of the  MLP  model are  listed  in 
Table 2.

The  successful  prediction  is  also  attributed  to  the  robust  deep 
learning models. Lamichhane et al. (2019) reviewed soil carbon map-
ping methods and reported that deep learning is a promising technique 
for improving SOC prediction. The emphasis on deep learning has also 
been noted by Wadoux et al. (2019), who used this technique to predict 
soil  C.  They  found  that  the  deep  learning  technique  significantly 
increased  prediction  accuracy.  In  addition  to  SOC  prediction,  some 
recent studies have used deep learning in the field of ecological infor-
matics and  demonstrated the  ability of this technique  to improve the 
prediction  of  ecological  components  such  as  forest  vegetation  cover 
(Kalinaki  et  al.,  2023)  and  agriculture-related  elements  (Attri  et  al., 
2023).  According  to  them,  deep  learning  has  the  potential  to  be  a 
valuable technique for ecological analysis.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given information, there isn't enough detail to provide a specific answer about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the researchers utilized TensorFlow and Keras, which are popular libraries for building and training deep learning models. These tools offer functionalities for saving or serializing models after training, which can then be loaded and deployed on various platforms. For instance, serialized models can be deployed on cloud platforms like Google Cloud ML Engine or AWS Sagemaker, or they can be integrated into web applications or mobile apps. Nevertheless, without explicit details regarding the deployment process, these possibilities remain speculative.
