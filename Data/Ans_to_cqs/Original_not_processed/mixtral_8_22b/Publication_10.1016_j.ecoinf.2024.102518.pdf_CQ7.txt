feature class as ‘L', ‘Q', ‘LQ', ‘LQP’, and set the regularization multiplier 
from 0.5 to 5, using the delta in the Akaike minimum information cri-
terion (delta.AICc) as the metric to determine the best tuning parame-
ters. The optimal model is the one with the minimum delta.AICc value 
(delta.AICc = 0), and a model with delta.AICc <2 is considered credible 
(Phillips et al., 2017). The Continuous Boyce Index (CBI)(Hirzel et al., 
2006) was employed in addition to the Area under the Receiver Oper-
ating Characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) because AUC-ROC is not reliable 
when  obtaining  true  absences  is  challenging  (Jim´enez  and  Sober´on, 
2020). The final optimal parameters were identified as the feature class 
‘LQP’ and a regularization multiplier of 3.5 (Fig. A.2). The mean AUC- 
ROC  stands  at 95.5%,  while the  average  CBI  index  for the  validation 
dataset is 82.6%.

cross-validation. The threshold was derived from the average output of 
the five models. Nine algorithms—Bioclim, Mahalanobis, Domain, GLM 
(gaussian),  GLM  (binomial),  GLM  (poisson),  MaxEnt,  Random  Forest, 
and SVM—were evaluated using AUC-ROC and Cohen's KAPPA metrics. 
Our analysis revealed that MaxEnt emerged as the most suitable model, 
striking  a  commendable  balance  between  accuracy  and  robustness 
(Fig. A.1).

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit details about how the data was split for deep learning model training into train, test, or validation sets. However, it mentions that cross-validation was performed, which typically involves splitting the dataset into multiple subsets, where each subset serves as the testing set once, while the remaining subsets form the training set. This process is repeated until all subsets have been used as the testing set. Additionally, the text states that the threshold was derived from the average output of five models, suggesting that some form of ensemble method might have been applied during the training phase.
