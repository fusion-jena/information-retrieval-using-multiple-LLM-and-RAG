field-collected data and machine learning methods on developing AGB 
models.  Moreover,  the  quality  of  training  samples  and  the  layout  of 
sampling  points  are  crucial  for  constructing  accurate  and  reliable 
models for biomass estimation (Morais et al., 2021). In this study, owing 
to  the  insufficiency  of  high-quality  training  samples,  we  employed  a 
method with low data dependency that integrates forest inventory data 
with remote sensing imagery for biomass estimation.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, some commonly used optimization techniques in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp), and others. These techniques help minimize the loss function during model training by adjusting the weights and biases of the neural network. Without further details from the authors or their codebase, it is impossible to determine which optimization technique was used in this particular study.

Based on the provided context, the study focuses on estimating forest biomass using a method that integrates forest inventory data with remote sensing imagery. The authors mention employing a method with low data dependency due to insufficient high-quality training samples. They also discuss the importance of the quality of training samples and the layout of sampling points for constructing accurate and reliable models for biomass estimation. However, there is no explicit mention of any optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
