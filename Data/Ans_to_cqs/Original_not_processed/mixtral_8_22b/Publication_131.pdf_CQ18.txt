of the entire training dataset) and a batch size (number of samples uti-lized in one training iteration) equal to 32. For the second network, the best training was achieved with six epochs and, again, a batch size equal to 32. For both networks, the initial learning rate [30] with 0.001 and the “adam” optimizer [31] were the parameters used in the training process. 3. Results 3.1. CPS Performance Several factors were considered in evaluating the CPS. First, at the level of data transport communication, a comparison between two paradigms was carried out. The central paradigm is based on sending the audio record from an IoT node to its digital twin at the cyber system side, where it is processed. The distributed paradigm is based on pro-cessing the audio record in the IoT node and sending the obtained result to its digital twin, where it is delivered to the central processing entity. Considering a 5-second audio regis-ter recorded with a sample rate of 44.1 kHz and 32 bits per sample

the network is trained with the data collected from sensor nodes (audio wave). In this
stage, human supervision is needed to identify every output with its correct pattern. In the
second stage, the network is run with the trained supervised neural network.

On the cyber system side, implementation was based on a workstation with an AMD
Threadripper Pro 3955WX processor with 32 GB RAM and GPU NVIDIA Quadro P620,
running Windows 10 Pro. The communication between the cyber and the physical system
was made using the TCP/IP protocol. A Python application was designed to train the
CNN based on a selected dataset. This cyber system is responsible for interacting with a
ﬁnal user (biologist) who is responsible for ordering the new trainings of the CNNs and
new updates of the trained CNNs on the physical nodes or on their digital twins to carry
out simulations or cooperative classiﬁcations.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, we can infer some details regarding the training process. The training was conducted using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), with different numbers of epochs for each network - three epochs for the first network and six epochs for the second network. Both networks had a batch size of 32. The initial learning rate was set to 0.001, and the 'adam' optimizer was utilized. These settings suggest that the model performance might have been monitored through metrics such as loss and accuracy, which are typically evaluated after each epoch during the training process. Additionally, early stopping could be employed to prevent overfitting by monitoring the validation loss and stopping the training when the performance stops improving. Nevertheless, without specific information about the monitoring strategy, these assumptions remain speculative.
