A landmark architecture for deep learning winning ILSVRC
2012 challenge (31).
Network in Network (NiN) is one of the ﬁrst architectures
harnessing innovative 1 × 1 convolutions (49) to provide
more combinational power to the features of a convolutional
layers (49).
An architecture that is deeper (i.e., has more layers of
neurons) and obtains better performance than AlexNet
by using effective 3 × 3 convolutional ﬁlters (26).
This architecture is designed to be computationally efﬁcient
(using 12 times fewer parameters than AlexNet) while offering
high accuracy (50).
The winning architecture of the 2016 ImageNet competition
(25). The number of layers for the ResNet architecture can be
different. In this work, we try 18, 34, 50, 101, and 152 layers.

Helpful Answer:
Regularization methods are techniques used to prevent overfitting in deep learning models. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the noise or random fluctuations in the training data instead of the underlying patterns, leading to poor generalization to new data. Two common regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline are dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to prevent complex co-adaptations between neurons. By ignoring some neurons, the model becomes less sensitive to any single input feature and thus reduces overfitting. Dropout is typically applied to fully connected layers but can also be used in convolutional and recurrent layers.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function based on the sum of squared weights. This encourages smaller weights, making the model simpler and reducing its capacity to fit noise in the training data. L2 regularization is often used in combination with other regularization techniques such as early stopping and data augmentation.

Other regularization methods include L1 regularization, which penalizes the absolute value of the weights, and max norm constraints, which limit the maximum size of the weights. Additionally, batch normalization, which standardizes the inputs to each layer, can help reduce overfitting by improving the stability of the optimization process.

In summary, regularization methods such as dropout and L2 regularization are essential tools for preventing overfitting in deep learning pipelines. These techniques help to improve the generalization of models to new data by limiting their complexity and sensitivity to individual input features.
