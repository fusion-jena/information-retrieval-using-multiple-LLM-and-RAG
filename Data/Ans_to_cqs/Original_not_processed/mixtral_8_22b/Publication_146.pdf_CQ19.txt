Model training was carried out on a NVIDIA Quadro M4000 GPU with 8 GB of memory,
with a training time of 4.9 min per epoch. With the adaptive learning rate algorithms usually yielding
higher model accuracies than static ones [16], the Adam learning rate optimizer was chosen over the
static stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Both the basic SGD and its further adaptive developments are
popular in neural network applications [17], but given the ﬁndings of [18,19], which proved Adam’s
usefulness on relatively small datasets (less than 1000 images), the Adam optimizer is chosen for
the model of this study. Hyperparameter setting was completed based on studies who successfully
implemented Yolo in remote sensing cases. The author of the Yolo-based “Yolt” model [14] suggests
implementing the same hyperparameters as the Yolo model. The default parameters of YoloV3 are
0.001, 0.9 and 0.0005 for the learning rate momentum and weight decay, respectively, and we decided

1. Introduction

Due to the lack of existing quality data, we set out to create our own data set for the purpose of
the project. The data set created is, in a deep learning context, still at a relatively small size. However,
testing the model under very diﬃcult circumstances and complex backgrounds still yielded good
detection capabilities, paving the way for future work.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention which specific deep learning framework was used to build the model. However, it can be inferred from the reference to the paper "[18]" by Taqi et al. that TensorFlow might have been used since they discuss the use of TensorFlow Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) performance. Additionally, the keyword "YoloV3" indicates that YOLO (You Only Look Once) version 3 was employed for object detection tasks. While YOLO itself is not a deep learning framework, it is often implemented using popular frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Therefore, without explicit information, one cannot definitively state whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or another framework was utilized.
