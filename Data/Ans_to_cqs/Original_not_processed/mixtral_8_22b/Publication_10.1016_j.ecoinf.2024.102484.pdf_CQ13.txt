Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Where  q  is  the  factor's  influencing  power  (q∈[0,1]),  N  and  Nh 
represent the numbers of sample units in the whole area and sub-area, 
respectively, and h = 1, 2…. L, σ2, and σh  are the sum number of sec-
ondary regions, the sum variance over the region, and the sum of the 
sample's  variance  in  sub-region  h,  respectively.  SSW  and  SST  repre-
sented  the  sum  of  squares  of  different  levels  in  the  study  region, 
respectively.
