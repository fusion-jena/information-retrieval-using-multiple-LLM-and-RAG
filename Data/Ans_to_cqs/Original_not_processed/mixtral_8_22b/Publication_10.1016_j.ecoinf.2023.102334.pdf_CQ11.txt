In the above formula, the number of samples in a batch, the number 
of sample classes, the cosine factor, the cosine interval, the angle be-
tween the feature and the target weight, the angle between the feature, 
and the non-target weight are all denoted by the letters n, C, s, m, θyi , 
and θj, respectively. The network can concentrate its expressive power to

6.1. Vision transformer 

Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), which is a deep neural network 
first created for natural language processing (NLP), was built on a self- 
attention mechanism that makes it possible for noticeably huge recep-
tive  fields.  The Transformer  has become  a  de facto industry  standard 
procedure in NLP because of its remarkable efficiency, and it has also 
motivated  researchers  in  the  field  of  computer  vision  to  investigate 
applications  by  utilizing  the  long-term  relationships  between  pixels 
(Khan et al., 2022).

ViT  is the  first significant effort to employ  a  pure Transformer on 
pictures directly, showing that it can totally replace the conventional 
convolution processes with SOTA performance. The training of the va-
nilla ViT model, however, necessitates high computing costs, according 
to  the  experimental  findings.  As  a  result,  the  utilization  of  a  hybrid 
design  that  couples  the  Transformer  with  a  CNN  backbone  (such  as 
ResNet)  is  advocated  here.  The  Transformer  may  concentrate  on 
modelling global attention using the feature that ResNet extracted. Ac-
cording to the experimental findings, the hybrid approach can deliver 
better performance with comparatively less computing work. The main 
objective of this work was to create a model that accurately identifies 
sika deer using the idea.
