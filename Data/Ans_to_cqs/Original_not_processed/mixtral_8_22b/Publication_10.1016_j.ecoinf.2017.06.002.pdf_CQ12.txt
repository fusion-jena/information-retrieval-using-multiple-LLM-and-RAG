start, middle, or end of the sampling period), 3) data processing level
with related processing approaches (e.g. raw, translated/processed,
data originator QA/QC, project-level QA/QC), 4) references to the
measurement setting description (e.g., E-ﬁeld Log ﬁle)—this informa-
tion is essential because it links the data to additional metadata re-
ported in the separate templates described in Section 3.3 (see
Fig. 2)—, and 5) references to data ﬁle descriptions (Data Column
Description).

temporal scales to answer a science question or to generate model in-
puts. Prior to synthesis, each observation must be quality checked,
processed (e.g., units transformed, gap-ﬁlled, erroneous data ﬂagged or
removed), and organized in standardized, comparable formats (e.g.,
variable names, units). An example of a synthesized data product is the
FLUXNET2015 dataset, which includes data collected at sites from a
network of single-locale, eddy covariance towers that monitor an eco-
system over many years (FLUXNET, 2016). In addition to ecosystem
and global scale datasets, earth system science requires syntheses of
individual-based measures like point observations of leaf carbohydrate
content, continuous tree sap ﬂow, and demography censuses (e.g.,
Walker et al., 2014). Physical measures, such as meteorological ob-
servations, measurements of soil water content, and 3D structural re-
presentations (e.g., LiDAR), are also needed (e.g., Hunter et al., 2015;
Powell et al., 2013).

Language (EML; Michener et al., 1997; EML Project, 2009). Data in-
formation models built upon these standards describe content data and
metadata standard formats and relationships, and are easily converted
to searchable relational databases (Horsburgh et al., 2016). Data in-
formation models suitable for environmental data include Morpho
(NCEAS, 2015) that is designed to interface smoothly with EML, and the
Observational Data Model 2 (ODM2; Horsburgh et al., 2016). Data in-
formation models support a wide range of data types and enable data
search, discovery, and synthesis. However, these models still require
that additional standard data collection and naming protocols be de-
ﬁned and that metadata for both observations as well as modeled
products be collected in a standardized way before it can be ingested
into the searchable database. Moreover, these models require the data
originator to be proﬁcient in data science terminology or concepts, and

%Query
Query: "What type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide information about what type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine if a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Transformer, or any other deep learning model is being utilized.
