The  mini-batch  size  is  user-adjustable  (typically  in  binary-number 
increments,  e.g.  2,  4,  8,  16,  32,  etc.)  depending  on  the  data  set.  Too 
small  a  mini-batch  size  may  provide  insufficient  image  data  for  the 
network  to  meaningfully  learn from  some or  all  of  the  classes  within 
each iteration, while too large a mini-batch size may cause the network 
to  overfit  to  the  training  images.  Because  of  the  high  computational 
complexity  of  the  deep  learning  process,  the  mini-batch  size  is  ulti-
mately limited by the amount of memory available to the GPU (in our 
case 8 GB), factoring in the size of the images (in our case 224 × 224 
pixels × 3 bands) and the number of internal parameters in the network 
(25.6 million in the case of ResNet-50). Thus, we were limited to mini-

the  first  fork  in  the  network.  These  are  the  layers  that  are  trained  to 
extract the lowest-level features of images and objects. Freezing them 
prevents  their  internal  parameters  from  being  adjusted  during  fine- 
tuning,  such  that  their  highly  robust  and  versatile  feature  extraction 
capacity  pre-trained  on  >1  million  images  was  not  weakened  by  our 
comparatively limited training set. 

3. Results

The  diversity  of  considerations  and  possibilities  for  improvement 
highlights another general challenge of using deep learning at present: 
as a still-burgeoning technology, optimized or standardized approaches 
for different analysis tasks are not yet well-established, so the range of 
possibilities  can  seem  overwhelming,  especially  to  non-expert  users. 
Even the basic training options, some of which are listed in Table 1, are 
numerous and highly technical. A sensible approach is to initially set 
options based on a review of published studies involving similar analysis 
tasks,  then  attempt  to  refine  certain  settings  through  trial  and  error. 
However,  it  should  also  be  noted  that  the  computationally  laborious 
process of training a CNN (several hours to several days of background 
processing) imposes a practical limit on the extent of trial and error that 
can  be  undertaken.  Nevertheless,  deep  learning  is  now  clearly  over-

2.2. Deep learning tools, principles and practicalities 

We  performed  all  deep  learning-related  operations  in  MATLAB 
2020b  (MathWorks  Inc.,  Natick,  MA,  USA)  equipped  with  the  Image 
Processing,  Computer  Vision,  Deep  Learning,  and  Parallel  Computing 
toolboxes. CNN training and image classification operations were pro-
cessed  on a  GeForce RTX  2070 Super  graphics processing  unit (GPU) 
(Nvidia Corp., Santa Clara, CA, USA) with 8 GB of memory. 

As the foundation of our CNN for detecting polar bears, we used the 
freely available residual network ResNet-50 (He et al., 2016), which has 
been  pre-trained  on  >1  million  images  from  the  ImageNet  database 
(http://www.image-net.org)  to  recognize  1000  categories  of  common 
objects,  including  numerous  animals.  Although  the  vast  majority  of 
these images are of an entirely different nature and/or visual perspective

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not explicitly mention any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does discuss the use of a pre-trained ResNet-50 model for object detection, specifically for identifying polar bears. This implies that some form of labeled data was likely used to train this model, but the exact method of labeling (bounding boxes, polygons, semantic segmentation, etc.) remains unspecified in the provided information.
