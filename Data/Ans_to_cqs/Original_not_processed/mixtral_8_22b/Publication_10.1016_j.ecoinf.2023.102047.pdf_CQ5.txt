0.3464  on  the  ECUHO-1  and  ECUHO-2  datasets  respectively.  More 
recently, Noman et al. (Noman et al., 2021b) proposed using Faster R- 
CNN with the NASNet model and achieved the highest mAP of 0.291 and 
0.412 on these H. ovalis datasets respectively.

Our proposed detector-2 was based on EfficientDet-B7. EfficientDet 
frameworks are well optimised with the input image sizes of 512, 640, 
768,  896,  1024,  1280,  1280,  and  1536  for  the  family  network 
EfficientDet-D0 to EfficientDetD7, respectively. These optimised image 
sizes achieved the highest accuracy on the ImageNet dataset. We set up 
the model config file with a class number 1, image size of 1536 × 1536, 
batch size of 16, initial learning rate of 2e3, momentum optimiser value 
of 0.5 and step number of 400,000. We also monitored the validation 
loss  using  early  stopping  during  training  for  every  epoch.  We 
consciously monitored the validation accuracy to stop overfitting and 
overtraining  with  a  patience  of  20.  We  have  used  TensorFlow  object 
detection  API.  First,  we  downloaded  the  pre-trained  EfficientDet-D7 
model weight from the TensorFlow-2 object detection model zoo page.

image,  and  the  produced  feature  maps  are  cropped  upon  the  object 
proposal. An RoI pooling layer is applied to extract a fixed length vector. 
This  feature  vector  is  processed  through  fully  connected  networks  to 
predict class probabilities and refine the bounding boxes. Faster R-CNN 
(Ren et al., 2015) is the most popular object detection algorithm. In the 
Faster R-CNN model, the input images are fed into a CNN, which pro-
duces feature maps from the input images. A different neural network, 
RPN, is applied to predict the candidate bounding boxes. RoI pooling 
layers are applied to reshape the inputs. These properties render these 
two-stage  detectors  superior  to  one-stage  detectors.  Among  the  two- 
stage  detector,  EfficientDet  (Tan  et  al.,  2020)  architecture  is  gaining 
popularity owing to its excellent detection performance as  well as its 
relatively lower FLOPS (floating point operations per second) than in 
other object detection models.

Helpful Answer:
The text mentions several datasets used in the deep learning pipelines. The first dataset mentioned is the ECUHO-1 and ECUHO-2 datasets, which were used by Noman et al. (2021b). Another dataset mentioned is the ImageNet dataset, which was used to achieve the highest accuracy on the EfficientDet frameworks. Additionally, the text references a study by Waycott et al. (2009) that discusses accelerating loss of seagrasses across the globe, but it does not explicitly mention any specific dataset used in their research. Similarly, the study by Xu et al. (2021) focuses on developing a forest fire detection system based on ensemble learning, but no specific dataset is mentioned. Overall, the text provides information about three datasets used in deep learning pipelines: ECUHO-1, ECUHO-2, and ImageNet.
