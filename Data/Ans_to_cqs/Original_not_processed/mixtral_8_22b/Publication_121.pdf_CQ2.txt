D. Model Training

Feature Extraction: The hardware to train the model included
a Lenovo laptop equipped with an 8265U CPU at 1.80 GHz
of Intel Core i5, 8 GB of RAM running on a Windows 10 64-
bit system. The software tools included Annaconda3 Jupyter
Notebook with Python 3.8, where the Tensorﬂow, OpenCV-
python3 [37] and Keras [38] libraries were used. The dataset
was divided in a ratio of 75:25 into a training set of 5789
images and a test set of 1930 images. To obtain the pre-
trained weight parameters, we built the base models from the
MobileNetV2, MobileNetV3-Large and MobileNetV3-Small

models, pre-trained on 1.4M images from 1000 classes. First,
the intermediate layer of all the models was selected to use
for feature extraction. For this purpose, the output of the last
layer (bottleneck layer) is commonly used prior to the ﬂatten
operation. The reason is that all the fully connected layers
are specialized to the task network was trained on; thus, the
features learned by these layers will not be useful for the new
task. The bottleneck features are more generic. Therefore, the
base models were frozen, loaded with weights trained on the
ImageNet dataset and used as a feature extractor. We added
a dropout layer with a dropout rate of 0.2 to reduce the
overﬁtting of the model. Finally, the top classiﬁer softmax
layer was added for predicting the class for an input image.
The model with the base model of MobileNetV2 was compiled
and optimized with Adam optimizer. The other with the base
model of MobileNetV3 were optimized with Gradient descent

CNN comes with the disadvantages of a huge number
of labelled training samples requirement for weighting pa-
rameters and powerful GPUs for a faster learning process.
With limited training samples, learning too many parameters
directly will result in overﬁtting even after using over-ﬁtting
prevention techniques such as Dropout [7]. Overﬁtting of a
machine learning model includes more terms and uses more
complicated approaches than necessary [8]. To make deep
CNN ﬁt for small datasets while keeping high accuracy is
a challenge. To overcome this challenge, transfer learning [9]
offers the solution, which implies reusing previously attained
knowledge in similar tasks. Some studies analyzed the use
of transfer learning for many deep learning algorithms. These
evaluations [10] concluded that transfer learning improves the
accuracy of deep learning models, which apply deep features
and ﬁne-tuning.

gained momentum to determine tree species. Compared to
DNA technologies, computer vision methods are non-intrusive,
which mainly use machine learning algorithms. Many machine
learning methods for tree species classiﬁcation, such as deep
learning models, e.g. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN),
have been applied to different datasets. The primary advantage
of CNN for image classiﬁcation is that the entire system is
trained completely automatically from raw pixels of images to
eventual categories. These images are acquired using remote
sensing or handheld devices and processed by powerful Cloud-
based machine learning algorithms. We aim at tree species
identiﬁcation using a CNN-based lightweight model, which
could embed within a handheld device resolving computation,
battery and network constraints.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images. This is evident from several references made throughout the text. For instance, the dataset is mentioned to consist of 5789 images for training and 1930 images for testing. Furthermore, the context discusses the use of pre-trained models like MobileNetV2, MobileNetV3-Large, and MobileNetV3-Small, which are known to work primarily with image data. Additionally, the mention of using OpenCV-python3 library further supports this inference, as OpenCV is typically used for working with images and videos. However, there is no explicit mention of any other data formats like audio, video, or CSV being used in the deep learning pipeline.
