artificial neural networks (ANN) (Men et al., 2022). The efficacy of these 
algorithms exhibits considerable variation across diverse aquatic envi-
ronments. For instance, the Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of 
Spectral  Hypercubes  (FLAASH)  model,  originally  developed  for  land 
pixels,  has  proven  effective  in  AC  for  aquatic  environments  utilizing 
Sentinel-2  and  SPOT-6  imagery  (Rotta  et  al.,  2016;  Li  et  al.,  2023a, 
2023b, 2023c, 2023d). Additionally, the FLAASH algorithm mitigates 
the  spatial  proximity  effect  by  employing  an  internal  pixel  averaging 
technique, which is essential for attaining high-quality AC (Wang et al., 
2021).  In  investigations  of  lacustrine  environments  using  Advanced 
Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) AVNIR-2 data, the efficacy of AC al-
gorithms  predicated  on  the  single  scattering  approximation  has  been 
significantly enhanced (Matsui and Kageyama, 2022). The Atmospheric

options, contribute to the stability of the search. Additionally, its effi-
cient standard marking system can remove low-quality pixels, thereby 
improving  search  quality  (Li  et  al.,  2023a,  2023b,  2023c,  2023d). 
However, L2gen requires an accurate understanding of aerosol types to 
obtain high-quality Rrs  retrieval, and the complex aerosols of PL make 
this practice less efficient.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide specific information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, common regularization techniques include dropout, L1 regularization, and L2 regularization. Dropout randomly sets a fraction rate of input units to 0 at each update during training time, helping reduce overfitting. L1 regularization adds an absolute value of the weights to the loss function, while L2 regularization adds the squared magnitude of the weights to the loss function. Both L1 and L2 regularizations help prevent overfitting by adding constraints to the optimization problem.
