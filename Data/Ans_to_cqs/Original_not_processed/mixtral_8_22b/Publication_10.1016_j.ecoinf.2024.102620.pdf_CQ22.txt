between 0.2 and 0.5 indicate acceptable accuracy, and values above 0.5 
indicate incorrect predictions.

Validation  metrics  include  the  Pearson  correlation  coefficient  (R), 
RMSE,  and  MAPE.  The  Pearson  correlation  coefficient  is  utilized  to 
evaluate the correlation between predicted and actual values. The co-
efficient ranged from 0 to 1, a higher value indicating a stronger cor-
relation. According to previous studies (Lewis, 1982; Rao et al., 2018; 
Zhu  et  al.,  2023),  both  RMSE  and  MAPE  can  be  used  to  assess  the 
credibility of predicted values. An RMSE of <0.1 indicates high accu-
racy, while values between 0.1 and 0.2, between 0.2 and 0.3, and >0.3 
indicate  good,  acceptable,  and  low  accuracy,  respectively.  MAPE  is  a 
statistical measure utilized to evaluate the accuracy of predictions by 
comparing predicted and actual values. It expresses the accuracy as a 
percentage  (%),  MAPE  values  below  0.1  indicate  excellent prediction 
accuracy,  values  between  0.1  and  0.2  indicate  good  accuracy,  values

The  PLUS  model  consists  of  two  main  modules:  the  transformed 
specification mining framework based on the land expansion analysis 
strategy (LEAS) module and the cellular automata (CA) model based on 
a multi-type random patch seed mechanism (CARS). In the LEAS mod-
ule, the PLUS model employs the random forest algorithm to obtain the 
development probabilities of each land use type based on two periods of 
land use data. This approach is considered superior to the FLUS model, 
which  uses  an  artificial  neural  network  (ANN)  to  determine  develop-
ment  probabilities  based  on  only  one  period  of  land  use  data.  Addi-
tionally,  the  PLUS  model  proposes  a  decreasing  threshold  rule  for 
generating  patch  seeds.  This  gradual  constraint  on  patch  growth  of 
various land use types is achieved through the iterative process. Cells 
with a higher total probability are more likely to change preferentially

These  three indicators  are commonly used to assess  prediction re-

sults, and their formulas are omitted here for brevity.

Helpful Answer:
The validation metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this context are the Pearson correlation coefficient (R), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). These metrics help assess the credibility of the predicted values.

The Pearson correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of association between the predicted and actual values. Its value ranges from 0 to 1, with a higher value indicating a stronger correlation.

RMSE is used to quantify the difference between the predicted and actual values. Lower RMSE values indicate better model performance. Specifically, an RMSE of less than 0.1 indicates high accuracy, while values between 0.1 and 0.2, between 0.2 and 0.3, and greater than 0.3 indicate good, acceptable, and low accuracy, respectively.

MAPE is another metric used to evaluate the accuracy of predictions by comparing predicted and actual values. It expresses the accuracy as a percentage. MAPE values below 0.1 indicate excellent prediction accuracy, values between 0.1 and 0.2 indicate good accuracy, and values between 0.2 and 0.5 indicate acceptable accuracy. Values above 0.5 indicate incorrect predictions.
