have  demonstrated  that  deep  learning  models  perform  well  in  object 
recognition and categorization (Shetty, 2019; Talukdar et al., 2020). In 
particular, the eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model has gained 
popularity  due  to  its  ability  to  identify  features  and  patterns  in  large 
image datasets (Friedman, 2001; Hamedianfar et al., 2022). Neverthe-
less, the application of deep learning models to detect and categorize 
forest  types  utilizing  high  spatial  and  ultra-high  resolution  remote 
sensing data is still uncommon (Georganos et al., 2018). Moreover, the 
risk of forest fire is also affected by the features of the forest condition 
(Reich et al., 2001). During dry weather, the forest states with numerous 
oil trees, vines, dry branches, and fallen leaves will burn more quickly 
than in other forest conditions (Doran et al., 2004; Ebright et al., 2023; 
Hardison,  1976).  As  a  result,  reliable  forest-type  categorization  is

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of high spatial and ultra-high resolution remote sensing data, which suggests that satellite imagery or drone footage could be one source of raw data collection. Additionally, the research may have involved gathering data from existing databases or conducting field surveys to collect relevant information.

Based on the given context, we can infer that various methods might have been employed for collecting raw data, such as:

1. Remote Sensing Data: High spatial and ultra-high resolution remote sensing data were mentioned, indicating that satellite imagery or drone footage was likely used to gather visual data related to land use and forest types.

2. Public Datasets: Existing databases containing historical records, geographical information, or environmental data could have been accessed to supplement the collected data.

3. Field Surveys: Researchers may have conducted ground surveys to validate their findings, observe local conditions, and gather additional data points.

However, without explicit mention of these methods in the provided context, this response remains speculative.
