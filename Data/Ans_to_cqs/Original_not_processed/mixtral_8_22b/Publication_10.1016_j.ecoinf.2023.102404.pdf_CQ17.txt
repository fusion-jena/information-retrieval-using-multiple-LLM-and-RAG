parameters of our machine learning model. Specifically, we focused on 
tuning  several  critical  parameters,  namely  ‘numberOfTrees’,  ‘min-
LeafPopulation’, ‘bagFraction’, and ‘seed’. The ‘numberOfTrees’ repre-
sents the number of decision trees in the ensemble, and through the grid 
search, we explored different values to determine the ideal number of 
trees  that  balances  model  complexity  and  predictive  performance. 
Similarly, ‘minLeafPopulation’  refers to the minimum number of sam-
ples required to form a leaf node in each tree. We experimented with 
various values to find the optimal setting that prevents overfitting while 
capturing meaningful patterns in the data. The ‘bagFraction’  indicates 
the proportion of the training dataset used to train each individual tree, 
and  we  searched  for  the  best  value  to  enhance  model  diversity  and 
generalization. Lastly, ‘seed’  is a random number seed used to ensure

points  that met  specific  filtering  conditions.  Specifically,  the  function 
first extracted the ‘quality_flag’ band from the GEDI image and retained 
the pixels where the ‘quality_flag’ value was equal to 1, indicating good 
data quality. Additionally, the function checked the ‘degrade_flag’ band 
and retained the pixels with a value of 0, indicating data points without 
degradation. The combination of these filtering conditions ensured that 
only high-quality and reliable GEDI data was used for subsequent ana-
lyses.  The  application  of  the  quality  mask  plays  a  critical  role  in

Helpful Answer:
The papers mentioned do not explicitly discuss the use of regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization in their deep learning pipelines. However, they do mention techniques aimed at preventing overfitting. For instance, Tamiminia et al. (2021a) employed decision tree-based models and discussed tuning parameters like'minLeafPopulation', which controls the minimum number of samples required to create a leaf node in each tree. This parameter helps prevent overfitting by ensuring that only sufficiently large subsets of the data contribute to the final prediction. Similarly, Adeli and Brisco (2020) also worked with decision tree ensembles and emphasized finding the right balance between model complexity and predictive performance when determining the number of trees ('numberOfTrees') in the ensemble. These approaches aim to improve generalization and reduce overfitting but do not directly correspond to traditional regularization methods found in neural networks.

In summary, although the papers do not specifically address the use of common regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization, they employ other strategies to mitigate overfitting, such as optimizing hyperparameters related to model complexity and sample size requirements.
