We  strongly  believe  that  the  utilization  of  professional  tracking 
combined  with  community  involvement  through  citizen  science  data 
collection  of  footprints  and  state-of-the-art  machine  learning  holds 
immense potential as an additional non-invasive method in the toolbox 
of every conservationist for monitoring endangered and elusive species. 
This integrated approach allows for the collection of valuable data from 
both experts and the general public, fostering a collaborative effort in 
wildlife conservation.
