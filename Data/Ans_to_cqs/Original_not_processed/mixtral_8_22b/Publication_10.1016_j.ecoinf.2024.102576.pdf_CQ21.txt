To generate training data for the PCF, 16,660 grid cells with a res-
olution  of  2560  m  were  created  in  South  Korea.  This  resolution  was 
selected because the training unit of the U-Net model was 256 pixels, 
and 2560 m contains 256 pixels of Sentinel-2 with a 10 m resolution. 
Fig. 6a and b show the extracted results, where 8330 cells (half of the 
total) were randomly extracted as a mask for training data in Fig. 6a, and 
3,332 cells (20% of the total) were randomly extracted as a mask for 
validation data in Fig. 6b. The PSI was extracted from Fig. 6a and b to 
prepare input data for model training. The sub-class land-cover map of 
South Korea can be transformed into a macro-class land-cover map by 
converting all sub-class items into macro-class items (Fig. 4). This con-
version  process  resulted  in  the  production  of  a  completely  converted 
sub-class  land-cover  map  of  South  Korea,  as  shown  in  Fig.  6c.  Addi-

the satellite. The labeling part determines the labeling methodology for 
training  the  deep  learning  model.  In  the  classification  part,  a  deep 
learning model was trained based on the results of previous steps. The 
target PSI, which has the same format as the trained PSI, can be classi-
fied using the trained model. Here, the format refers to the spatial res-
olution and spectral band used, interval in PSI, and chronological order 
of  each  band.  If  satellite  imagery  accumulates  owing  to  continuous 
satellite observations, the PSI can also be continuously generated, and 
classification can be continued using the model. This enables PCF land 
monitoring.

The PCF consists of three sequential parts: PSI generation, labeling, 
and classification. The PSI generation part produces satellite imagery to 
train  the  model,  which  reflects  the  phenological  characteristics  of 
vegetation on the land surface. PSI data are defined as satellite imagery 
with appropriate intervals that have had cloud cover removed to accu-
rately reflect these characteristics. The length of the appropriate interval 
may vary depending on the temporal resolution or observation width of

The use of deep learning models has become prevalent across various 
scientific  fields.  Specifically,  these  models  have  demonstrated  excep-
tional  performance  in  image  classification.  Consequently,  numerous 
researchers are employing these models for land-cover classification and 
extraction of ecological information (Capinha et al., 2021; Jagannathan 
and Divya, 2021; Kırbas¸ and Çifci, 2022; Passah and Kandar, 2023). The 
U-Net model, a type of convolutional neural network (CNN), is a deep 
learning  algorithm  that  performs  classification  through  supervised 
learning  (Ulmas  and  Liiv,  2020).  The  model  was  trained  using  both 
training and validation data, and classification was performed based on 
these data (Kattenborn et al., 2021). Consequently, the availability of 
labeling data is crucial for U-Net model applications. However, in North 
Korea, there is no official land-cover map based on national-scale field

Helpful Answer:
After the model training, several postprocessing steps can be taken to evaluate the performance of the model and interpret its predictions. Some common postprocessing techniques include saliency maps, metrics calculation, and confusion matrices.

Saliency maps are visualizations that highlight the regions of an input image that contribute most significantly to the output prediction. They help identify which features of the input image are important for making accurate predictions.

Metrics calculation involves computing quantitative measures such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., to assess the overall performance of the model. These metrics provide insights into how well the model generalizes to unseen data and can aid in identifying areas for improvement.

A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification model by comparing predicted labels against actual labels. It provides detailed information about true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of the model's strengths and weaknesses.

In the given context, it appears that the authors did not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps after model training. However, they likely employed some form of evaluation technique to validate their approach and measure its effectiveness. Based on the description of their methodology, one could infer that they might have calculated metrics such as accuracy or F1 score to compare the performance of different models or configurations. Additionally, they may have utilized tools like saliency maps or confusion matrices to gain further insight into the behavior of their model during training and testing phases.
