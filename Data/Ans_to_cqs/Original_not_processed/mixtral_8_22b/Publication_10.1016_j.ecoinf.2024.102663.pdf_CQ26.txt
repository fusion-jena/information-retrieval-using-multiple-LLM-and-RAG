Helpful Answer:
The paper does not explicitly mention any specific techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses several image enhancement techniques applied to improve the quality of images used for training a deep learning model called YOLOv8. These techniques include white balance, gamma correction, sharpening, dehazing, denoising, and CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization). The purpose of applying these techniques is to enhance the visual appearance of the input images, which can potentially lead to better performance of the deep learning model. Nevertheless, addressing data bias during preprocessing might involve other techniques like those mentioned above, depending on the nature of the dataset and the problem being solved.
