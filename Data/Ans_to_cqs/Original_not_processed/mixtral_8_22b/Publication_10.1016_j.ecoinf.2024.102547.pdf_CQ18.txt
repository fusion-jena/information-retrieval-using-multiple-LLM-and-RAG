5. Conclusion 

In  this  study,  we  analyzed  a  multifrequency  acoustics  dataset  ac-
quired  from  scientific  echosounders  in  the  West  African  waters  using 
FDA,  both  with  and  without  the  incorporation  of  spatial  dimensions.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. However, it can be inferred that the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) were used as metrics to evaluate the performance of the models during training and testing phases. These are common evaluation metrics used in machine learning and statistical modeling to assess how well a model performs. Additionally, R^2 values are also presented, which indicate the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables in the model. Therefore, it appears that these metrics were employed to track the progress and effectiveness of the models throughout the training process.
