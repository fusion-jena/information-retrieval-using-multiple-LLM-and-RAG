value. The algorithm makes full use of information from each sampling
point computed to continuously learn about the shape of objective
functions and find optimal combinations of hyper parameters. The
Bayesian theorem can be expressed as follows:
p(f |D) = p(D|f)p(f)

Despite the growing popularity of ML models in eco-hydrological
studies, building effective models is a complex and time-consuming
process that involves tuning a large number of hyper parameters to
obtain an optimal model architecture. Because of the non-linear inter-
action between hyper parameters, manual tuning is ineffective for most
issues. Bayesian optimization (BO) is a global optimization algorithm
that optimizes the hyper parameters in ML models to achieve high
simulation accuracy. The combination of BO and LSTM improves the
performance of the model on unseen data, thereby increasing the
generalization ability and robustness of the model. The BO algorithm is
based on the Bayesian theorem to estimate the posterior distribution of
target functions. It establishes a provisional surrogate function based on
past evaluation of unknown target functions and continues to search for
the next set of hyper parameters that minimize the surrogate function

p(D)

Probabilistic proxy models are used to estimate the prediction error
of the LSTM model with various hyper parameters. Through iterative
computation of BO and a constant correction of the prior probabilities,
the agent model will closely approximate location objective functions. In
this study, Gaussian processes are selected as the probabilistic agent
model, which is widely employed in non-linear regression, classifica-
tion, and other fields (Seeger, 2004). The Gaussian distribution is
expressed as:

f(x) ∼ GP(μ(x) , k(x, x) )

(10)

where μ(x) = E(f(x)) is the mathematical expectation of f(x), usually the
mean function is set to 0; f(x) is the mean absolute error; k(x, x) is the
covariance function of x.

Helpful Answer:
The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using Bayesian Optimization (BO). Unlike traditional methods such as grid search or random search, BO uses a more efficient approach by leveraging past evaluations of the target function to guide future searches. This method is particularly useful when dealing with a large number of hyperparameters due to its ability to handle non-linear interactions between them. By estimating the posterior distribution of the target function, BO constructs a provisional surrogate function. This function is then minimized to determine the next set of hyperparameters to evaluate. In this study, Gaussian processes are chosen as the probabilistic agent model for BO. These processes are commonly used in non-linear regression, classification, and other fields. They provide a way to estimate the prediction error of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model with different hyperparameters. Through iterative computation of BO and continuous updating of the prior probabilities, the agent model approximates the objective function.
