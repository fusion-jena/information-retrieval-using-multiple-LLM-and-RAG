The  development  and  evaluation  of  ML/AI  models  have  become 
central to many domains, ranging from healthcare and finance to natural 
language processing and computer vision (de Hond et al., 2022; Krenn 
et al., 2023). Accurately assessing the performance and generalization 
capability of these models is of paramount importance. To achieve this, 
data  scientists  and  researchers  rely  on  a  plethora  of  validation  tech-
niques,  like  holdout  method,  bootstrapping,  leave-one-out  cross-vali-
dation, nested cross-validation among which cross-validation stands as a 
cornerstone (Tsamardinos et al., 2018; Wainer and Cawley, 2021; Wong, 
2015).  Cross-validation  is  a  systematic  approach  to  model  evaluation 
that has gained widespread popularity due to its robustness and versa-
tility (Bates et al., 2023; Nunez et al., 2021). It is particularly valuable 
when dealing with limited datasets, where overfitting and underfitting

%Query
Query: "What type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the paper titled "Analysis of input set characteristics and variances on k-fold cross validation for a recurrent neural network model on waste disposal rate estimation" by Vu, H.L., Ng, K.T.W., Richter, A., and An, C. uses a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model in their study. However, there is no information about the use of any other types of deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Transformers in the provided context. Therefore, we can only confirm that an RNN model was used in one of the papers mentioned in the context.
