3.2. Model performance 

The five  component  models (GLM,  MaxEnt,  RF, GBM,  and  MARS) 
demonstrated variable  performance (Table 2).  Notably, the  RF model 
and the GLM model demonstrated the best and worst performance for all 
studied species, respectively (Table 2). 

3.3. Variable contributions to habitat suitability 

In the ensemble habitat suitability model, distance to mining roads, 
distance  to  roads,  distance  to  CAs,  and  distance  to  water  resources 
played  important  roles  in  predicting  habitat  suitability  for  the  three 
species (Table  3). Response curves  detailing the  relationship between 
habitat suitability and environmental variables in the best-performing 
model  (the  RF  model),  are  presented  in  Supplementary  Materials

Connectivity  prediction  was  implemented  in  UNICOR  over  the 
resistance  map  for  the  species  to  find  the  single-source  shortest  path 
between  start  and  end  occurrence  records  (Landguth  et  al.,  2012; 
Cushman et al., 2013). Furthermore, the continuous factorial least-cost 
path map was converted to a categorical map based on the same method 
used  for  core  habitats.  To  measure  the  coverage  of  core  habitats  and 
corridors by CAs, the proportion of these areas within CAs was measured 
(Almasieh and Mohammadi, 2023).

%Query
Query: "Which hardware resources are used for training the deep learning model (e.g., GPUs, TPUs)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The paper does not provide information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot determine whether GPUs or TPUs were utilized during the training process.

Based on the given context, it is impossible to identify which hardware resources were used for training the deep learning model.
