IV. EXPERIMENTS

A. Hand-crafted Feature Extraction Experiment

A. Datasets

We used a leaf-scan dataset D that contains a total of
7,262 photos of 255 tree species from the Central Plateau
in Costa Rica. Leaf samples were collected during the ﬁrst
semester of 2016 by taxonomists from the Costa Rica National
Museum1 and digitized by a technician from the Costa Rica
Institute of Technology. All 255 species were used for training.
Images were re-sampled to a 224×224 resolution for the deep
learning experiment and to a 700×525 resolution for the hand-
crafted feature extraction experiment. Figure 2 shows a random
sample taken from the dataset. It is very important to mention
that, for this work, it is crucial to include as metadata no
only the species associated with each photo but also a unique
specimen identiﬁer.

1) Biased Dataset: This dataset was created by randomly
taking 70% of the data in D for training and 30% for
testing. These are really approximate percentages because such
distribution has to be attempted for each species in dataset D.
How close to a 70%-30% distribution is achieved depends
on how many photos per species there are in dataset D. For
example, if a given species X has 20 photos, 14 randomly
chosen photos will go to the training dataset and 6 to the
testing dataset. However, if the number of photos for species
X is 2, one will go to the training dataset and the other one to
the testing dataset, resulting in a 50%-50% distribution. This
is the approach most of previous plant identiﬁcation studies
have followed (particularly those based on leaf-scans).
