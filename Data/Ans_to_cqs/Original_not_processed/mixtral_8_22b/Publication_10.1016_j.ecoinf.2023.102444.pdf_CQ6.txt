To our knowledge, this is the first application of UMAP to directly 
estimate species distribution based on an analysis of bioclimatic vari-
ables.  Other  studies  have  used  DRM  to  visualize  results  from  deep 
learning models; e.g., Deneu et al. (2022) used tSNE (another DRM) to 
visualize input data and the results of applying a convolutional neural 
network to model the distribution of species at a fine resolution. On the 
other hand, we applied clustering to identify groups containing species 
and near background points to highlight how bioclimatic heterogeneity 
between clusters in the reduced dimension translates to geographic re-
gions, i.e., to show that groups in the reduced dimension have similar 
bioclimatic  properties  within  a  group,  but  differ  among  groups  (see 
Figs. 6, 7). This behavior underlines the nature of UMAP in that back-
ground points near species samples share similar bioclimatic properties

In  ecology,  species  distribution  modeling  (SDM)  is  an  important 
research  area,  with  applications  in  conservation  management  of 
threatened species, analysis of invasive pests and climate change, and 
niche  modeling  (Franklin,  2013;  Srivastava  et  al.,  2019).  Different 
methods have been proposed to assess how bioclimatic variables influ-
ence  species  occurrence.  Some  machine  learning  techniques,  such  as 
support  vector  machines,  artificial  neural  networks,  random  forests, 
genetic algorithms, and maximum entropy, have been applied to study 
species distribution (Elith and Leathwick, 2009; Gobeyn et al., 2019). 
The fundamental problem in SDM is finding a subset of environmental 
conditions in certain regions that are similar to those in the locations 
where the individuals are found. This is normally achieved by fitting a 
model using a multivariate set of bioclimatic variables, associated with

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be taken to improve its performance. These may include:

* Normalization or standardization: This involves rescaling the values of features so they fall within a specific range, often between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. This helps prevent any one feature from dominating the others due to differences in scale.
* Scaling: Similar to normalization, scaling involves adjusting the values of features to bring them into a common range. However, unlike normalization, scaling does not necessarily involve bringing all values into a fixed range. Instead, it might involve multiplying all values by a constant factor.
* Cleaning: This step involves removing or correcting errors, outliers, or missing values in the dataset. For example, if there are missing values in some rows of the dataset, these could be filled in using various imputation methods. Similarly, if there are outliers present in the dataset, these could be removed or replaced with more typical values.
* Feature engineering: This step involves creating new features or transformations of existing features that might help improve the performance of the model. For example, polynomial features or interaction terms could be created to better capture nonlinear relationships between features.
* Data augmentation: In cases where the amount of available training data is limited, data augmentation techniques can be used to artificially increase the size of the dataset. For example, images could be rotated, flipped, or cropped to create new variations of the same image.
