ficient evidence to the response of the basin to climatic forcings. This is 
bearing in mind that a poor groundwater-based response could lead to 
long-term drought and the annihilation of many aquatic and endangered 
species that rely on the GAB's groundwater resources (e.g., Barron et al., 
2011). Additionally, some innovative techniques have been employed to 
evaluate groundwater-related aspects, such as changes in groundwater 
levels across seasons (Pandey et al., 2020) and identifying the potential 
for  groundwater  availability  using  factors  such  as  geological  charac-
teristics and land use (Kumar et al., 2023), which shows the significance 
of groundwater assessment in areas (e.g., India) where water resources 
are crucial for sustainability and livelihood which directly or indirectly 
aligns with the objectives of our study (Kumar et al., 2023; Pandey et al., 
2020).

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge, several common methods can be applied to mitigate data bias issues:

1. Stratified Splitting: In this method, the dataset is divided into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes in both subsets. This ensures that the model learns from all types of instances equally.

2. Oversampling: When dealing with imbalanced datasets, oversampling involves duplicating samples from the minority class to balance it with the majority class. Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is one popular approach for generating new synthetic examples.

3. Undersampling: Unlike oversampling, undersampling reduces the number of samples in the majority class by randomly removing instances until the desired balance between classes is achieved.

4. Diverse Data Collection: Collecting diverse data helps ensure that the model is exposed to various scenarios and patterns, reducing the risk of overfitting and increasing its ability to generalize better.

These techniques aim to improve the performance of deep learning models by addressing data biases and ensuring fair representation of different classes in the dataset.
