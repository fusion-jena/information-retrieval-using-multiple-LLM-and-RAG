randomly  splitting  all  individual  observations.  This  data  splitting  ap-
proach is generally considered optimum in machine learning as it does 
not  introduce  any  systematic  differences  between  the  test  and  train 
datasets. To perform the RY data splitting, individual observations were 
grouped according to year of capture and years were randomly selected 
for inclusion in the train and test datasets. Although this may produce 
systematic  differences  between  the  test  and  train  datasets,  it  ensures 
that  the  model  is  tested  using  previously  unseen  combinations  of  ex-
planatory  variables  and  is  therefore  a  more  robust  test  of  model  per-
formance in this context.

2.4.2.  Hyperparameters 

Hyperparameter tuning was done manually. As a starting point the 
learning rate was set as low as possible and the number of iterations as 
high as computationally feasible (Hastie et al., 2009). The learning rate, 
which is also called a shrinkage parameter, determines the contribution 
of each tree to the model. The maximum tree depth which reflects the 
degree of interaction in the model is usually low. GBRT performs best 
using fairly shallow trees, so-called tree stumps.

between the response and explanatory variables is not specified, instead 
a learning algorithm is used to find patterns in the data. Due to these 
flexible properties, GBRT were selected as a suitable method for iden-
tifying  potential  drivers  of  changes  in  growth  across  the  two  herring 
populations.

For  the  RI  models  the  same  initial  parameters  were  set  for  the 
analysis of the CS and NW datasets, then a grid search was performed 
on both datasets with a two-part split to give hyperparameters with the 
highest level of accuracy. These were as following: learning rate 0.05 
and maximum tree depth of 4 for both the CS and the NW models. The 
early stopping technique was used to determine when to stop the model 
training  to  avoid  overfitting.  Using  early  stopping  the  number  of 
iterations required until convergence was 120 for CS and 106 for NW. 
Grid search was not required for a three-part splits, and further tuning 
of the parameters was done manually. 

For the RY models, in contrast to the RI models, the best performing 
models (based on MSE) were models with a slow learning rate of 0.005. 
Additionally, the NW model had a very shallow tree (tree depth of 2). 
The number of iterations was kept at 500.

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, the authors use a specific type of data splitting approach known as Random Year (RY) data splitting to prevent data bias during preprocessing of their deep learning pipeline. Unlike traditional random splitting methods, where individual observations are divided into training and testing sets without considering temporal factors, RY data splitting groups observations based on the year of capture and randomly selects years for inclusion in either dataset.

This method acknowledges that there might be systematic differences between the test and train datasets due to grouping by year but ensures that the model is evaluated using previously unseen combinations of explanatory variables. By doing so, they aim to create a more robust test of model performance in this particular context.

However, the text does not explicitly mention other common techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, while we can infer that the authors employ RY data splitting to mitigate potential biases related to time series data, we cannot comment on whether they utilize additional strategies like those mentioned above.
