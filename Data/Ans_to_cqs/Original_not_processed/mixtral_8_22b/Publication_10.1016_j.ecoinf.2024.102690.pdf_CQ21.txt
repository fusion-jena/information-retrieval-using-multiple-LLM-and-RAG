ecological leisure corridors, 6 along species migration corridors, and 2 
along  river  runoff  corridors  in  Scenario  C.  While  other  disturbance 
points were mostly found in the center of the mountain greenbelt, those 
in  the  southern  section  of  the  region  were  concentrated  around  river 
tributaries and watercourses.

4.4.3. Ecological barriers 

Based on the characteristics of each scenario, the search radius for 
ecological  barriers  was  set  as  follows.  A  search  radius  of  320  m  was 
established in Scenario A by computing the total area of cropland and 
the  accompanying  cropland  pressure  index  for  each  sub-district  in 
Guangzhou. Based on pertinent planning documents, the search radius 
was set to 200 m for Scenario B and 500 m for Scenario C. 

Six barriers were identified in Scenario A, where the land-use type 
was dominated by water bodies (Fig. 6c), mainly located in the south-

Helpful Answer:
After completing the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be taken to evaluate and analyze the performance of the trained model. Some common postprocessing techniques include:

1. Saliency Maps: These visualize which parts of the input data had the most significant impact on the model's output. They help identify important features or patterns within the dataset.

2. Metrics Calculation: Various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curves, etc., can be calculated to quantify the model's performance. This helps determine how well the model is performing and whether it needs further tuning or optimization.

3. Confusion Matrix: It provides a summary of prediction results on a classification problem. The number of correct and incorrect predictions are summarized with count values and broken down by each class. This allows us to understand the types of errors made by our model.

4. Model Interpretability: Techniques like LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) or SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) can be used to explain individual predictions made by the model. This helps improve transparency and trust in the model's decision-making process.

5. Hyperparameter Tuning: Postprocessing may also involve fine-tuning hyperparameters to optimize the model's performance based on its evaluation during the training phase.

These postprocessing steps provide valuable insights into the model's behavior and performance, enabling researchers and practitioners to make informed decisions about deploying their models in real-world applications.
