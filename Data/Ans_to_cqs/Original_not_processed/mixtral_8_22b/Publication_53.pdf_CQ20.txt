We trained our deep learning CNN on 7362 labelled images using the same parameters
detailed above, and we achieved an error rate of 0.1195 (11.95%) with a training loss of
0.3462 and a validation loss of 0.2847. We further ﬁne-tuned the model by unfreezing the
entire model and training at a 10-fold lower learning rate (10−4). The ﬁnal model achieved
an accuracy of 94.8% (error rate of 5.2%) with a training loss of 0.1397 and a validation loss
of 0.1446 with ten epochs (see confusion matrix in Figure S1).

2.2.2. Correcting for False Positives

Locations falsely classiﬁed as containing a dam (i.e., false positives, or commission
error) act to overpredict the real number of dams in Australia. Therefore, we calculated
the probability of false positives by using our deep learning CNN to analyse and validate
ca. 2000 dams in each State and Territory sampled from our compiled database. To do so,

of 0.8287. We used the trained model to automatise the classiﬁcation of 500 more images
from the unlabelled training dataset, and we manually ﬁxed any mistakes. We repeated
this process of training, classiﬁcation and checking until all of the 7362 downloaded images
were labelled.

2.4. Statistical Analyses

We used Python [35] and fastai [30] for developing the deep learning CNN. We used
R [36] for all statistical analyses, using packages sf [37] and raster [38] for data manipulation;
ggplot2 [39], rasterVis [40] and cowplot [41] for plotting. We also used R for designing
the website AusDams.org, using Shiny [42], Leaﬂet [43], Plotly [44] and using Joe Cheng’s
Superzip template (https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/superzip-example.html).

3. Results
3.1. Reported Farm Dams

There were 1,694,675 farm dams reported by regional and Federal authorities in
Australia. The majority of farm dams were in New South Wales (37%), Victoria (26%),
Queensland (17%) and Western Australia (10%; Table S1). Around three-quarters of Aus-
tralia recorded at least one dam per 2000 km2, but the typical density near urban centres
was 2–5 farm dams per km2 (Figure 2). The average size of a dam was ca. 1000 m2, ranging
from 100 m2 to >105 m2 (Figure 3).
