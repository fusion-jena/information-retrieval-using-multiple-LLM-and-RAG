with a 50% probability of occurrence. To avoid any risk of overfitting at 
each  training  stage,  we  selected  the  model  relative  to  the  epoch  that 
gave the best performance on the validation set. During inference, the 
patch  size  was  set  to  1024  Ã— 1,024  pixels  to  accelerate  the  process. 
Further information on the fine-tuning process is described in section 
2.5.2.

The  pre-trained  model  underwent  inference  and  fine-tuning  for  4 
iterations using the entire SW stratum employing the SAL. This iterative 
process served to enhance the model's performance and gather samples 
pertaining to each key species present in the region. The training pro-
cedure for the two first fine-tuning iterations was the one proposed in 
the  original  paper  (Delplanque  et  al.,  2023a)  which  consisted  of  two 
main steps: 1) training the architecture using positive patches for 200 
epochs, and 2) collecting and including hard negative patches, which are 
patches  containing  false  positives,  to  further  train  the  model  for  50 
epochs in order to reduce the number of false positives. During the two 
last fine-tuning iterations, only the second step of the training procedure 
was used. Hard negative patches were created using false positives that 
emerged from the thumbnail classification (step 1 of the SAL). To avoid a

aperture set to f/5.0, the auto-ISO was preferred, with a minimum value 
of  500,  and  minimum  shutter  speed  was  set  to  1/2000  s.  In  total,

too severe imbalance between positive and negative patches the batch 
was equally balanced between the latter during training.

Helpful Answer:

Answer: Training completion is determined by selecting the model relative to the epoch that gave the best performance on the validation set. This approach is employed to prevent overfitting at each training stage. Additionally, the patch size is set to 1024 x 1024 pixels during inference to expedite the process.
