When  it  comes  to  the  application  of  deep  learning  models,  it  is 
mandatory to train the model on training data that resemble the data, on 
which  the model will be applied  later. If the  model is  applied over  a 
longer period of time (as it can be the case in long term biomonitoring), 
the training dataset and the dataset, on which the model is applied can 
have  different  data  distributions  due  to  some  reasons,  like  different 
recording  conditions  (brightness,  scale)  or  recording  devices/sensors 
(contrast,  resolution).  This  is  a  well-known  phenomenon  called  data 
drift  or  domain  drift  (Farahani  et  al.,  2020).  Thus,  it  is  necessary  to 
create specific datasets tailored to the desired application. The field of 
machine learning that is dealing with this discrepancy across domain 
distributions, is called domain adaption, with the aim of increasing the 
transferability of models to datasets with similar statistical properties.

mated segmentation approaches were not sufficient, so a manual image 
annotation  was  indispensable.  However,  once  a  dataset  of  a  specific 
location and community has been created and the deep learning model 
has been trained on it, it is very easy to process large amounts of image 
data and the model can be used for subsequent timesteps. Compared to a 
manual  assessment  of  the  monitoring  points,  the  deep  learning-based 
evaluation  of the  biocrust  images provides an  accurate quantification 
of the individual taxa. This allows a precise analysis of large amounts of 
data, e.g. obtained at monitoring points. Thus, changes in the biocrust 
composition can be accurately quantified over time and/or location.

function to ignore a certain class. These annotations are made manually, 
using special software, and consume large amounts of time. For model 
development  there  are  many  well  established  collections  of  image 
datasets for the training and evaluation of the models, such as ImageNet

models  can  extract  complex  image  features  and  project  them  into  a 
latent space representation to produce an image classification based on 
these features. To achieve a suitable biocrust coverage estimation, one 
needs to classify every pixel of an image at the highest possible accuracy. 
This pixel-wise classification is called semantic segmentation. Various 
neural  network  architectures  like  UNet  (Ronneberger  et  al.,  2015)  or 
DeepLabV3  (Chen  et  al.,  2017)  were  developed  for  semantic  image 
segmentation (Minaee et al., 2021).

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not directly address the issue of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, including the use of random seed values. However, I can provide some general information about how randomness is typically handled in deep learning pipelines.

Randomness in deep learning pipelines often arises from various sources, such as weight initialization, shuffling of training data, dropout regularization, and stochastic gradient descent optimization algorithms. Random seeds are commonly used to control these sources of randomness, ensuring reproducibility and consistency between experiments.

To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, several strategies can be employed:

1. Fixed random seed: By setting a fixed random seed value, you ensure that all random processes within the pipeline generate the same sequence of numbers each time they are executed. This helps maintain consistency and reproducibility across multiple runs of the same experiment.

2. Multiple runs with different seeds: Since using a single random seed may lead to overfitting or underestimation of performance variability, researchers often perform multiple runs of their experiments with different random seed values. Averaging results across these runs can help obtain more robust estimates of model performance.

3. Seed sweeping: In this approach, instead of fixing a single random seed, you run your experiments with a range of different seed values. This technique can help identify whether the observed performance is sensitive to the choice of random seed.

4. Deterministic algorithms: Some operations in the deep learning pipeline, such as sorting or matrix multiplication, have deterministic alternatives that do not rely on random number generation. Using these deterministic versions can reduce the overall randomness in the pipeline.
