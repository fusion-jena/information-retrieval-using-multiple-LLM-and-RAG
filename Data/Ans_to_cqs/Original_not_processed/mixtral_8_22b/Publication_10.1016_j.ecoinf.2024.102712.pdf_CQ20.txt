Spectral  values  for  all  100  m  resolution  Sentinel-2  bands  were 
extracted to the GEDI footprints the using bilinear interpolation method 
in which we done taking the weighted average determined by the value 
of the four nearest 100 m pixels and their relative position or weighted 
distance adjusted to account for their distance from the centre of the 
GEDI footprint. By resampling Sentinel-2 images to the size of the field 
plots (100 m × 100 m) we lose valuable details which might have an 
negative influence on our AGBD model. 

A regression model estimating AGBD was constructed using Sentinel-2 
spectral  data  of  100  m  (all  spectral  bands  except  bands  1,  9  and  10) 
and the available field data (Eq. (1)).

Query: "Which hardware resources are used for training the deep learning model (e.g., GPUs, TPUs)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not explicitly mention any specific hardware resources such as GPUs or TPUs used for training a deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which hardware resources were utilized based solely on this information.

The context primarily discusses the use of Sentinel-2 satellite data, its integration with other datasets like GEDI, and the application of remote sensing techniques for aboveground biomass density (AGBD) modeling. It also mentions the use of regression analysis and the extraction of spectral values from Sentinel-2 bands. However, there is no reference to the type of computational infrastructure employed for these tasks.
