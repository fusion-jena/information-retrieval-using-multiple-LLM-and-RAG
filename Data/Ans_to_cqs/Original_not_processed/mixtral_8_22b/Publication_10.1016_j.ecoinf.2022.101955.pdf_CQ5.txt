To improve accuracy and decrease processing time, several Machine 
Learning  (ML)  algorithms  have  been  tested  for  LULC  mapping  using

We used three steps for image classification: 1) the establishment of 
training  datasets,  2)  classification,  and  3)  accuracy  assessment.  In 
generating training datasets, we first identified eight LULC classes in our 
study area, including croplands, dense forest, grassland savanna, open 
savanna/barelands, built-up areas, water bodies, wetlands, and woody 
savanna  (see  Table  S2  for a  full  description  of  the  LULC  classes). We 
identified and selected these eight LULC classes to be consistent with the 
land  cover  types  used  by  Moderate  Resolution  Imaging  Spectroradi-
ometer  (MODIS)  Global  Land  Cover  products  for  the  years  2010  and 
2020. These MODIS data are generated by NASA, and mapped at a 500

2.3.2.3. ANN: artificial neural networks classification. In classifying with 
the MLP ANN model, we used the package “nnet”, which provides pos-
sibilities for adjusting weighted decay and size, thereby countering the 
effects of model overfitting. We used an MLP ANN architecture with 1 
hidden layer established as a default setting within the “nnet” package, 
and with 6 neurons defined for our model inputs. The number of neurons 
in the input layer was equal to the number of used bands (6), and the 
output  layer  had  8  neurons  (representing  8  LULC  classes).  A  back 
propagation learning algorithm was used during the training phase of 
the model. Size and decay were used to define the primary model tuning 
parameters, and the control () function was used to control for model 
runs. As with the kNN approach, we defined the LULC classes of the test 
datasets  as  target  variables  and  the  band  reflectance  values  as  pre-

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide specific details about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of satellite image data from sources such as Landsat and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for land use and land cover (LULC) mapping. It also describes the process of generating training datasets by identifying and selecting eight LULC classes based on MODIS Global Land Cover products. Therefore, it can be inferred that the dataset used in this case is likely related to satellite imagery and land cover classification.
