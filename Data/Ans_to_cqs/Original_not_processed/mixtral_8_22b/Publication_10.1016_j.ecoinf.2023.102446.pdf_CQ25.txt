2.2. Data collection and processing

rogates  (100  surrogates)  and  a  significance  level  of  1%. The  network 
computation considered lagged information (Ï„ = 1 to 12, i.e., 6 h).

The present research used flux tower measurements of the western 
Himalayan pine-dominated ecosystem (Pinus roxburghii) at a temporal 
resolution  of  30  min  for  two  continuous  years  (December  2014  to 
November  2016).  This  pioneering  study  employs  the  information- 
theoretic  approach  to  develop  eco-hydrological  process  networks  for 
the  pine-dominated  ecosystem  of  the  Himalayas.  These  process  net-
works  illustrate  the  response  of  ecosystems  across  various  temporal 
scales (Supplementary Fig. 1 (a)). We used the Temporal Information 
Partitioning Network (TIPNet) approach (Goodwell and Kumar, 2017a; 
Goodwell and Kumar, 2017b) to investigate the following objectives: (1) 
identifying  the  contributions  of  sub-daily  scale  (6  h)  variability  in 
creating  within-week  variability  by  generating  weekly  process  net-
works, (2) recognizing the dominant causal hydrometeorological vari-

A  comprehensive  explanation  of  additional  statistics,  such  as  the 
decomposition of individual MI (Eqs. 5 and 6) as well as individual es-
timates of U, S, and R (Eqs. 7, 8, 9, and 10) involved in the generation of 
process networks is provided in the Supplementary text (1.1 Method). 
TPINet  effectively  works  when  there  are  at  least  200  data  points 
(Goodwell  and  Kumar,  2017a).  This  approach  can reveal  interactions 
occurring on hourly to daily time scales over several-day-time windows. 
Studies  employing  an  information  theory-based  transfer  entropy 
approach for network generation, with datasets at sub-hourly and sub- 
daily scales, have consistently provided robust results (Goodwell et al., 
2018; Goodwell and Kumar, 2017a; Goodwell and Kumar, 2017b).

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that no specific deep learning model was mentioned or utilized in this research. Instead, the study focuses on using the Temporal Information Partitioning Network (TIPNet) approach to create eco-hydrological process networks for a pine-dominated ecosystem in the Himalayas. The main objective of this approach is to identify the contributions of sub-daily scale (6 hours) variability in creating within-week variability by generating weekly process networks. Additionally, the study aims to recognize the dominant causal hydrometeorological variables influencing these processes. Therefore, the purpose of this research is not related to any deep learning models but rather to understand and analyze the complex relationships between different environmental factors affecting the studied ecosystem.
