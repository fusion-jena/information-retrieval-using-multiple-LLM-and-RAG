randomly selecting a subset of the parameter grid to explore (Bergstra 
and  Bengio,  2012).  Instead  of  exhaustively  searching  through  all 
possible combinations of hyperparameters, which can be computation-
ally  expensive  and  time-consuming,  randomized  grid  search  offers 
several  advantages, like,  reduces computational cost, especially when 
dealing with a large number of hyperparameters, and it has been shown 
to find equally or more optimal solutions than an exhaustive grid search, 
particularly  when  some  hyperparameters  are  more  influential  than 
others (Bergstra and Bengio, 2012; Lee et al., 2022). We then generated 
various  cases  by  combining  hyperparameter  values  extracted  from  a 
uniform distribution and evaluated their performance. Table S4 in the 
supplementary file summarizes the hyperparameters, their ranges, and 
the intervals used in the grid search. After the randomized grid search,

2.4.1. Random forest 

RF is a widely used algorithm for ensemble learning that employs 
multiple  decision  trees  for  classification  and  regression  tasks.  The 
method builds a forest of decision trees, each of which is trained using 
different samples of training data and the input attributes. The combined 
predictions of all the trees are taken into account (Breiman, 2001). The 
decision function of RF is, 

f (x) =

1
T

∑T

i=1

fi(x)

where T is the number of decision trees used to construct the forest and 
fi(x) is the decision function of the ith  tree. This algorithm outputs the 
final decision of majority voting among individual tree predictions. 

Given its accuracy and robustness, RF has found widespread appli-
cation  in  multiple  sectors,  including  freshwater  ecology,  limnology, 
economics, and medicine. Its superiority to other well-known machine 
learning algorithms, including SVMs and NNs, has been demonstrated 
(Cutler et al., 2007; Shen et al., 2022).

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information on handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it mentions the use of randomized grid search methods (Bergstra & Bengio, 2012), which help reduce computational costs and avoid overfitting by exploring only a subset of the parameter grid instead of exhaustively searching through all possible combinations of hyperparameters. In this method, various cases are generated by combining hyperparameter values extracted from a uniform distribution, and their performance is evaluated. Although this strategy doesn't directly address randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it contributes to managing the overall randomness inherent in the process by systematically exploring the parameter space.
