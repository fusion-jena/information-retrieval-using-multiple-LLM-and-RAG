Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

(sowing), green (emergence and full growth) and bare soil (harvest).
Capturing these three stages with spectral data should further enhance
the spectral separability between paddy rice and others.

This is the ﬁrst study to our knowledge to investigate the pheno-
logical features in improving the performance of deep learning. As re-
vealed in our results, we have seen great potential in developing phe-
nological knowledge based deep learning methods. Recent literature
has documented the applications and beneﬁts of deep learning, a new
branch of machine learning, in various ﬁelds (LeCun et al., 2015).
However, it is still a controversial topic whether deep learning is more
suitable than traditional machine learning methods for Landsat image
classiﬁcation (Heydari and Mountrakis, 2018; Li et al., 2016). Never-
theless, this study aims to evaluate the hypotheses that applying phe-
nological knowledge as input data of deep learning can improve the
performance in the detection of invasive S. alterniﬂora. A comparison
experiment between SAE and SVM with six diﬀerent types of Landsat
images was conducted (see Table 2). The best performance was

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information on the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions using Google Earth Engine and Landsat images, which suggests that remote sensing satellite imagery is one source of data collection. Additionally, the focus on phenological features implies that temporal data related to plant life cycles might be collected through ground observations or other means. But without additional context, it cannot be confirmed what exact methods were employed for gathering raw data.
