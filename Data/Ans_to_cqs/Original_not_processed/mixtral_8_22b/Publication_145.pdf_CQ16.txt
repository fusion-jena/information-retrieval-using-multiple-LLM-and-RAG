the validation dataset and the model segmented 1195 objects.

as a sum of two terms: binary cross-entropy and Dice coefﬁcient-related loss of the three predicted
masks [50–52]. We used the optimizer RMSprop (unpublished, adaptive learning rate method proposed
by Geoff Hinton here http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~tijmen/csc321/slides/lecture_slides_lec6.pdf)
with an initial learning rate of 0.0001. We trained our network for 300 epochs with 24 images per batch.

We found that 6.4% of the forest canopy was covered by canopy palms (

128 pixels over the region where palms were manually
delineated resulted in a sample of 1024 images and their associated labelled masks to train the model.
Among these images, 980 contained canopy palms and background and 44 contained only background.
819 images (80%) were used for the training and 205 (20%) for independent validation. The training
dataset contained 1,038,807 canopy palm pixels and 12,379,689 background pixels while the validation
dataset contained 265,309 canopy palm pixels and 3,093,411 background pixels. The size of 128
128 pixels was selected because studied objects are smaller than 128 pixels in size (128 pixels =
×
38.4 m) and their distribution is not dependent on a larger context. The images were extracted from
uniform grids of 128
128 pixels without any overlap between neighboring images. During network
training, we used a standard stochastic gradient descent optimization. The loss function was designed

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly state the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions that the network was trained for 300 epochs with a batch size of 24 images. This suggests that the number of epochs or iterations could be one criterion used to decide when to stop training. Additionally, since the model uses the optimizer RMSprop, which is an adaptive learning rate method, it might also consider changes in the learning rate or convergence of the learning process as indicators for stopping training. Unfortunately, there is no explicit mention of using validation loss plateau as a criterion for determining when training should be stopped.
