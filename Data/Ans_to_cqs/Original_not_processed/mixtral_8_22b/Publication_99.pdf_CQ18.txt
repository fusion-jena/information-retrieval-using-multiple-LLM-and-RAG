3.3.3. Classification 

Pretrained classification models such as VGG16 have demonstrated 
to perform well on various plant species identification tasks (Pang and 
Lim,  2019).  To  train  our  classification  model,  we  adapted  the  vgg16 
network  pre-trained  on  ImageNet  dataset  (Simonyan  and  Zisserman, 
2014). The fully connected layers of the networks were replaced with a 
global max-pooling layer, a dropout layer with a dropout ratio of 0.5 as a 
network regularizer and single hidden layer with a total of 256 units for 
a larger image sized model(512 × 512) and 128 units for a smaller image 
size model (256 × 256). Both networks were trained for 20 epochs with 
a  batch  size  of 32  and  various data augmentation  techniques such as 
height and width shift, flipping, zooming and brightness changes were

applied.  All  input  images  were  preprocessed  by  mean  centering  the 
image with ImageNet values and then rescaled between 0 and 1. Since 
our dataset was balanced, both networks were trained with a learning 
rate of 0.03, cross-entropy loss as a loss function optimized by Adam 
optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014). Table 2 summarizes the parameter 
used for training each model.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions that the networks were trained for 20 epochs with a batch size of 32 using cross-entropy loss as a loss function optimized by Adam optimizer. This suggests that monitoring the model performance might involve observing metrics like accuracy or loss over epochs during training. Additionally, since the dataset was balanced, it can be assumed that standard practices such as splitting the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets could also be employed to evaluate the model's performance.
