monitoring wildlife (Clarfeld et al., 2023; Ferreira et al., 2020; Leorna 
and Brinkman, 2022; Santoro et al., 2022; Sim˜oes et al., 2023; Tan et al., 
2022; Villa et al., 2017; Willi et al., 2019). For instance, Ferreira et al. 
(2020) identified individual birds with Mask-RCNN (He et al., 2017) and 
the  VGG  network  (Simonyan  and  Zisserman,  2014).  Some  researches 
present techniques for addressing imbalanced class recognition of ani-
mal  species  in  camera-trap  images  (Cunha  et  al.,  2023;  Yang  et  al., 
2021). As for detecting wildlife, Tan et al. (2022) conducted an evalu-
ation  of  the  effectiveness  of  object  detection  algorithms  on  mammal 
wildlife.  Clarfeld  et  al.  (2023)  and  Leorna  et  al.  (2022)  compared 
humans and machines’ ability to detect wildlife in camera trap images, 
showing the potential of machine learning in detecting. We summarize 
the related wildlife monitoring works in Table 1.

Ortmann and Johnson, 2021). Secondly, dataset noise is another factor 
that  affects  the  algorithm’s  performance  in  identifying  specific  bird 
species.  This  noise  can  arise  for  a  number  of  reasons,  for  example, 
vandalism, animal damage, loss of power or extreme weather. According 
to Foster (2008), we believe that it is common and may be difficult to 
avoid. In complex environments, environmental clutter and ambiguities 
may affect the bird detection dataset, resulting in a noisy dataset. These 
conditions  make  it  difficult  for  the  algorithm  to  accurately  learn  the 
features of a particular bird species during training, thus affecting its 
detection and recognition capabilities.

The  results  indicate  that  the  Cascade  RCNN  outperformed  other 
models at each training stage, while the FCOS model and Sparse CNN 
model consistently had lower mAP scores than others. This is consistent 
with  the  findings  of  Section  3.1.  Although  12  epochs  were  a  typical 
number of training times, almost all models reached the maximum mAP 
when the number of epochs reached 10. Therefore, for bird recognition, 
not  all  models  are  better  with  more  training  times,  and  choosing 

appropriate  training  times  for  different  models  is  beneficial  to  save 
computing resources. Specifically, the Cascade RCNN model had almost 
no  increase  in  the  mAP  at  9  epochs,  and  the  Faster  CNN  model  also 
showed a similar trend. However, the ATSS and RepPoint growth curves 
continued to 12 epochs, suggesting they require more training data or a 
longer training schedule to perform better.

Helpful Answer:

While the given context does not directly mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, some relevant information can still be extracted from the text. The authors discuss the issue of imbalanced class recognition of animal species in camera-trap images, which could potentially be addressed by using techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets based on certain criteria, ensuring that each subset maintains the same distribution of classes as the original dataset. Oversampling increases the representation of minority classes by duplicating samples, while undersampling reduces the majority class size to balance the dataset. Diverse data collection aims to gather a wide range of examples representing various scenarios, conditions, and variations within the target classes.

Although these techniques are not explicitly mentioned in the context, they have been widely applied in deep learning pipelines to mitigate data biases and improve overall performance. It should be noted that the choice of technique depends on factors like dataset characteristics, computational resources, and desired outcomes.

In conclusion, while the given context does not provide explicit details about techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, commonly employed methods include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.
