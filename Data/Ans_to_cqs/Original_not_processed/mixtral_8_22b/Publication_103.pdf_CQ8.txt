Discussion and conclusions
This study is, to our knowledge, the first one that ana-
lyzes a big dataset with thousands of specimen images
from herbaria and uses deep learning. Results show the
potential of deep learning on herbarium species identifi-
cation, particularly by training and testing across different
herbarium datasets. This could potentially lead to the cre-
ation of a semi, or even fully, automatic system to help

taxonomists and experts do their annotation, classifica-
tion, and revision work at herbarium.

Finally, based on our results, we believe that the devel-
opment of deep learning technology based on herbarium
data, together with the recent recognition of e-publication
in the International Code of Nomenclature [41] will also
contribute to significantly increase the volume of descrip-
tions of new species in the following years.

ertheless, in the last five years, deep learning has become
a promising tool to handle extremely complex computer
vision tasks. Additionally, online portals of ambitious ini-
tiatives such as iDigBio already provide access to more
than 14 million herbarium images [9] that are particu-
larly useful for deep learning approaches [10]. Thus, it
is now possible to use images of herbaria thanks to cur-
rent advances in machine learning and initiatives such as
iDigBio.

• I.H255.H255: The neural network was pre-trained
on the generalist dataset ImageNet to initialize the
weights, fine-tuned on the Herbarium255 training set
(70%), and tested on the Herbarium255 test set (30%).

• R.H1K.H1K: The neural network was initialized

Herbarium specimen classification
These experiments aim at assessing the feasibility of using
a deep learning system dedicated to herbarium specimen
identification at a realistic scale (255 species from Costa-
Rica in Herbarium255 and 1K species from France in
Herbarium1K). Herbarium255 was divided in 70% train-
ing data and the rest 30% as test data used for computing
the top-1 and top-5 classification accuracy. Herbarium1K
was divided in 80 and 20% respectively, to keep the pro-
portion of the data provided by the PC challenge. The
separation was done by species, and within each species,

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The paper does not mention where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide information about its location on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
