2.2. Data and processing 

Detailed information of the data in this study can be obtained from 
Table 1. The Google Earth Engine platform, as a planetary-level cloud 
computing platform, provides rich remote sensing data (Gorelick et al., 
2017). This study selected the 16-day synthesized MOD13Q1 V6 NDVI 
dataset(MODIS NDVI), the daily NOAA Climate Data Record (CDR) of 
AVHRR NDVI V5 dataset(CDR AVHRR NDVI)(Eric et al., 2024), and the 
third  generation  GIMMS  NDVI  from  AVHRR  sensors  dataset  (GIMMS 
NDVI) on the Google Earth Engine platform. The SPOT/VEGETATION 
products (SPOT NDVI), administrative divisions, and DEM datasets are 
sourced  from  the  Resource  and  Environmental  Data  Center  of  the

posite  data,  the  annual  mean  NDVI  data  (January–December),  the 
growing season mean NDVI data (March–November), the spring mean 
NDVI data (March–May), the summer mean NDVI data (June–August), 
and  the  winter  mean  NDVI  data  (September–November)  were

NDVIR = MAX(NDVIi)

(2) 

Among them, NDVIR is the monthly (annual) NDVI value, and NDVI i 

is the value before synthesis. 

2.3.3. NDVI classification analysis 

The Jenks natural breaks optimization method is a statistical tech-
nique designed to determine the optimal classification by maximizing 
the variance between classes and minimizing the variance within clas-
ses, thereby identifying natural groupings in the data (Jenks, 1967). The 
Jenks natural breaks optimization method has been widely applied in 
the classification research of vegetation indices, such as NDVI and Soil 
Adjusted  Vegetation  Index  (SAVI)  classification  research  (Anchang 
et al., 2016; Silva Costa et al., 2023). To accurately compare the dif-
ferences in value sizes between different NDVI products, we used the 
Jenks  natural  breaks  optimization  method  to  divide  the  average  or 
maximum values of four NDVI products at different time scales into six

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of using a deep learning model for any specific task like classification, segmentation, or object detection. However, it does discuss the use of the Jenks natural breaks optimization method for classifying NDVI products at different time scales. Therefore, one could infer that if a deep learning model was employed in this study, its purpose might have been related to improving the accuracy of NDVI product classification. Nonetheless, without further context regarding the application of a deep learning model, it remains speculative.
