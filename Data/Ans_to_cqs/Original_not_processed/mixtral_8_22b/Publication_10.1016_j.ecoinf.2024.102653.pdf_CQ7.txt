Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

2.4. Model training and hyperparameters 

The  model’s  weights  were  randomly  initialized  using  a  specific 
integer seed to guarantee consistent reproducibility of results. Further-
more, meticulous manual tuning of hyperparameters was conducted to 
achieve  optimal  model  performance.  The  selected  hyperparameters, 
which yielded the best performance metrics, are presented in Table 1. 

2.5. Model validation 

Two distinct validation methodologies were implemented. The first 
method  involved  partitioning  the dataset into  training and  validation 
sets, with 70% of the data designated for training and 30% for valida-
tion.  This  division  was  performed  through  random  selection  (Dobbin 
and Simon, 2011).

2.6. Performance metrics 

Conventional  metrics  were  used  to  evaluate  the  model’s  perfor-
mance, such as confusion matrices, accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, 
Cohen  Kappa,  and  the  area under  the  ROC curve,  some of  which  are 
defined below (Johnson and Khoshgoftaar, 2019).

This study used the train_test_split function from the scikit-learn library 
(version 1.2.2), a function that facilitates randomized shuffling and di-
vision of datasets into distinct training and testing subsets. Specifically, 
70%  of  the  data  was  designated for  training  the  classification  model, 
while the remaining 30% was set aside for testing (Dobbin and Simon, 
2011). Individuals from the control and pesticide-exposed groups were 
evenly  distributed  between  these  subsets,  guaranteeing  a  balanced 
representation of each class. The recurrent neural network (RNN) model 
was designed to incorporate three primary input parameters: the bee’s 
age, the daily number of flights, and the total time spent outside daily. 
Following  data  preparation,  labels  for  both  training  and  testing 
datasets  underwent  a  transformation  known  as  one-hot  encoding, 
facilitated  by  the  OneHotEncoder  function  from  the  scikit-learn  library

The model was trained using varying disjoint subsets of the dataset in 
order to assess the number of recordings necessary to yield satisfactory 
classification  metrics.  These  subsets  corresponded  to  different  time 
steps, namely 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 days of flight activity recordings. 
Subsequent  experiments  included  training  the  model  with  various 
combinations of datasets: 1, 2, 3, or all four datasets combined. These 
raw  and curated versions of the datasets are  readily accessible in the 
Code and Data Availability section.

Helpful Answer:
Answer: The data was split into training and validation sets using a ratio of 70% for training and 30% for validation. This division was carried out through random selection. Additionally, the train_test_split function from the scikit-learn library was employed to further divide the data into distinct training and testing subsets. In this case, 70% of the data was allocated for training the classification model, while the remaining 30% was reserved for testing. It is important to note that individuals from the control and pesticide-exposed groups were evenly distributed between these subsets to ensure a balanced representation of each class.
