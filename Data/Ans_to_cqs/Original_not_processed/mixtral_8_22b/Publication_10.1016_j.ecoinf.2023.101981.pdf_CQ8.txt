different Sika Deer vocalizations (range 2–70%, Enari et al., 2019). A 
recent study using the Red Deer as a study species obtained recall rates 
of  approximately  90%  for  the  five  supervised  machine  learning  algo-
rithms tested, suggesting that the creation of sophisticated models could 
clearly improve the detection of ungulate vocalization.

dominated by a mosaic of forested and savanna areas, were separated by

2.2. Acoustic monitoring 

We  deployed  an  acoustic  recorder  (Song  Meter  SM2  recorder, 
Wildlife  Acoustics)  at  each  site.  The  Song  Meters  were  active  from  8 
June 2015 to 31 May 2016 and programmed to record (.wav format) the 
first 15 min of each hour. The sampling rate was 48 kHz, with 16 bits per 
sample resolution. The devices were checked weekly to download data 
and change batteries. A total of 32,023 15-min recordings (8006 h of 
recording) were collected (8044 at Station A, 8075 at Station B, 7782 at 
Station C, and 8122 at Station D).
