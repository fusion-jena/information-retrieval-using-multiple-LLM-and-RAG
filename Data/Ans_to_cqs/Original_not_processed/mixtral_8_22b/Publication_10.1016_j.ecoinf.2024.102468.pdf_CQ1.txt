4. Discussion 

This section discusses the findings and results of the study on blue 
whale vocalizations, considering the performance of the proposed WT- 
HMM  across  varying  dataset  sizes,  how  it  compared  to  other  x-HMM 
detectors,  and  its  comparison  with  other  machine  learning  detectors. 
The discussion is based on relevant studies from the literature.

2.2. Data denoising 

2.3. Data annotations 

Whale sound recordings typically contain some ambient noise from 
both geophonic (rain, sea currents, drifting icebergs, etc.) and anthro-
pogenic (sonar, vessel traffic, wind energy, and oil and gas exploration, 
among other sources) (Shabangu et al., 2022). Therefore, filtering and 
denoising contribute to improving the quality of the signal and ensuring 
that the subsequent feature extraction process is effective.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer that whale sound recordings are likely collected through underwater acoustic sensors or hydrophones deployed in marine environments. These devices capture sounds produced by various marine organisms, including whales, which can then be analyzed using deep learning techniques such as wavelet transform hidden Markov models (WT-HMM) and other machine learning detectors. Public datasets may also be available for research purposes, but this information is not directly stated in the given context.
