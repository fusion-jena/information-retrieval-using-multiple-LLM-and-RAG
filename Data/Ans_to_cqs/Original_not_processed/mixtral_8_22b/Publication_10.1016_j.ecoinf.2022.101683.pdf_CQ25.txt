Each of the iSDMs at the four different spatial extents were further 
subject to five treatments to test the impact of potential biases and error: 
a) Random backgrounds where 100% of training records were used, and 
background points were selected at random from the full extent of the 
model.  b)  Spatial  filtering  input  data  to  reduce  problems  of  spatial 
autocorrelation, where all species records were thinned using the soft-
ware OccurrenceThinner (Verbruggen et al., 2013), in a manner to filter 
out a greater proportion of sightings where the density of records was 
highest  based  on  their  kernel  density  (Fig.  1c;  with  densities  per  cell 
rescaled  to  an  index  from  0  to  1).  Species  records  were  selected  for 
deletion randomly from those cells with a kernel density index between 
0.5 and 1.0 giving an increased chance of removing records from the 
highest density areas. Over 10 cross-validated model runs, an average of

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the purpose of the deep learning model. However, it mentions several evaluation metrics such as AUC, TPR, TSS, Kappa, and Omission, which are commonly used in binary classification tasks. Therefore, it can be inferred that the deep learning model might have been developed for a classification task, possibly predicting the presence or absence of a certain species within a given geographical area.
