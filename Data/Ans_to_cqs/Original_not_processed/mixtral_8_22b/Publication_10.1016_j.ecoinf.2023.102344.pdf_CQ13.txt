means the images where the extracted numerical features were used in 
Approach 1 during training were the exact images used in training in

Approach 3 utilized the same PCA-NCA-selected bivalve features of 
Approach  1  as  inputs  to  six  combination  models  of  3-layer  sequence 
neural  networks  that  are  primarily  composed  of  LSTM,  GRU,  and 
BiLSTM. The six developed models using sequence neural networks are 
hybrid PCA-NCA and GRU-LSTM-BiLSTM sequence (BivalveNet), LSTM- 
GRU-BiLSTM, LSTM-BiLSTM-GRU, GRU-BiLSTM-LSTM, BiLSTM-LSTM- 
GRU,  and  BiLSTM-GRU-LSTM  (Fig.  10),  and  among  these  predictive 
traceability models, the GRU-LSTM-BiLSTM resulted as the most accu-
rate, sensitive, and specific model with the following scores, 96.91%, 
96%, and 96%, respectively (Table 1). Hence, the GRU-LSTM-BiLSTM is 
considered the BivalveNet. Interestingly, BivalveNet has the lowest fall- 
out of 4% among all models among Approaches 1 to 3 which means that 
it has the lowest misprediction instances for both false positive and false 
negative (Table 1). This claim is supported by the confusion matrix in

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit details about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the study uses a "Hyperparameter-tuned batch-updated stochastic gradient descent" method for plant species identification. This suggests that the authors have likely tuned various hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and possibly others like momentum or weight decay. Unfortunately, without more specific information, we cannot definitively state what those values might be.
