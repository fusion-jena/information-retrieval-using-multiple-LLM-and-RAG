compressed,  reducing  to  only  a  few  pixels  in  deeper  CNN  layers.  For 
instance, an object with dimensions of 15 × 15 pixels in a UAV thermal 
image might be represented by just 1 pixel in the feature map from Layer 
4 of ResNet152 (refer to Fig. 4). The limited spatial resolution can lead to 
loss of fine details, making it difficult for the model to distinguish small 
objects from the background. Through FPN, different feature maps from 
different layers can complement each other, and deeper feature map can 
receive some spatial information from shallower layers. However, still 
certain  spatial  features  might  have  been  lost  during  the  process  of 
convolution operations. Consequently, the models of FRC_ResNet18FPN 
and FRC_ResNet34FPN can obtain higher AP for medium and large ob-
jects than the remaining models because they have less CNN layers than 
others.  Notably,  the  FRC_ResNet152FPN  obtains  the  best  detection

The number of deer instances in each image varies, ranging from 1 to 
72. The frequency histogram illustrating this distribution is depicted in 
Fig.  9,  and  an  example  image  containing  72  deer  annotations  is  dis-
played in Fig. 10. According to Fig. 9, it is evident that the distribution of 
deer numbers across the different images in the dataset is unbalanced, 
which  may  raise  concerns  if  the  dataset  is  randomly  divided  into 
training,  validation,  and  testing  subsets.  To  address  this  issue,  the 
dataset is initially divided into separate subsets based on the number of 
deer in each image. Within each subset, the images are further parti-
tioned into three sections using a ratio of 75:15:15. Subsequently, the

For deep learning-based object detection, two fundamental elements, 
feature  maps  and  anchor  boxes,  play  critical  roles.  Feature  maps  are 
extracted from original images and utilized to identify potential objects 
of  interest  and  locate  their  rough  positions  within  an  image.  Subse-
quently, anchor boxes come into play for generating regions of interest 
(RoIs)  and  facilitating  bounding  box  regression,  which  enables  the 
refinement of RoIs to better match the bounding box of the objects of 
interest. In the general definition of CNNs, the CNN layers that are closer 
to the input layer are called shallower layers, while deeper layers are 
those more distant  from the  input  layer. In the  architecture of  object 
detection,  various  CNNs—such  as  ResNet18,  ResNet34,  ResNet50, 
ResNet101, and ResNet152—differ in the overall depth of their layers. 
These CNNs are used to extract feature maps from the original imagery.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention or discussion about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific strategy related to this topic based solely on the provided text. However, common practices in dealing with randomness in deep learning include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, employing techniques like cross-validation, and utilizing ensemble methods to reduce variance caused by random initialization.
