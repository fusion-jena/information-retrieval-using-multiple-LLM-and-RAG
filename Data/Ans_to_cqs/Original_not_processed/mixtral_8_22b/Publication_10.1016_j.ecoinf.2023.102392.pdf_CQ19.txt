have  demonstrated  that  deep  learning  models  perform  well  in  object 
recognition and categorization (Shetty, 2019; Talukdar et al., 2020). In 
particular, the eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model has gained 
popularity  due  to  its  ability  to  identify  features  and  patterns  in  large 
image datasets (Friedman, 2001; Hamedianfar et al., 2022). Neverthe-
less, the application of deep learning models to detect and categorize 
forest  types  utilizing  high  spatial  and  ultra-high  resolution  remote 
sensing data is still uncommon (Georganos et al., 2018). Moreover, the 
risk of forest fire is also affected by the features of the forest condition 
(Reich et al., 2001). During dry weather, the forest states with numerous 
oil trees, vines, dry branches, and fallen leaves will burn more quickly 
than in other forest conditions (Doran et al., 2004; Ebright et al., 2023; 
Hardison,  1976).  As  a  result,  reliable  forest-type  categorization  is

inference system with ABC optimization technique to enhance the pre-
diction model’s performance. In a prior study conducted by Pham et al. 
(2023), the ACO-NFS model was utilized to estimate the extent of forest 
fire in the Bo Trach district, Quang Binh province. However, the authors 
of that study solely focused on one specific type of forest cover without 
addressing  the  susceptibility  of  different  forest  types  to  wildfires. 
Considering these limitations, our experiment aims to integrate a hybrid 
model  for  predicting  forest  fires  vulnerability  with  a  deep  learning 
model-based approach for forests classification.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given information, it is not possible to determine which specific frameworks were used to build the deep learning models mentioned in the papers. The papers do not provide explicit details about the programming languages or libraries used to develop their models. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding whether they used TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other specific deep learning framework.
