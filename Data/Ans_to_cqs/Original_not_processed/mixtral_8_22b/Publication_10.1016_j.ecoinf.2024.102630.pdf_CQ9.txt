2.2. Data and processing 

Detailed information of the data in this study can be obtained from 
Table 1. The Google Earth Engine platform, as a planetary-level cloud 
computing platform, provides rich remote sensing data (Gorelick et al., 
2017). This study selected the 16-day synthesized MOD13Q1 V6 NDVI 
dataset(MODIS NDVI), the daily NOAA Climate Data Record (CDR) of 
AVHRR NDVI V5 dataset(CDR AVHRR NDVI)(Eric et al., 2024), and the 
third  generation  GIMMS  NDVI  from  AVHRR  sensors  dataset  (GIMMS 
NDVI) on the Google Earth Engine platform. The SPOT/VEGETATION 
products (SPOT NDVI), administrative divisions, and DEM datasets are 
sourced  from  the  Resource  and  Environmental  Data  Center  of  the

posite  data,  the  annual  mean  NDVI  data  (January–December),  the 
growing season mean NDVI data (March–November), the spring mean 
NDVI data (March–May), the summer mean NDVI data (June–August), 
and  the  winter  mean  NDVI  data  (September–November)  were

NDVI datasets are mainly distributed in the western, central, and eastern 
regions of WS, as well as the Chengdu Plain region of SB. In contrast, the 
high-value areas are mainly distributed in the southern and northeastern 
regions of WS, the northern and southern regions of SS, the northern and 
southern regions of SB, and the junction of WS, SS, and SB. The spatial 
distribution  differences  of  the  values  of  the  four  NDVI  products  are 
mainly concentrated in the eastern region of WS and the central region 
of SB.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide specific information about where the data repository for the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it mentions that the data used in this study was sourced from the Google Earth Engine platform and the Resource and Environmental Data Center of Western China. It also lists several datasets such as the 16-day synthesized MOD13Q1 V6 NDVI dataset, the daily NOAA Climate Data Record (CDR) of AVHRR NDVI V5 dataset, and the third generation GIMMS NDVI from AVHRR sensors dataset. Unfortunately, without more specific details, I cannot determine the exact location or name of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline.
