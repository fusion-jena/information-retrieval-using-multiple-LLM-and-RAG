3.2. Performance of the models and forecast distribution 

The  mean  accuracies  and  standard  deviations  of  the  5  × 10-fold 
cross-validations  for  each  method  and  species  are  shown  in  Table  4. 
Random Forest is the method that achieves the highest accuracy for all 
the analysed species (0.718 for SKJ, 0.728 for YFT, 0.589 for BET and 
0.842 for FAL). Consequently, this is the method that has been used to 
build the prediction models. 

A  model  has  been  trained  for  each  species,  by  using  the  selected 
variables in Table 3. Then, for each model, the probabilities of finding 
high and low catches and absences of each species in the study area have 
been predicted by using the corresponding predictors given in Table 3. 
The results of the validation of the trained models are shown in Table 5,

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The article does not provide information on the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it mentions that Random Forest was the method used to build the prediction models, which suggests that traditional machine learning methods were employed rather than deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), or transformers.
