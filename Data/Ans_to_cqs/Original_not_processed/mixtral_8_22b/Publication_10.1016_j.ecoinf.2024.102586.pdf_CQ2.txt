2.2. Data sources

native  and  alien  species  pools.  This  was  followed  by  separating  the 
specimens of the native species (~ 3200) from the alien species (~ 800). 
The specimens of alien species belonged to different categories such as 
cultivated, casual, naturalised and invasive. Only the specimens of those

2) What are the relative roles of these drivers in determining the rich-

ness and abundance of invasive alien species in the region?  

3)  Does the relative importance of these drivers differ between the two 

diversity metrics (i.e., species richness and abundance)?

the  OpenLandMap  Soil  Organic  Carbon  Content  (Hengl  and  Wheeler, 
2018). We used the mean value of soil water content, pH and organic 
carbon content available at six depths. These variables, available at 250 
m resolution, were aggregated to a spatial resolution of 1 km2  in the 
Google Earth Engine (https://earthengine.google.com/platform/; Gor-
elick  et  al.,  2017).  Topographic  variables  such  as  slope,  aspect  and 
elevation, which determine the steepness, direction (north, south, east, 
west) and altitudinal height in the mountainous regions, were extracted 
from GTOPO with a spatial resolution of 1 km2 (https://www.usgs.gov/ 
centers/eros/science/usgs-eros-archive-digital-elevation-global-30-arc- 
second-elevation-gtopo30).  Since  the  study  area  is  predominantly 
mountainous,  topographic  factors  are  expected  to  be  a  critical  factor 
influencing  invasive  plant  diversity  and  distribution  (Zhang  et  al.,

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it does not provide details about the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot accurately determine whether they use image, audio, video, or CSV files for their analysis. However, considering the nature of the research involving specimen categorization and environmental factors, it can be assumed that they might have used structured datasets like CSV or Excel files containing relevant information about each specimen and its corresponding environment. Additionally, satellite imagery could also potentially be utilized to extract topographical features. Nevertheless, without explicit mention of the data format, this remains purely speculative.
