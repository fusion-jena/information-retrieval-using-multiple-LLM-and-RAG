A critical characteristic of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 
model is its training phase’s simplicity, which can be achieved by using a 
smaller amount of weights compared to the fully connected architecture. 
In addition, it allows the extraction of key features (Guo et al., 2023). 

2.6.2. Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU) 

The  Gated  Recurrent  Unit  (GRU)  was  a  sort  of  RNN  that  worked 
analogously to that of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. To 
control gradient disappearance and gradient explosion in conventional 
RNN  models, GRU  was  first implemented  in  2014  (Cho  et  al., 2014). 
GRU  can  mitigate  the  gradient  vanishing  issue  in  RNN,  decrease  the 
number of LSTM parameters, and reduce the training period (Niu et al., 
2022). The GRU algorithm may be described as follows: The memory 
cell  of  GRU  primarily  consists  of  two  types  of  gates:  reset  gates  and 
update gates. The linkage relationship formulas are:

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding whether GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware resources were utilized during the training process. It would be best to refer back to the original source material or consult with the authors/researchers involved in developing this model for more accurate details about their chosen hardware setup.
