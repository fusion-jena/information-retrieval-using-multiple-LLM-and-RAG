900 s, at a sample rate of 6 kHz with a low pass anti-aliasing filter at 2.8 
kHz. A gentle high-pass roll off was applied below 8 Hz to flatten the sea 
noise spectra and increase the dynamic range of the recordings. Cali-
bration was carried out using injection of white noise in series with the 
hydrophone  to  obtain  frequency  response  data  to  enable  correction 
during post-processing. See McCauley et al. (2017) for full calibration 
details.
