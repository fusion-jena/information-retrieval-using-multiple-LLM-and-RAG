The EF network architecture consisted of three convolutional layers (Conv) including the
Rectiﬁed Linear Unit (ReLU), two Max-pooling layers (MaxPool), and two Fully Connected layers
(FC), with a softmax layer at the end with two outputs, corresponding to “deforestation” and
“no-deforestation” classes. The ﬁlter and output size of each layer are summarized in Table 3.

For training the EF and SN models, we selected the following setup empirically: batch size equal
to 32 with 100 number of epochs, early stopping after 10 epochs with no improvement (over the
validation set) and a dropout rate of 0.2 in the ﬁnal FC layer. Additionally, Adam optimizer was
selected empirically with weight decay equal to 0.9 and learning rate equal to 10−3. As loss function,
we used the binary cross-entropy.

Goals And Contributions

This work evaluates Deep-Learning based techniques applied to deforestation detection in
the Amazon and Cerrado biomes.

For comparison purposes, we used a SVM classiﬁer, which was taken as the baseline. The main
objective is to reduce the human effort involved in monitoring programs such as the Amazon
Deforestation Monitoring Project and the Cerrado Monitoring Project. In addition, this work aims at
contributing to improve accuracy and reduce the subjectivity inherent to human photointerpretation,
besides the reduction of costs and time for monitoring the vegetation of these biomes, which meets the
need for constant improvement of monitoring instruments [45].

The main contributions of this work are:
