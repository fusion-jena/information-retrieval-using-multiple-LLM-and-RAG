Between-datasets classification

For the between-dataset prediction, the CNN model was trained with

set and AccT and ΔAcc were measured. We ran the above procedures
for three source–target pairs (training dataset!predicted dataset),
GH!LH, GH!LL and LL!LH. These settings simulate two alternative
scenarios: (i) a global image database is used to predict local samples
(GH!LH and GH!LL) and (ii) conventional

Effects of datasets and the number of images

The accuracy of within-dataset classification and the effect of the

training was done using taxon labels from the source images and data-

training images on prediction accuracy, whereby the CNN model was

trained with N images randomly selected from the dataset and predicted

the class (family label) of n test images randomly selected from the rest.

N ranged between 100 and 700 for LH (with intervals of 100 images),
between 50 and 250 for LL (with intervals of 50 images) and between
100 and 900 for GH (with intervals of 100 images). The number of test
images n was set to 200 for LH and GH, and 50 for LL due to the small
size of the dataset. To evaluate the consistency of prediction accuracy,

Helpful Answer:
A convolutional neural network (CNN) is used in the pipeline for this study. This can be seen in several places throughout the given text. For example, when discussing the between-dataset classification, it mentions that "the CNN model was trained with a source dataset." Additionally, when describing the effects of datasets and the number of images, it states that "the CNN model was trained with N images randomly selected from the dataset." Furthermore, Figure 2 also refers to a CNN architecture. Therefore, based on these references, we can conclude that a CNN is being utilized in this research.
