similarities. It is widely used to visualize high-dimensional data (van der 
Maaten  and Hinton, 2008). Here the  method has been applied to the 
fc1000 activation vectors returned by ResNet-50. 

4.2. Classifier model 

The labeled dataset was split 70/30 into training and testing data-
sets.  For  model  selection  and  parameter  optimization  50%  of  the 
training data were held-out for validation (see Supporting Information). 
The final classification model, a SVM with a cubic polynomial kernel, 
was trained using the ResNet-50 fc1000 activations of the full training 
dataset. A 10-fold cross-validation was then used to define the score-to- 
posterior-probability transformation function (Platt, 2000), which pro-
vides a basis for estimating the posterior probability for new observa-
tions. Fig. 9 shows a confusion matrix for the test data not seen during 
training.

Fig. 4. Illustration  showing the  five lowest  and five 
highest frequency kernels used to identify candidate 
boatwhistle  calls.  Each  mimics  the  lowest  two  har-
monics  of  an  idealized  boatwhistle.  By  default,  the 
lowest  frequency  kernel  considered  has  a  starting 
fundamental  frequency  of  102.5  Hz,  with  a  down-
ward sweep of 3 Hz over the kernel duration of 240 
msec.  Subsequent  kernels  increase  the  fundamental 
frequency in  steps of 2.94  Hz (i.e., the resolution of 
the data spectrogram) with the same down-sweep and 
duration. By default, 81 kernels are considered, with 
the  highest  frequency  kernel  having  a  starting 
fundamental  frequency  of  336.9  Hz.  The  kernel 
height (frequency range) is fixed for each template.

3.2. Cataloging overview 

The  description  below  assumes  that  the  acoustic  waveforms  have 
been  sampled  (or  re-sampled)  at  a  rate  of  24  kHz,  demeaned,  and 
pressure  corrected.  The  approach  utilizes  a  multi-stage  workflow. 
Candidate signals are identified by matching a suite of harmonic kernels 
using spectrogram cross-correlation (modified after Ricci et al., 2017a). 
Machine learning is then used to mitigate the false alarm rate associated 
with  the  detection  stage  (e.g.,  Balantic  and  Donovan,  2020;  Bohnen-
stiehl, 2023a). Frequency-reassigned spectrogram images are generated

when weights are used, the range of the kernels receiving full weight 
should be set larger than the confidence interval of the prediction.

Helpful Answer:
According to the given information, it appears that the hyperparameters of the model were optimized using a hold-out validation strategy. Specifically, 50% of the training data was held out for validation purposes. However, the exact methodology used for hyperparameter tuning, such as grid search or random search, is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. Therefore, based on the available information, we cannot definitively state how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized beyond knowing that a hold-out validation strategy was employed.
