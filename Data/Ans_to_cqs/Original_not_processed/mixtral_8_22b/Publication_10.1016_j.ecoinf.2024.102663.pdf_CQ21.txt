Random Forest Regressor exhibits the longest training time. However, 
the potential improvement in performance may warrant the investment 
of additional effort. Performance of Linear Regression, Lasso, and Ridge 
models is deemed unsatisfactory despite their efficient training times.

The last model is the biomass estimator. It takes input length and width 
in cm and turbidity and outputs biomass in mg.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there isn't a direct mention of any specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, we can infer some possible postprocessing steps based on the context provided.

For instance, since the study involves object detection using YOLOv8, it would be reasonable to assume that postprocessing might involve generating bounding boxes around detected objects or calculating metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, etc., to evaluate the performance of the models. Additionally, confusion matrices could also be used to visualize the performance of the classifiers.

Moreover, considering that the research focuses on fish species identification and biomass estimation, saliency maps could potentially be employed as a postprocessing step to highlight important features contributing to the final predictions made by the models. This technique helps improve interpretability and understanding of deep learning models.

However, without explicit details regarding the postprocessing steps mentioned in the paper, these assumptions remain speculative. Therefore, further clarification from the authors or access to more detailed information about the methodology would be required to provide a definitive answer.
