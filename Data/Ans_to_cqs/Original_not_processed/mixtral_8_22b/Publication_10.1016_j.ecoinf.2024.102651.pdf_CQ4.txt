tion and Transformer, effectively extracts richer semantic features (Xie 
et al., 2024). A network based on CNN and ViT modules classified mi-
croorganisms with an accuracy of 67.62% (Dwivedi et al., 2024).

increase in accuracy compared to the ResNet and ViT. By incorporating 
CAM, the network gains the capability to attend to important regions, 
thus improving classification accuracy.

The proposed classification network in this paper demonstrates su-
perior performance on the dataset, as indicated by the results presented 
in Table 3. In each classification network, the accuracy for the “medium” 
is consistently higher than that for the “small”. Besides, the experimental 
data in Table 3 also indicates that the classification network proposed 
achieves the highest classification accuracy among the “medium”  and 
“small”.  In  our  proposed  model,  the  classification  accuracy  for  both 
“medium”  and “small”  is improved by 3.56% and 2.93% respectively, 
compared to the ResNet50 and ViT. Additionally, the classification ac-
curacy for the “medium” is 5.6% higher compare with the “small” in the 
CA-Hybrid network.

CA-Hybrid network based on CNN and ViT (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) is 
constructed as the classification network to precisely categorize Cervi-
dae  localized  by  YOLOv7.  Within  the  CA-Hybrid  network,  by  intro-
ducing the CAM (Woo et al., 2018) in the CNN, the network was able to 
focus more on critical features, which boosted the generalization ability 
of the model. Finally, when utilizing the same classification network for 
both small  objects(pixels less than 32*32) and  medium objects(pixels 
between 32*32 and 96*96) to evaluate the influence of image size on 
classification performance, the medium objects achieved higher classi-
fication  accuracy  compared  to  small  objects  under  identical  network. 
Furthermore, by comparing the performance of our monitoring pipeline 
with  object  detection  networks,  the  effectiveness  of  the  pipeline  was 
demonstrated. The pipeline effectively resolves the issue of background
