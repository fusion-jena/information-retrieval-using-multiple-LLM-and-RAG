Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

2.1. Operational workflow 

The whole process of data acquisition and processing, reported in the 
following  section,  is  called  Knowledge  Discovery  in  Databases  (KDD) 
(Kotu and Deshpande, 2015); it is a process of identifying patterns or 
relationships  within  a  dataset  useful  to  make  important  decisions 
(Hammad and AbouRizk, 2014). This process does not involve applying 
data-mining  techniques  but  requires  more  actions  to  reach  the  final 
result. 

The KDD sequence applied in our case study included the following 

steps:  

• identification of the aim for a specific study area;  
• pre-selection of useful data to achieve the objective;  
• analytical determinations for the detection of PPPs in Puglia surface 

water bodies;  

• optimisation and elaboration of the obtained results through:

In short, data mining ensures that starting from “cryptic” information 
scattered without apparent order in a database, we arrive at knowledge 
that can be exploited for various purposes (Kotu and Deshpande, 2015). 
It is also possible to implement (Online document, 2022b) an automatic 
elaboration  workflow  with  open-source  software  without  using  an 
operator who reprocesses the data each time. Data mining can be sup-
ported  by well-known  and  widely applied  data  processing techniques 
such as verifying or interpreting results (Hamdi et al., 2022).

• Mapping and interpretation of the results: It evaluates whether the 
objective has been achieved, and if the answer is no, it proceeds with 
the reiteration (and possible modification) of the previous step and 
sometimes further steps.  

• display of results in an understandable format;
