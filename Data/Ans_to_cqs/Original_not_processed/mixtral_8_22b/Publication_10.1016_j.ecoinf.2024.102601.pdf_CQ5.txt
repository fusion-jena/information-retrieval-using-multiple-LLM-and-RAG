In the domain of WSM utilizing ML models, optimizing data struc-
tures is paramount. Our study’s engagement with this challenge has led 
to identifying efficient data structures for ML classification. This opti-
mization focuses on the strategic selection of predictors from S2 imagery 
and  the  integration  of  XAI  techniques.  Specifically,  we  optimize  the 
input  matrix  X  = i  × j,  where  I  represents  the  number  of  predictors 
(columns) and j represents the number of training points (rows). We aim 
to select the 12 most pertinent predictors from S2 imagery to enhance

gorithms, as explored by Collins et al. (2018), demonstrate significant 
potential in accurately classifying burn areas and severity levels using 
spectral data. Following this, Montorio et al. (2020) utilized synthetic 
spectral  databases—created  from  linear  spectral  mixing—to  further 
develop  RF-based classifiers and  regression models tailored  for WSM. 
Complementing  these  efforts,  Seydi  et  al.  (2022)  demonstrated  the 
utility  of  deep  learning  in  extracting  complex  patterns  from  high- 
dimensional S2 satellite imagery, leading to notable improvements in 
the  accuracy  of  severity  classifications.  Furthermore,  Morresi  et  al. 
(2022) explored the potential of S2 imagery to map burn severity in the 
western Italian Alps. By generating reflectance composites optimized for 
seasonal timing, their approach aimed to overcome challenges posed by 
cloud  coverage  and  the  temporal  requirements  for  effective  burn

For the hyperparameter optimization task, we employ two predom-
inant models— RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV—provided by 
the  scikit-learn  library  to  meticulously  refine  the  RF  algorithm’s  per-
formance.  The  tuning  methodology  encompasses  an  initial  broad 
exploration of the hyperparameter space using RandomizedSearchCV, 
followed by a focused and exhaustive search using GridSearchCV to fine- 
tune the model. RandomizedSearchCV performs a probabilistic search 
over  the  predefined  hyperparameter  space,  offering  a  computational 
advantage  by  evaluating  a  user-specified  subset  of  hyperparameter 
combinations.  This  method  aids  in  efficiently  navigating  vast  hyper-
parameter  spaces  and  is  particularly  advantageous  when  there  is  un-
certainty  regarding  the  optimal  values.  It  generates  a  sample  of  the 
parameter settings based on specified distributions, allowing the incor-

However,  the  strengths  of  our  methodology  come  with  notable  chal-
lenges. The primary issue lies in the complexity and computational de-
mands of XAI techniques. For example, applying SHAP-FSS to analyze a 
comprehensive set of predictors necessitates a profound understanding 
of  both  ML  algorithms  and  the  foundational  principles  of  XAI.  This 
complexity  may  present  a  steep  learning curve,  particularly  for  those 
new to the field. Additionally, the computational resources required to 
process large datasets and conduct thorough analyses may exceed the 
capabilities  of  some  research  teams,  highlighting  concerns  about  the 
accessibility of our approach. Such limitations suggest that our meth-
odology  might  be  restricted  to  those  with  significant  computational 
support. Furthermore, our study acknowledges the necessity for broader 
validation across diverse ecosystems and varying levels of fire severity.

The text does not provide explicit information about specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of Synthetic Spectral Databases created from Linear Spectral Mixing for developing RF-based classifiers and regression models tailored for Wildfire Severity Mapping (WSM). Additionally, it discusses the utility of deep learning in extracting complex patterns from High-Dimensional Sentinel-2 (S2) Satellite Imagery, which leads to improved accuracy in severity classifications. Therefore, while the exact dataset names like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet are not mentioned, it can be inferred that the researchers have employed Synthetic Spectral Databases and High-Dimensional S2 Satellite Imagery within their deep learning pipeline.
