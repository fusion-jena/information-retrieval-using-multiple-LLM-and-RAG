Due to the unique characteristics of neural networks, which solve problems by ex-
ploiting the hidden relationships inherent in multiple input variables, it was difﬁcult to
physically quantify the importance of the input variables. As an alternative, we performed
a statistical feature importance test (SFIT) to explain which feature had the greatest sig-
niﬁcance in the species richness retrievals and to determine the optimized features in
an operational retrieval system. For the SFIT, a single feature was randomly shufﬂed,
while all the other features were kept constant. We iterated this process by changing the
test variable. The feature importance shows the extent to which the model performance
decreased with random shufﬂing. In this study, we used the root mean square error (RMSE)
as the performance metric.

The training process was performed for a number of iterations in which all the training
data were exposed to the network until the loss function reached its minimum value. The
model score reached its maximum after approximately 5000 iterations with a NVIDIA
Titan X GPU (3584 CUDA cores). The number of trainable parameters was 85,569 and the
computational run-time was approximately 4 h with a training batch size of 1024.

Deep learning approaches have shown promising results in many scientiﬁc applica-
tions [67,68] but do not always guarantee better outcomes [69,70]. Therefore, we compared
the performance of the proposed DL model with a RF regression model as a baseline, since
RF showed reasonable results and is popular in various machine learning applications [71].
To determine the best values of the hyperparameters (number of trees, maximum tree
depths, and the maximum number of features) in the RF model, a grid search was used.

Helpful Answer:

In the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing the random seed value. However, some implicit techniques can be inferred from the information provided.

One common strategy to manage randomness in deep learning models is to use dropout regularization, which helps prevent overfitting by randomly dropping out neurons during training. This technique introduces randomness into the model, making it more robust and generalizable. In the context, reference [66] discusses dropout as a method to prevent neural networks from overfitting.

Additionally, the concept of cross-validation is often used to mitigate the impact of randomness in model selection and evaluation. Cross-validation involves splitting the dataset into several folds or subsets, where each fold serves as a validation set while the remaining folds form the training set. By repeating this process multiple times with different random seeds, one can obtain a more reliable estimate of the model's performance. Although not explicitly mentioned in the context, cross-validation could potentially be applied to evaluate the deep learning model's performance against the random forest model.

Lastly, another approach to handling randomness is through ensemble methods, which combine multiple models to improve overall performance. Ensemble methods can help reduce variance and increase stability in predictions. While not directly related to managing randomness due to random seed values, ensemble methods like bagging or boosting can still contribute to addressing the issue indirectly.

In summary, based on the given context, strategies such as dropout regularization, cross-validation, and ensemble methods can be employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, the context does not provide explicit details about how these strategies are specifically applied to address issues related to random seed values.
