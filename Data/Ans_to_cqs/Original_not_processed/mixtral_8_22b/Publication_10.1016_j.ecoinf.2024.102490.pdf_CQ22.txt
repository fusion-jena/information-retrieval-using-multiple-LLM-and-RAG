For model creation, 80% of the data was used as the training set, with 
the  remaining  20%  (the  evaluation  set)  used  to  assess  model  perfor-
mance. This procedure was necessary for thoroughly assessing the pre-
cision of our models. To evaluate the accuracy of our models, we used 
two metrics: the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating 
characteristics (ROC) and the true skill statistics (TSS) (Allouche et al., 
2006; Wani et al., 2022). To  ensure the robustness of our results, we 
applied committee averaging and weighted mean approaches to create 
separate ensemble models for each climate scenario and period. When 
selecting the final ensemble models, special attention was given to those 
with a TSS score of ≥0.7.

3.1. Model performance and distribution model 

We obtained ROC scores >0.94 (Table 3) for our distribution model, 
indicating a good overall model fit, considering the TSS values ranged 
between  0.739  and  0.838  (Fig.  S1,  Supplementary  Material;  Table  S5, 
Supplementary Material), which also indicates a good fit to the model, 
taking into account that the closer to 1 there is a good fit (Allouche et al., 
2006). Highlighting the fact that in the pre-modeling test, the mean AUC 
values varied with the SE and GE from 0.850 to 0.876 for C. guazumifolia, 
0.872–0.874  for  C.  xanthocarpa,  0.853–0.855  for  E.  pyriformis,  and 
0.881–0.928 for P. cattleyanum. (Table S6, Supplementary Material).

Among the ten climatic variables, Bio04 (Temperature Seasonality) 
and Bio14 (Precipitation of Driest Month) contributed the most to the 
prediction of climatic suitability for all the species; Bio17 (Precipitation 
of Driest Quarter) was shown as the third environmental variable as it 
was present in three of the four species (Table 4). The relative contri-
bution of Bio04 and Bio14 was >32% for all species, with Bio04 being 
the largest contributor.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using two metrics: the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and the true skill statistics (TSS). The ROC scores obtained were greater than 0.94, indicating a good overall model fit. The TSS values ranged between 0.739 and 0.838, which also indicated a good fit to the model. In the pre-modeling test, the mean AUC values varied with the SE and GE from 0.850 to 0.928 for different species. These metrics are used to measure the accuracy and precision of the model.
