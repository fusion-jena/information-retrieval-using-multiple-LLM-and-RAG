2.6. Training and validation set 

The  study  utilized  a  training-and-test  approach  with  stratification 
splitting. For each setting, 100 different splits to the training-and-test set 
were given. Tuning of the hyperparameter on the training set was done 
for  each  set.  This  was  followed  by  model  training  using  an  optimal 
setting of the hyperparameter. 

2.7. Regression models 

Four methods were used to model forest AGB in the study: AdaBoost, 
random  decision  forest  (RF),  multilayer  neural  network  (NET),  and 
Bayesian ridge regression (Bayes).

Random decision forest, multilayer neural network, and Bayesian ridge regression). The results show that canopy 
conditions and airborne LiDAR point densities did not affect the strength of the AGB model, but that model's 
strength was affected by the vegetation regeneration component in the field biomass reference and by the ma-
chine  learning  method  tested  for  modelling.  AdaBoost  and  random  decision  forest  were  the  most  successful 
methods. To evaluate the quality of an AGB model it is recommended to combine several individual evaluation 
functions into the model score. The study highlights several recommendations to follow when estimating AGB 
from ALS using an ABA in Central European forests.

learning techniques (e.g., random forest [RF], support vector regression 
[SVR], and k-nearest neighbor [kNN]) are capable to reveal complicated 
nonlinear patterns (Fassnacht et al., 2014) and, in addition, to solve data 
dimensional  problems  when  fitting  models  with  a  large  number  of 
predictors (Hudak et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2019). The variety among 
research  sites,  however,  corresponds  to  equal  variety  among  those 
predictors and machine learning methods used. Therefore, there is no 
agreement to  date  on best  practices  for machine  learning methods  to 
estimate AGB from ALS. In a review, Fassnacht et al. (2014) reported 
that RF performed best and stepwise linear models poorest, as judged by 
coefficient  of  determination  (R2)  and  root  mean  square  error  (RMSE) 
under  cross-validation.  Tompalski  et  al.  (2019)  generated  area-based 
models using ordinary least squares regression (OLS), RF, and kNN to

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention any specific optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam that are commonly used in the deep learning pipeline. However, we do see that the study utilizes a training-and-test approach with stratification splitting, which involves tuning hyperparameters on the training set for each split. This process could potentially involve optimization techniques like SGD or Adam, although this information isn't directly stated in the context.

Additionally, four methods were employed to model forest AGB in the study: AdaBoost, Random Decision Forest (RF), Multilayer Neural Network (NET), and Bayesian Ridge Regression (Bayes). Among these, only the Multilayer Neural Network (NET) would typically use optimization techniques like SGD or Adam during its training phase. However, without further details about the implementation of the NET method, we cannot definitively state whether SGD, Adam, or another optimization technique was used.
