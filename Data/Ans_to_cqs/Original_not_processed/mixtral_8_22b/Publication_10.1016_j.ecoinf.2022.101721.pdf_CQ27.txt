observed data (e.g. Bhattacharya, 1967), thus reducing manual labour to 
a minimum.

identification  of  species.  To  try  to  overcome  this  problem,  species

include all observations in statistical modeling, rather than excluding observations, an approach which can affect 
the reliability of studies. This study also, to a great extent, explains the poor performance of software attempting 
automated bat ID. Implementing Bayesian algorithms, and thereby allowing users to interact with the software, 
should significantly improve their performance.
