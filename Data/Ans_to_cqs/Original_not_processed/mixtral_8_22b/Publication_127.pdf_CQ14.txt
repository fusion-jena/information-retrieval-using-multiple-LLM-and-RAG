Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

A well-known method for further improving classiﬁcation
accuracy is to use an ensemble of models at the same time
and average their predictions. After training all of the nine
models for each stage, we formed an ensemble of the trained
models by averaging their predictions (SI Appendix, Prediction
Averaging). More details about the architectures, training meth-
ods, preprocessing steps, and the hyperparameters are in SI
Appendix, Preprocessing and Training. To enable other groups
to replicate our ﬁndings and harness this technology for their
own projects, we are publishing the software required to run
our experiments as freely available, open-source code. We are
also publishing the ﬁnal DNNs trained on SS so that others
can use them as is or for transfer learning. Both the code and
the models can be accessed at https://github.com/Evolving-AI-
Lab/deep learning for camera trap images.

Question: %INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the provided pieces of context to answer the query in less than 400 words. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

%Query
Query: "How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide specific information on how the hyperparameters were optimized. It only mentions that more details about the hyperparameters are included in the SI Appendix, Preprocessing and Training. Therefore, based on the given context, it cannot be determined which method was used to optimize the hyperparameters, whether it was a grid search, random search, or another optimization technique.
