number of convolutional weights by a factor of K, resulting in a lack of 
compactness  in  the  model.  Secondly,  jointly  optimizing  dynamic 
attention and static convolutional kernels becomes a challenging task. 
To address these issues, Li proposed the dynamic convolutional kernel 
decomposition in 2021 (Li et al., 2021). This approach effectively re-
duces the number of parameters in dynamic convolution and improves 
the classification performance of neural networks that utilize dynamic 
convolutional kernels. 

In (Li et al., 2021), the static convolution kernel can be re-defining by 

the formula 9. 

Wk = W0 + ΔWk, k ∈ {1, …, K}

feature maps and weights obtained through the two convolutional layers

in the residual block. The resulting feature map, denoted as X
, is then 
input into the upsampling layer to double its size and obtain Xout. These 
skip connections enable the neural network to effectively capture the 
relationship between input and output features, learn deeper represen-
tations, and enhance the quality of the generated images. 

The attention mechanism enables the network to selectively focus on 
essential parts of the feature map and enhance the weights in specific 
channels or spatial regions based on calculated attention scores. It ac-
quires  essential  information  while  enhancing  the  quality  and  level  of 
detail in the generated images. Fig. 4 illustrates the attention mecha-
nism’s model structure.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer from the dataset names such as G1\_Dataset1, G1\_Dataset2, etc., that they might have been collected using various means like surveys, sensors, or public datasets. Additionally, the paper references a survey on image data augmentation for deep learning, which suggests that some form of data collection was involved. But without more specific details about the source of each dataset, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
