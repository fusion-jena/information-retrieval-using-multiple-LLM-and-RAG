classification processing. This step reduced the average number of pixels 
per scene the classification model had to analyze to 3,757,323 and took, 
on average, 18 s per scene.

Accuracy metrics for models with entropy feature across window sizes  

Table A.5 
Accuracies and classification results into iceplant (positive class P) and other vegetation (negative class N) from models using spectral, NDVI, and date features together 
with entropy values of each spectral band and NDVI within a window, calculated across multiple window sizes. Accuracies are given in percentages.

Question: %INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the provided pieces of context to answer the query in less than 400 words. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

%Query
Query: "Which hardware resources are used for training the deep learning model (e.g., GPUs, TPUs)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The information provided does not mention any specific details about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether GPUs, TPUs or any other hardware resources were utilized during the training process based solely on this information.
