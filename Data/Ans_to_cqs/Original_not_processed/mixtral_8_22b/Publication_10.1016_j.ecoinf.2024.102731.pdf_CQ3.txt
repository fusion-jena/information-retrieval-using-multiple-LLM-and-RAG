Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, generally speaking, these are common methods employed for image data labeling in computer vision tasks. Bounding boxes involve drawing rectangles around objects of interest within images, while instance segmentation involves creating pixel-level masks for each object instance. Other techniques include semantic segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and landmark annotation. The choice of technique depends on the specific requirements and goals of the project.
