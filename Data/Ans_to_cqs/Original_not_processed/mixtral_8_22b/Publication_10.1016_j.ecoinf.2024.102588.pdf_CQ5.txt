Batch normalization and dropout layers were adopted to assist in the 
feature extraction of the convolutional layers. The feature generalization 
of  the  input  mini-batch  was  performed  by  calculating  the  mean  and 
standard deviation of the batch normalization layer to avoid covariate 
shifts  (Cooijmans  et  al.,  2016).  Overfitting  of  the  CNN  model  was 
reduced  using  a  dropout  layer  that  inactivates  random  nodes  that 
contain learnable weights (Ashiquzzaman et al., 2018). Fully connected 
layers  obtain  processed  features  using  convolutional  operations  for 
classification  or  regression  tasks.  CNN  model  training  adjusts  the 
weights  by  conducting  backpropagation,  whereas  the  loss  function 
minimizes  the  error between  the observed and  estimated results.  The 
gradient  descent  algorithm  iteratively  updates  kernel  weights  by 
calculating the partial derivative of the loss function with respect to each

2.4.2. Convolutional neural network 

CNN is a type of deep learning algorithm primarily used for image 
recognition and processing tasks (Chauhan et al., 2018). It’s composed 
of multiple layers, including convolutional layers that apply kernels to 
extract  features  from  input  images,  followed  by  pooling  layers  that 
reduce  the  spatial  dimensions  of  the  features.  CNNs  are  designed  to 
automatically learn hierarchical representations of data, making them 
highly effective for tasks like object detection, image classification, and 
even natural language processing (Khan et al., 2020). That is, the CNN 
architecture  was  designed  to  efficiently  process  complex  datasets 
(Alshehhi et al., 2017). Convolutional layers adopt internal kernel op-
erations that calculate nonlinear features using trainable weights and

autoencoder, which concentrates the latent information of the original 
data  (Wang  et  al.,  2014;  Zabalza  et  al.,  2016).  Convolutional  neural 
networks (CNN) are deep learning architectures that have demonstrated 
outstanding performance in processing multidimensional data (Chaddad 
et al., 2021; Gupta and Bag, 2022; Ren et al., 2017). The CNN model has 
been successfully applied to the estimation of variables in aquatic en-

(Hussain  et  al.,  2020),  and  algae  (Cao  et  al.,  2022).  Therefore,  deep 
learning algorithms are suitable applications for sustainably estimating 
aquatic ecosystem health. Only one previous study applied a CNN-based 
approach, not to classify health levels but to augment aquatic ecosystem 
health data (Lee et al., 2021). Consequently, the deep learning fusion

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific details about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that deep learning algorithms, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), have been successfully applied to estimate variables in aquatic environments, such as water quality, streamflow, and algae. This suggests that the datasets used could potentially include various types of environmental data related to these factors. Unfortunately, without more specific information, it is impossible to definitively state what datasets were used in this particular case.
