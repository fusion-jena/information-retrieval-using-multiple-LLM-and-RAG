2.2. Transformer-like model 

Transformer  was  proposed  by  Vaswani  et  al.  (2017)  and  initially 
designed for Seq2Seq tasks, replacing long short-term memory (LSTM) 
with a full-attention structure. It was primarily applied in NLP, and both 
the  transformer  and  its  subsequent  iterations  demonstrated  excellent 
performance in a wide range of downstream tasks. With the success of 
the transformer in NLP, researchers have begun to explore its applica-
tion in CV. 

The core structure of the transformer-like visual model is an encoder 
module, which comprises several stacked blocks. Each block consists of 
two  components:  a  token  mixer  module  (Yu  et  al.,  2022)  for  fusing 
spatial information and an MLP module for fusing channel information. 
The main distinction among the different transformer-like visual models 
lies in the variations in the token mixer module. For example, the token 
mixer in a ViT (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) is a self-attention module.

, respectively. Here, N represents the number of samples

in the validation set, n is the number of classes, and m is the number of 
basic models.

Yuan et al. (2022) claimed that the superior performance of a ViT can 
primarily be attributed to extensive pre-training data. If a ViT is trained 
from  scratch  on  a  medium-sized  dataset,  its  performance  lags  behind 
that of a CNN model with comparable parameter sizes. To address this 
limitation, they proposed Volo with the novel Outlook Attention as the 
token mixer module, which enabled fine-grained token representation 
and the aggregation of global information.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices. However, it does provide some insights into the evaluation process used for comparing the performance of various models. The table titled 'Classification Performance (%) of Basic Models and Proposed Methods on the IP102 Dataset' suggests that accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were calculated to evaluate the performance of the models. These metrics are commonly used in machine learning classification problems to assess the quality of predictions made by the models. Therefore, one could infer that these metrics might be part of the postprocessing steps performed after the model training phase. Nonetheless, without further context, it cannot be confirmed if other postprocessing techniques like saliency maps or confusion matrices were also employed.
