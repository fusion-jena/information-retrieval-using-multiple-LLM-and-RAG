In addition to selecting the RS imagery and representative training 
samples, the choice of machine learning (ML) algorithm directly affects 
the accuracy of the classification results. Currently, a wide range of ML 
algorithms are extensively employed in LULC mapping, including sup-
port vector machines (SVMs) (Adugna et al., 2022; Silva et al., 2017), 
random forests (RFs) (Svoboda et al., 2022), decision trees (DTs) (Shih 
et al., 2018), and artificial neural networks (ANNs) (Amani et al., 2020; 
Hu et al., 2021). Researchers have frequently compared the accuracies 
of LULC maps derived from different classifiers (Shih et al., 2021). The 
RF  classifier  outperformed  the  other  ML  classifiers,  as  confirmed  by 
LULC (Shih et al., 2018; Yuh et al., 2023) and crop mapping (Inglada 
et al., 2015). RF has lower sensitivity to tuning parameters and stronger 
robustness against noise (Wa´sniewski et al., 2022). Furthermore, RF can

image presegmentation. This retains the benefits of object-based clas-
sification  while  eliminating  time-consuming  parameter  adjustments 
required by traditional segmentation methods. Furthermore, it is worth 
highlighting that the proposed method is deployed on the GEE platform. 
This indicates that it can be easily applied to other regions or different 
study years, making it a versatile and accessible tool for RS and LULC 
classification tasks. In future studies, the sample and vegetation index 
feature datasets should be continuously optimised. Furthermore, we will 
incorporate CNN and DNN deep-learning algorithms into the study of 
LULC mapping in arid zones.

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common optimization techniques used in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp), and others. These techniques help minimize the loss function during the training process, enabling the model to learn effectively from the input data. Without explicit mention in the provided context, one cannot definitively state which optimization technique was utilized in this particular case.
