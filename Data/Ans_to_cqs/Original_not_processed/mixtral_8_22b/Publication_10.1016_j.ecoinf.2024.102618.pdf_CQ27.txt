provide crystal-clear images for further examination. The added image 
enhancement  technique  enabled  the  proposed  systems  to  reach  high 
accuracy values. 

This  dataset  is  used  after  these  pre-processing  steps  with  the  sug-
gested models. Table 3 presents a comparison between different trained 
deep learning models proposed in this paper. The table shows the five 
different  deep  learning  models  chosen  for  this  application  and  their 
reported  accuracy  and  F1-score.  The  table  also  shows  ten  different

Accuracy

3.7. Performance metrics 

In this work, we measure the accuracy of the deep-learning models 

by using the following metrics:  

• Accuracy 

accuracy which is a simple metric for deep-learning classification 
models. This metric measures the overall percentage of correct pre-
dictions. However, accuracy does not take into account the different 
types  of  errors.  That  is  the  reason  we  employ  other  metrics  for 
measuring the efficiency of deep learning models. 

Accuracy =

TP + TN
TP + TN + FP + FN

• Precision 

(1)    

Precision  is  a  metric  that  measures  the  number  of  positive  pre-
dictions  that  are  actually  correct  viz.  a  viz.  correct  and  incorrect 
positive predictions. 

recall is a metric that measures the number of positive predictions 
that are actually correct viz. a viz. correct positive predictions and 
incorrect negative predictions. Recall measures how many positive 
predictions were correctly spotted by the model. 

Recall = TP

TP + FN

%Query
Query: "What process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model (e.g., Model serialization, Platform selection)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information on the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact deployment process based on the given context.
