Different strategies can be employed to select samples to be labelled 

by the oracle. The most naive strategy is selecting queries at random.

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention specific methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does provide some clues about possible sources of data. For instance, Swanson et al. (2015) describe a dataset called Snapshot Serengeti, which consists of high-frequency annotated camera trap images of 40 mammalian species in an African savanna. This suggests that one method for collecting raw data could involve using cameras or other types of sensors to capture images or videos. Additionally, Norouzzadeh et al. (2018) and Yosinski et al. (2014) discuss fine-tuning models on target datasets, implying that publicly available datasets may also serve as sources of raw data. Finally, the context mentions a network being trained on a large dataset before being fine-tuned on a target dataset, suggesting that preprocessing and augmentation techniques might also play a role in preparing raw data for use in deep learning pipelines.
