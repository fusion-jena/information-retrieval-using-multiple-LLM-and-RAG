2.5. Model selection procedure 

The model selection procedure was performed as follows (Capinha 
et  al.,  2021;  Van  Kuppevelt  et  al.,  2020):  we  randomly  generated  5 
models for each of the four available deep-ANN architecture types (20 
models in total) and trained each one with a small subset of the training 
data  (data  partition  At)  for  4  epochs  (an  “epoch”  corresponds  to  the 
complete training dataset being passed forward and backward across the 
network  one  time;  Capinha  et  al.,  2021).  The  accuracy  of  candidate 
models,  as  provided  by  mcfly  (i.e.,  the  “proportion  of  cases  correctly 
classified”), was then compared using a left-out validation data set (data 
partition Av) and the model with the highest performance was selected 
for training on the full training data (data partition Bt; Bt = At + Av) for 
up to 30 epochs.

number of eggs (i.e., 1 to 25% and > 25 to 50%; Table 1). 

3.2. Deep learning model accuracy, predictive performance, and predictor 
importance 

Concerning the performance of the candidate models, the best vali-
dation accuracies were achieved by model 12 in all the years (accuracy 
= 0.833 ± 0.005; mean of years ± sd) (Fig. 2), a model having a Deep 
Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (DeepConvLSTM) architecture. 
Model  19,  also  with  a  DeepConvLSTM  architecture  had  high  vali-
dation accuracies too (accuracy = 0.829 ± 0.003; mean of years ± sd), 
followed  by model 14, a Convolutional Neural Network  (CNN) archi-
tecture reaching a validation accuracy of 0.821 ± 0.005 (mean of years 
± sd).
