according to a 60%–40% ratio. Table 6 presents the details about the 
total number of samples, the training, and the validation samples. The 
distribution of samples is represented in Fig. 8. It is worthy to note that 
after selecting the samples, we checked all the samples carefully and as 
we see in Fig. 8 (as an example); surprisingly, no mis-collected samples 
were detected in the automatically collected samples.

In the second post-classification step according to Eq. (25), the RCM 
is firstly post-processed using morphological opening, i.e., performing 
an erosion followed by dilation using a structural element. This opera-
tion  is  called  “opening”.  The  opening  operation  removes  very  small 
misclassified pixels or speckles. Furthermore, the output of the opened 
image is entered into the “closing” operation, i.e., a dilation followed by 
an erosion using a structural element. This closes the gaps and holes in 
the classified map. Generally, the two mentioned morphological oper-
ations increase spatial coherency. It is noteworthy that we perform the 
mentioned chain operations iteratively (an iteration loop of >1) to reach

matic  selection  + human  post-revision).  As  citrus  orchards  have  a 
relatively regular geometric shape and spatial patterns, this information 
can be exerted to the classification by the human supervisor as well. A 
few points (about 40 samples) are also collected in field surveying which 
is used for visual assessment of classification performance. Afterward, 
each category of samples (citrus and non-citrus) is randomly split up into 
two groups of training and validation in a 60%–40% ratio, respectively. 
Totally,  we  have  “citrus-training”,  “citrus-validation”,  “non-citrus- 
training”,  and  “non-citrus-validation”  collections.  Of  the  two  defined 
classes, the “citrus” class includes oranges and mandarin orchards (the 
appearance of both is similar). The “non-citrus”  class encompasses all

By calculating all the mentioned features, three feature spaces are 
obtained  which  are  then  merged  in  the  “feature  fusion”  step.  All  the 
above-mentioned primary imageries and indices (features) are stacked 
to provide us with a hybrid feature space out of multi-modal data. The 
mentioned feature space which contains all the initial images and the 
calculated features is then entered into the subsequent phase.

Helpful Answer:
After the model training, there are several postprocessing steps involved. According to the given context, the postprocessing steps include morphological opening and closing operations. These operations are performed on the Relevance Class Map (RCM) generated from the model. Morphological opening involves performing an erosion followed by dilation using a structural element. This operation helps remove very small misclassified pixels or speckles. On the other hand, morphological closing involves performing a dilation followed by erosion using a structural element. This operation helps close the gaps and holes in the classified map. Both these operations help increase spatial coherency. Additionally, it is worth noting that these operations are performed iteratively until the desired results are achieved. However, the context does not mention any specifics regarding saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, based on the given context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training are morphological opening and closing operations.
