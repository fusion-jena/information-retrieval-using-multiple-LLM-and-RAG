SPEI time scale corresponding to the highest probability was identified 
as  that  month's  representative  drought  propagation  time.  With  this 
method,  it  is  possible  to  calculate  the  propagation  time  for  different 
drought propagation scenarios occurring in different months and obtain 
the probability of this drought propagation occurring. 

The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a feed-forward neural 
network primarily used to process gridded data of a fixed size. Its main 
advantage  is  the  ability  to  automatically  learn  spatial  hierarchies, 
making it highly suitable for processing data such as images, sounds, and 
time series. In this study, CNN is utilized to fit linear and nonlinear re-
lationships  between  independent  and  dependent  variables  and  in-
teractions  between  independent  variables(Gu  et  al.,  2018).  The  core 
formula of CNN is as follows: 

∑

∑

(f*g)(i, j) =

nf(m, n)⋅g(i (cid:0) m, j (cid:0) n)
