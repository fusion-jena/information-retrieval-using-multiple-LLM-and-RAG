On the other hand, based on the fact that, with respect to other
classification algorithms running in GEE, Random Forest (RF) is one of
the machine learning classifiers with the best accuracies in the classifi-
cation of satellite images to obtain LULC maps (G´omez Fern´andez et al.,
2022; Ouma et al., 2022; Shetty, 2019; Talukdar et al., 2020), therefore,
for the classification, the RF algorithm was trained using training points
collected in the field and the inputs of the best dataset, obtaining LULC
maps with 30-m pixels, according to the spatial resolution of Landsat
missions, finally, through a post classification and visual inspection, the
products were improved.

vegetation, soil and water indices and clusters, with the objective of
determining which combination yields the highest accuracies.

We run Random Forest in GEE, as it is one of the best machine
learning classifiers (G´omez Fern´andez et al., 2022), in turn, supported
by Talukdar et al. (2020), through an evaluation of six LULC classifiers
determined that Random Forest is the best classifier but still needs to be
tested in different morphoclimatic conditions.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some common strategies used to manage randomness include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using techniques like cross-validation to reduce variability, and employing ensemble methods to average out the effects of randomness. These strategies help ensure consistent results and improve model performance.

Based on the provided context, we can see that the authors use the Random Forest algorithm for land cover classification. While this is a machine learning technique rather than deep learning, the concept of managing randomness remains relevant. In the case of Random Forest, the algorithm inherently handles randomness by creating multiple decision trees from randomly selected subsets of data and features. This approach helps mitigate overfitting and improves overall accuracy.

In summary, while the specific context does not address strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines, general approaches include setting fixed seeds, using cross-validation, and applying ensemble methods. For Random Forest specifically, the algorithm itself manages randomness through its construction of multiple decision trees from random subsets of data and features.
