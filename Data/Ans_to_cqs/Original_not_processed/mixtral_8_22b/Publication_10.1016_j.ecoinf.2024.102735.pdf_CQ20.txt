Data-driven models have evolved as effective decision-support tools
for HABs monitoring and prediction. These models are essential for
using patterns between water quality parameters and ecosystem vari-
ables to predict algal-related parameters such as chlorophyll-a, phyco-
cyanin, algal cells, and toxins (Busari et al., 2023; Kimambo et al.,
2019). Machine learning (ML) models such as random forest (RF),
Multilayer perceptron (MLP), long-short term memory (LSTM), and
support vector regression (SVR) have been used successfully to predict
different algal-related parameters and help identify drivers of HABs (Liu
et al., 2019; Qian et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2015, Busari et al., 2023).
Model predictions are, however, influenced by varying degrees of un-
certainty (Gawlikowski et al., 2023). According to Guzman et al. (2015),
uncertainty refers to the variation between the actual state of a variable
and its theoretical assessment at a particular time. These prediction

i. All the datasets were divided randomly into two: 80 % for
training the RF and SVR models, and 20 % for testing the
model, although the training set was further randomly
sampled to select training and validation set to obtain opti-
mized model hyperparameters.

included during the model training phase when introducing high-
frequency datasets. This is unsurprisingly as dataset size is often line-
arly related to number of regression trees required to build the models
(Biau and Scornet, 2016). This will enable the RF model to learn more
patterns
in the water quality datasets efficiently and improve
chlorophyll-a predictions. The most occurring max_depth when using
the manually sampled dataset was 28, which increased to 37 when more
datasets were used to train the model. Deeper trees in the continuous
high frequency data allows the model to learn intrinsic water quality
patterns. Less deep trees in the manually sampled datasets helps the
model to learn effectively with the few datasets without overfitting. The
inclusion of the chlorophyll-a sensor values as a predictor variable made
little impact on the parameter distribution for both RF_with_Sensor and
RF_w/o_Sensor (Fig. 5). This suggests that increasing predictor numbers

enhance learning of peak values as compared to that of the manually
sampled data.

4.2. Hyperparameter tuning

For tuning purposes, the model structures were same as described in
Table 3, with the manually sampled chlorophyll-a as output for the
manually sampled scenarios and the continuous regression derived
laboratory chlorophyll-a was the output for the high frequency data
scenario. Using different random training datasets to develop the models
enabled the realization of optimized parameters using the Optuna
package. The multi-modal nature of some of the distribution of the pa-
rameters indicates several peaks that provide a good trade-off between
performance and computational cost. The distribution of the parameters
slightly varies with each modeling scenario. For RF_w/o_Sensor, the
modal n_estimators observed was 20, which increases to 50 in the RF_w/
o_Sensor_cont. This shows the need for more regression trees to be

Helpful Answer:
The given text does not mention any specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. Therefore, it cannot be determined from this context what type of hardware resources were utilized for training the deep learning models.

Based on the available information, we can only infer that machine learning models like Random Forest (RF), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Support Vector Regression (SVR) were employed for predicting various algal-related parameters. However, there is no explicit reference to the use of GPU or TPU resources for training these models.
