the  metadata  (e.g.,  camera,  date,  and  capture  time)  included  in  the 
dataset.  Despite  the  seemingly  large  scale  of  the  dataset,  only  potted 
plants  were  captured  under  controlled  indoor  settings,  restricting  the 
applicability of this dataset in real-world field scenes.

%Query
Query: "What data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., image, audio, video, CSV)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly state the specific data format(s) used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the references mentioned that the primary focus is on images, specifically weed species images. This is evident from the mention of the 'DeepWeeds' dataset, which is described as a multiclass weed species image dataset. Additionally, several other studies referenced also deal with weed detection using imagery, such as Rahman et al.'s work on deep neural networks for weed detection. Therefore, while not directly stated, it can be reasonably assumed that the main data format used in this deep learning pipeline is image data.
