Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Where γm presents the number of training samples belonging to the 
wetland class with the highest number of training samples and γi shows 
the number of training data of other wetland classes. The 3D patches of 
Sentinel-1/2 imagery with the dimension of γi × S × S × B, as well as the 
output of the conditional map unit, are employed in each of Ui. Next is to 
transform the output of the conditional unit map (intermediate feature 
expressed by If) to a feature with the length of γi. It should be noted that S 
and B present image patch size (i.e., 8) and the number of utilized bands 
(i.e., 18). In the GAN network, a dense layer is employed first, followed 
by  a  softmax  layer.  For  the  generation  of  the  class-specific  random 
feature (Im) with the dimension of n × γ, the feature vector n = S × S × B 
times is repeated. The 3D Sentinel-1/2 image patches with the dimen-
sion  of  γi  × S  × S  × B  are  then  converted  into  a  matrix  (Pm)  with  a

3.6. Cost of computation in terms of time 

The hardware configurations for the experiments in this study con-
sisted of Intel Core i7-10750H 2.60 GHz CPU, GeForce RTX 2070-MaxQ 
GPU, and 16GB RAM. As seen in Table 5, the Swin Transformer classifier 
had  the  least  cost  in  terms  of  time,  with  approximately  1.5  h  of  its 
required training time, while the CoAtNet algorithm required about 5 h 
for its training. The proposed 3DUNetGSFormer required around 3.5 h 
for its training time. 

4. Discussion 

Understanding  dynamic land  cover changes  in wetland-dominated 
regions such as Canada requires accurate mapping of diverse and com-
plex  wetland  ecosystems.  Up-to-date  maps  showing  wetlands’  extent 
and  spatial  pattern  are  critical  for  protecting  and  conserving  these 
important  ecosystems.  The  rapid  evolution  of  free  access  and  high

dimension  of  n  × γ.  Afterward,  the  Sentinel-1/2 class-specific  feature 
matrix (Fm) is calculated (see Eq. 3).

Then, patches of images were translated into vectors, which were fed 
to the vision transformers. The outputs of the Swin Transformers were 
then merged, resulting in a 4 by 32 feature map, which was subsequently 
followed by a 1D global average pooling layer. The final layer is a dense 
layer of size 8 (see Fig. 4).

Helpful Answer:
After the model training, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the project or research. Some common postprocessing steps include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, and creating confusion matrices.

Saliency maps are visualizations that highlight the regions of input data that contribute most significantly to the model's predictions. They help identify important features used by the model during decision making. To generate saliency maps, techniques like GradCAM or Layerwise Relevance Propagation (LRP) can be applied. These methods provide insights into how the model interprets the input data and what patterns it focuses on when making decisions.

Calculating performance metrics is another crucial step in evaluating the trained models. Commonly used metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and Area Under Curve (AUC), among others. These metrics quantify the overall performance of the model and allow comparison between different algorithms or architectures. Additionally, they enable researchers to assess whether the chosen approach meets their desired objectives.

Creating confusion matrices is also essential for understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the trained models. A confusion matrix provides a summary of prediction results on a classification task, displaying true positives, false negatives, false positives, and true negatives. This information helps determine where the model performs well and where improvements may be needed. Furthermore, confusion matrices aid in identifying potential biases within the dataset or imbalanced classes affecting the model's performance.

In conclusion, various postprocessing steps can be carried out after model training, including generating saliency maps, computing performance metrics, and constructing confusion matrices. Each of these steps contributes valuable insights into the behavior and effectiveness of the trained models, ultimately guiding further refinement and optimization efforts.
