Deep learning tools for bat acoustic signal detection

S1 Fig. CNNFAST network architecture description. The CNNFAST network consists of two
convolution layers (Conv1 and Conv2), with 16 filters each (shown in yellow, with the filter
size shown inset). Both convolution layers are followed by a max pooling layer (Max Pool1 and
Max Pool2), and the network ends with a fully connected layer with 64 units (Fully Connect).
CNNFAST computes feature maps (shown as white boxes) across the entire input spectrogram,
resulting in less computation and a much faster run time. The fully connected layer is also eval-
uated as a convolution. The output of the detector is a probability vector (shown in green)
whose length is one quarter times the width of the input spectrogram. The numbers below
each layer indicate the height, weight, and depth of the corresponding layer.

the BatDetect CNNFULL, which used a GPU at test time, all the other algorithms were run on
the CPU.

binary classification problem. Our CNNFULL consisted of three convolution and max pooling
layers, followed by one fully connected layer (see Supplementary Information Methods for fur-
ther details). We halved the size of the input spectrogram to reduce the input dimensionality
to the CNN which resulted in an input array of size of 130 frequency bins by 20 time steps, cor-
responding to a fixed length, detection window size of 23ms. We applied the CNN in a sliding
window fashion, to predict the presence of a search-phase bat call at every instance of time in
the spectrogram (Fig 1D). As passive acoustic monitoring can generate large quantities of data,
we required a detection algorithm that would run faster than real time. While CNNs produce
state of the art results for many tasks, naïve application of them for detection problems at test
time can be extremely computationally inefficient [33]. So, to increase the speed of our system

Helpful Answer:
According to the given information, the deep learning tool for bat acoustic signal detection was trained using an Intel i7 processor, 32GB of RAM, and a Nvidia GTX 1080 GPU. It appears that only the BatDetect CNNFULL utilized a GPU during testing, while all other algorithms ran on the CPU. Therefore, it seems that the primary hardware resource used for training this particular deep learning model was a GPU. However, without further context or specifications regarding the training process, it cannot be definitively stated whether additional hardware resources such as TPUs were employed.
