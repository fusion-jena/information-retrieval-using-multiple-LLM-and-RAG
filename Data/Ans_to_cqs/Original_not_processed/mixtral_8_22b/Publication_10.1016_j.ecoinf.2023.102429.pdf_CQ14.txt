parameter values were selected based on the RMSEcv values (De San-
tana  et  al.,  2021).  SVM  was  performed  in  MATLAB  R2016a,  and  the 
training model was established by using the libsvm package in MATLAB.

SVMR is a kernel-based machine learning algorithm that originated 
in  statistical  theory  and  can  be  used  for  regression  and  classification 
(Cortes and Vapnik, 1995). The algorithm maps each covariate in the 
training set (sensitive bands filtered by the CARS algorithm) to a high- 
dimensional feature space by using a kernel function. Epsilon refers to 
an insensitive loss function that maps the maximum epsilon deviation of 
the independent data and the associated training data. Errors within the 
epsilon are ignored, whereas errors larger than the epsilon are penal-
ized. The epsilon-SVR model and Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) 
are  used  to  construct  the  calibration  model.  Epsilon-SVR  optimal  pa-
rameters (e.g., cost C, epsilon p, and gamma g) are used to make the 
model  achieve  the  best  accuracy,  where  parameters  C  and  p  help  us 
avoid overfitting of SVMR. For each parameter combination, the best

2.5. Evaluating model performance 

The accuracy of calibrated and validated models is assessed by four 
parameters,  namely,  coefficient  of  determination  (R2),  root-mean- 
square  error  (RMSE),  ratio  of  performance  to  deviation  (RPD),  and 
ratio of performance to interquartile range (RPIQ) (Zizala et al., 2019). 
The model is considered accurate when the bias is close to zero. RPD 
corresponds to the ratio of standard deviation (SD) to RMSE, which is 
widely used to evaluate VNIR spectral models. RPIQ considers predic-
tion  errors  and  variations  in  observations  simultaneously,  thereby 
providing  a  more  objective  and  easily  comparable  measure  of  model 
validity in model validation studies and has no assumptions about the 
distribution of observations (Guo et al., 2019).

Competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) is an algorithm 
used for selecting effective feature bands based on the “survival of the 
fittest” principle in Darwinian evolution. CARS combines N times Monte 
Carlo sampling and a PLSR algorithm to select the optimal wavelength 
subset (Li et al., 2009). In each sampling, a fixed proportion (80%) of 
samples were randomly selected to build the PLSR model using Monte 
Carlo sampling method. The remaining 20% was used as the validation 
set, whereas the absolute value weights of the PLS regression coefficients 
were  recorded  for  each  sampling  process.  Wavelength  variables  with 
small absolute values of PLS regression coefficients were excluded ac-
cording to the exponential decay function (Zhao et al., 2021). At each 
sampling, the number of wavelengths was selected from the variables 
sampled in the previous sampling using adaptive reweighted sampling. 
In the end, the subset with the smallest root mean square error of cross

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given information, it appears that the Support Vector Machine Regression (SVMR) model uses optimal parameters such as cost C, epsilon p, and gamma g to achieve the best accuracy. However, the text does not explicitly mention how these hyperparameters are optimized, whether through methods like grid search or random search. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the specific optimization technique employed for this particular case.
