VAE model includes a series of operations such as pre-processing, Effi-
cientNet based feature extraction, IKHO based parameter optimization, 
and VAE based classification. Besides, the IKHO algorithm is designed by 
the  integration  of  KH  algorithm  with  FS  operator  to  avoid  the  local 
optimal problem of the KH algorithm. In addition, the PTDLEN based 
feature extractor by the use of parameter tuned EfficientNet model using 
IKHO  algorithm  helps  to  enhance  the  prediction  outcome  of  the 
PTDLEN-VAE model for unseen data. For validating the improved per-
formance  of  the  PTDLEN-VAE  method,  an  extensive  experimental 
analysis  take  place  on  benchmark  aerial  image  dataset.  The resultant 
experimental  values  highlighted  the  supremacy  of  the  proposed 
PTDLEN-VAE model over the other techniques. In future, the presented 
PTDLEN-VAE  model  can  be  deployed  in  unmanned  aerial  vehicles

• The IKHO algorithm is designed by the integration of KH algorithm 
with free search (FS) operator to avoid the local optimal problem of 
the KH algorithm.  

• A  PTDLEN  based  feature  extractor  is  presented  by  the  use  of 
parameter  tuned  EfficientNet  model  using  IKHO  algorithm,  which 
aids to enhance the prediction outcome of the PTDLEN-VAE model 
for unseen data.  

• Validation  of  the  PTDLEN-VAE  model  takes  place  on  benchmark 
dataset  and  the  experimental  results  are  discussed  interms  of 
different aspects. 

1.3. Paper organization 

The rest of the paper is planned as follows. Section 2 elaborates the 
previous  satellite  imagery  analysis  techniques.  Besides,  Section  3  dis-
cusses  the  proposed  PTDLEN-VAE  model  and  Section  4  offers  the 
experimental validation. At last, Section 5 summarizes the paper.

Helpful Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to divide datasets into these subsets for various purposes. Typically, the dataset is divided into three parts:

1. Training set: This subset is used to train the model, i.e., adjusting its parameters to minimize the error between predicted and actual outputs. Usually, this comprises around 60-80% of the total dataset.

2. Test set: After training the model, it needs to be evaluated on unseen data to assess its performance. This evaluation is done using the test set, which typically consists of about 20-30% of the total dataset. It should be noted that the test set must remain completely separate from the training process to ensure accurate evaluation.

3. Validation set: Sometimes, a third subset called the validation set is also created during the training phase. Its purpose is to fine-tune hyperparameters or select the best performing model among multiple trained ones. The validation set usually makes up around 10-20% of the total dataset.

In summary, while the exact criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not mentioned in the given context, typical practices involve dividing the dataset into training, testing, and sometimes validation sets. These divisions help improve the model's accuracy, generalization, and overall performance.
