mapping probability samples that are exclusively used for map evalua-
tion are often not available and therefore alternative methods have been 
proposed.  In  machine  learning,  if  data  are  abundant,  a  common 
approach is to randomly divide the full dataset used for modelling into 
three parts: a training set, a validation set, and a test set (Hastie et al., 
2009,  Chapter  7).  The  training  set  is  used  for  fitting  the  models,  the 
validation set is used to estimate prediction error for model selection and 
hyperparameter tuning, while the test set is used for assessing the ac-
curacy of the final model. This paper addresses this latter testing phase, 
with the specific aim to assess the accuracy of a thematic map produced 
by a calibrated statistical prediction method. Data availability is often 
limited  so that setting  aside a  test set  cannot always be afforded and 
therefore resampling methods are used (Hastie et al., 2009; Steele et al.,

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be taken to improve its performance. These may include:

1. Normalization or Scaling: This involves transforming the input features to a similar scale, which helps the model learn more efficiently. Common techniques include Min-Max scaling, where values are scaled between 0 and 1, and Standardization, where values are centered around the mean with unit standard deviation.

2. Cleaning: This step involves handling missing or inconsistent data. Missing values can be replaced with a suitable value such as the mean, median, mode, or a predicted value based on other features. Inconsistencies might involve removing outliers or correcting erroneous entries.

3. Feature Selection: Selecting relevant features can help reduce dimensionality and improve model performance. Techniques like correlation analysis, mutual information, or feature importance ranking can be employed to choose significant features.

4. Encoding Categorical Variables: Deep learning models typically work better with numerical inputs. Therefore, categorical variables need to be converted into numerical form. One popular technique is one-hot encoding, where each category is represented as a binary vector.

5. Data Augmentation: To increase the size of the training dataset and prevent overfitting, synthetic examples can be generated through various transformations like rotation, flipping, zooming, etc.

These preprocessing steps are crucial for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of deep learning models. However, it should be noted that the choice of preprocessing techniques depends on the nature of the problem and the characteristics of the dataset.
