100 km2) (Table 1). The frequency of occurrence of conflict types also 
differed  between  the  Euro-Siberian  and  Irano-Turanian  regions,  as 
damages to livestock and beehives and road accidents were significantly 
higher in the Euro-Siberian region (Table 1).

To  determine  risk  probabilities  across  Türkiye  and  to  reduce  the 
uncertainty among models, we constructed a final ensemble conflict risk 
model by weight averaging the ten different algorithms as implemented 
in the biomod2 package (Thuiller, 2014). By combining predictions from 
several  different  modeling  approaches,  ensemble  models  have  been 
shown  to  produce  more  robust  results  when  compared  to  individual 
models  (Buonincontri  et  al.,  2023;  Erickson  and  Smith,  2023).  We 
averaged  predictions  across  three  replicated  runs  for  each  model and 
selected model runs with a TSS > 0.5 for generating the ensemble model. 
We classified the predicted risk probabilities generated by the ensemble 
model  into  5  classes:  no-risk  areas  (< 0.2),  low-risk  areas  (0.2–0.4), 
moderate-risk areas (0.4–0.6), high-risk areas (0.6–0.8) and extreme risk 
areas (> 0.8).

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information on the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, common practices include splitting the dataset randomly or stratified based on class labels, using a fixed percentage such as 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing, or employing techniques like k-fold cross-validation. It is essential to ensure that the splits maintain the same distribution as the original dataset to avoid introducing bias during the training process.
