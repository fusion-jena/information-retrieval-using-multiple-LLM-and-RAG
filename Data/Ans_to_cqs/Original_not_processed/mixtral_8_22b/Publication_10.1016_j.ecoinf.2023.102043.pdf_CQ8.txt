3.2.2. Transfer learning based on YAMNet 

The second algorithm exploits the representation extracted from a 
deep neural network, i.e. YAMNet, which is pre-trained on data coming 
from 521 classes. Interestingly, YAMNet follows the MobileV1 convo-
lution architecture and is trained on the AudioSet-YouTube corpus (Shor 
et  al.,  2020).  Towards  using  YAMNet,  the  audio  data  is  processed  as 
follows:  

1.  The audio is converted to a monophonic channel and resampled at 

16 kHz.  

2.  The spectrogram is extracted and created using STFT magnitudes of 

25 ms overlapped by 15 ms.  

3.  The Mel spectrogram is calculated by mapping to 64 bins of the Mel 

scale within the range of 125–7500 Hz.  

4.  Finally, the algorithm is applied and its outcome is passed to YAMNet 

model for extracting the embeddings.

model for extracting the embeddings. 

These are pulled from YAMNet and then fed as input to a sequential 
and  a  reduce  mean  layer  mapping  to  the  classes  mentioned  above 
(Ntalampiras et al., 2021). At this point, the final layers of the network 
map the YAMNet embeddings to the available labels as shown in Fig. 5. 

3.3. Results on goat vocalization detection 

The  dataset  presented  in  Section  3.2  was  divided  into  70%  for 
training, 10% for validation, and 20% for testing purposes. The division 
was  kept  the  same  when  experimenting  with  RF  and  YAMNet-based

Therefore, the recording campaign was planned to last an entire year so 
as  to  capture  the  variations  that  goat  vocalizations  demonstrate 
throughout  the  year.  Overall,  we  have  collected  approximately  10  M 
sound  events  lasting  more  than  34,000  h.  Fig.  7  illustrates  the  data 
distribution per farm in terms of number of audio files, annotations and 
durations.

The annotation process is based on the information provided by the 
available farm records filled by the stock persons and the output of the 
YAMNet-based goat vocalization detection algorithm described in Sec-
tion 3.3. Furthermore, cameras were positioned in the barns, and videos 
were transmitted via WiFi to a digital video recorder and stored on a 
hard disk. These videos, together with farm records, were used to sup-
port animal scientists in the labeling of goat vocalizations. To match the 
registers and domain expert knowledge, we designed and developed a 
web-based annotation tool available in the back-end area of the official 
project’s Web site (https://vocapra.lim.di.unimi.it/). The list of possible 
events (i.e., event types) was provided by domain experts, namely ani-
mal scientists  and  farmers. Fig.  8 illustrates  the  variables  used in  the 
study (i.e. contexts of emission) are those out of boxes and are organized

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough context to determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is located. The given text does not mention any specific links or platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
