mapping probability samples that are exclusively used for map evalua-
tion are often not available and therefore alternative methods have been 
proposed.  In  machine  learning,  if  data  are  abundant,  a  common 
approach is to randomly divide the full dataset used for modelling into 
three parts: a training set, a validation set, and a test set (Hastie et al., 
2009,  Chapter  7).  The  training  set  is  used  for  fitting  the  models,  the 
validation set is used to estimate prediction error for model selection and 
hyperparameter tuning, while the test set is used for assessing the ac-
curacy of the final model. This paper addresses this latter testing phase, 
with the specific aim to assess the accuracy of a thematic map produced 
by a calibrated statistical prediction method. Data availability is often 
limited  so that setting  aside a  test set  cannot always be afforded and 
therefore resampling methods are used (Hastie et al., 2009; Steele et al.,

1. Introduction 

Maps of environmental variables such as above-ground biomass, soil 
carbon stock and land cover change are essential information sources for 
assessing global carbon fluxes and to support climate change mitigation 
actions (Fitts et al., 2021; Harris et al., 2021). Such maps are commonly 
produced  by  machine  learning  approaches  using  spatially  exhaustive 
Earth observation imagery, climatic data and terrain variables derived 
from digital elevation models as predictors (e.g. Du et al., 2020; Grabska 

et  al.,  2020;  Li  et  al.,  2020;  Morais  et  al.,  2021;  Poggio  et  al.,  2021; 
Sanderman et al., 2018). It is widely acknowledged that maps resulting 
from  model  predictions  are  not  error-free  and  need  proper  accuracy 
assessment  (Ploton  et  al.,  2020;  Stehman  and  Foody,  2019;  Wadoux 
et al., 2021).

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of Earth observation imagery, climatic data, and terrain variables derived from digital elevation models as predictors. This suggests that the data formats used could include images (for Earth observation imagery) and possibly CSV or other tabular formats for climatic data and terrain variables. Without more specific details, it is difficult to determine the exact data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.
