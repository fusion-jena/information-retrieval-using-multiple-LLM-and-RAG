2014), which is suggested for relatively small datasets such as ours
(Ng et al., 2015; Peng et al., 2018). The CNN model (Fig. 2) is trained
using a two-stage process. In the ﬁrst stage only a top classiﬁer
(fully connected layer) is trained based on features extracted from
processing images with a pretrained convolutional part of the net-
work. In the second stage, an adjustment of the network in a ﬁne-
tuned manner (using smaller learning rates) is done by training it
as a whole. A two phase approach was used to speed up the process
by preserving pretrained encoder weights in the ﬁrst phase of the
training and achieve optimal model performance using the second
phase. We also applied data augmentation by randomly deforming
input images in each training cycle due to the small sample size.
Additionally, dropout techniques (Hinton et al., 2012) were applied
to extracted features to enhance model robustness.

cies level (Table 2). The network performed surprisingly well con-
sidering the ImageNet dataset does not contain any similar object
(e.g., does not contain non-biting midges). As expected, the results
further improved when ﬁne-tuning was applied in the second
training phase, where the whole network was trained allowing
the model to learn additional features speciﬁc to our dataset.

factors: network architecture, protocol type of image acquisition
(Martineau et al., 2017), and robustness of input matrix (number
of entities and replicates). Our choice to use a ResNet-50 network
architecture, in combination with transfer learning, data augmen-
tation, and dropout proved appropriate for the current number of
taxa in our demonstration dataset. ResNet-50 network architecture
represents a midsize solution in the ResNet palette (18, 34, 50, 101,
152 layers) that combines both representation power and lower
complexity that allows relatively fast training of the models. How-
ever, the protocol for image acquisition inﬂuences the complexity
of features, which will be processed by CNNs. Controlled object
position during the collection of images can also govern the level
of feature variability. Our dataset was constructed under the lab-
based protocol of image acquisition with fully controlled position
of the larvae (ventral point of view). This was not the case in pre-

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about specific preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it mentions several other strategies employed before training the deep learning model. These include a two-stage training process, data augmentation, and application of dropout techniques.

In the first stage of the training process, only a top classifier (fully connected layer) is trained based on features extracted from processing images with a pretrained convolutional part of the network. This suggests that some form of feature extraction has been carried out prior to the actual training.

Data augmentation is another technique mentioned, which involves randomly deforming input images in each training cycle. This step helps increase the diversity of the training data without actually collecting new samples, thus improving the model's ability to generalize.

Dropout techniques are also applied to extracted features to enhance model robustness. Dropout is a regularization method that approximates training a large number of neural networks with different architectures in parallel. During training, some number of neuron outputs are randomly ignored or “dropped out.” This has the effect of making the training process noisy, forcing nodes within a layer to probabilistically take on more or less responsibility for the inputs. It reduces overfitting and improves the model’s performance on unseen data.
