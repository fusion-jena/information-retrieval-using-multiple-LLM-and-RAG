Measurement of Performance
To get a sense of how our approaches will perform on new unseen
data, and also to keep a track of if any of our approaches are
overﬁtting, we run all our experiments across a whole range
of train-test set splits, namely 80–20 (80% of the whole dataset
used for training, and 20% for testing), 60–40 (60% of the whole
dataset used for training, and 40% for testing), 50–50 (50% of

the whole dataset used for training, and 50% for testing), 40–60
(40% of the whole dataset used for training, and 60% for testing)
and ﬁnally 20–80 (20% of the whole dataset used for training,
and 80% for testing). It must be noted that in many cases, the
PlantVillage dataset has multiple images of the same leaf (taken
from diﬀerent orientations), and we have the mappings of such
cases for 41,112 images out of the 54,306 images; and during all

Helpful Answer:
The authors of this study utilize the publicly available dataset called PlantVillage. This dataset contains over 54,000 images of healthy and diseased leaves collected under controlled conditions. The dataset includes images of various crops such as corn, grapes, potatoes, tomatoes, apples, strawberries, blueberries, peaches, oranges, lemons, cherries, squash, bell peppers, raspberries, and soybeans. Each image in the dataset is labeled with its corresponding disease class. The dataset is divided into three categories based on color: color, grayscale, and leaf segmentation. Additionally, the dataset provides information about the mapping of multiple images of the same leaf taken from different orientations. However, it should be noted that the authors only provide this information for 41,112 images out of the total 54,306 images. Overall, the authors rely solely on the PlantVillage dataset for their deep learning pipeline and do not mention any other methods for collecting raw data.
