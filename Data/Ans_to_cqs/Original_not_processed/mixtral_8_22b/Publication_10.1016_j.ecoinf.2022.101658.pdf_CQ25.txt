our study, is due to the deep learning method’s loss function, which is 
biased toward overrepresented classes. This represents a performance 
barrier for any study using semantic segmentation with few images and 
high class-imbalance.

in  semantic  segmentation  training  and

Since the multi-class (i.e. 10 classes) semantic segmentation problem 
is quite complex, the set of 290 training images was found to be insuf-
ficient to obtain satisfactory results, even with the use of the transfer 
learning framework. Therefore, we employed data augmentation stra-
tegies to increase the training set size fourfold: horizontal flip, Gaussian 
noise  addition,  and  contrast  reduction.  The  first  two  augmentation 
strategies are fairly common. The contrast reduction strategy was spe-
cifically motivated by our application, namely given that we expect the 
images  to  contain  shadows  occluding  the  vegetation  types,  contrast 
reduction helps to simulate areas of low lighting which can be expected 
in the dataset.

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is semantic segmentation. Semantic segmentation is a process where individual pixels in an image are classified according to their category or class. In this case, the deep learning model is being trained to identify different fuel types within ground photographs. The goal is to overcome the challenge posed by high class imbalance and few images, which has been identified as a barrier to performance in studies using semantic segmentation.
