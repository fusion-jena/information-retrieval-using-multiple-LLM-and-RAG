model performance. In each replication, the corresponding dataset was 
partitioned  into  training,  validation,  and  testing  sets  with  a  different 
random  seed,  and  the  performance  metrics  on  the  test  set  over  three 
replications  were  averaged  for  eventual  model  assessment.  The  weed

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves partitioning the corresponding dataset into training, validation, and testing sets with a different random seed in each replication. The performance metrics on the test set are then averaged over three replications for eventual model assessment. This process is conducted within the framework of PyTorch (version 1.13.1) with Torchvision (version 0.14.1), OpenCV (version 4.7.0), and CUDNN (version 9.2) on an NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPU.
