Individual machine learning models address large datasets and dy-
namic water quality data well but are commonly overfit. Researchers 
have employed model to address this issue. Combining weak learners 
reduces overfitting and strengthens the prediction model (Mosavi et al., 
2020). Adedeji et al., 2022 predicted stream water quality using SVM, 
RF,  XGB,  ensemble  RF-XGB,  and  ANN  models.  Panahi  et  al.  (2022) 
predicted stream flow and water quality with data pre-processing based 
on  an  ensemble  bagging  technique  combined  with  the  SVM  model. 
(Haghiabi et al., 2018) analyzed various aspects of water quality in the 
Tireh River in Iran, employing models based on ANN, group method of 
data handling (GMDH), and SVM. Among these models, the SVM model 
utilizing  the  radial  bias  function  demonstrated  outstanding  perfor-
mance,  highlighting  its  effectiveness  in  accurately  predicting  water

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the researchers utilized machine learning models to analyze and predict water quality parameters such as conductivity, BOD, nitrate, and DO. Therefore, we can infer that the data format used is likely to be structured data, possibly in CSV or similar tabular format, containing numerical values representing these water quality parameters. The context also mentions the use of libraries like Lazy Predict, which supports various machine learning models, further suggesting the use of structured data. Without additional context, we cannot confirm if other data formats like images, audio, or video were used in the deep learning pipeline.
