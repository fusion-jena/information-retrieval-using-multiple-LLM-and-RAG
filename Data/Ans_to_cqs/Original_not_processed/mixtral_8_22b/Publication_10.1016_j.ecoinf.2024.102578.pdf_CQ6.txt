2. Workflow 

The multi-step, semi-automated workflow proposed here (Fig. 1) is 
adapted from B¨ohner et al., 2023, including pre-processing of images, 
model  training,  classification,  manual  quality  checks,  and  final  data 
formatting. Specifically, we build on the results of Rigoudy et al. (2022) 
and  Fennell  et  al.  (2022),  who  combined  MegaDetector  with  manual 
classification and custom-trained models. The workflow consists of the 
following two classification steps in addition to pre-processing of images 
and  final  manual  inspection,  quality  control,  and  data  formatting 
(Fig. 1). 

2.1. Classification 1 – Image quality and animal presence/absence

Separate  two-class  models  were  trained  for  Finnmark  and  Yamal 
using  the  keras  package  in  R  (Allaire  and  Chollet,  2023)  with  a  Ten-
sorFlow  backend (Allaire  and Tang,  2023).  Preliminary trials  showed 
that region-specific models performed better. The ResNet-50 architec-
ture, a convolutional neural network that is 50 layers deep (He et al., 
2015), was used to train the models with 55 epochs (number of times the 
algorithm goes through the entire training data set) and a batch size of 
64  (number  of  samples  to  work  through  before  updating  model  pa-
rameters)  with  a  one-cycle  learning  rate  (hyperparameter  controlling 
model  response  to  estimated  error  each  time  the  model  weights  are 
updated) policy with a minimum of 0.000001 and a maximum of 0.001 
(Smith, 2018).

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that some level of preprocessing might have been done due to the nature of the task. Typically, preprocessing steps could include normalization, scaling, or cleaning of the dataset. Normalization involves rescaling the values to fit within a certain range, often between 0 and 1. Scaling refers to adjusting the scale of features so they fall under similar ranges, which helps prevent variables with larger scales dominating those with smaller ones. Cleaning may involve removing missing or irrelevant data points, handling outliers, or dealing with inconsistent data entries. In this case, since the authors mentioned using separate two-class models for different regions, it suggests that there might have been some regional differences in the input data requiring appropriate preprocessing. Nevertheless, without explicit information about the exact preprocessing steps applied, it remains speculative.
