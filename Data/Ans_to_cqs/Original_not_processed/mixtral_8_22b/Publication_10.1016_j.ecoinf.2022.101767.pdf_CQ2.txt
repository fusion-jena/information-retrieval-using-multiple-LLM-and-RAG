Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

2.2. Data extraction of videos displaying wild birds

For thumbnail information, we classified the thumbnail character-
istics into six categories, including people, birds, objects, scenery, text, 
and food. Objects that we identified in the videos were either a camera 
or  binoculars.  Each  thumbnail  category  was  recorded  as  a  separate 
column (i.e., basically, with a value of 0 or 1 in a separate column of 
each category). 

2.3. Data analysis 

The  following  data  analyses  were  performed  using  R  software 
version 4.1.2 (R Core Team, 2021) with Boruta, lmerTest, car, MuMIn, 
and randomForest packages.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it is not explicitly stated what specific data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline. However, there are some clues that can help infer possible data formats.

Firstly, the research involves analyzing videos displaying wild birds and extracting thumbnail characteristics from these videos. This suggests that one of the data formats used could be video files. Additionally, since thumbnail characteristics are being extracted, it is likely that images are also used in the pipeline.

Secondly, the data analysis section mentions that the analysis was conducted using R software version 4.1.2 with various packages such as Boruta, lmerTest, car, MuMIn, and randomForest. These packages are commonly used for statistical analysis and machine learning tasks involving structured data, which often comes in the form of CSV files. Therefore, it is plausible that CSV files containing metadata about the videos and their corresponding thumbnail characteristics are used in the pipeline.

Lastly, while not directly mentioned in the context, it is worth noting that audio data may also be relevant in this type of research. For instance, sound recordings of bird calls could potentially be used to identify different bird species in the videos. However, without further information, it cannot be confirmed whether audio data is indeed used in the pipeline.

To summarize, based on the given context, it can be inferred that the deep learning pipeline likely uses video, image, and possibly CSV file formats. Audio data may also be relevant but is not explicitly mentioned in the context.
