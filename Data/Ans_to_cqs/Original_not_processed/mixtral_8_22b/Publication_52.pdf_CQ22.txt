Moreover, a graph represents the accuracy for the data sets that have been considered

As it has been proven, ELMs are an important approach for handling and analysing Big
Data as they require the minimum training time relative to the corresponding engineering
learning algorithms. Moreover ELMs do not require ﬁne manipulations to determine their
operating parameters and ﬁnally they can determine the appropriate output weights
towards the most eﬀective resolution of a problem. What is most important, they have

performance based solely on their training data set. It is obvious that the emerging use of
ELM in Big Data analysis as well as DELE creates serious prerequisites for complex systems’
development by low-cost machines.

The 10-fold cross validation (10_FCV) is employed in this stage in order to obtain per-
formance indices. Analytical values of the predictive capacity of the DELMF algorithm are
presented in the following Tables 1–3 where a comparison is made with the Spiking Con-
volutional Neural Network (SCNN) algorithm, which was the subject of an earlier research
eﬀort by our team (Demertzis et al., 2017). The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)
curve, that is a graphical plot that illustrates the diagnostic ability of the classiﬁer
system are presented in graphs 4–6. Authors have designed 3 ROC curves. The ﬁrst ROC
curve (Graph 4) represents the underwater sounds, the second curve (Graph 5) indicates
the ﬁshes and ﬁnally the third curve (Graph 6) depicts the mammals. In all simulations

Helpful Answer:

The performance of the deep learning models in the given context is evaluated using several metrics such as Classification Accuracy (ACC), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Precision, Recall, F-Score, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC). These metrics are calculated for both the DELMF and SCNN classifiers across different datasets like mammals\_dataset and fishes\_dataset. Additionally, the Time taken by each classifier is also reported.

For instance, Table 2 shows the performance metrics for the mammals\_dataset, where DELMF achieves an accuracy of 92.18%, while SCNN scores 92.10%. Similarly, other metrics like RMSE, Precision, Recall, F-Score, and ROC are compared between the two classifiers. The same evaluation methodology is applied to the fishes\_dataset in Table 3.

In summary, the performance of the deep learning models is assessed using various metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F-score, ROC, and time. This comprehensive evaluation helps compare the effectiveness of different classifiers across multiple datasets.
