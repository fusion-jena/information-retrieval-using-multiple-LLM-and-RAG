processing  of  the  recorded  images.  In  some  cases,  deep  learning 
models perform quite poorly when the training data and the test data are 
recorded with different types of cameras, different illumination condi-
tions  and/or  different  acquisition  geometries.  Hence,  additional  con-
siderations  concerning  transferability  of  the  model  are  needed,  if 
training  and  model  application  are  based  on  datasets  taken  with 
different devices, as e.g., reflex camera and smartphone, respectively.

models  can  extract  complex  image  features  and  project  them  into  a 
latent space representation to produce an image classification based on 
these features. To achieve a suitable biocrust coverage estimation, one 
needs to classify every pixel of an image at the highest possible accuracy. 
This pixel-wise classification is called semantic segmentation. Various 
neural  network  architectures  like  UNet  (Ronneberger  et  al.,  2015)  or 
DeepLabV3  (Chen  et  al.,  2017)  were  developed  for  semantic  image 
segmentation (Minaee et al., 2021).

When  it  comes  to  the  application  of  deep  learning  models,  it  is 
mandatory to train the model on training data that resemble the data, on 
which  the model will be applied  later. If the  model is  applied over  a 
longer period of time (as it can be the case in long term biomonitoring), 
the training dataset and the dataset, on which the model is applied can 
have  different  data  distributions  due  to  some  reasons,  like  different 
recording  conditions  (brightness,  scale)  or  recording  devices/sensors 
(contrast,  resolution).  This  is  a  well-known  phenomenon  called  data 
drift  or  domain  drift  (Farahani  et  al.,  2020).  Thus,  it  is  necessary  to 
create specific datasets tailored to the desired application. The field of 
machine learning that is dealing with this discrepancy across domain 
distributions, is called domain adaption, with the aim of increasing the 
transferability of models to datasets with similar statistical properties.

The current study deals with two different analysis. First, we inves-
tigated  the  applicability  of  a  neural  network  based  semantic  image 
segmentation on biocrust image data to enable an automated biocrust 
monitoring over different ecosystems and over long periods of time. And 
finally, in order to improve the problem of insufficient transferability of 
deep learning models between datasets obtained with different camera 
sensors(with  different  sensor  construction,  sensor  size  and/or  resolu-
tion), different device settings (with different aperture, field of view and

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. One such measure was using diverse datasets for training and testing purposes. These datasets included images captured under various conditions, such as different illumination levels, acquisition geometries, and camera types. By incorporating these variations, the model could learn to adapt to new environments and maintain its performance even when applied to unseen data.

Cross-validation was another technique employed to enhance the model's robustness. Cross-validation involves dividing the available data into multiple subsets, where each subset serves as a validation set while the remaining subsets form the training set. This process is repeated until all subsets have been used as the validation set once. By doing so, the model's ability to generalize is evaluated more accurately, reducing the risk of overfitting.

Stratified splitting was also utilized during the creation of the training and validation sets. This method ensures that both sets contain representative samples from each class present in the original dataset. Consequently, the model can better capture the underlying patterns within the data, leading to improved overall performance and generalization capabilities.

Additionally, the study addressed the issue of data drift or domain drift by focusing on domain adaptation techniques. Domain adaptation aims to increase the transferability of models to datasets with similar statistical properties but different distributions. By employing these methods, the researchers aimed to create specific datasets tailored to their desired applications, thereby improving the model's performance and ensuring its generalizability across varying domains.
