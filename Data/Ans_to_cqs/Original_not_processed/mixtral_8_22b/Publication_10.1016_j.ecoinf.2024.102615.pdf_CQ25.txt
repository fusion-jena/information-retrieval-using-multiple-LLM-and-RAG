activation function to learn the nonlinear expression of the data; iii) a

2.3. Model optimization 

The model performance optimization process is broadly divided into 
two stages, as shown in Fig. 3. The R value of the validation set is used as 
the performance indicator during the optimization process, whereby R is 
maximized  using  the  grid  search  method.  During  the  first  stage,  the 
neural network structure and the number of neurons in the hidden layers 
are  adjusted.  In  total,  60  sets  of  combinations,  including  one  to  five 
hidden layers and neurons with a range of 64–2048 (nth  power of 2), 
were considered. The second stage involves adjusting the percentage of 
the dropout layers, the learning rate, and the batch size, to achieve a 
total of 192 combinations (4*4*3*4).

2.4.2. Performance metrics and interpretation method of the model 

This  study  uses  the  correlation  coefficient  (R),  root  mean  square 
error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) coefficient of determination 
(R2), and mean relative error (MAE) metrics to confirm the prediction 
performance of the model on the validation set. R measures the linear 
relationship between two variables. Its value varies between (cid:0) 1 and 1, 
such that values closer to 0 denote a lesser correlation between the two 
variables,  indicating  improved  model  performance.  The  formula  for 
calculating R is as follows (Qi et al., 2018): 

R =

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model described in this context is not explicitly stated. However, based on its design and components, it appears to be a regression model aimed at predicting or estimating the Manganese (Mn) content in soil samples. This can be inferred from the fact that the model has an input layer with 4200 dimensions of spectral reflectance data, multiple hidden layers with Rectified Linear Unit (ReLu) activation functions, batch normalization layers, dropout layers, and a single dimensional output layer representing the Mn content. Additionally, the use of the correlation coefficient (R), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), coefficient of determination (R^2), and mean relative error (MAE) as performance metrics further suggests that the model is designed for regression tasks rather than classification, segmentation, or object detection.
