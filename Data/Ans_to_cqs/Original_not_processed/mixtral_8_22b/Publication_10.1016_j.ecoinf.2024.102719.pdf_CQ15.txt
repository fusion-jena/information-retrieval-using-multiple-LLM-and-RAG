The tree-structured Parzen estimator (TPE) improves the perfor-
mances of ML algorithms by finding the optimal hyperparameter set of
each ML model. The TPE estimates the probability distribution of the
hyperparameters using a probabilistic model and iteratively constructs a
tree of Gaussian distributions to approximate the objective function.
This probabilistic model then selects new hyperparameters for the
subsequent rounds of ML evaluation. The TPE is designed for efficient
searching in high-dimensional spaces.

In the present study, the TPE algorithm identified the most effective

Predictive models that relate river health to gradients of environ-
mental factors can identify potential causes of impairment in areas of
ecological concern, supporting strategic decisions on prioritizing resto-
ration activities and new monitoring initiatives. Such models should be
generalizable to unseen data for predicting the river health in unmoni-
tored areas. Bias–variance decomposition is widely adopted for gener-
alizability evaluations of ML models (Guan and Burton, 2022; Van Der
Putten and Van Someren, 2004; Van Der Valk and Picek, 2019).
Although deep learning and other ML models have been widely
employed in river health predictions (Gazendam et al., 2016; Kwon
et al., 2024; Lee et al., 2021), they have not been supplemented with
evaluation techniques that would confirm their generalizability to un-
seen datasets. In the present study, the generalizability of various ML

Helpful Answer:
While the given context does not explicitly mention specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), it discusses another optimization method called Tree-Structured Parzen Estimator (TPE). This method is employed to improve the performance of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms by identifying the optimal hyperparameter sets for each ML model. It works by estimating the probability distribution of the hyperparameters using a probabilistic model and iteratively constructing a tree of Gaussian distributions to approximate the objective function. However, this information alone cannot provide a direct comparison between TPE and traditional optimization methods like SGD or Adam. Therefore, further research into the literature discussing these optimization techniques within the context of deep learning pipelines would be necessary to fully address the query.
