The EF network architecture consisted of three convolutional layers (Conv) including the
Rectiﬁed Linear Unit (ReLU), two Max-pooling layers (MaxPool), and two Fully Connected layers
(FC), with a softmax layer at the end with two outputs, corresponding to “deforestation” and
“no-deforestation” classes. The ﬁlter and output size of each layer are summarized in Table 3.

For training the EF and SN models, we selected the following setup empirically: batch size equal
to 32 with 100 number of epochs, early stopping after 10 epochs with no improvement (over the
validation set) and a dropout rate of 0.2 in the ﬁnal FC layer. Additionally, Adam optimizer was
selected empirically with weight decay equal to 0.9 and learning rate equal to 10−3. As loss function,
we used the binary cross-entropy.

2.6. Inﬂuence of the Number of Training Samples

To evaluate the inﬂuence of the number of training samples, four scenarios were considered.
Speciﬁcally collecting samples from the training set of a one, two, three and four tiles, denoted as Ni,
where i corresponds to the number of tiles used in each scenario. For EF and SN methods, the validation
set (val) was used to stop training once the loss increased in 10 consecutive epochs (early stopping).
As mentioned before, for CSVM and SVM the samples in this set were added to the training set (tr).
The number of training samples in each scenario for the Amazon and Cerrado databases is presented
in Tables 6 and 7, respectively.

The buffer of both references was obtained applying the morphological dilation, using as
structuring elements a disk of radius 2. This operation expanded the boundaries of the deforested
polygons. Then, a difference between the dilated and original images was performed, resulting in the
outer edge, and the patches with the central pixel in these regions were not considered for training,
validation or test.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model include a batch size of 32, 100 number of epochs, early stopping after 10 epochs with no improvement over the validation set, and a dropout rate of 0.2 in the final fully connected layer. The Adam optimizer was chosen with a weight decay of 0.9 and a learning rate of 10^-3. The binary cross-entropy was used as the loss function.
