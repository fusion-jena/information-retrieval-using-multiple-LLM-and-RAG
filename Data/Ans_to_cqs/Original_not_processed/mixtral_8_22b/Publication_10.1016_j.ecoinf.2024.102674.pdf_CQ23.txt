over five decays (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1) and sizes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). We fitted 
RFs using the RANDOMFOREST R package (Liaw and Wiener, 2002) with 500 
trees, five as the minimum size of terminal nodes, and by sampling all 
descriptors for splitting at each node; these RFs were thus equivalent to 
bagged decision trees. Finally, we fitted GBMs via the  GBM  R package 
(Greenwell et al., 2020) by ensembling a maximum of 10,000 trees, with 
shrinkage and interaction parameters equal to 0.01 and 1, respectively; 
each  tree  was  thus  equivalent  to  a  decision  stump.  After  model  cali-
bration, we identified the most relevant physiographic descriptors for 
each algorithm and each month. For GAMs, we evaluated the predictors’ 
relative importance by considering their F statistics. We assessed vari-
able importance in ANNs by employing the Olden method (Olden et al., 
2004)  implemented  in  the  NEURALNETTOOLS  R  package  (Beck,  2018).

Importantly,  these  biases were  reflected by  the  cross-validations, too, 
namely  by  consistently  negative  average  pbias  values  (i.e.,  underesti-
mation) during the hot season and positive average pbias values (i.e., 
overestimation)  during  the  cold  season  (Fig.  2a).  That  downscaling 
techniques could have encountered some difficulties was anticipated. As 
mentioned,  downscaling  macroclimate  grids  cannot  catch  climate- 
forcing effects not initially present in the coarse-scale products (Lem-
brechts et al., 2019). WorldClim’s grid values, for instance, are initially 
derived by interpolating weather station measurements with the help of 
altitude and distance to the coast as topographical predictors (Fick and 
Hijmans,  2017);  interestingly,  these  two  descriptors  were  the  only 
relevant  ones  when  we  downscaled  WorldClim  (Fig.  A.12  in  Appen-
dices). In this respect, our results underline that these difficulties can

downscalings extrapolated by comparing the training data at the cali-
bration points with the projection data over the study area. By doing so, 
we  obtained  12  surfaces  of  the  Shape  extrapolation  metric  for  both 
WorldClim and CHELSA, one for each month.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The authors used several methods to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model. They employed diverse datasets, including various physiographic descriptors such as altitude, slope, aspect, solar radiation, and others. To evaluate the performance of their model, they conducted cross-validations, which revealed consistent patterns of bias. Specifically, they observed negative average pbias values during the hot season and positive average pbias values during the cold season. This suggests that the model may have had difficulty capturing certain climate-forcing effects not initially present in the coarse-scale products. Additionally, they compared the training data at the calibration points with the projection data over the study area to obtain 12 surfaces of the Shape extrapolation metric for both WorldClim and CHELSA, one for each month. However, it is important to note that the specific details regarding stratified splitting or other techniques commonly used to improve model generalization are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
