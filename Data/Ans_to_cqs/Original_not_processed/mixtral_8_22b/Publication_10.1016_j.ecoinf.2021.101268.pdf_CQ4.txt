4.2. Architecture configurations 

Convolutional neural networks (CNN) outstand over DL techniques 
by disentangling high-level representations across multiple processing 
layers. CNN’s process data on two levels: a convolutional block for the 
automatic  feature  extraction,  and  fully  connected  layers  to  establish 
feature-output  correlation.  The  convolutional  block  comprises  con-
volutional,  ReLU,  and  max-pooling  layers.  Each  set  of  convolutional 
layers diversify features by applying a set of parallel filters that process 
local sections of the input space. The feature vector integrates low-level 
local features from the first layers and higher-level representations from 
the latest ones.

Like any other complex model, DL requires a large amount of data to 
fit appropriately, which is hard in our context. To overcome this limi-
tation, we employ different architectures pre-trained with the ImageNet 
dataset. Pre-trained models capture low-level features (e.g., edges, cor-
ners, color spots, etc.) from one domain and transfer them to another 
with  similar  characteristics.  The  transfer  process  is  called  fine-tuning 
due  to  the  model  only  learns  specific  higher-level  features  (e.g.,  ar-
rangements, venations, etc.). We compare four pre-trained models: (1) 
AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012, 2) VGG-19 (Simonyan and Zisserman, 
2014, 3) ResNet-101 (He et al., 2016, 4) DenseNet-201 (Huang et al., 
2017).  The  fully  connected  block  is  adjusted  to  feed  off  the  feature 
vector and output the ten species of leaves. Table 3 describe architecture

validation samples are selected randomly from the first group. The data 
distribution is 70.12% for training, 1.69% validation, and 28.19% for 
testing. The model feeds off with 16 elements per mini-batches using the 
ADAM optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014) with a learning rate of 1e-3. To 
run our experiments, we use Pytorch 1.3 framework in a PC with the 
following specifications: 4.0 GHz Intel Core i9 processor, 32 GB 3000 
MHz DDR4 memory, and NVIDIA Titan RTX.

input space relevance. Thus, a higher density in a region suggests that 
the network ponderates it the most when classifying.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information about the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, and adjusting brightness or contrast. These techniques help increase the size and diversity of the dataset, improving the model's ability to generalize and prevent overfitting.
