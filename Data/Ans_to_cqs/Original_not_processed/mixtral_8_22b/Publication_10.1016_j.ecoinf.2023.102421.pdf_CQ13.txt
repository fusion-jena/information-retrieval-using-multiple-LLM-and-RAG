2.4. Hyperparameter optimisation 

Hyperparameter  optimization  searches  for  the  best  set  of  hyper-
parameters  for  a  machine  learning  model  that  can  perform  best  on  a 
given  task.  In  many  packages,  random  or  grid  search  is  the  default 
method  for  selecting  optimal  hyperparameters  (Snoek  et  al.,  2012). 
There are many studies on the selections of optimization algorithms for 
theoretical  problems  or  engineering  applications,  in  which  various 
versions  of  Bayesian  optimizers  and  Swarm-based  algorithms  were 
compared (Stenger et al., 2019; Stenger and Dirk, 2022).

The training dataset, including 268 sample plots with 39 features in a 
tabulated format, was used as input during the training process (opti-
mizing  hyper-parameters  and  fitting  models  with  these  data).  The 
training data set was divided into two parts, in which 80% was used for 
training/validation, and the remaining 20% was kept as unseen data for 
testing. To eliminate bias, 10-fold cross-validation was used during the 
training  process,  and  mean  RMSE  was  used  as  the  objective  function 
(lost function). Table 4 shows RMSE, MAE, and R2  using different op-
timizers. In addition, we tested the differences between the RMSEs in 
Table 4 using the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test with paired samples. The 
differences between (XGBoost-BO vs. XGBoost-TDO, XGBoost-BOHB vs. 
XGBoost-TDO) or (LightGBM-BO vs. LightGBM-TDO, LightGBM-BOHB 
vs.  LightGBM-TDO)  are  significant.  However,  the  performance  of 
XGBoost-TDO  versus  LightGBM-TDO  appears  to  be  the  same (Fig.  3),

As  machine  learning  models  have  been  increasingly  deployed  in 
critical applications, there may be a growing demand for interpretable 
and explainable hyperparameter optimization techniques. Methods that 
provide transparency and explainability in the hyperparameter tuning 
process  could  gain  importance  to  ensure  fairness,  accountability,  and 
transparency in developing machine learning models. Machine learning 
algorithms are considered robust classification and regression methods 
in which models are trained and learned from input data to improve the 
prediction of unseen data. However, the internal process is not under-
standable, as  it is  considered a  black-box stage. To  better understand 
interactions  between  features,  we  evaluated  several  performance  in-
dicators,  such  as  feature  importance,  feature  interactions,  and  contri-
butions of all features. The Shapley values provide a way to distribute

Bayesian optimization is a family of algorithms used for the global 
optimization of black-box functions. These algorithms utilize Bayesian 
statistical  techniques  to  model  the  unknown  objective  function  and 
iteratively explore the search space to find the optimal solution. Each 
algorithm has its characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses, making it 
suitable for optimization problems. The choice of algorithm is subject to 
specific requirements of the problem at hand, such as the dimensionality 
of  the  search  space,  the  presence  of  noise, and  the  computational  re-
sources  available.  Typically,  optimization  is  problem-dependent,  and 
comparisons  are  worth  making  in specific  contexts.  In  this study, the 
hyperparameters of XGBoost and LightGBM were tuned by several op-
timizers, using RMSE as the objective (loss) function.

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. However, it discusses the use of hyperparameter optimization for machine learning models, specifically XGBoost and LightGBM, where the hyperparameters were tuned using several optimizers. It also mentions that RMSE was used as the objective (loss) function. Unfortunately, without more detailed information about the specific hyperparameters used, I cannot provide a comprehensive list.
