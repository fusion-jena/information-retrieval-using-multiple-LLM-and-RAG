kernel range). The threshold used was the 10th percentile training presence. For each metric the best model is highlighted in bold where higher was better for AUC, TPR, TSS and Kappa and lower better for Omission.

sampling  effort  e.g.,  some  species  records  were  sourced  from  surveys 
that  recorded absence  in  addition  to  presence-only incidental  records 
from the public. All records were combined to create a bias grid (using 
the previous upweighted area combined with a weighted distribution of 
occurrences), calculated using the Gaussian function:

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information regarding the specific code repository of the deep learning pipeline mentioned in this context is not explicitly stated or provided. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct link or name of the repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. It would be necessary to refer to the original source or contact the authors for more detailed information about the code repository.
