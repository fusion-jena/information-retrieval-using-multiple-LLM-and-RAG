Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it can be determined that a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is being utilized within the pipeline for various tasks such as crop image analysis and tree counting. The use of CNNs is mentioned multiple times throughout the text, including references to specific works [16] and [17] where CNNs were employed for prediction and quantification purposes respectively. Additionally, U-Net, which is also a type of CNN specifically designed for semantic segmentation, was referenced in several studies [20]-[23] for tasks like identifying eucalyptus trees and grading maize drought based on RGB images from UAVs. Therefore, it can be concluded that CNNs are the primary type of deep learning models being used in this pipeline.
