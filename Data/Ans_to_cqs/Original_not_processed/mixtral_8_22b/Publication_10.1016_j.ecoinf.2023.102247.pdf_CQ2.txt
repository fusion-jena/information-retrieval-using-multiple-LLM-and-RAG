3.1. Model accuracy

Habitat in desert and semi-desert ecosystems are especially vulner-
able to climate change because its resources, especially water, are scarce 
(Daneshvar et al., 2019; Evans, 2009). Water resources are a limiting

To  predict  the  distribution  of  the  study  species,  we  employed  an 
ensemble  modeling  approach  in  BIOMOD2  package  (Thuiller  et  al., 
2009) in R (R Development Core Team, 2014) (See text S1). With this 
approach,  we  weight  averaged  four  different  models,  including  one 
regression-based 
three 
machine-learning  (Maximun  entropy  (MaxEnt),  RF(Random  Forest), 
and  Support  Vector  Machines  (SVM))  models,  to  generate  a  final 
ensembled model for each species. To test for model performance, we 
employed cross-validationby using 70% of the dataset as training data to 
build  the  models  and  the  other  30%  as  testing  data  to  calculate  the 
models’  accuracy. The Area Under the Receiving Operator Character-
istics Curve is the index we used to specify the accuracy (AUC). AUC is a 
scale that ranges from 0.5 to 1.0. A higher AUC value indicates that the 
model  is  more  accurate  (Phillips  and  Dudík,  2008).  We  considered  a

factor for many species living in Iran (Morovati et al., 2014; Shadloo and 
Naderi, 2019). In addition, desertification is expected to intensify with a 
warming and drying climate, further limiting the resources within desert 
ecosystems.  For  example,  Iran  is  an  arid  and  semi-arid  country  with 
nearly  70%  of  its  land  at  risk  of  desertification  (Eskandari  Dameneh 
et al., 2021), and its temperature and precipitation are projected to rise 
by  2.6 
C  and  decline  by  35%  over  the  next  decade,  respectively 
(Change, 2007; Zarenistanak et al., 2015). Given the dramatic change 
that  future  climate  can  have  on  desert  and  semi-desert  ecosystems, 
ascertaining  how  species  and  their  habitat  respond  to  such  change  is 
particularly crucial for conservation and management in these systems 
(Almasieh et al., 2018).

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the given context, it appears that the researchers utilized environmental variables related to temperature, precipitation, and distance to roads or rivers. These types of data are typically represented in numerical format, often stored in structured files like CSV (Comma Separated Values) or similar tabular data formats. It is also possible that they could be processed into arrays or matrices suitable for machine learning algorithms. Nevertheless, without explicit confirmation, I cannot definitively state the exact data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.
