2. on the other hand, a practically reasonable pipeline for recognition
can be achieved despite the problem specification challenges, using a
careful examination of different factors, such as pose handling, while
bearing some surprises to the Computer Vision community, e.g., the
advantage of a feature-extraction enhancement (avoiding data
augmentation) over using augmentation techniques.

Preprocessing the input instead of relying on data augmentation is a
preferred way with significantly better results, seemingly by-passing the
difficulty of the Siamese network to learn similarity in the presence of so
few examples. It could be, however, that there is still a better way to by-
pass this difficulty but also exploit the power of augmentations.

Wang and Deng, (2021) also refer to deep face-recognition via face
preprocessing adjustment to work under various conditions, such as
poses, illuminations, expressions and occlusions. The face processing
methods are categorized by Wang and Deng, (2021) as “one-to-many
augmentation”
“One-to-many
and “many-to-one normalization”.
augmentation” methods generate many patches or images of the pose
variability from a single image to enable deep networks to learn pose-
invariant representations. Alternatively, “Many-to-one normalization”
methods recover the canonical view of face images from images of a non-
frontal view; then, face recognition is performed as if it were under
controlled conditions. Their discussion of pose handling in face recog-
nition made us realize that poses should probably be handled also for
individual BR ray recognition as the two different tasks share this
challenge.

3. Methods

Still there are issues that should be considered before a specific
detailed framework can be designed. In order to decide on a feature
extraction and recognition detailed steps framework,12 initial experi-
ments were performed on the individuals labeled database. Since we
study a task that has not been studied before, we explore different as-
pects and several directions to tackle them, which naturally, most of
them are abandoned after evaluating the results. Nevertheless, these
initial experiments are important as a base case to study the conditions
that improve the performance, which is the focus of this paper. Based on
the literature survey our initial experiments referred to the following
issues to be decided for the chosen framework: architecture, data
augmentation usage, feature extraction enhancement and handling
different poses. The evaluation of the initial experiments results then
guided our design of the follow-up experiments. The initial experiments,

The training set included 21 different individuals (classes) each
having 4 different 320 × 320 pixels images. The test size included 99
other labeled images of the individuals that appeared in the training set.
Images of both training and test sizes varied in their poses and other
image characteristics, such as contrast, brightness, etc. The initial ex-
periments referred to the following issues to be decided for the chosen
framework:

1. Architecture: We examined two Siamese architectures versions
based on the work of (Koch et al., 2015), since Siamese networks that
learn a similarity function are a better choice for learning with a
small example set.13 The two architectures have either 2 or 4
convolution layers with Relu activations and Contrastive Loss (CoL)
as a loss function. The implementations are taken from the open
sources of Choi, (2020); Siyah, (2020).

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, the preprocessing step mentioned involves face preprocessing adjustment to handle various conditions like poses, illuminations, expressions, and occlusions. This process is divided into two categories: one-to-many augmentation and many-to-one normalization. One-to-many augmentation generates multiple patches or images of pose variability from a single image, enabling deep networks to learn pose-invariant representations. On the other hand, many-to-one normalization recovers the canonical view of face images from images of a non-frontal view, allowing face recognition to be performed as if it were under controlled conditions. However, the context does not explicitly mention any general preprocessing steps typically used before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.
