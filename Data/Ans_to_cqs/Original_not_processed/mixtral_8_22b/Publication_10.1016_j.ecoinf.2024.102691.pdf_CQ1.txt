was analysed using various evaluation matrices. During model training, 
the input image size was set to 512 × 512 and the maximum batch size 
was limited to 4. To prevent underfitting, all models were ensured to 
follow back-propagation after accumulating the batch size 32 times. The 
models were trained using a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer 
with an initial learning rate of 0.01 and a cycle learning rate of 0.2, with

where,  n  represents  the  input  tensor  with  shape  [batch_size,  height, 
width, channels].  It contains the input  data or feature map  used in a 
neural network, w(n) is a weight tensor derived from n, typically ob-
tained through some form of learned parameters or coefficients, and f (w 
(n), n) represents the process of treating the input feature n. 

The network architecture of the depth-attention YOLOv5 is shown in 
Fig. 10. Unlike other attention mechanisms that are usually introduced 
earlier in the network and trained along with the other layers, the depth- 
attention mechanism was placed after the final processing layers of the 
detection model. It remains unchanged and does not adapt during the 
training  process.  This means that the depth-attention  weights are not 
updated  during  training  and  remain  fixed  throughout  the  learning

2.4.1. Depth attention fusion mechanism 

The attention mechanism was used to provide different weights to 
things depending on how significant they are in a certain visual region. 
To  implement  this  mechanism,  many  techniques  like  SE,  CBAM,  Effi-
cient Channel Attention (ECA), Channel Attention (CA), Non-Local, and 
Global Context Networks (GCNet) are used. The attention mechanism in 
the YOLOv5 network is often included in the C3 module or the last layer 
of the backbone. The process of managing the input feature 'n' based on 
its associated weighting, w(n), is represented by Eq. (1) (Jie et al., 2021).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not explicitly mention any specific methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets. However, it can be inferred that the authors might have used images as their primary source of data since they discuss image sizes and use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) like YOLOv5. Typically, researchers collect image data using cameras, drones, or publicly available datasets like ImageNet, COCO, etc. For agricultural applications, specialized sensors or equipment may also be employed to gather relevant data.
