scenarios. The study showed the suitability of the SVR algorithm for
making predictions with restricted datasets, a finding that aligns with
previous research investigations (Kaveh et al., 2023; Mehmood et al.,
2024a; Zhang et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2022). An important conclusion
is derived from Fig. 6. It highlights that MLR heavily depends on pre-
dictor variables, demonstrating a more pronounced reliance on these
elements than machine learning methods. Furthermore, it is worth
noting that relying solely on spectral bands to predict AGB is unlikely to
produce favorable outcomes. Integrating these spectral bands with other
variable sets, including those produced from the Shuttle Radar Topog-
raphy Mission Digital Elevation Model (SRTM DEM) and vegetation-
derived indices, will lead to more favorable outcomes.

2.8. Optimizing model parameters

RF parameters include “ntree,” which controls the number of trees,
and “mtry,” which determines the number of variables sampled at each
split. Optimal values for these parameters were identified using grid
search. Variable importance was assessed using “percent IncMSE” and
“IncNodePurity” indices (Freeman et al., 2016b; Luo et al., 2024; Probst
et al., 2019). Key parameters for tuning XGBoost include “nrounds”
(boosting iterations), “max depth,” “min child weight,” “gamma,” and
“subsample.” A grid search methodology was employed to find the best

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be applied to improve its performance and efficiency. These may include data cleaning, normalization, scaling, and augmentation. Data cleaning involves removing or correcting any inconsistent, incorrect, or missing data points. Normalization scales numeric columns to a range between 0 and 1, while standardization rescales features so they have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. Both techniques help prevent certain features from dominating others due to their scale. Scaling ensures all input features have similar magnitudes, improving convergence during optimization. Augmentation generates new samples by applying transformations such as rotations, translations, or flips to existing ones, increasing dataset size and diversity. However, not all preprocessing steps are necessary for every problem, and some might even negatively impact performance. Therefore, careful consideration should be given when deciding which preprocessing steps to apply based on the specific requirements and characteristics of the task at hand.
