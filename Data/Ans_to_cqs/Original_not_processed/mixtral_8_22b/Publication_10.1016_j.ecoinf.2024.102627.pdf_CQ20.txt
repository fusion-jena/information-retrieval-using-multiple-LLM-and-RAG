where θ is the set of parameters of the neural network to be optimised by 
minimizing the loss function of Eq. (2). 

Using this very common deep learning framework, it is possible to 
show that the species assemblage predictor Sλ(x) of Eq. (1) is consistent 
λ(x) when  the 
(Lorieul,  2020),  i.e.  it  tends  towards  the  optimal  set  S*
number  of  training  samples  increases.  In  other  words,  our  species 
assemblage predictor is as simple as training a deep neural network with 
a cross-entropy loss function on the presence-only samples and thresh-
olding  the  output  softmax  probabilities  to  get  the  assemblage  of  pre-
dicted species.

and training procedure can be found in supplementary information (SI)

2.1.2. Predictive features 

A large environmental context around each observation is collected 
and provided to the model: 64 × 64 2D tensors sampled at the kilometre- 
scale  resolution  and  centred  on  the  observation.  Predictors  include 
WorldClim2  bioclimatic  variables,  Soilgrids  pedological  variables, 
human  footprint  rasters,  terrestrial  ecoregions  of  the  world  and  the 
observation location (longitude and latitude), see SI Box E for details. 
Examples of input are shown in Fig. S5 and the full list of predictors is 
given in Table S2.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide explicit information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. However, it mentions using the French National High Performance Computing Centre (IDRIS), which suggests that high-performance computing resources were utilized for training the model. Without further context, we cannot determine the exact type of hardware resources employed.
