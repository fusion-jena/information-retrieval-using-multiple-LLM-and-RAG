weighted sampler. While a purely random classifier would have an ac-
curacy  of  1/(NClasses),  a  weighted  random  sampler  would  randomly 
guess classes according to their occurring frequency. Calculating this for 
the regression CNNs gave the following accuracies: river age (43.7%) 
and  sea  age  (36.5%).  Both  regression  CNNs  therefore  perform  much 
better than what can be expected by weighted random sampling.

2. Methods 

2.1. CNN training data

Given abundant GPU resources an ideal approach would also be to 
combine predictions from an ensemble of architectural similar or even 
identical  CNNs.  These  CNNs  could  use  the  same  training  data  but 
altering the training process slightly by shuffling the sequence of data or 
by using different batch sizes. This approach of using multi-model en-
sembles  to  produce  more  reliable  predictions  have  been  explored  in 
modelling studies within various fields (Kindt, 2018; Liao et al., 2014; 
Olsen et al., 2016). Future studies could exploit this, and it is expected 
that the group average prediction from several CNNs would outperform 
the performance of any single CNN in the very same group.

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, there is a mention of a strategy that could potentially address some aspects of randomness. In section 2.1, it discusses combining predictions from an ensemble of architecturally similar or identical Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). By using the same training data but altering the training process slightly—for example, by shuffling the sequence of data or using different batch sizes—this method aims to improve the reliability of predictions. Although this technique doesn't directly manage random seeds, it introduces controlled variability into the model training process, which might help mitigate the impact of randomness inherent in deep learning pipelines.
