In  our  study,  we  utilized  data  from  the  third  and  fourth  natural 
environment surveys, incorporating various environmental variables, to 
assess  the  impact  of  urban  development  on  species  distribution.  To 
achieve  this,  we  employed  seven  different  machine  learning  models, 
extracting the Area Under the Curve (AUC) values for each model both 
before and after urban development (Fig. 3). The AUC value, a critical 
measure of model performance, indicated that the Generalized Linear 
Model  (GLM)  and  Random  Forest  (RF)  models  had  the  highest  AUC 
value  of  0.85,  while  the  Classification  and  Regression  Tree  (CART) 
model  had  the  lowest  at  0.79.  On  average,  the  models  demonstrated 
robust performance with an average AUC value of 0.84, underscoring 
their overall effectiveness in species distribution modeling. Despite the 
methodological similarities among the models, their distinct character-

Second,  a  species  distribution  model  was  constructed  using  seven 
machine-learning  techniques.  This  model  leveraged  environmental 
variables  and  species  data  to  generate  model  input  variables  and  a 
landscape matrix for landscape connectivity. An ensemble model was 
employed to minimize the uncertainty in species occurrence, which is 
essential for implementing the IFM-LCONS. Third, we extracted map-
ping results and AUC values from the ensemble model. The results of the 
species distribution models were then used as input data for the IFM- 
LCONS, considering any grid with a value above the threshold of 0.74 
as  an  input  variable  (number  of  species  observations).  Fourth,  we 
calculated the least-cost distance using the habitat suitability map for 
landscape connectivity analysis. Finally, the IFM-LCONS was developed,

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The query asks about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, based on the given context, there is no information regarding the use of these specific datasets in the research process. Instead, the authors mention utilizing data from the third and fourth natural environment surveys, including various environmental variables, to assess the impact of urban development on species distribution. They also employ seven different machine learning models and extract Area Under the Curve (AUC) values before and after urban development. Therefore, it can be concluded that the mentioned datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet are not relevant to this particular research study.
