Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not directly address the query about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge, there are several strategies used to manage randomness in machine learning and deep learning pipelines:

1. Seed Fixing: One common strategy is fixing the seed value for all random processes involved in the pipeline. This ensures reproducibility by generating the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers each time the code runs.

2. Cross-Validation: To reduce variability due to random sampling, cross-validation techniques like k-fold or stratified k-fold can be applied. These methods split the dataset into multiple folds, ensuring that every observation gets to be part of both training and validation sets across different iterations.

3. Ensemble Methods: Another approach involves combining multiple models trained on different random subsamples of the original dataset. Techniques such as bagging, boosting, or stacking help improve overall performance and robustness against random fluctuations.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning: Grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization can be utilized to find optimal hyperparameters for the model. By exploring various combinations of parameters, these methods aim to minimize the impact of random initialization on final results.

5. Regularization: Techniques like dropout, weight decay, or early stopping can also mitigate overfitting caused by random noise in the data. They introduce controlled perturbations during training, making the model more resistant to variations in input features.
