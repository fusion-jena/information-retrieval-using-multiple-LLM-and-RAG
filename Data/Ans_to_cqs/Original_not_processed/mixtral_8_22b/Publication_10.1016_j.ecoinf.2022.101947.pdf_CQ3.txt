Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Trails  were  collected  from  free-ranging  Amur  tiger,  of  unknown 
identity, at the study sites. Table 2 reports the trail ID collected for each 
trail. As described above (Section 3.1) sub-trails were formed where >10 
footprints existed in any one trail. For example, the table indicates that 
using the 25 left hind footprints from trail MW09, we were able to derive 
four sub-trails. Section 3.5 below explains how the sex classification for 
images and the resulting designations for each trail were made.

Table 1 
The number of variables extracted from the footprint images as lengths (L), angles (A) and areas. The numbers 01–25 refer to the landmark points and 26–40 to points 
derived from the landmark points by predetermined geometric relationships. For example, variables 81–88 were generated at the intersection of two vectors e.g. V81 
refers to the angle formed by the intersection of the vector from points 01 to 05 with the vector from points 09 to 13. Areas were generated using the most peripheral 
points in each case. Area 1 = whole image, Area 2 = toe 5, Area 3 = toe 4, Area 4 = toe 3, Area 5 = toe 2, Area 6 = pad, Area 7 = points 1, 5, 9 & 13 and the proximal pad 
points, Area 8 = points 1 & 13 and the proximal pad points, Area 9 = points 1, 5, 9 & 13 and points 19 & 25, Area 10 = points 1 & 13 to the most distal toe points (3,7, 
11 & 15).

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it is not possible to provide a direct answer to the query about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, some general information can be inferred from the text regarding the collection and processing of data related to Amur tiger trails.

In this study, trails were collected from free-ranging Amur tigers, which likely involved tracking and identifying individual animals based on their footprints or other physical evidence. Sub-trails were then created when more than ten footprints existed within a single trail. This process suggests that some form of manual annotation was performed to identify and classify these features.

Additionally, the context mentions the extraction of various variables from footprint images, including lengths, angles, and areas. These measurements could have been obtained through different types of annotations such as point annotation, line annotation, or polygon annotation depending on the specific feature being measured.

However, without explicit mention of the use of bounding boxes, instance segmentation, or other common deep learning annotation techniques, it cannot be confirmed whether these methods were employed in this particular study. Therefore, further details would be required to accurately address the query regarding the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
