2.3.1. Model architectures 

(1)  Unet.  By  incorporating  an  encoder-decoder  structure  that  es-
tablishes shortcut connections, Unet model extended upon FCN’s end-to- 
end concept (Ronneberger et al., 2015). The input to the network is a 
512  × 512  pixels  image  (Fig.  3).  The  encoder  (left  dashed  square) 
downsamples the input tensor and encodes it into a vector with reduced 
dimensions. It consists of multiple convolutional blocks, each including 
a  3  × 3  convolutional  kernel  layer,  batch  normalization,  and  an

(3) Deeplabv3þ. In the encoding stage of Deeplabv3+ model, the 
backbone  network  is  replaced  with  Mobilenetv2  featuring  expanded 
convolution (Fig. 5). Mobilenetv2 network ensures higher accuracy and 
enhances  the  model’s  lightweight  nature  compared  to  the  originally 
used  Xception+ network  (Fu  et  al.,  2022),  significantly  reducing  the 
model weights file size and accelerating model prediction speed. Addi-
tionally,  the  semantic  segmentation  task  involves  incorporating  ASPP 
module into the encoder-decoder network (Chen et al., 2018b). Five sets 
of feature maps are obtained by utilizing four atrous convolution blocks 
with varied dilation rates (including convolution, batch normalization, 
and activation layers) and a global average pooling block. These feature 
maps are concatenated, then passed through a 1 × 1 convolution block, 
and  ultimately  inputted  into  the  Decoder  module.  ASPP  method  in-

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer from the context that the models mentioned, such as Unet and Deeplabv3+, are primarily used for image processing tasks like semantic segmentation. Therefore, it can be assumed that the data format used in these pipelines would most likely be image files, possibly in formats like.jpg or.png. Nevertheless, without more detailed information, this cannot be confirmed definitively.
