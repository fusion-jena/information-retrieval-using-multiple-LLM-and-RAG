2.2.1. High spatial resolution satellite image data

2.3.3. Random Forest (RF) 

The RF model is a machine learning algorithm based on a classifi-
cation  tree  proposed by  Breiman  (1996, 2001)  that is  widely used  in 
regression and classification. The basic idea is to construct decision trees 
and combine them according to certain criteria to generate an RF model. 
The randomness of RF is due to the random selection of samples and 
characteristic variables. Compared to other black-box machine learning 
algorithms,  the  RF  regression  model  has  a  high  tolerance  for  noisy 
datasets,  is  straightforward  to  implement,  has  low  computational 
overhead,  is  highly  interpretable,  effectively  prevents  variable  collin-
earity, avoids model overfitting, and provides good prediction ability for 
high-dimensional datasets.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to provide a detailed answer about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, some common data annotation techniques include bounding box annotation, where objects within images are outlined with rectangles; semantic segmentation, which involves labeling each pixel in an image with its corresponding object or region category; and instance segmentation, which combines both object detection and semantic segmentation to identify individual instances of objects within an image. These techniques can be applied to various types of data, including high spatial resolution satellite image data mentioned in the context.
