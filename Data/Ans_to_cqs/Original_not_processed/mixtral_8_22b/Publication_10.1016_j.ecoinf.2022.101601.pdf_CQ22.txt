Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

As  development  of  BNs  is  often  seen  as  an  on-going  process  (Fox 
et al., 2017; McLaughlin and Packalen, 2021; Webster and McLaughlin, 
2014), there are many avenues of future work that can be undertaken 
with PermaBN. Foremost could be addressing the limitations previously 
discussed by: (1) aiming to reduce uncertainty in the expertly assessed 
CPTs through more robust elicitation procedures, (2) conducting sensi-
tivity analysis, (3) exploring algorithms for determining the CPTs, and 
(4) improving validation by finding or creating new datasets for evalu-
ation. Related to the point on exploring algorithms for determining CPTs 
is calibration of the BN. Three types of calibration could be considered: 
(1) manual calibration, (2) optimization, and (3) probabilistic calibra-
tion. Manual calibration would entail manually manipulating the CPTs 
until  the  parent  node  yields  the  expected  thaw  depth  response.  Opti-

80 cm), and 78% of measurements were expected to be low (i.e., less 
than 50 cm). This may indicate that permafrost in the Siksik Creek Basin 
has experienced less  thaw than elsewhere in the broader Trail Valley 
Creek area or that the boundaries based on ALT for Trail Valley Creek 
are not as representative of the Siksik Creek Basin.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it does not provide information about the evaluation metrics used for a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot determine what specific metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model mentioned in the context. However, some common evaluation metrics used for deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC AUC, etc. These metrics help measure how well the model performs on unseen data and provide insights into its strengths and weaknesses.
