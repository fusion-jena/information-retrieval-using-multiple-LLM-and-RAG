RESULTS 

The training process took around 10 hours on 
the  CPU.  The  accuracy  obtained  reaches 
95%  on  140  epochs.  We  first  measure  the 
performance  of  the  proposed  model  fig  6.

approaches to justify its performance.

Experiment  show  that  the  proposed  CNN-
LSTM  performs  better  in  classifying  plant 
species  than  the  convectional  CNN  as  it 
attains  the  accuracy  of  95.06%  while  the 
literatures (Zhang et al. 2019) have reported 
only 91% accuracy. 

Performance Evaluation

Generally, the proposed network system has 
20  layers:  12  convolutional  layers,  five 
pooling  layers,  one  Fully  Connected  layer, 
one LSTM layer, and one output layer with 
the  softmax  function  for  classification.  The 
convolutional  layer  with  a  size  of  3  ×  3 
kernels is used for extracting feature and it is 
activated  by  the  ReLU  function.  The  max-
pooling layer with a size of 2 × 2 kernels is 
applied to reduce the dimensions of an input 
image. In the last part of the architecture, the 
function map is shifted to the LSTM layer to

classification  purpose.  Using  the  reshape 
method,  the  input  size  of  the  LSTM  layer 
becomes (196,512). After analyzing the time 
features,  the  model  sorts  the  plant  species 
images  through  a  fully  connected  layer  to

predict whether they belong under any of the 
100 categories of the plant species.

Training 

We  train  the  proposed  deep  CNN-LSTM 
regressively with the learning time gradually 
decreased. The model was based on the pre-
trained  model  [38]  and  was  trained  to 
classify plant species  and therefore identify 
the new incoming unknown species. The loss 
was taken as the sum of the firing rates of the 
error  neurons  in  the  zeroth  pixel  layer.  A 
random 
search  was 
performed  over 
fourth-  and  fifth-layer 
models  of  the  leaf  features  positions.  Our 
model consists of 20 layers with 3 by 3 filter 
sizes  of  all  convolutions  and  stack  size  per 
layer  of  (1,32,64,64,128,256).  The  initial 

hyperparameter 

training  rate  is  set  to  0.001  dropped  by 
learning ratio of 10 after every 60 epochs.  

Softmax 

The proposed system uses k-way softmax 
classifier to classify image to one among k 
plant species. The loss due to this 
architecture is given by

Helpful Answer:
Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model. However, generally speaking, common preprocessing techniques include data normalization, scaling, cleaning, and augmentation. Data normalization involves transforming the data so that it falls within a specific range, such as between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. Scaling involves adjusting the scale of the data to prevent certain features from dominating others during training. Cleaning involves removing noise, outliers, and missing values from the dataset. Augmentation involves creating additional training examples by applying various transformations to existing ones. These preprocessing steps help improve the performance and efficiency of the deep learning model.
