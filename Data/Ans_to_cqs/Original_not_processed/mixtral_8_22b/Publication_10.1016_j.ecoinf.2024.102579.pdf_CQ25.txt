(7) 

In Eq. (7), n is the number of trees included in the sample at a given 
sample point, i.e. the number of sample trees. In the remainder of this 
paper, we referred to Eq. (7) as the inventory estimator. 

2.2.2. NN1 and NN2 estimators

(Pommerening, 2023), as structural complexity is an important objec-
tive  of  this  type  of  forest  management.  Compared  to  variance,  the 
contribution of bias to the values of rRMSE is rather small. This is where 
the  NN3  and  NN4  estimators  can  help,  since  they  are  effective  in 
reducing the overall index variation. They have performed well with all 
diversity indices other than distance and the aggregation index. In this 
context, it is particularly interesting that the NN4 estimator, which is 
based  on  the  weights  of  both  sample  trees  and  of  the  neighbours  of 
sample trees, has performed best with most diversity indices other than 
distance  and  aggregation  index.  Given  the  general  aim  to  reduce  the 
index variance, this finding seems to suggest that the information pro-
vided by sample-tree neighbours complements that of the sample trees 
and is with most indices more important than spatial edge-bias concerns

(12) 

In Eq. (12), PS  is an arbitrary sample point, whilst Pi is the location of 
sample tree i (see Fig. 1). The expression ‖PS (cid:0) Pi‖ denotes the Euclidean 
distance between points PS  and Pi. The individual inclusion zone radius 
of tree i is ri  and depends on basal area factor v and on the tree’s stem 
diameter di. The basal area factor defines the sample size at each sample 
point, i.e. more trees are included with smaller values of v than with 
larger ones (Bitterlich, 1984). We ran independent simulations for v = 1,
1.5, 2, 2.5, …, 5.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the use of any deep learning models. However, based on the context, it appears that the authors are discussing various methods for estimating diversity indices in ecology, specifically in the context of continuous cover forestry. These methods include the inventory estimator, NN1 and NN2 estimators, and NN3 and NN4 estimators. While these may involve some form of machine learning or statistical modeling, there is no mention of deep learning models such as those used for classification, segmentation, or object detection. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer regarding the purpose of a deep learning model in this context.
