Image classification 

To assess the efficacy of the various techniques, we compute the top- 
k accuracy on a test set, where k = 1, 5, and 10 represents the position of 
the correct match (i.e., an annotation of the same individual represented 
by a query annotation) within a list of proposed matches. Consequently, 
a top-1 rank is an accurate result supplied by the algorithm as the most 
probable match for a candidate annotation. A top-5 rating indicates that 
the correct answer might be any of the top-5 values among the returned 
options, and so on.

3. Results 

3.1. Detection algorithm

Models were trained and tested by tuning the number of required 
epochs and then inspecting the model outputs and error outcomes for 
signs of overfitting. If the model focuses excessively on data fitting, it 
may imitate insignificant noise rather than the broad properties of in-
terest, resulting in overfitting.

converged to its most accurate state, assessing each image only 10–30 
times  (in  machine  learning  terms,  after  10–30  “training  epochs”), 
whereas the typical duration is between 70 and 250 epochs. Subsequent 
training had no effect or decreased the algorithm’s performance on held- 
out test data, indicating that its long-term behavior resembled memo-
rizing  its  training  set  rather  than  learning  a  generalized  matching 
strategy (this is the machine learning definition of “overfitting”).

Helpful Answer:
After the model training process, several postprocessing steps may be involved depending on the specific application and requirements. Some common postprocessing steps include:

1. Model evaluation: This involves calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., to evaluate the performance of the model. In the given context, the authors use top-k accuracy to measure the effectiveness of their technique. They calculate the top-k accuracy on a test set, where k=1, 5, and 10 represent the position of the correct match within a list of proposed matches.
2. Visualization tools: These help in understanding how the model arrived at its predictions. For example, saliency maps highlight the regions of an input image that contribute significantly to the output prediction. However, there is no mention of using visualization tools in the given context.
3. Overfitting prevention: The authors mention preventing overfitting during the training phase by monitoring the model outputs and error outcomes for signs of overfitting. They ensure that the model does not focus too much on data fitting, which can lead to memorizing the training set instead of learning a generalized matching strategy.
4. Data sharing: The authors provide instructions for researchers who wish to access the annotations and data used for machine learning training in this study. Requests should be made to the corresponding author, and permission must be granted explicitly by one of the authors or through an established collaboration on Whiskerbook.org.

Therefore, based on the given context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include evaluating the model using top-k accuracy, preventing overfitting, and providing instructions for data sharing.
