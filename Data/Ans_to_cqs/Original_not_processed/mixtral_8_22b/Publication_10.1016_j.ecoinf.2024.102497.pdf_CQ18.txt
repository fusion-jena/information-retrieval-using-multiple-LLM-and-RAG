The Random Forest model  is an  ensemble learning  technique that 
combines  multiple  decision  trees  to  make  predictions.  In  regression 
tasks, the Random Forest Regression (RFR) algorithm constructs several 
independent  decision  trees  by  randomly  sampling  data  and  features. 
Each  tree  generates  predictions,  and  the  final  regression  result  is  ob-
tained by aggregating predictions from all trees in the forest. Notably, 
the RFR model exhibits strong noise resilience and reduces the risk of 
overfitting. The RFR method is particularly advantageous in nearshore 
bathymetry  studies,  as  it  doesn’t  require  prior  knowledge  of  water 
properties  or  seabed  type,  enhancing  accuracy  in  predicting  water 
depths.  To  implement  the  RFR  model,  we  utilized  the  Python  pro-
gramming  language,  importing  the  RFR  algorithm  from  the  ‘sklearn’ 
library.  Fine-tuning  the  model  parameters  -  such  as  ‘n_estimators’,

‘max_depth’, ‘min_samples_split’, ‘min_samples_leaf’, and ‘max_features’ 
-  was  crucial  to  achieving  optimal  prediction  results  and  enhancing 
nearshore  bathymetry  accuracy.  Following  multiple  experiments  and 
comparisons, we determined the optimal parameters for the RFR model

by selecting features and thresholds that minimize the variance of the 
target  variable  within  each  subset.  This  iterative  process  employs  a 
greedy  algorithm,  gradually  building  the  tree  until  specific  stopping 
conditions  are  met.  The  key  components  of  CART  involve  feature  se-
lection, tree generation, and pruning. For our implementation, we uti-
lized the Python programming language to build the CART model. The 
CART algorithm was imported from the ‘sklearn’ library in Python. To 
optimize the regression decision tree for efficiency and suitability, we 
fine-tuned  specific  model  parameters  such  as  ‘max_depth’,  ‘min_sam-
ples_leaf’, and ‘max_leaf_nodes’. Ultimately, we set these parameters to 
8,  5,  and  20,  respectively.  These  parameter  values  were  selected  to 
prevent overfitting and minimize cross-validation error in our model. 

3.4. Random Forest regression (RFR) method

Advancements  in  bathymetry  retrieval  methods  have  led  to  the 
development  of  various  models,  including  linear  or  nonlinear  regres-
sion, logarithmic ratio transformation, and machine learning techniques 
such  as  CART,  RFR, and  SVM (Ashphaq et  al.,  2021; Cahalane et  al., 
2019; Lyzenga, 1978; Lyzenga et al., 2006). Gabr et al. (2020) utilized a 
linear model to estimate bathymetry and confirmed the equivalence of 
Landsat images to high-resolution PlanetScope (3 m) predictions. Sun 
et al. (2021) applied two regression tree models (CART and Cubist) to 
retrieve  coastal  bathymetry  and  analyze  vertical  water  environment 
information.  Zhang  et  al.  (2019)  employed  the  SVR  (support  vector 
regression) model to provide technical support for bathymetry data in 
Arctic waters. However, despite several studies, the application of CART 
and  RFR  models  in  nearshore  turbid  waters  for  bathymetry  has  been

Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about the strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. However, some common strategies can be inferred based on general practices in implementing Random Forest Regression (RFR) models.

One possible approach could be using Cross-Validation, which involves splitting the dataset into k subsets or folds. Each fold is then used once as a test set while the remaining k-1 folds form the training set. This allows for evaluating the model's performance across different subsets of the data, providing insights into its ability to generalize well to unseen data.

Additionally, monitoring metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), or coefficient of determination (R^2 score) during training can help assess the model's performance. By tracking these metrics, one can observe how well the model fits the training data and identify potential issues like underfitting or overfitting.

Furthermore, tuning hyperparameters through Grid Search or Randomized Search can also aid in optimizing the model's performance. Adjusting parameters such as 'n_estimators','max_depth','min_samples_split','min_samples_leaf', and'max_features' can significantly impact the model's accuracy and prevent overfitting.

In summary, although the exact strategy for monitoring the model performance during training is not specified in the provided context, common approaches include employing Cross-Validation, tracking evaluation metrics, and fine-tuning hyperparameters.
