Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Then we get the model architecture. For the sake of illustration, we use a resnet18 here, but we used
a resnet50 to get the full results presented in the main text.

learn <- cnn_learner(dls = dls,

arch = resnet18(),
metrics = list(accuracy, error_rate))

Now we are ready to train our model. Again, for the sake of illustration, we use only 2 epochs here,
but used 20 epochs to get the full results presented in the main text. With all pictures and a resnet50,
it took 75 minutes per epoch approximatively on a Mac with a 2.4Ghz processor and 64Go memory,
and less than half an hour on a machine with GPU. On this reduced dataset, it took a bit more than
a minute per epoch on the same Mac. Note that we save the model after each epoch for later use.

one_cycle <- learn %>%

fit_one_cycle(2, cbs = SaveModelCallback(every_epoch = TRUE,

fname = 'model'))

Here, we showcase a full why-what-how workflow in R using a case study on the structure of an
ecological community (a set of co-occurring species) composed of the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx)
and its two main preys. First, we introduce the case study and motivate the need for deep learning.
Second we illustrate deep learning for the identification of animal species in large amounts of images,
including model training and validation with a dataset of labelled images, and prediction with a
new dataset of unlabelled images. Last, we proceed with the quantification of spatial co-occurrence
using statistical models.

approximately 10 hours. The computational burden prevented us from providing a full reproducible
analysis, but we do so with a subsample of the dataset in the Appendix. All trained models are
available from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5164796.

Helpful Answer:
The process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model involved saving the model after each epoch for later use. This was done using the `SaveModelCallback` function within the `fit_one_cycle()` method. The saved models were then made available online via Zenodo (<https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5164796>). However, due to the high computational requirements of the model, a full reproducible analysis could not be provided. Instead, a subsample of the dataset was used for demonstration purposes, as detailed in the appendix. It is also mentioned that the model was trained on a platform using a GPU machine (Titan Xp Nvidia) with 16GB of RAM, taking approximately 10 hours for 20 epochs.
