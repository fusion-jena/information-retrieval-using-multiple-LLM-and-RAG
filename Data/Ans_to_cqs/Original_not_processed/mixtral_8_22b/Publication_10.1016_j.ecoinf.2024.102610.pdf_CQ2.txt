Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipelines discussed in the referenced studies. However, we can infer some possible data formats based on the nature of the research topics mentioned.

For instance, Gonz\'alez Jim\'enez et al. (2019) discuss the use of mid-infrared spectroscopy and supervised machine learning for predicting mosquito species and population age structures. This suggests that spectral data might be one of the input formats used in their deep learning pipeline.

In another example, Laaksonen et al. (2017) describe crowdsourced nationwide tick collections to reveal the distribution of ticks and associated pathogens in Finland. While it is unclear what exact data format was used in this study, it could potentially involve geospatial or location-based data, such as GPS coordinates or satellite imagery.

Additionally, since many of the papers cited focus on analyzing and minimizing the effects of vector-borne diseases using machine and deep learning techniques, it is likely that various types of health and environmental datasets were utilized. These may include time series data, epidemiological records, climate variables, land cover information, etc.

Lastly, given that several references point towards the use of packages like 'caret', 'VSURF', and 'pdp' from the CRAN repository, which support various data formats including CSV files, images, and other structured data, it is reasonable to assume that these formats have been employed in the respective deep learning pipelines.

However, without more explicit details about each study's methodology, it remains speculative to definitively state the precise data formats used across all the reviewed literature.
