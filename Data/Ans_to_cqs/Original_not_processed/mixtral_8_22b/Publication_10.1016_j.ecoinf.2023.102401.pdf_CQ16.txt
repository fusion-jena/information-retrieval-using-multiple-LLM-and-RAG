Step 3: Evaluate the performance of the trained model by validating 
it against the test images. This involves computing metrics such as ac-
curacy,  recall,  F1  score,  and  other  relevant  measures.  Adjust  the  pa-
rameters and structure of the model based on the evaluation results to 
improve the detection performance. Iterate the training and evaluation 
process until a satisfactory level of performance is achieved.

This study draws the mAp comparison diagram of different networks 
to  offer  a  more  intuitive  effect  when  comparing  the  performance  of 
different  networks.  The  mAp  curve  of  YWnet  is  substantially  greater 
than the curve of other networks, as illustrated in Fig. 9. YOLOv5 is the 
next best performer, and Retinanet is the worst performer.

3.1. The backbone of YWnet 

The  feature  extraction  phase  is  considered  crucial  in  the  training 
process,  as  it  plays  a  significant  role  in  enhancing  detection  perfor-
mance. The objective of this work is to improve detection accuracy by 
designing  a  feature  extraction  mechanism  that  incorporates  rich  se-
mantic  information  and  integrates  features  from  multiple  scales.  By 
leveraging these strategies, the aim is to capture and utilize a compre-
hensive range of relevant features, thereby enhancing the overall per-
formance of the detection system. As a result, a CBAM is added to the 
network's  backbone  to  improve  feature  extraction  from  the  incoming 
semantic information. Simultaneously, a novel feature extraction mod-
ule called SRC3 is provided to extract rich semantic information from 
the complicated undersea environment.

application of decoupled heads contribute to improved model detection 
performance.  Experiments  were  conducted  on  the  URPC  dataset  and 
compared  with  other  object  detection  algorithms.  The  experimental 
results indicate that YWnet outperforms other advanced object detection 
networks in terms of performance. Furthermore, generalization experi-
ments on other ocean datasets and small target datasets indicate that the 
YWnet model presented in this paper exhibits superior generalization 
capabilities.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:

Training is determined to be complete when a satisfactory level of performance is achieved. This is evaluated by validating the trained model against test images and computing metrics such as accuracy, recall, F1 score, and other relevant measures. Based on the evaluation results, adjustments can be made to the parameters and structure of the model to improve its detection performance. This process is iterated until the desired level of performance is reached. In simpler terms, training continues until the model performs well enough according to the chosen metrics, which may include a validation loss plateau or reaching a specific threshold for accuracy or another metric.
