tion and Transformer, effectively extracts richer semantic features (Xie 
et al., 2024). A network based on CNN and ViT modules classified mi-
croorganisms with an accuracy of 67.62% (Dwivedi et al., 2024).

The experimental results presented in Table 2 and Table 3 illustrate 
the enhancement in classification accuracy achieved by incorporating 
CAM into the residual network. Regardless of “medium”  or “small”  or 
the entire dataset, the best classification results are achieved using the 
CA-Hybrid  network.  Notably,  the  experimental  results  demonstrate  a 
positive correlation between image size and classification performance. 
Specifically, larger image tend to yield better classification outcomes.

assign varying weights to each channel to allow the network to focus on 
important  features.  Therefore,  the  CAM  in  CBAM  is  incorporated  the 
classification network. Additionally, CAM can enhance the transmission 
and  characterization  of  more important  features in  the  network, thus 
improving  the  feature  representation  capability  of  the  network.  The 
model structure of CAM is shown in Fig. 3. While ViT primarily extracts 
features  from a  spatial  perspective,  the combination  of  CAM and  ViT 
enables the network to better learn image features.

Compared with ViT, CNN has stronger local information extraction 

ability.  In  particular,  the  residual  structure  of  ResNet  connects  the 
different network layers via shortcut, which not only preserves the input 
features  but  also  addresses  the  degradation  problem  of  the  deep 
network, thus mitigating issues such as vanishing or exploding gradi-
ents. The residual structure can help the network to learn the features in 
the input image better, thereby improving the classification effect of the 
network. 

Different classes of objects of the same species have high similarities. 
To better classify objects, CA-Hybrid network is constructed for Cervidae 
classification, based on ResNet and ViT, with the integration of CAM into 
the residual structure of ResNet. The structure of the CA-Hybrid network 
is shown in Fig. 4.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline discussed here involves images as its primary data format. This is evident from several mentions of images throughout the text, including phrases like "image size," "larger image," and references to networks being used for tasks such as microorganism classification and Cervidae classification - both of which typically involve visual data. However, the context does not provide explicit details about other potential data formats used in this specific deep learning pipeline, such as audio, video, or structured data in formats like CSV.
