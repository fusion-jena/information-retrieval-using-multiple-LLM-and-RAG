2.1. Data filtering

match environmental information with ground observations (e.g. wild-
life  movements),  other  ecological  processes  may  require  coarser  tem-
poral scales, hence more diluted temporal aggregation (e.g. ecosystem 
resilience). As for spatial scaling, a formula defines how data is tempo-
rally aggregated, namely by a mean, median, or standard deviation.

Difference  Vegetation  Index  (NDVI),  the  Enhanced  vegetation  index 
(EVI2), the Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index 2 (MSAVI2), then 
satellite-derived  spectral  bands  (BLUE,  GREEN,  RED,  Near-Infrared– 
NIR1,  Short-wave  Infrared  -  SWIR1&2)  and  NDVI-derived  textural 
metrics (GLCM; further detail in Supplementary information S1.1). We 
used a Random Forests variant (Boruta; Kursa and Rudnicki, 2010) to 
discriminate significant variables in the R environment (v.4.2.0; R Core 
Team,  2021),  being  the  present  GEE  tool  focused  primarily  on  data 
preparation and scaling. This represents an example of how to explore 
relevant variables and associated scales, as through Boruta permutations 
are performed to understand whether the importance of each variable 
significantly  differs  from  the  respective  randomised  copy  (Kursa  and 
Rudnicki, 2010).

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide direct information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge, some common strategies used to manage randomness include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using ensemble methods to average out results across multiple runs, and employing techniques like cross-validation to ensure robust model performance. These strategies help mitigate the impact of random initialization and improve overall model reliability.
