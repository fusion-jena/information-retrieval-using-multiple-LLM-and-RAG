2.3.3. Modelling 

Artificial  neural  networks  are  a  successful  method  in  modelling 
studies and are frequently discussed in the literature. Essentially, neural 
networks learn from past and present data, uncover hidden relationships 
among  the  data,  and  utilise  them  to  make  predictions  for  future  sce-
narios. Among the various types of artificial neural network models, the 
NARX model is widely employed. In this study, the NARX feedback ANN 
model  was  utilised  to  define  vegetation  biomass  density  for  2030.  A 
hybrid  model  was  developed  by  combining  wavelet  analysis  and  the 
NARX ANN algorithm to enhance the performance of the NARX ANN 
model.

Helpful Answer:
The query asks about strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, specifically regarding the random seed value. While none of the provided sources directly address this topic, some general principles can be applied.

Randomness in deep learning pipelines often comes from initializing weights randomly or shuffling training datasets before each epoch. To ensure reproducibility and consistency across experiments, one common strategy is setting a fixed random seed value. This ensures that any random processes will produce the same sequence of numbers, making results more comparable between runs. However, it should be noted that using a fixed random seed might limit the exploration of different solutions during optimization, potentially leading to suboptimal results.

To mitigate this issue, researchers may employ techniques such as running multiple trials with different random seeds or using ensemble methods that combine the outputs of several independently trained models. These approaches help capture the variability introduced by randomness while still providing robust and reliable results.

Additionally, advanced techniques like Bayesian Optimization or Hyperband can be used to optimize hyperparameters, including the choice of random seed values. These methods aim to find the best combination of hyperparameters through efficient search algorithms, reducing the need for manual tuning and improving overall performance.

In summary, handling randomness in deep learning pipelines involves setting fixed random seed values for reproducibility, running multiple trials with different seeds, using ensemble methods, and applying advanced optimization techniques like Bayesian Optimization or Hyperband.
