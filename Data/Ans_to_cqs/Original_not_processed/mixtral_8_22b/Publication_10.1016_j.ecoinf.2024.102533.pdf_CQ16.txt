beling  is  explaned  in  the  following  sub-section.  Meanwhile,  species 
divided into three classes were labeled according to the three available 
classes.

This research utilizes six organoleptic parameters and applies them 
to seven fish species, serving as the standard for automatically classi-
fying fish freshness. The dataset, generated over 11 days, is employed in 
machine learning experiments. In the clustering process, we exclusively 
consider Euclidean distance as a metric, given the uniform data range. 
However, alternative distance metrics have not been explored, poten-
tially  influencing  the  quality  of  freshness  class  determination.  Future 
research possibilities may involve investigating the impact of different 
distance metrics on class groups. Each distance possesses distinct char-
acteristics,  leading  to  varied  cluster  patterns.  Additionally,  extending 
this work to include other fish species could provide a more compre-
hensive understanding. 

CRediT authorship contribution statement

to experiment with the number and range of freshness classes using a 
clustering approach. For each fish, we automatically identify the num-
ber  of  classes  and  their  duration,  evaluating  them  using  the  elbow 
method. The significant prevalence of automatic computing minimizes 
subjectivity, enhancing the objectivity of our findings.

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it can be inferred from the text that one possible criterion might be the use of the elbow method. This method is mentioned in relation to identifying the optimal number of clusters or classes for fish freshness classification. While this is not directly related to determining when training is complete, it suggests that some form of evaluation or optimization technique is being applied during the machine learning process. Other common criteria for determining when training is complete include observing a plateau in validation loss, monitoring changes in accuracy or error rates, or setting a predefined maximum number of iterations or epochs. Without further information, it cannot be definitively stated which criteria are being used in this particular case.
