Figure 3. The two top panels show examples of the 80 × 80-pixel image patches used to build the
training dataset for the CNN model: (left) patches of Ziziphus lotus class, (right) patches of Bare soil
with sparse vegetation class. The bottom panel shows the training-zone dataset with 100 Ziziphus lotus
patches labeled with a green contour and 100 Bare soil and sparse vegetation patches labeled with
yellow contour.

4.2.3. Training Dataset for the CNN-Classiﬁer

The design of the training dataset is key to the performance of a good CNN classiﬁcation model.
From the 82 Ziziphus individuals georeferenced by botanic experts in the training-zone, we identiﬁed
100 80 × 80-pixel image patches containing Ziziphus lotus shrubs and 100 images for Bare soil with
sparse vegetation. Examples of the labeled classes can be seen in Figure 3. We distributed the
100 images of each class into 80 images for training and 20 images for validating the obtained CNNs
classiﬁers, as summarized in Table 1.

The training-zone used for training the CNN-based model. This zone is located in Cabo de
Gata-Níjar Natural Park, 36◦49(cid:48)43(cid:48)(cid:48) N, 2◦16(cid:48)22(cid:48)(cid:48) W, in the province of Almería, Spain (Figure 2).
The climate is semi-arid Mediterranean. The vegetation is scarce and patchy, mainly dominated
by large Ziziphus lotus shrubs surrounded by a heterogeneous matrix of bare soil and small
scrubs (e.g., Thymus hyemalis, Launea arborescens and Lygeum spartum) with low coverage ([49,52]).
Ziziphus lotus forms large hemispherical bushes with very deep roots and 1–3 m tall that trap and
accumulate sand and organic matter building geomorphological structures, called nebkhas, that
constitute a shelter micro-habitat for many plant and animal species ([19,49,53]).
Test-zone-1 and test-zone-2 belong to two different protected areas. Test-zone-1 is located 1.5 km

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It could be possible that it was not mentioned in this particular excerpt or that it might have been published elsewhere. Therefore, without additional context or information, it would not be possible to provide a definitive answer to this query.
