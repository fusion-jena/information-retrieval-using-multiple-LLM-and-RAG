Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

2.3.  Model training 

2.3.1.  Training data preprocessing 

The  CNN  model  used  in  this  study  requires  equally  sized  input 
images. We chose a time-frequency input window size of 2 s as it is near 
the mean and median template duration across target call types (Fig. 2). 
Most  call  types  have  a  duration  below  1  s,  and  for  those  above  2  s,

learning, wherein a model already optimized for a similar dataset is re- 
trained with new data. We used a ResNet50 model, pre-trained on the 
ImageNet dataset, which contains over one million photo images across

2.4.2.  Evaluation metrics 

Let TP ≡ TP(τ) represent number of true-positive CNN predictions 
(i.e. correct predictions of species presence). Similarly, let TN represent 
number of true negatives (i.e. correct predictions of absence), let FP be 
number of false positives (i.e. incorrect predictions of presence), and let 
FN be number of false negatives (i.e. incorrect predictions of absence). 
All counts are dependent on the chosen threshold τ. 

Performance  was  quantified  by  several  metrics  described  below. 
The  precision  P(τ)  is  the  fraction  of  predictions  of  presence  that  are 
correct. 

where NP′ is the number of predicted presences. Recall R(τ), also known 
as sensitivity or true-positive rate, measures  the fraction of presences 
that are correctly identified.

1000 classes (Deng et al., 2009). Although ImageNet does not contain 
spectrograms,  models  pre-trained  with  the  dataset  learn  a  variety  of 
image features that have been successfully tuned to spectrogram clas-
sification  previously  (Lasseck,  2019;  Florentin  et  al.,  2020).  While 
previous  studies  have  found  optimal  performance  using  ensembles  of 
multiple CNN models (Kahl et al., 2017; Lasseck, 2019; Florentin et al., 
2020), in the interest of prediction efficiency and reasonable memory 
requirements, we chose to evaluate a single ResNet50 model.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text provides information about the use of transfer learning, where a pre-trained ResNet50 model was utilized. This model was initially trained on the ImageNet dataset containing over one million photo images from 1000 classes. Despite ImageNet not containing spectrograms, previous research has shown success in applying these pre-trained models to spectrogram classification tasks. However, there is no explicit mention of specific techniques such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting being employed to enhance the generalizability of the deep learning model. Therefore, based on the given context, it cannot be confirmed whether any of these methods were implemented to improve the model's ability to generalize.
