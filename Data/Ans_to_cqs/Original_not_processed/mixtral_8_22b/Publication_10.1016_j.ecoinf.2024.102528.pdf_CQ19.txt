One  of  the  most  valuable  tools  developed  in  recent  years  is  deep 
learning models which have been used for the tasks mentioned above

In this paper, we present an automated framework that allows the 
monitoring of a large number of bird species by their vocalizations over 
extended periods and across various time scales. The framework relies 
on the BirdNET Analyzer deep learning model (BirdNET-Analyzer, n.d.),

Continuous  bioacoustic  monitoring  is  an  emerging  opportunity  as  well  as  a  challenge,  allowing  detection  of 
cryptic species' activity while producing high computational demands. In this paper, we present an automated 
framework that allows the monitoring of a large number of bird species by their vocalizations over extended 
periods. The framework relies on the BirdNET-Analyzer deep learning model. We applied the framework to >80 
species; 20 species with the highest recall scores were selected for further analysis.

In this study we demonstrated the use of our monitoring pipeline for 
computing  long-term  activity  behavior  of  several  species  recorded 
continuously for over two years in the Agmon Hula Lake Park located in 
the Hula Valley, a major migratory flyway. We generated the Agmon 
annotated dataset to examine the BirdNET deep learning model. A total 
of 23 species with the highest precision/recall values were selected for 
further analysis. When using automated deep learning models such as 
BirdNET the confidence score can strongly affect the automated iden-
tification  process  (Cole  et  al.,  2022;  PÂ´erez-Granados,  2023).  We 
demonstrated that using BirdNET the relationships between the confi-
dence thresholds and the precision and recall values are species-specific. 
Accordingly,  we  used  species-specific  confidence  thresholds  which 
yielded detection scores that accounts for the precision-recall tradeoff.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not explicitly mention the specific framework or library used to develop the BirdNET-Analyzer deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if popular machine learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch were utilized. However, these libraries are commonly employed for building deep learning models due to their extensive features and support from the developer community.
