5.2. Land type conversion drivers 

We  added  the  extracted  land  type  expansion  raster  to  LEAS  and 
imported  the  driver  raster  map.  Subsequently,  the  RFC  was  used  to 
obtain the probability of development and the contribution of drivers for 
each land category. We also set the sampling rate to 0.1, the number of 
decision trees to 20, the number of features used to train the random 
forest to 9, and the number of parallels to 12 to improve the execution 
speed. In summary, the contribution rates and root mean square errors 
of each driving factor to the expansion of each land type were obtained 
(Fig. 6). The root mean square error (RMSE) of the PLUS model's analysis 
of the drivers of expansion for the six land types in the YRB-SX for the 
years  2000–2010  and  2010–2020  was  less  than  0.2,  and  the  model 
performed well. 

The higher the variable contribution rate is, the greater the impact of

4.3.3. LSTM model 

The  long  short-term  memory  (LSTM)  model  is  a  common  deep 
learning model used to solve the prediction problem of time series data 
(Tang  et  al.,  2023).  Compared  with  traditional  machine  learning 
models, the LSTM model has better performance and ability to manage 
the  prediction  problem  of  time  series  data,  especially  the  long-term 
dependency  problem  and  multivariate  time  series  data,  and  has 
obvious  advantages  (Liu  et  al.,  2021;  Tang  et  al.,  2023;  Zhou  et  al., 
2023). Fig. 3 shows the prediction process of the LSTM model and the BP 
model.  This  study  compares  these  two  models  and  the  Markov  chain 
model. 

4.4. FMOP model 

Optimizing land allocation through a multiobjective programming 
(MOP) model combined with uncertainty analysis methods can provide 
a reference for decision makers. 

4.4.1. MOP model

after the TIFS treatment, and the shrinkage rates of woodland, grassland 
and  water bodies  were reduced by 0.52%, 3.46%  and  3.76%, respec-
tively, compared to those in the EDP scenario; moreover, the expansion 
rate of built-up areas was reduced by 18.04% compared to that in the 
EDP scenario. At this point in the basin, the economic benefit, ESV and 
EC of the land system were 31,773.63, 5079.30 and 3563.04 (unit: 104 
CNY), respectively. In summary, future planning should focus on pro-
tecting  cropland  by  formulating  appropriate  policies  and  strictly 
adhering to protection strategies, coordinating the systematic manage-
ment  of  different  types  of  land,  improving  the  quality  of  vegetation 
cover  and  restoring  the  natural  ecological  environment.  On  the  one 
hand, there is an urgent need to improve the planning and construction 
of urban clusters to make efficient use of existing land in built-up areas

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it does not directly discuss specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, some general insights about handling data in deep learning models can be derived from the information available.

For instance, in section 5.2, the authors mention setting the sampling rate to 0.1 when training their Random Forest Classifier (RFC) model. This could potentially indicate the usage of subsampling or downsampling techniques to handle class imbalance issues in the dataset. Additionally, they specify the number of decision trees to 20 and the number of features used to train the random forest to 9, which suggests feature selection and parameter tuning processes aimed at reducing overfitting and improving model performance.

Furthermore, in section 4.3.3, the authors compare the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model with other traditional machine learning models like the Backpropagation (BP) model and the Markov Chain model. While this comparison doesn't explicitly refer to addressing data bias, it highlights the importance of selecting suitable algorithms based on the characteristics of the input data and the nature of the problem being solved.

Lastly, in section 4.4.1, the authors briefly touch upon the concept of Multiobjective Programming (MOP) models, which can be employed to optimize land allocation decisions while considering various objectives and constraints. Although this isn't directly related to data preprocessing, it emphasizes the significance of incorporating domain knowledge and expert opinions into the modeling process to ensure fairness and accuracy.

Overall, while the given context does not offer explicit details regarding techniques used to mitigate data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, it provides valuable insights into aspects such as class balancing, feature engineering, algorithm selection, and optimization methods that contribute towards building robust and reliable predictive models.
