provide crystal-clear images for further examination. The added image 
enhancement  technique  enabled  the  proposed  systems  to  reach  high 
accuracy values. 

This  dataset  is  used  after  these  pre-processing  steps  with  the  sug-
gested models. Table 3 presents a comparison between different trained 
deep learning models proposed in this paper. The table shows the five 
different  deep  learning  models  chosen  for  this  application  and  their 
reported  accuracy  and  F1-score.  The  table  also  shows  ten  different

Accuracy

Different  deep  learning  models  are  tested  to  find  the  model  with  the 
highest accuracy. The results show that EfficientNet achieves the highest 
accuracy.  A  data  augmentation  technique  is  added  to  increase  the 
number  of  images  from 55,448  to  61,486  images.  Results  of  the  pro-
posed deep learning models on the dataset with and without augmen-
tation  are  reported. This  work  augments  the  dataset using a  complex 
data augmentation technique to produce a new dataset. However, in our 
proposed work we use an augmented version of PlanVillage that can be 
used by different researchers for comparison. Also, we propose using a

diseases. We also propose using different ensembles to increase classi-
fication accuracy. To this end, five different deep-learning models are 
proposed to classify plant diseases. The chosen models are:  

Precision = TP

TP + FP

• DenseNet201 

• Recall 

(2)    

DenseNet is a network proposed by (Huang et al., 2017). In this 
network,  each  Layer  has  a  connection  with  subsequent  Layers. 
Densenet201 is a CNN that has 201 deep layers.

%Query
Query: "Where is the data repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The article does not provide information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that they have used PlantVillage dataset for training and testing purposes but it doesn't specify any specific platform or repository where the dataset is hosted. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
