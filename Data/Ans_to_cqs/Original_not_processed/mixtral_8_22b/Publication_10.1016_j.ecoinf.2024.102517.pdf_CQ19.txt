2.3.3. Experimental setting 

In our experiment, a deep learning environment based on Python and 
Tensorflow – GPU as well as CUDA was constructed under the Windows 
operating system. The deep feature loss bird noise reduction network 
model was trained for 50 epochs on an RTX 2080 Ti GPU using the Adam 
(cid:0) 4. In each 
optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014) with a learning rate of 10
epoch, the entire training set was presented in a random order, with one 
noisy bird sound signal per iteration. 

2.4. Comparative algorithms 

Using the same test  set, we compared the  denoising results of the 
deep feature loss-based bird sound noise reduction network with several 
other  bioacoustics  noise  reduction  algorithms,  namely  SEGAN, 
WebRTC, wavelet transform (Priyadarshani et al., 2016), Wiener filter 
(Loizou, 2017), and MMSE STSA (Brown et al., 2017) algorithms.

2.3.2. Training of the bird sound noise reduction network based on deep 
feature loss

reducing noise, and accordingly, would not be suitable for processing 
large  volumes  of  recorded  data  collected  in  the  field.  Furthermore, 
compared with the bird sound noise reduction network based on deep 
feature loss and the SEGAN algorithm, we found that the noise reduction 
efficiencies of the WebRTC and Wiener Filter algorithms were notably 
higher. This disparity in performance can be attributed to the fact that 
the deep learning model is larger in size and is thus more demanding of 
computational resources. However, it should be noted that the execution 
time of the deep learning models on CPUs is acceptable.
