annotations, distributed unevenly among the various sites. An analysis 
of the annotations within the library indicated that Bm-Ant-A calls had 
the  highest  number of  manual  detections,  totaling  24,363,  while  Bm- 
Ant-Z  calls  had  the  lowest,  with  a  total  of  2515  manual  detections. 
Similarly,  the  percentage  of  hours  with  each  type  of  call  annotation 
varied across sites, where Bm-Ant-A had the highest percentage across 
all sites ranging from 0.6 to 91.2% of hours. For more informatiion about 
the open access data and annotations, readers are encouraged to see the 
IWC-SORP/SOOS  annotated  library  (Miller  et  al.,  2020;  Miller  et  al., 
2021).

Sequel to training the two HMMs independently, HMM1 and HMM2 
are combined to form an ergodic-type HMM with 8 states and 4 mixture 
weights. One of the HMMs is represented by the first 1–4 states, and the 
other  HMM  is  represented  by  the  following  5–8  states.  Specifically, 
states 1–4 depict the waveform of blue whale vocalizations while states 
5–8  represent  the  noise  signal.  Subsequently,  the  feature  vectors 
extracted from the test datasets are updated using the trained Gaussian 
parameters to produce refined feature vectors. The V-alg employs these 
refined feature vectors, along with T  and π, to classify the test dataset as 
either blue whale vocalizations or noise. It is noteworthy that that the V- 
alg switches from states 1–4 to states 5–8 with equal transition proba-
bilities. Table 1 shows the parameters used for WT-HMM simulation.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information regarding the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it mentions that there were manual detections made for different types of calls, which suggests that some form of manual annotation was performed. Additionally, the text refers to an IWC-SORP/SOOS annotated library, indicating that this library contains annotated data. Unfortunately, without further details, we cannot determine the exact nature of these annotations.
