the classification model with a total of 86,208 segments. Fig. 7 shows 
how the model is able to learn in fewer steps and with better accuracy if 
data augmentation is used.

2.3. Fish classification by species 

A classifier based on deep neural networks was also used for this task. 
In this case, the chosen architecture is a residual neural network, whose 
main characteristic is that it can skip some of its layers (He et al., 2016). 
In particular, the implementation of ResNet50V2 model in TensorFlow

Helpful Answer:
The table titled "Hyperparameters used for the training of each neural network" provides information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning models. For the segmentation module, the epochs were set to 15,000, batch size to 4, learning rate to 0.008, activation function to Softmax, and train/test split ratio to 0.9/0.1. On the other hand, for the classification module, the epochs were set to 500, batch size to 128, learning rate to 0.0001, activation function to Softmax, and train/test split ratio to 0.8/0.2. However, the optimizer used in these models is not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
