for the FWI and FFMC data layers with a spatial resolution of 1 × 1 km.
The nine-cell approach, the results of which are shown in this paper, led
to slightly better prediction results of the variants, likely because it
smoothed existing data inaccuracies within single grid cells.

fine organic matter from the last year (grass, litter) dries out faster than
on north-facing slopes, increasing the probability for an earlier fire
ignition in spring (Conedera et al., 2018; Maxwell et al., 2019). This
phenomenon cannot be described by current fire danger indices such as
the Canadian Fire Weather Index (FWI), as these indices are not in-
tended to be used in the cold season (Van Wagner, 1987).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:

I apologize, but based on the given context, there is no information available regarding strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses vegetation, fire weather indices, and related research papers. Therefore, I am unable to provide a helpful answer to your query.
