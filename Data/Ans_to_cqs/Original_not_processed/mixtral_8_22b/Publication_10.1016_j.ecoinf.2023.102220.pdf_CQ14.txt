contained in P′
c. These results reflect the accuracy of 100% obtained for 
some parameter regions in our sensitivity study. The results improved 
dramatically  when  we  fully  optimised  our  choice  for  the  parameter 
values, even when subject to stochastic effects.

With  respect  to  interpretability,  when  using  RF,  it  is  possible  to 
obtain variable importance. However in this case, this will tell us which 
previous  steps  were  most  important  when  predicting  outbreaks,  not 
necessarily  how  they  relate  to  its  occurrence.  When  using  LSTM  and 
DNN,  which  are  commonly  referred  to  as  ‘black-box’  methods  (Liang 
et al., 2021), it is even more challenging to find explainable frameworks 
that allow us to study the relationship between the predictors and the 
outbreaks. However, each hyperparameter in the PBP framework pro-
vides a clear interpretation, and we are able to create visual represen-
tations  of  the  patterns  that  occurred  before  the  outbreak  (the  P′
means 
matrix).  For  instance,  Fig.  7  displays  the  three  patterns  in  P′
means  ob-
tained from employing PBP using the optimised hyperparameter values 
for the aphid data using 50% of the time series for training.

Also, considering the influence of the model, we found that the rank 
of  models  in  which  our  method  produced  higher  performance  is, 
respectively, starting with the best one, the negative binomial (ϕ = 1.2), 
Gaussian, negative binomial (ϕ = 3) and Poisson stochastic models. On 
average, we obtain an accuracy of 84.6% with a standard deviation of 
20.5%, a false positive rate of 14.9% with a standard deviation of 24.2% 
and a true positive rate of 59.6% with a standard deviation of 42.0% for 
the  negative  binomial  (ϕ = 1.2)  model.  Considering  the  Gaussian 
model, we obtained an accuracy of 75.2% with a standard deviation of 
18.0%, a false positive rate of 22.9% with a standard deviation of 22.2% 
and a true positive rate of 55.5% with a standard deviation of 37.3%. 
This finding makes our method a promising prediction tool since we got 
good results even when using stochastic approaches to simulate the data.

machine  learning  methods:  Support  Vector  Machines,  Deep  Neural  Networks,  Long  Short  Term  Memory  and 
Random Forests. The PBP method yielded a competitive performance associated with higher true-positive rates 
in most comparisons while providing interpretability rather than being a black-box method. It is an improvement 
over current state-of-the-art machine learning tools, especially by non-specialists, such as ecologists aiming to use 
a quantitative approach for pest monitoring. We provide the implemented PBP method in Python through the 
pypbp package.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention the specific optimization technique used for selecting the optimal hyperparameters for the model. However, it does indicate that the authors employed a process of optimization to improve their results significantly, even under stochastic conditions. This suggests that some form of hyperparameter tuning was performed, but without further information, it cannot be definitively stated whether techniques like grid search or random search were utilized.
