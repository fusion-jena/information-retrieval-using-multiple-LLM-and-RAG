vegetation growth cycle included in the training samples.

period  of  lush  vegetation.  Therefore,  the  selected  training  samples 
lacked low-value LAI samples, resulting in a lack of training in this part 
of the RF model, which could not predict low-value LAI accurately.

While building the RF model, the training samples were randomly 
divided  according  to  proportions  of  80%  and  20%  and  used  for  the 
training and test datasets, respectively. The parameters of the RF model, 
number of trees (n_estimators), minimum number of leaves (minleaf), and 
number of randomly selected node-split feature variables (max_features) 
significantly affected  the  accuracy and  complexity  of  the model.  This 
study used a grid search method (GridSearchCV) based on the out-of-bag 
(OOB)  error  and  five-fold  cross-validation  to  search  for  the  optimal 
parameters  of  the  model  (Chang  et  al.,  2023).  The  n_estimators  were 
spaced at 50 intervals, ranging from 100 to 1000. The minleaf is 2, 5, 10, 
20, and 50. The max_features were spaced at intervals of 1, ranging from 
1 to k where k is the number of characteristic variables.

3.1. Screening of training feature variables 

We selected high-quality LAI training samples from the two MODIS 
products according to the method described in Section 2.3, and elimi-
nated outliers. On 18 May 2020, we selected 26,816 LAI training sam-
ples  and on  11 August  2019, we selected 29,810.  A histogram  of the 
selected LAI training samples for the two periods is shown in Fig. 4. To 
compare the estimation effects of high spatial resolution LAI combined 
with vegetation, two feature variable combinations were established: (1) 
band reflectance and (2) band reflectance and VIs. For the band reflec-
tance, as the blue band is easily affected by atmospheric scattering and 
the GF-1 WFV data only includes images in the R, G, B, and NIR bands; 
therefore, only the R, G, and NIR bands were selected for band reflec-
tance  extraction.  For  VIs,  a  Pearson  correlation  coefficient  >0.4  was 
used as the screening boundary.

Helpful Answer:
The study uses a grid search method (GridSearchCV) based on the out-of-bag (OOB) error and five-fold cross-validation to search for the optimal parameters of the Random Forest (RF) model. The parameters include the number of trees (n\_estimators), minimum number of leaves (minleaf), and number of randomly selected node-split feature variables (max\_features). The n\_estimators are spaced at 50 intervals, ranging from 100 to 1000. The minleaf is set to 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50. The max\_features are spaced at intervals of 1, ranging from 1 to k where k is the number of characteristic variables. However, the text does not explicitly mention any specific criteria for determining when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau or other stopping conditions.
