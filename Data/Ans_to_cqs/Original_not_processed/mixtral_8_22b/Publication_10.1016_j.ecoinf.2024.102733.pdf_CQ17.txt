During the training of the MLP, Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba,
2015) is used, as well as the scheduler which adjusts the learning rate
when the network reaches a plateau. For the training, various parameter
values and different regularization techniques were explored, with the
option of using either Cross-Entropy or Focal Loss (Lin et al., 2017). In
detail, the learning rate was set to 0.00001 and 0.0001, batch sizes of 8,
16, 32, and 64 were tested, and weight decay was varied between
0.0001 and 0.001 with a dropout of 0.1. Additionally, Focal Loss (Lin
et al., 2017) introduce additional parameters to investigate: α and γ. The
former serves as a balancing factor, either as a fixed value for all classes
or as the inverse of each class frequency. The latter regulates the impact
of the scaling factor; specifically, when set to zero, Focal Loss is equiv-
alent to Cross-Entropy Loss. We experimented with α set as the inverse of

Once the latent representations were extracted from the Autoencoder
model, an MLP was trained for the classification of fish events.
Throughout the training of MLP, Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba,
2015) with the learning rate modified by a scheduler when the network
reaches a plateau was used. The MLP was trained for several epochs with
various parameter configurations and regularization techniques,
including both Cross-Entropy and Focal Loss, in line with the proposed
method. As regularization techniques, weight decay, batch normaliza-
tion (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015), and dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014)
were explored. In particular, batch normalization (Ioffe and Szegedy,
2015) was tested on each layer of the network separately and on all
layers simultaneously, with the best results achieved when applied to
the third layer. Dropout has been applied to the input layer, the hidden
layers, and all layers, yielding various results in combination with other

parameters. The parameter values explored alongside the aforemen-
tioned autoencoder include the following: learning rates of 0.00005,
0.0005, 0.0001, 0.005, 0.001, and 0.01; batch sizes of 8, 16, 32, 64, and
128; weight decay values of 0, 0.00001, 0.0001, and 0.001, with
dropout set to 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.25. For the focal loss parameters, α
was defined as the inverse of class frequency, 0.25, or 0.5, while γ was
set to 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, and 2.

The MLP employed consists of four fully connected layers with the
size of 256, 128, 64, and 12, each comprising a linear layer followed by
PRelu as non-linearity. Only the third layer differs, as it is provided with
Batch Normalization (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015). During optimization,
Batch Normalization was also applied to other layers as well, but the
network performance was not as good. The network gets the input of size
512 consisting of learned features extracted from the diffusion model
and the last layer has 12 neurons. The maximum neuron value from this
layer is then used for predicting the event class, as each neuron corre-
sponds to one of the events. The values of the 12 neurons are then
compared to the real event ground truth through a loss, which serves to
update the model parameters and perform the training.

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, there are three main regularization techniques mentioned for preventing overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. These techniques are weight decay, batch normalization, and dropout.

Weight Decay: Weight decay is another term for L2 regularization, where a penalty equal to the sum of squares of weights is added to the loss function during optimization. This encourages smaller weights, reducing the complexity of the model and helping avoid overfitting. In the given context, weight decay values of 0, 0.00001, 0.0001, and 0.001 were explored.

Batch Normalization: Batch normalization is a technique that standardizes the inputs to a layer for each mini-batch, allowing each layer of a network to learn by itself more independently of other layers. It helps reduce internal covariate shift, making the network faster and more stable. In the given context, batch normalization was applied to each layer of the network separately and to all layers simultaneously, with the best results achieved when applied to the third layer.

Dropout: Dropout is a regularization method that randomly sets a fraction of input units to 0 at each update during training time, effectively creating a sparse representation of the input data. This prevents complex co-adaptations on training data, thereby improving generalization to unseen data. In the given context, dropout was applied to the input layer, the hidden layers, and all layers, with values of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.25 being explored.
