Deep learning models are complex artificial neural networks (ANN; 
Lek and Gu´egan, 1999; Olden et al., 2008) composed of a large number 
of trainable parameters (LeCun et al., 2015), which are able to perform 
complex  tasks  with  high  performance,  such  as  computer  vision  and 
natural language processing but also image and sound data classification 
(Christin et al., 2019; LeCun et al., 2015). In the context of disease vector 
abundance  prediction,  a  key  difference  of  deep  learning  models  over 
conventional  approaches  is  that  the  former  allow  using  time  series 
directly as predictors and the relevance of the features found in these 
data is evaluated by the models themselves (Capinha et al., 2021; Fawaz 
et al., 2019). This is in sharp contrast to prior research, where predictors 
were typically temporally invariant, usually corresponding to a statis-
tical summarization of the variability observed in the time series data (e.

Here we describe and demonstrate the application of a deep learning- 
based approach, as an alternative to the classical approaches (e.g., Chen 
et al., 2019; Cheng et al., 2020; da Cruz Ferreira et al., 2017; Li et al., 
2019; Monaghan et al., 2019; Poh et al., 2019; Ripoche et al., 2019) for 
predicting  disease  vector  numbers.  While  the  use  of  deep  learning  in 
ecology is increasing, most studies are for image and sound data clas-
sification  (e.g.,  Brodrick  et  al.,  2019;  Campos-Taberner  et  al.,  2020; 
Christin et al., 2019; Mac Aodha et al., 2018). To our knowledge, this is 
the  first  time  a  deep  learning-based  approach  is  used  for  modelling 
disease vector abundances.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not explicitly state what specific data format was used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that deep learning models can be applied to various types of data including images, sounds, and time series data. It also states that while the use of deep learning in ecology is increasing, most studies focus on image and sound data classification. Therefore, it can be inferred that the deep learning pipeline described here could potentially involve any of those data formats, depending on the specific application.
