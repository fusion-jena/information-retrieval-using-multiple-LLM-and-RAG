number of convolutional weights by a factor of K, resulting in a lack of 
compactness  in  the  model.  Secondly,  jointly  optimizing  dynamic 
attention and static convolutional kernels becomes a challenging task. 
To address these issues, Li proposed the dynamic convolutional kernel 
decomposition in 2021 (Li et al., 2021). This approach effectively re-
duces the number of parameters in dynamic convolution and improves 
the classification performance of neural networks that utilize dynamic 
convolutional kernels. 

In (Li et al., 2021), the static convolution kernel can be re-defining by 

the formula 9.

generative models. It consists of an encoder, decoder, and latent space 
sampling components. The CVAE maps the input data and conditional 
information  to  the  latent  space  and  decodes  the  latent  vectors  to 
generate data samples using the decoder. To evaluate the performance 
of  the  proposed  model  in  this  paper,  we  conducted  experiments  on 
generating birdsong spectrograms using the CVAE model. The results, 
presented  in  Table  10  and  Fig.  14,  demonstrate  the  quality  of  the 
generated spectrograms. The CVAE model achieved an IS of 3.26 and a 
FID of 134.48. These scores were 1.84 lower and 72.91 higher than those 
of  the  DR-ACGAN  model,  indicating  that  the  CVAE  model  generated 
images of poorer quality. This could be attributed to the CVAE’s limited 
ability to learn the distribution of latent variables, resulting in recon-
structed images with more noise. Additionally, Fig. 14 also illustrates

thereby limiting the upper and lower bounds of the function gradient 
and making the function smoother. This property ensures more stable 
parameter  changes  and  reduces  the  likelihood  of  gradient  explosion 
during neural network optimization, leading to improved training sta-
bility of the model. 

Spectral normalization(Miyato et al., 2018) achieved Lipschitz con-
tinuity by constraining the spectral norm of the weight matrix of each 
layer  of  the  network  in  the  discriminator.  This  approach  is  simple, 
efficient,  and  does  not  require  additional  hyperparameter  tuning. 
Therefore,  it  is  widely  adopted  to  train  stable  GANs(Li  et  al.,  2022a; 
Zhang et al., 2019a).

the comparison of the DR-ACGAN generated wavelet spectrograms with 
the original ones. For each class, two original images and four generated 
images  are  displayed.  The  figure  shows  that  the  generated  images 
exhibit similarities in overall structure to the original images while also 
displaying differences in specific details. This observation indicates that 
the  DR-ACGAN  model  generated  images  possess  similarities  and  di-
versity, avoiding model collapse.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, there is mention of Spectral Normalization (Miyato et al., 2018) which is used for achieving Lipschitz continuity by constraining the spectral norm of the weight matrix of each layer of the network in the discriminator. This method is described as being simple, efficient, and not requiring additional hyperparameter tuning. Therefore, based on the available context, it appears that the use of Spectral Normalization may help reduce or eliminate the need for extensive hyperparameter optimization methods such as grid search or random search.
