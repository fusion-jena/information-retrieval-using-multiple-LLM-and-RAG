scenarios. The study showed the suitability of the SVR algorithm for
making predictions with restricted datasets, a finding that aligns with
previous research investigations (Kaveh et al., 2023; Mehmood et al.,
2024a; Zhang et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2022). An important conclusion
is derived from Fig. 6. It highlights that MLR heavily depends on pre-
dictor variables, demonstrating a more pronounced reliance on these
elements than machine learning methods. Furthermore, it is worth
noting that relying solely on spectral bands to predict AGB is unlikely to
produce favorable outcomes. Integrating these spectral bands with other
variable sets, including those produced from the Shuttle Radar Topog-
raphy Mission Digital Elevation Model (SRTM DEM) and vegetation-
derived indices, will lead to more favorable outcomes.

Query: "What are the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet)? "

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The query asks about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, the given context does not provide specific details about any deep learning pipelines or the use of popular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the context focuses on a study related to modeling forest above-ground biomass using various datasets.

From the context, we can gather that the researchers utilized multiple datasets, including:

1. Data from EarthExplorer (<https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/>): This platform provides access to various types of geospatial data, including SRTM DEM data rendered at a resolution of 30 meters. In this case, the authors used this data to supplement their existing dataset.

2. SoilGrids250m: This dataset offers global gridded soil information based on machine learning techniques. It was mentioned in one of the cited sources but not explicitly stated whether it was used in the current study.

3. Freely available satellite and multisource datasets: These were employed to model forest above-ground biomass, according to another cited source. However, no further details regarding the exact datasets used were provided.

Therefore, while the context discusses several datasets used in a study, none of them match the well-known deep learning datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
