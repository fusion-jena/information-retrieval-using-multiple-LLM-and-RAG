in  predicting  means,  SDs  and  finally  population  sizes  based  on  the 
observed data (e.g. Bhattacharya, 1967), thus reducing manual labour to 
a minimum.

full  sample  (N  = 10,000)  using  both  uninformative  and  informative 
priors through the R-code (supplement S1). The outcome is presented in 
a figure, but is also stored as a .csv file when running the R-code, hence, 
the number of errors at each frequency can be studied in detail.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets. However, it does discuss the use of observed data and full samples in the analysis process. It mentions a full sample size of N=10,000, which suggests that some form of data collection method has been employed to gather these observations. Additionally, there is reference to species identification based on machine learning, indicating that image or sensor data may have been collected for this purpose. Nonetheless, without further information about the exact nature of the study or research being conducted, it is difficult to definitively state what methods were used for gathering raw data.
