sub-basins of the GAB region.

5.5. Relevance for policy and management

The GAB lends itself well as a case study area for this research, as its 
climatic conditions, although variable across its vast size, has a history 
of drought occurrences. This basin is a country-size underground aquifer 
that  lies  over  1.7  million  km2,  which  is  nearly  one-fifth  the  size  of 
Australia.  The  basin  is  geologically  complex  and  is  home  to  approxi-
mately 200,000 people, 7600 businesses and a wide variety of endemic 
flora and fauna (Habermehl, 1998; Habermehl, 2009). The hydrological 
characteristics  of  the  GAB  are  primarily  influenced  by  rainfall,  soil 
moisture,  evapotranspiration,  surface  water  discharge,  and  terrestrial 
water  storage  which  makes  it  a  perfect  case  for  this  research.  With 
diverse climatic conditions, varying from semi-arid to arid, the GAB's 
most  northern  portions  receive  substantial  tropical  seasonal  rainfall, 
while there is minimal rainfall in its middle and western regions (Fig. 1).

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, the purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated. However, considering the overall theme of the text, we can infer that the deep learning model aims to enhance understanding and investigation of groundwater-climate interactions within the sub-basins of the Great Artesian Basin (GAB) region. Given that the GAB is subject to diverse climatic conditions ranging from semi-arid to arid, with varying levels of rainfall across different regions, the deep learning model could potentially be used for tasks such as predicting or classifying climate patterns, identifying areas prone to drought, or analyzing the impact of climate change on groundwater resources. Additionally, the mention of previous studies related to drought risk assessments and groundwater table depth predictions suggests that these might also be relevant applications for the proposed deep learning model. Nonetheless, without further information, it is difficult to determine the exact purpose of the deep learning model with certainty.
