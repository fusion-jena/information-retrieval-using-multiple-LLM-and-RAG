matching score and cross-correlation feature map of the classification 
branch. Finally, a refined classification confidence score was generated 
using a convolution operation. The refinement module effectively inte-
grated  the  relation  detector  into  the  Siamese  framework  to  suppress 
false-positive detections and filter background interference.

train a Siamese network using fewer samples, resulting in high accuracy. 
As the training dataset contained an insufficient number of samples, we 
used  the  few-shot  learning  method  to  train  the  network.  Herein,  the 
classification task was defined as the N-way K-shot problem, where the 
training  set  contained  N  different  categories  with  each  category 
comprising K labeled samples. Two categories were defined during the 
training  of  the  tracking  tasks:  target  and  non-target.  Based  on  the 
training pairs assigned to the labels, experiments were performed using 
two-way one-shot learning(Cheng et al., 2021).

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about how the data is split for deep learning model training. However, it can be inferred from the context that the authors use a few-shot learning approach due to having an insufficient number of samples in their dataset. In this case, they define their classification task as an N-way K-shot problem, which means they have N different categories, each containing K labeled samples. For their specific application, they perform two-way one-shot learning, implying that they have only two classes (target and non-target) and one sample per class for training purposes. Although the exact splitting criteria are not mentioned, typically, datasets are divided into three parts: training, testing, and validation sets. The training set is used to fit the model parameters, while the validation set helps tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Lastly, the testing set evaluates the final performance of the trained model.
