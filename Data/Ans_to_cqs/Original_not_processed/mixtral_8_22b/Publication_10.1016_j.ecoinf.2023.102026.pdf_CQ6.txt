4.2. Scaling hypotheses

To produce accurate SDMs, not just the effects of different algorithms 
should be investigated, but also the effects of resampling techniques on 
model's  training  data  (Efron,  1982;  Freedman,  1981).  Specifically, 
bootstrapping (i.e., random subsampling with replacement) the training 
data  has  been  shown  to  increase  models'  precision  by  providing  a 
combination of models, which reduces stochastic errors in estimation (e. 
g., Vaughan and Ormerod (2005); Hefley et al. (2014); Xu and Goodacre 
(2018)).

A key point in machine learning is represented by the data, not only 
by the algorithms. The structure of the training data can have profound 
and critical effects on the outcomes of models trained with the RF al-
gorithm. While this is an important point which is worthy of evaluation, 
our dataset was limited to a collection of camera trap data on several 
species which makes it difficult to comprehensively compare the effects 
of the data and its structure. We note that this is better explored with 
simulation, as in a recent paper from our group (Kumar et al., 2021) 
which  indeed  showed  that  the  spatial  pattern  and  shape  of  the  envi-
ronmental manifold itself affects performance of GLM and RF.

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not directly address the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does discuss the importance of data preparation for machine learning models, specifically focusing on Species Distribution Models (SDMs). It mentions the use of bootstrapping, a type of resampling technique, to improve the precision of models by reducing stochastic errors in estimation. This could be considered a form of data preprocessing, although it is not one of the standard methods typically associated with deep learning models. In general, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models include normalizing input features to a similar scale, handling missing values or outliers, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the dataset into training and validation sets. These steps help ensure that the model can learn effectively from the data and generalize well to new, unseen examples.
