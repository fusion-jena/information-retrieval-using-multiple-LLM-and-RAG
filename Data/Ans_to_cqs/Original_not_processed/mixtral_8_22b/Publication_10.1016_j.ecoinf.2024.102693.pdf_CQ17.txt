Yuan et al. (2022) claimed that the superior performance of a ViT can 
primarily be attributed to extensive pre-training data. If a ViT is trained 
from  scratch  on  a  medium-sized  dataset,  its  performance  lags  behind 
that of a CNN model with comparable parameter sizes. To address this 
limitation, they proposed Volo with the novel Outlook Attention as the 
token mixer module, which enabled fine-grained token representation 
and the aggregation of global information. 

2.3. MLP-like model

2.2. Transformer-like model 

Transformer  was  proposed  by  Vaswani  et  al.  (2017)  and  initially 
designed for Seq2Seq tasks, replacing long short-term memory (LSTM) 
with a full-attention structure. It was primarily applied in NLP, and both 
the  transformer  and  its  subsequent  iterations  demonstrated  excellent 
performance in a wide range of downstream tasks. With the success of 
the transformer in NLP, researchers have begun to explore its applica-
tion in CV. 

The core structure of the transformer-like visual model is an encoder 
module, which comprises several stacked blocks. Each block consists of 
two  components:  a  token  mixer  module  (Yu  et  al.,  2022)  for  fusing 
spatial information and an MLP module for fusing channel information. 
The main distinction among the different transformer-like visual models 
lies in the variations in the token mixer module. For example, the token 
mixer in a ViT (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) is a self-attention module.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The papers mentioned do not explicitly discuss regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, two related techniques are discussed: MixUp and CutMix. These techniques are used to improve generalization and robustness during training. MixUp (Zhang et al., 2017) creates new samples by linearly combining existing ones, while CutMix (Yun et al., 2019) replaces part of one input image with another. Both methods help reduce overfitting by increasing the diversity of training examples.
