Pre-training on the both ResNet50 (He et al., 2016) and Inception 
(Szegedy et al., 2014) neural networks did not meaningfully improve 
classification performance, therefore this simpler architecture, similar to 
those implemented by (Ruff et al., 2020; Sprengel et al., 2016) was used 
instead. 

2.6. Generating prediction record

Transfer learning, where a model pre-trained on one dataset is re- 
trained  to  classify  a  similar  datset,  is  one  convenient  approach  to 
effectively  utilize  the  power  of  CNNs.  Well-known  pre-trained  archi-
tectures such as Inception, MobileNet, and Resnet50 have recently been 
used with great success for the classification of birds in soundscape re-
cordings (Florentin et al., 2020; He et al., 2016; Howard et al., 2017; 
Incze et al., 2018; LeBien et al., 2020; Sevilla and Glotin, 2017; Szegedy 
et  al.,  2014).  Such  networks  are  typically  pre-trained  on  large  image 
databases such as ImageNet, which contains over one million samples 
distributed across 1000 classes (Deng et al., 2009). However, in cases 
where  targeting  foreground  species  is  the  main  task,  or  with  more 
acoustically sparse soundscapes, CNN architectures with far fewer (<10) 
convolutional layers have proven more than sufficient, and indeed, may

2.4.1. Training database assembly 

To assemble a training database, three randomly selected days from 
each month of the calendar year (see Table 1) were selected for anno-
tation. Select spectrogram images were manually labeled via visual in-
spection by two trained graduate students into a set of sound categories 
that evolved as the year progressed. On average, around 60 images could 
be  annotated  per  minute,  which  corresponds  to  8  min  of  audio  data. 
Therefore,  annotating  every  single  spectrogram  from  a  single  day 
(10,800 images) would take 3 h. Assembling the training database took 
less time in practice because only 10â€“15% of the spectrograms from each 
of the selected days were actually annotated (many spectrograms which 
contained only background noise were simply not needed). 

In total, this database consists of over 40 k images of bio-, anthro- 
and  geophonies.  The  full  contents  of  the  database  are  presented  in 
Table 2.

2.3. Data pre-processing 

Once all of the audio data was collected, it was segmented into 8 s- 
long clips, to increase the likelihood  that both biological and  anthro-
pogenic sound sources with longer call lengths (the cardinal, with a song 
sequence that often lasts 4 s, and the siren call, one period of which lasts 
5  s)  to  be  captured  in  their  entirety.  Each  segment  was  then  down-
sampled to 16 kHz for processing efficiency, allowing each to be rep-
resented  as  a  128,000-sample  vector.  Finally,  these  segments  were 
converted into log-mel spectrograms using the Librosa python package

Helpful Answer:
The given text does not provide explicit information about the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on common practices in deep learning pipelines, some possible data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, zooming, brightness adjustment, contrast adjustment, saturation adjustment, and hue adjustment. These techniques can help improve the robustness and generalization ability of the models by increasing the diversity of the training data. It should be noted that the choice of data augmentation techniques depends on the nature of the problem and the characteristics of the input data. Therefore, without further details about the specific deep learning pipeline mentioned in the text, we cannot determine which data augmentation techniques were applied.
