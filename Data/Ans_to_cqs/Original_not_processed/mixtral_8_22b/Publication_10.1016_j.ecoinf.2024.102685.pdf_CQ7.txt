of a plethora of runs with different number of trees (Probst et al., 2019). 
For  the  best  split  selection  measurement,  the  Gini  Index  was  used 
(Breiman,  2001).  The  number  of  variables  used  for  each  node  (mtry) 
were  automatically  selected  by  using  repeated  cross  validations  per-
formed  with  10  folds  and  10  repetitions  for  the  seagrass  meadow 
models, while 5 folds and 5 repetitions were used for species meadow 
models. The available validation dataset was used to create a confusion 
matrix for image classifications. Based on the confusion matrix, metrics 
as  overall  (O.A.),  producer  (P.A.)  and  user  (U.A.)  accuracy  for  each 
classified class were calculated (Congalton, 1991). O.A. represents the 
proportion  of  correctly  classified  validation  samples  (found along  the 
diagonal in the error matrix) to the total number of validation samples, 
irrespective of class. P.A. quantifies the proportion of accurately clas-

2.2. Training data and validation distribution data 

The workflow adopted for data acquisition, preparation and to set RF 
models are summarized in Fig. 2. The field data were collected during 
the summer season in 2010 (see Boscutti et al., 2015 for details about the 
field sampling procedure). The presence or absence and the cover per-
centage of the three seagrass species were recorded for each sampling 
point, by means of inspection and sampling of the seabed. To reduce the 
effects  introduced  by  non-vegetated  and  mixed  pixels,  the  points  not 
falling within the region of interest (ROI) (i.e. main channels and tidal 
islands  of  the  lagoon), and  the  points  considered  mixed  (i.e.  those in 
which  the  co-occurrence  of  multiple  species  was  recorded),  were 
removed. The removed mixed points represented 16.7% of the original 
data.  Considering  the different  combinations of  the three  speciesâ€™  co-

Helpful Answer:

In this study, the authors use random forest classification for their statistical analysis. They mention using a plethora of runs with different numbers of trees and selecting the best split based on the Gini index. However, they do not explicitly state how they divide their data into training, testing, and validation sets.

From the given information, we can infer that the authors use a form of cross-validation for their models. Specifically, they perform repeated cross-validations with 10 folds and 10 repetitions for the seagrass meadow models, and 5 folds and 5 repetitions for the species meadow models. This suggests that they likely use some form of k-fold cross-validation to evaluate their models.

Additionally, the authors mention creating a confusion matrix for image classifications using the available validation dataset. From this confusion matrix, they calculate various metrics such as overall accuracy, producer accuracy, and user accuracy. This indicates that they have a separate validation set to evaluate their models' performance.

However, it is unclear from the given information whether the authors also have a separate test set to further evaluate their models' generalization ability. It is possible that they only use the validation set for both evaluation and tuning purposes, which could potentially lead to overfitting. Without more specific information regarding the division of their data into training, testing, and validation sets, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer to the query.
