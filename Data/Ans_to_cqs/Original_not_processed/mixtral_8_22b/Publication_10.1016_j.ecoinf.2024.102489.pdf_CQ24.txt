2.3.3. Random Forest (RF) 

The RF model is a machine learning algorithm based on a classifi-
cation  tree  proposed by  Breiman  (1996, 2001)  that is  widely used  in 
regression and classification. The basic idea is to construct decision trees 
and combine them according to certain criteria to generate an RF model. 
The randomness of RF is due to the random selection of samples and 
characteristic variables. Compared to other black-box machine learning 
algorithms,  the  RF  regression  model  has  a  high  tolerance  for  noisy 
datasets,  is  straightforward  to  implement,  has  low  computational 
overhead,  is  highly  interpretable,  effectively  prevents  variable  collin-
earity, avoids model overfitting, and provides good prediction ability for 
high-dimensional datasets.

While building the RF model, the training samples were randomly 
divided  according  to  proportions  of  80%  and  20%  and  used  for  the 
training and test datasets, respectively. The parameters of the RF model, 
number of trees (n_estimators), minimum number of leaves (minleaf), and 
number of randomly selected node-split feature variables (max_features) 
significantly affected  the  accuracy and  complexity  of  the model.  This 
study used a grid search method (GridSearchCV) based on the out-of-bag 
(OOB)  error  and  five-fold  cross-validation  to  search  for  the  optimal 
parameters  of  the  model  (Chang  et  al.,  2023).  The  n_estimators  were 
spaced at 50 intervals, ranging from 100 to 1000. The minleaf is 2, 5, 10, 
20, and 50. The max_features were spaced at intervals of 1, ranging from 
1 to k where k is the number of characteristic variables.

Helpful Answer:

The given context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or managing random seed values. However, it does provide information about how randomness is handled in the Random Forest (RF) model, which could be relevant to understanding general approaches to managing randomness in machine learning algorithms.

In the case of the RF model, randomness is introduced through the random selection of samples and characteristic variables during the construction of decision trees. To manage this randomness and optimize the performance of the RF model, several strategies are employed:

1. Cross-validation: In this study, a five-fold cross-validation approach was used to evaluate the performance of the RF model. Cross-validation helps ensure that the model can generalize well to unseen data and reduces the risk of overfitting.

2. Grid Search Method: A grid search method (GridSearchCV) was utilized to find the optimal parameters for the RF model. By systematically searching across a range of parameter values, this method aims to identify the best combination of hyperparameters that minimize the out-of-bag (OOB) error.

3. Parameter Tuning: Specific parameters such as the number of trees (n\_estimators), minimum number of leaves (minleaf), and the number of randomly selected node-split feature variables (max\_features) were adjusted to improve the accuracy and complexity of the model. These adjustments help control the level of randomness introduced into the model.

Although these strategies do not explicitly address the management of random seeds in deep learning pipelines, they demonstrate some common techniques for controlling randomness in machine learning models. Managing randomness in deep learning often involves setting fixed random seeds, using deterministic algorithms, or employing ensemble methods like bagging or boosting to reduce variance caused by randomness.
