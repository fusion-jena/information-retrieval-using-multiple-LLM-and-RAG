We applied the transfer learning and fine-tuning technique with the 
deep learning model ResNet50 (He et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2018), which 
was already pre-trained on ImageNet data (Deng et al., 2009). Transfer 
learning is a technique that enabled us to overcome the issue of shortage 
of  training  data  and  construct  a  model  efficiently  by  transferring 
knowledge  from  a  similar  task  to,  in  this  case,  our  target  task.  The 
implemented  architecture  received  RGB  images  of  224×224×3  as 
inputs—in this case, color spectrograms of two-second durations—and 
included  only  the  feature  extraction  layers  from  the  ResNet50,  dis-
carding the superior classification layers (known as the top network). 
The newly created model reconfigured the top network with two fully 
connected  layers  (FC)  that  could  learn  new  features.  To  reduce  over-
fitting and imitate the training of a set of different models, a dropout

important acoustic activity, even though they are not a species of in-

number of classes and benefit from numerous and diverse data. 

It is very likely that the high performance shown in the test subset is 
partially biased by the individuals’ vocalizations that were recorded for 
both  training  and  testing.  Consequently,  we  recommend  reserving 
monitoring areas for the creation of validation and test sets, avoiding a 
link with the training data and allowing the generalization of the model 
to  be  correctly  estimated.  This  should  speed  up  threshold  calibration 
during production.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the type of optimizer employed. It mainly focuses on describing the application of the transfer learning and fine-tuning techniques with the ResNet50 model, along with its input size and modifications made to the top network. For more detailed information regarding the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, additional sources would need to be consulted.
