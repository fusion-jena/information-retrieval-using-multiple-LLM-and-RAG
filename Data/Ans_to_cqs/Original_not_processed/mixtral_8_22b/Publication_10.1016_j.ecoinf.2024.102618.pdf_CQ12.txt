• EfficientNetB0 EfficientNet is a CNN architecture and scaling method 
that uniformly scales all dimensions of the CNN. EfficientNetB0 (Tan 
and Le, 2019) is a network that is trained on more than a million 
images from the ImageNet database.  

• EfficientNetB3 

EfficientNetB3 (Tan and Le, 2019) is another network of the Effi-
cientNet  family.  EfficientNetB3  comes  from  scaling  EfficientNetB0 
which was generated using AutoML.  

• InceptionResNetv2 

InceptionResNetv2 (Szegedy et al., 2017) is a CNN network that 
builds on the inception family of architectures. However, the model 
incorporates residual connections instead of the filter concatenation 
stage of the inception family.  

• ResNet50v2 

(Gomez et al., 2017) ResNet50 is a deep learning architecture that 
is  50  layers  deep.  ResNet50v2  is  also  trained  on  a  million  images 
from the ImageNet dataset.

Different  deep  learning  models  are  tested  to  find  the  model  with  the 
highest accuracy. The results show that EfficientNet achieves the highest 
accuracy.  A  data  augmentation  technique  is  added  to  increase  the 
number  of  images  from 55,448  to  61,486  images.  Results  of  the  pro-
posed deep learning models on the dataset with and without augmen-
tation  are  reported. This  work  augments  the  dataset using a  complex 
data augmentation technique to produce a new dataset. However, in our 
proposed work we use an augmented version of PlanVillage that can be 
used by different researchers for comparison. Also, we propose using a

Helpful Answer:
The pipeline uses various types of deep learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Specifically, it employs DenseNet201, efficientNetB0, efficientNetB3, Inceptionresnetv2, and ResNet50v2. These models are part of the ensemble methods used in the pipeline. Additionally, the pipeline utilizes EfficientNet, which is a CNN architecture and scaling method that uniformly scales all dimensions of the CNN. It includes networks such as EfficientNetB0 and EfficientNetB3. Another model used is InceptionResNetv2, which is a CNN network built upon the inception family of architectures but incorporating residual connections instead of the filter concatenation stage of the inception family. Lastly, the pipeline uses ResNet50v2, a deep learning architecture that is 50 layers deep and trained on a million images from the ImageNet dataset.
