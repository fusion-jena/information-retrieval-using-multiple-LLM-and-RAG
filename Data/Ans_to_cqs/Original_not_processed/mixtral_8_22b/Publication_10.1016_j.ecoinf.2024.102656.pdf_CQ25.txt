Although  studying  complex  ecosystems  can  be  challenging,  this 
study  underscores  the  importance  of  interdisciplinary  collaboration 
(Westley and Miller, 2013). Continuous refinement of models is essential 
given the dynamic and nonlinear nature of ecological processes and the 
scarcity of long-term data (Bugmann and Weisberg, 2003). The findings 
of this study offer practical value and provide a roadmap for protecting 
essential habitats, restoring connectivity, and ensuring the resilience of 
ungulate populations in the face of escalating human activities.

Connectivity  prediction  was  implemented  in  UNICOR  over  the 
resistance  map  for  the  species  to  find  the  single-source  shortest  path 
between  start  and  end  occurrence  records  (Landguth  et  al.,  2012; 
Cushman et al., 2013). Furthermore, the continuous factorial least-cost 
path map was converted to a categorical map based on the same method 
used  for  core  habitats.  To  measure  the  coverage  of  core  habitats  and 
corridors by CAs, the proportion of these areas within CAs was measured 
(Almasieh and Mohammadi, 2023).

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly state the purpose of the deep learning model used in the study. However, it mentions that the model was employed to predict suitable habitats for three ungulate species (wild goat, urial, and Jebeer gazelle) using environmental variables such as land cover, topography, climate, and anthropogenic factors. Therefore, we can infer that the deep learning model was likely used for habitat suitability modeling or classification purposes.
