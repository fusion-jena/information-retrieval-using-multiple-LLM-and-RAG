2.3. Modeling framework

1.4. Modeling approaches 

Modeling also includes selection of the classifier (or probability of 
occurrence estimator), which encompasses hundreds of different options 
(FernÂ´andez-Delgado  et  al.,  2014),  although  general  linear  models, 
MaxEnt,  and  random  forests  are  among  the  most  commonly  applied 
classifiers  (Santini  et  al.,  2021).  For  the  selected  classifier,  modeling 
package  options  enable  automated  tuning  for  parameters  through 
resampling and standard default values to reach the most accurate final 
model configuration. Multiple methods may be applied to detect over-
lapping outcomes, allowing some strength of evidence within a study 
rather  than  only  comparing  support  from  other  studies,  but  multiple 
methods may be too burdensome when hundreds or thousands of models 
are generated due to numerous species, predictor variable combinations, 
and time intervals.

Accuracy  metrics  occurred  on  separate  testing  data,  or  withheld 
known classes, to determine how well the classifier assigned classes using 
predictor  variables.  The  testing  data  were  25%  of  samples  for  this 
modeling, a randomly sampled split that is standard modeling practice 
(performed through the createDataPartition function in the caret pack-
age). The true positive rate or sensitivity is a measure of the number of 
predicted observations that were accurately assigned to a class, while the 
true negative rate or specificity is a measure of the number of predicted 
observations where the response variable of interest did not occur. 

2.4. Variable reduction for correlation

4.5. Sample thinning 

Sample  thinning  had  very  little  effect  on  accuracy  or  variable 
importance,  or  mapped  models,  indicating  no  clear  benefits  for 
tampering  with  samples  that  may  provide  information  about  species 
characteristics and responses to the environment. It is not necessary to 
add another modeling step that involves many choices, although thin-
ning  may  be  beneficial  if  thousands  of  samples  were  taken  from  one 
study site. An outcome of reducing samples is that minimum sample size 
thresholds need to be lowered to maintain the same species pool. Sample 
thinning does provide a confirmation that sample size is not as critical as 
capturing ecological amplitude for species distribution.

Helpful Answer:
After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be performed to evaluate the performance of the classifier and generate visualizations. Some common postprocessing steps include calculating accuracy metrics, creating confusion matrices, and generating saliency maps.

Accuracy metrics such as true positive rate (sensitivity) and true negative rate (specificity) can be calculated by applying the trained classifier to separate testing data or known classes that were withheld during the training process. These metrics help assess how well the classifier assigns classes based on predictor variables. In the given context, 25% of samples were used as testing data, which is a standard modeling practice.

A confusion matrix is a table layout that allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm. Each row of the matrix represents the instances in an actual class, while each column represents the instances in a predicted class. This provides insight into the types of errors made by the classifier.

Saliency maps are visual representations of the importance of input features in determining the output of a machine learning model. They highlight areas in the input space that have the greatest impact on the model's predictions. Generating saliency maps can help identify important predictors and improve understanding of the relationships between predictors and the response variable.

In summary, postprocessing steps after model training involve evaluating the performance of the classifier using accuracy metrics, confusion matrices, and saliency maps. These techniques aid in interpreting the results and improving the overall understanding of the model.
