Researchers have developed numerous WQP inversion algorithms for 
different lakes over the years. These algorithms include Band Ratio (BR), 
Three Bands (TB), NDCI, NDTI, Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), and 
more.  In  this  study,  the  development  of  these  algorithms  is  also 
considered. Moreover, deep learning algorithms were also considered, 
however,  the  limited  number  of  samples  was  not  conducive  to  deep 
learning, a point supported by the evidence in the research of Feng et al.

the  Visible  Infrared  Imaging  Radiometer  Suite  (VIIRS)  (Jiang  et  al., 
2020; Shi et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2016). However, when applied to 
small to medium-sized water bodies, issues such as insufficient spatial 
resolution (>100 m) and mixed pixels cannot be avoided. Some scholars 
have  also  used  Landsat  satellites  to  estimate  the  WQP,  but  the  long 
revisit period limited the number of available images (Andrzej Urbanski 
et al., 2016; Cao et al., 2020). Hyperspectral data have great potential

quantile sketching algorithms. LGBM achieves a reduction in the num-
ber of sample features through gradient-based one-sided sampling and 
exclusive  feature  bundling  techniques  and  significantly  improves  the 
processing  speed  of  the  algorithm  (Meng,  2018).  CatBoost,  which  is 
based  on  symmetric  decision  trees,  can  handle  one-hot  encoding  for 
discrete features, addressing gradient bias and prediction shifts, leading 
to  improved  algorithm  accuracy  and  generalisation  capabilities  (Pro-
khorenkova  et  al.,  2017).  In  this  study,  an  integrated  development 
environment based on Python and Anaconda was used to complete the 
construction, training, testing, and hyperparameter optimisation of all 
models. RF and GBDT were provided in the Scikit-learn library, whereas 
XGBoost,  LGBM,  and  CatBoost  were  implemented  through  the 
Scikit-learn API interfaces.

In recent years, machine learning (ML) has been applied in various 
fields  due  to  its  powerful  ability  to  handle  non-linear  relationships 
(Mohammadi et al., 2023), according to previous surveys, an increasing 
number of studies are attempting to use ML methods to estimate WQP. Li 
et al. established a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to estimate 
Chla concentrations in 45 typical lakes in China based on measured data 
from 2017 to 2019; the results indicated that this model is suitable for 
lakes  with  medium  to  low  Chla  concentrations  (Li  et  al.,  2021). 
Muhammad et al. developed a neural network model called the Ocean 
Color  Network  (OGN)  to  estimate  Chla  concentrations  in  the  Barents 
Sea,  in  comparison  to  Gaussian  Process  Regression,  this  network 
demonstrated  a  5.2%  reduction  in  mean  absolute  error  (Asim  et  al., 
2021). Ensemble learning (EL) is one of the key technologies in the field

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that researchers have developed numerous Water Quality Parameters (WQP) inversion algorithms using different approaches, including deep learning algorithms. The study considers the development of these algorithms, but it does not specify the type of input data used in the deep learning models.

Additionally, the text discusses the application of machine learning methods to estimate WQP, mentioning examples like Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Neural Networks (NN). It also refers to ensemble learning as a key technology in the field. However, there is no clear indication of the data format used in these models either.

Based on the given context, we can infer that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline could potentially involve satellite imagery or remote sensing data, considering the focus on estimating WQP. This assumption is further supported by the mention of sensors like the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and Landsat satellites being used for similar purposes. Nevertheless, without more specific details from the provided context, we cannot definitively determine the exact data format used in the deep learning pipeline.
