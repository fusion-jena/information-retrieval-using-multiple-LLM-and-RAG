ditions  (e.g.  fog,  glare)  in  terrestrial  images.  Therefore,  the  proposed 
model was designed based on the VGG architecture. Unlike conventional 
VGG16 or VGG19 models (the numeric value corresponds to the number 
of layers), our CNN model contained only 12 layers (see Fig. 3).

environment condition classification models, the potential influence of 
fish being in the extracted frames was considered negligible. 

The  12,000  frames  (8  frames  *  1500  videos)  extracted  from  the 
training  and  testing  dataset  were  then used  to  generate  five  different 
data sets using repeated random sub-sampling (see Fig. 4 (2)). Each of 
the  sets  was  further  split  into  a  training/testing  split  of  80/20,  con-
taining 9600 frames for training and 2400 for testing. Five CNN models 

using  the  same  model  architecture  were  then  trained  and  tested.  All 
models were trained over 100 epochs and returned an average loss value 
of  0.0126  with  an  average  accuracy  of  99.3%  during  training  and 
testing. Figures  for the  individual models are provided  in the  supple-
mentary material.

To  select  the  best  performing  model,  the  five  CNN  models  were 
validated in a final step using the 1500 videos of the validation dataset. 
It should be noted that the validation videos were held-out from training 
and thus contained videos that the models had not encountered before. 
To validate the models, 1 random frame was extracted from each vali-
dation dataset video. After extracting 1500 random frames (1 frame * 
1500 videos) all five CNN models were used to classify the videos into 
the  six  environmental  condition  classes.  The  results  of  the  validation 
phase are detailed in Section 3.1.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in this context is for image classification. Specifically, it is designed to classify underwater images into one of six environmental condition classes. This is evident from several statements throughout the text, such as "environmental condition classification models" and "classifying the videos into the six environmental condition classes." Additionally, the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the mention of a confusion matrix further support this conclusion, as these are common tools used in image classification tasks.
