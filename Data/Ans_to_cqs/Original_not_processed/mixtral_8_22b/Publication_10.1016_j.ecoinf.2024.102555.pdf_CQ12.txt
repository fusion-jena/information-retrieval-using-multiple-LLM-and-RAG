Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The paper titled "Verification of novel integrations of swarm intelligence algorithms into deep learning neural network for flood susceptibility mapping" discusses a methodology involving deep learning neural networks for flood susceptibility mapping. However, it does not explicitly mention which specific type of deep learning model was used in their pipeline, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot determine the exact type of deep learning model used in this particular research.
