2.1. Data filtering

environmental  data  to  ecological  processes  (Chave,  2013;  Pettorelli 
et al., 2014).

match environmental information with ground observations (e.g. wild-
life  movements),  other  ecological  processes  may  require  coarser  tem-
poral scales, hence more diluted temporal aggregation (e.g. ecosystem 
resilience). As for spatial scaling, a formula defines how data is tempo-
rally aggregated, namely by a mean, median, or standard deviation.
