in the basin, based on 180 resident species’ data. As species observation 
data,  we  use  data  from  a  public  authoritative  repository  of  big  data 
(GBIF)  improved  with  reliable  records  we  accurately  and  directly 
observed in the field.

The GBIF repository is a taxonomic and observation data provider 
involved in several data FAIRness initiatives (Lane and Edwards, 2007). 
Unlike other data providers, GBIF has a broad scope across taxonomic 
orders and kingdoms. It currently hosts ~2.5 billion observation data 
records at the global scale. An R package is available to automatise the 
retrieval  of  occurrence  records  containing  taxonomic,  coordinate, 
sighting authorship, and primary source information.

%Query
Query: "What is the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention or reference to a specific code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the use of data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) repository for building a robust distribution model for Architeuthis Dux, improving data quality, classifying climate change effects on marine species distributions, and modeling habitat suitability. Additionally, it mentions various research papers related to these topics but does not provide any direct links to a deep learning pipeline code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific code repository link for a deep learning pipeline based on the given context.
