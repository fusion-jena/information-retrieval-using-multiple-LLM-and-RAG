The challenge for applying deep learning to natural systems is the need for large training datasets.
A lack of training data is a pervasive problem in remote sensing due to the cost of data collection
and annotation [13]. In addition, the spatial extent of training data often prohibits the ﬁeld-based
veriﬁcation of annotated objects. For tree detection, the high variation in tree crown appearance, due
to taxonomy, health status, and human management, increases the risk of overﬁtting when using small
amounts of training data [10]. One approach to addressing the data limitation in deep learning is
“self-supervised learning” (sensus [14]), which uses unsupervised methods to generate training data
that is used to train supervised models [15]. This approach has recently been applied to remote sensing
for hyperspectral image classiﬁcation [9]. Self-supervision, which only relies on unlabeled data, can be

combined with labeled data in a semi-supervised framework (sensu [14]), which may improve deep
learning on limited training data by providing neural networks the opportunity to learn generalized
features on a wider array of training examples, followed by retraining on a smaller number of high
quality annotations [16]. It is unknown whether moderate to low quality annotations can be used
to generate trees for initial model training, given the imperfect nature of existing unsupervised tree
delimitation approaches.

REVIEW 3 of 13   Figure 1. A conceptual figure of the proposed semi-supervised pipeline. A Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR)-based unsupervised detection generates initial training data for a self-supervised (red, green, blue (RGB) deep learning model. The model is then retrained based on a small number of hand-annotated trees to create the full model. 2.1. Study Site and Field Data We used data from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) site at the San Joaquin Experimental Range in California to assess our proposed approach (Figure 2). The site contains an open woodland of live oak (Quercus agrifolia), blue oak (Quercus douglasii), and foothill pine (Pinus sabiniana) forest. The majority of the site is a single-story canopy with mixed understory of herbaceous vegetation.   Figure 2.

Helpful Answer:
The data repository for the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is stated that all the data are publicly available on the NEON Data Portal (<http://data.neonscience.org/>). Additionally, the paper mentions that all code for this project is available on GitHub (<https://github.com/weecology/DeepLidar>) and archived on Zenodo. Therefore, while there isn't a direct mention of where the dataset itself is stored, one could infer that the data might also be accessible through these platforms or directly linked within them.
