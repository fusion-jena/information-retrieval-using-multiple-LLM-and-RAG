bility—differences between recording devices. By reducing device bias, 
we enhance the applicability of these indices for broader comparative 
analyses, potentially extending their use to fields like machine learning 
and deep learning, which require consistent feature spaces across studies 
regardless of the recording device used (Purwins et al., 2019).

3.  Differences gains among recording devices: The signal amplitude of a 
microphone depends on the sound pressure that the microphone may 
capture. This depends on the manufacturing materials and its level of 
degradation.  Significant  differences  in  gain  are  expected  from  mi-
crophones of different brands or after severe outdoor use. 

2.3. Proposed preprocessing approach 

Fig. 2 shows the proposed preprocessing methodology to tackle the 

abovementioned issues. It consists of three steps:
