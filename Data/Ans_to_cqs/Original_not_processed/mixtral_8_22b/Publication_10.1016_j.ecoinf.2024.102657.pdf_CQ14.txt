2.2. Training 

Next, DialectDecoder trained the two classification networks based 
on the labeled training data. Each dialect class was split into a training 
set, a validation set, and a testing set by taking the first 70% of songs in 
the folder as the training set, the next 10% as the validation set, and the 
last 20% as the test set to reduce variability between tests. We note that 
while the validation set was used to tune the hyperparameters of the 
CNN, the only hyperparameter of the k-NN is the value of k, which we 
fixed as k = 4, as this value yielded the best performance after testing 
several values. Hence both the training and validation sets, totaling 80% 
of the full dataset, were used directly to fit the k-NN. Thus, we used 80% 
of the full data set to train and validate the CNN spectrogram classifier 
and to train the k-NN location classifier, and reserved 20% of the data set 
to test the two systemsâ€™ ability to classify songs correctly.

5. Conclusion 

Classifying bird songs has long been an arduous process, requiring 
large  amounts  of  time.  DialectDecoder  uses  the  power  of  machine 
learning and the anomaly identification abilities of humans to detect and

understand dialects in White-crowned Sparrow populations. Below, we 
outline each test and provide results for each one in Table 1.

Query: "How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text mentions that the validation set was used to tune the hyperparameters of the CNN. However, it does not specify the exact method used for optimization, such as grid search or random search. It also notes that the only hyperparameter of the k-NN is the value of k, which was fixed as k = 4 after testing several values. Therefore, while some form of hyperparameter tuning was performed, the specific optimization method used is not explicitly stated in the given context.
