leaf-based  plant  species  classification.  However,  medicinal  plants  are 
not the primary focus of this work, and also considered high-resolution 
images for classification tasks. In a recent study (Chulif et al., 2023), 
deep  learning  models  are  used  for  detecting  diseases  in  single  crop 
species by considering real-time field challenges during image acquisi-
tion.  In  a  different  work  (Barhate  et  al.,  2023),  VGG-16  and  dimen-
sionality reduction with ESPCA is adapted to classify thirty-two plant 
species  with  hyperparameter  tuned  and  batch  updated  stochastic 
gradient descent technique. Later, (Ganguly et al., 2022), utilized the 
ResNet-50  architecture  to  capture  the  leaf  feature  patterns  via  fusion 
learning  and  is  trained  on  three  benchmark  datasets  to  showcase  the 
effectiveness of the model. The aforementioned studies do not directly 
focus  on  the  classification  of  a  large  group  of  Indian  medicinal  plant

Additionally, the results are also supported by the work (Barr´e et al., 
2017) where an accuracy of 86.3% is achieved towards top five classes 
on  Leafsnap  dataset  using  Leafnet  deep  learning  model  that  employs 
convolution features. In a similar work, multi class disease classification 
with respect to six classes of plants comprising of twenty-seven diseases, 
a multi-layered convolutional network is proposed (Tiwari et al., 2021) 
and obtained about 99.09% accuracy.

Helpful Answer:
The papers mentioned in the given context primarily discuss various applications of deep learning in plant species identification and classification, including medicinal plants. While they provide valuable insights into the use of deep learning architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Global Average Pooling, ResNet-50, and VGG-16, there isn't explicit information regarding specific optimization techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam.

However, one paper does mention the application of a hyperparameter-tuned batch-updated stochastic gradient descent method for plant species identification (Barhate et al., 2023). This suggests that some form of SGD was employed in their deep learning pipeline. Unfortunately, without further details, it remains unclear whether other popular optimization methods like Adam were also explored or compared.

In conclusion, while the papers offer interesting perspectives on applying deep learning to plant species identification and classification, they lack comprehensive coverage of optimization techniques used within these pipelines. Further research may be required to fully understand which optimization strategies have been successfully implemented in this domain.
