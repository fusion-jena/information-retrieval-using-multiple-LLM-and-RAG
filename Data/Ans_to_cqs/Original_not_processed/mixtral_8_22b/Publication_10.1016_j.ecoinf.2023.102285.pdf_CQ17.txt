There  are  numerous  studies  in  the  literature  to  detect  underwater 
man-made  objects  (MMOs)  within  a  limited  region  of  interest  (RoI) 
using  underwater  imagery,  robots  or  sonography.  For  instance,  Abu 
et  al.  (Abu  and  Diamant,  2022)  proposes  a  contour-based  features 
analysis method to discern underwater MMOs from natural environment 
considering that contours of MMOs' are supposed to be smoother than 
natural objects. There are a limited number of studies in the literature to 
detect specific types of surface marine MMOs using supervised Machine 
Learning  (ML)  and  Deep  Learning  (DL)  approaches  that  require  prior 
training in the marine ecosystem. For instance, Han et al. (Han et al., 
2022) proposed a DL technique titled LCSE-ResNet to detect, classify and 
locate  vessels  and  oil  platforms  based  on  remote  optical  imagery,  by 
which all other MMOs are excluded. There are no studies in the litera-

2.3. Masking and dilation 

Two  masks  are  applied  on  the  image  acquired  from  the  dynamic 
thresholding  technique  on  H  and  S  channels  mentioned  above,  one 
of  which  is  for  detecting  the  blueish  part  and  the  other  one  is  for 
removing the unwanted background parts from the image. First mask 
(i.e.,((ImgR < 0.25&ImgG < 0.80&ImgB = 1)&(ImgR < (ImgB)&ImgG <
(ImgB) ) ))  makes  the  blueish  sections  visible  by  suppressing  all  other 
sections,  in  particular,  reddish  parts  that  dominantly  indicate  the 
background of sea as depicted in Figs. 11e, 12e, 13e, 14e, 15e and in our

Helpful Answer:
The references provided do not directly discuss the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, some common regularization techniques used in deep learning include Dropout, L1 Regularization, and L2 Regularization.

Dropout is a regularization technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to reduce overfitting. L1 Regularization adds an absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients as penalty term to the loss function, while L2 Regularization adds a squared magnitude of the coefficient as penalty term to the loss function. Both L1 and L2 Regularizations help to prevent overfitting by adding constraints to the model parameters. Other regularization techniques such as early stopping, weight decay, and batch normalization can also be used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines.
