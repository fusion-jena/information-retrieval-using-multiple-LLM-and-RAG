grams, and created the metadata .csv file necessary for training the CNN 
and k-NN. Identical in structure to the metadata file outlined above, this 
file contained the metadata for the training set as opposed to the met-
adata for the entire dataset. 

No additional preprocessing was applied to the spectrograms as the 
goal was to do the least amount of preprocessing possible in order to 
demonstrate  the  power  of  human-machine  teaming.  Further,  when 
assessing the accuracy of the CNN on noise-filtered data versus raw data, 
the accuracy levels were similar: after 10 trials, the CNN’s accuracy on 
the  filtered  data  averaged  to  99.22%  and  the  accuracy  on  the  non- 
filtered data averaged to 99.25%.

Additionally,  we  created  a  metadata  .csv  file  that  listed  all  of  the 
necessary classification information for training the CNN and k-NN . The 
.csv file had five columns. The first, dialect_folder, listed the file path to 
the folder containing the bird song. Each folder was labeled with the 
dialect type and the year it was collected, for example, “ABLA_2022”. 
Note, each folder name contained the label of the songs inside, as this

Next, DialectDecoder trained the two classification networks based 
on the labeled training data. Each dialect class was split into a training 
set, a validation set, and a testing set by taking the first 70% of songs in 
the folder as the training set, the next 10% as the validation set, and the 
last 20% as the test set to reduce variability between tests. We note that 
while the validation set was used to tune the hyperparameters of the 
CNN, the only hyperparameter of the k-NN is the value of k, which we 
fixed as k = 4, as this value yielded the best performance after testing 
several values. Hence both the training and validation sets, totaling 80% 
of the full dataset, were used directly to fit the k-NN. Thus, we used 80% 
of the full data set to train and validate the CNN spectrogram classifier 
and to train the k-NN location classifier, and reserved 20% of the data set 
to test the two systems’ ability to classify songs correctly.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning models, several measures were taken during the training process. Firstly, the dataset used for training consisted of diverse dialect types from different years, ensuring that the model could learn patterns applicable across various conditions. Secondly, the dataset was divided into three distinct subsets - training, validation, and testing sets. This division allowed for tuning the hyperparameters of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using the validation set while preventing overfitting or bias towards specific examples. Lastly, stratified splitting was employed to maintain a consistent distribution of dialect classes within each subset. By preserving the original proportions of dialect classes, the risk of imbalanced datasets affecting the model's performance was minimized. These steps collectively contributed to enhancing the robustness and reliability of the deep learning models.
