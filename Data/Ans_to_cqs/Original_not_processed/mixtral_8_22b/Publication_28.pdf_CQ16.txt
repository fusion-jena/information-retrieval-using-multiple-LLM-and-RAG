This  section  offers  a  brief  experimental  results  analysis  of  the 
PTDLEN-VAE model over the other techniques. Table 1 and Fig. 6 assess 
the  classification  outcomes  analysis  of  the  PTDLEN-VAE  model  with 
other techniques on the applied UCM dataset. On examining the results 
interms  of  precision,  the  experimental  results  showcased  that  the 
PTDLEN-VAE model has accomplished maximum average precision of 
96% whereas the DLEN-VAE, DLEN-DNN, and DLEN-LSTM techniques 
have  gained  a  minimum  average  precision  of  95.70%,  95.68%,  and 
95.49% respectively. Followed by, on investigative the outcomes with 
respect  to  recall,  the  experimental  outcomes  demonstrated  that  the 
PTDLEN-VAE  manner  has  accomplished  maximal  average  recall  of 
95.35% whereas the DLEN-VAE, DLEN-DNN, and DLEN-LSTM methods 
have reached a lesser average recall of 94.90%, 94.93%, and 94.73% 
correspondingly. Eventually, on exploratory the outcomes interms of F1-

VAE model includes a series of operations such as pre-processing, Effi-
cientNet based feature extraction, IKHO based parameter optimization, 
and VAE based classification. Besides, the IKHO algorithm is designed by 
the  integration  of  KH  algorithm  with  FS  operator  to  avoid  the  local 
optimal problem of the KH algorithm. In addition, the PTDLEN based 
feature extractor by the use of parameter tuned EfficientNet model using 
IKHO  algorithm  helps  to  enhance  the  prediction  outcome  of  the 
PTDLEN-VAE model for unseen data. For validating the improved per-
formance  of  the  PTDLEN-VAE  method,  an  extensive  experimental 
analysis  take  place  on  benchmark  aerial  image  dataset.  The resultant 
experimental  values  highlighted  the  supremacy  of  the  proposed 
PTDLEN-VAE model over the other techniques. In future, the presented 
PTDLEN-VAE  model  can  be  deployed  in  unmanned  aerial  vehicles

methods.  Along  with  that,  MLRSSC-CGNN-SGAT,  MLRSSC-CGNN- 
MLGAT, and AL-RCNN techniques have accomplished moderately closer 
outcomes.  In  line  with,  the  DLEN-LSTM,  DLEN-DNN,  and  DLEN-VAE 
techniques  have  resulted  in  competitive  outcome  interms  of  different 
measures.  However,  the  proposed  PTDLEN-VAE  model  has  obtained 
improved  performance  with  the  higher  precision  of  0.9600,  recall  of 
0.9535, F1-score of 0.9584, F2-score of 0.9567.

• The IKHO algorithm is designed by the integration of KH algorithm 
with free search (FS) operator to avoid the local optimal problem of 
the KH algorithm.  

• A  PTDLEN  based  feature  extractor  is  presented  by  the  use  of 
parameter  tuned  EfficientNet  model  using  IKHO  algorithm,  which 
aids to enhance the prediction outcome of the PTDLEN-VAE model 
for unseen data.  

• Validation  of  the  PTDLEN-VAE  model  takes  place  on  benchmark 
dataset  and  the  experimental  results  are  discussed  interms  of 
different aspects.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention any specific criteria used to determine when training is completed for the PTDLEN-VAE model or any other mentioned techniques. Therefore, without additional information, we cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, common practices in machine learning include monitoring metrics like validation loss, accuracy, or other relevant measures during training. Training may be considered complete when these metrics reach a satisfactory level or stop improving significantly, indicating convergence or overfitting.

In this case, since the context discusses various performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and F2-score, one might infer that similar metrics could also be monitored during training to decide when to stop training. Nonetheless, without explicit information about the stopping criterion used for the PTDLEN-VAE model, we cannot confirm this assumption.
