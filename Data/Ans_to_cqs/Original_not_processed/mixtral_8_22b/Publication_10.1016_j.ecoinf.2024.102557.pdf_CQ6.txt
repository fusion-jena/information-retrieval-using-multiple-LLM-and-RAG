The patterns found by random forest models are informative about 
the  relationships  between  species-specific  productivity  and  environ-
mental  conditions.  These  models  have  been  extensively  contrasted  to 
explain relationships between variables and estimate their importance 
(Gregorutti  et  al.,  2017),  and  used  in  different  fields  of  ecology,  for 
instance biomass quantification (Kaveh et al., 2023), species distribution 
modeling (Valavi et al., 2021) and genomic studies (Brieuc et al., 2018). 
Although machine learning models cannot explicitly detect proximate 
variables  that  reveal  the  causal  relationships  between  fungal  produc-
tivity and the sampled environment, they can be very helpful in disen-
tangling these complex relationships (Archer and Kimes, 2008). This is 
especially  helpful  in  Mediterranean  environments,  where  mushroom 
productivity is closely related to short-term weather conditions (Alday

resolution at the landscape scale. To achieve this, we use predictive models based on machine learning algo-
rithms and a fungal database resulting from the sampling of more than 100 permanent sampling plots over 20 
years. We estimate that current and future productivity patterns differ among species, under different climate 
change scenarios and bioclimatic regions. Our results suggest that optimal productivity areas may be shifted to 
higher  elevations,  making  those  species  with  higher  productivity  at  higher  elevations  the  most  affected  by 
climate change. This would mean that some species with high socioeconomic value, such as Lactarius deliciosus 
and Boletus edulis, could be negatively affected in their total productivity in the study area. This study highlights 
the need to anticipate the potential effects of climate change on fungal productivity and in particular on high

analytical  methods and  modeling tools  are needed to  deal with  these 
challenges (Tan et al., 2006). Over the past years, the field of artificial 
intelligence and machine learning has enabled significant advances in

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved to ensure the data is suitable for analysis. While the specific steps can vary depending on the nature of the dataset and the problem being addressed, common preprocessing techniques include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing or correcting any inconsistencies, errors, or missing values within the dataset. It might also involve handling outliers or dealing with categorical variables.

2. Normalization or Scaling: Deep learning algorithms often perform better when input features are scaled to similar ranges. Techniques like Min-Max scaling, which scales all features to a range between 0 and 1, or Z-score normalization, which standardizes features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, are commonly employed.

3. Feature Selection or Extraction: In many cases, not all available features contribute equally to the prediction task. Therefore, selecting relevant features or extracting new ones through dimensionality reduction techniques (like PCA) can improve model performance and reduce computational complexity.

4. Data Augmentation: For image datasets, augmentation techniques like rotation, flipping, zooming, etc., can help increase the size of the dataset and prevent overfitting.

5. Encoding Categorical Variables: Since neural networks work best with numerical inputs, it's necessary to convert categorical variables into numerical form using encoding schemes like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
