does not assume a specific distribution of the response variable, and is 
largely  computationally-efficient  in  GEE  (Belgiu  and  Dr˘agut¸,  2016; 
Breiman, 2001; Lary et al., 2016; Quintano et al., 2023; Roteta et al., 
2021). The default RF hyperparameters in the GEE implementation were 
preserved,  except  for  the  number  of  trees,  which  was  set  to  500  to 
improve  computational  efficiency  without  losing  precision  in  the  BA 
estimates as determined by recursive validation of the BA classification 
algorithm over independent wildfires (see Section 3.1). We calculated 
the mean decrease in the Gini Index (dGI) to assess RF variable impor-
tance on classification accuracy.
