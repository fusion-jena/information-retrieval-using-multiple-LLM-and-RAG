we break them down into smaller patches. Specifically, in the training 
stage,  we  randomly  crop  square  patches  (experimenting  with  various 
patch sizes, namely 256, 320, 480, 640, and 800 pixels), and we apply a 
simple  augmentation  strategy,  flipping  the  patches  horizontally  and 
vertically with a 50% probability. On the other hand, during the vali-
dation phase, we divide the images of the validation split into regularly- 
spaced,  overlapping  patches,  using  the  same  size  employed  during 
training.  We  process  these  patches  individually,  reconstructing  the 
overall  output  by  combining  the  predictions  from  the  patches,  and 
subsequently, we calculate metrics over the complete image. For clarity,

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it mentions some general practices related to data processing and preparation.

During the training stage, the authors experimented with various patch sizes (256, 320, 480, 640, and 800 pixels). They also applied a simple augmentation strategy, which involves flipping the patches horizontally and vertically with a 50% probability. This technique can help reduce potential biases caused by the orientation of objects within the images.

For the validation phase, they divided the images into regularly spaced, overlapping patches using the same size employed during training. These patches were processed individually, and the overall output was reconstructed by combining the predictions from the patches. The use of overlapping patches might contribute to reducing any potential spatial bias introduced by cropping the original images.

Although the context does not directly mention techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, the described methods could still indirectly mitigate certain types of data bias. Nonetheless, without further details regarding class distribution, sampling strategies, or data sources, it remains unclear whether these specific techniques have been implemented.
