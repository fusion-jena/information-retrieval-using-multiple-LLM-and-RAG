chosen to ensure that the training/testing dataset accurately represented

use of this approach was crucial in ensuring that the AGB maps gener-

parameters of our machine learning model. Specifically, we focused on 
tuning  several  critical  parameters,  namely  ‘numberOfTrees’,  ‘min-
LeafPopulation’, ‘bagFraction’, and ‘seed’. The ‘numberOfTrees’ repre-
sents the number of decision trees in the ensemble, and through the grid 
search, we explored different values to determine the ideal number of 
trees  that  balances  model  complexity  and  predictive  performance. 
Similarly, ‘minLeafPopulation’  refers to the minimum number of sam-
ples required to form a leaf node in each tree. We experimented with 
various values to find the optimal setting that prevents overfitting while 
capturing meaningful patterns in the data. The ‘bagFraction’  indicates 
the proportion of the training dataset used to train each individual tree, 
and  we  searched  for  the  best  value  to  enhance  model  diversity  and 
generalization. Lastly, ‘seed’  is a random number seed used to ensure

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of a specific sampling technique called stratified random sampling. This method was employed to capture the full distribution of AGB values within the LiDAR-derived AGB maps accurately. By randomly selecting half of the pixels for the training and testing split, they ensured that the training/testing dataset accurately represented the distribution of AGB values within the LiDAR-derived AGB maps. This approach aimed to prevent any potential bias caused by uneven representation of AGB values in the dataset. Although not explicitly mentioned, this could be considered a strategy to mitigate data bias during preprocessing. Other common techniques to address data bias include oversampling, undersampling, diverse data collection, and data augmentation. These techniques help balance classes or improve the generalizability of models when dealing with imbalanced datasets or limited data availability.
