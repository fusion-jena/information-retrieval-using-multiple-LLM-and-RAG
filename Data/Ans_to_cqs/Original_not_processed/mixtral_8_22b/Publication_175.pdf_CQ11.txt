a new task with a very limited dataset, usually only 1â€“5 thumbnails per 
class.

There are two ways to tackle this problem of lack of data. The first 
one  consists  of  directly  addressing  the  data  itself,  through  data 
augmentation (Van Dyk and Meng, 2012; Wang and Perez, 2017; Wong 
et al., 2016). The second option is to change the classification algorithm. 
Few-shots learning (FSL) algorithms (Fei-fei et al., 2006; Fink, 2005) are 
designed to compute a classification task (query, noted Q) with only a 
few  thumbnails  to  train  (Support  Sets,  noted  SS),  and  it  has  been 
increasingly studied since 2017 (Finn et al., 2017). Few-shots learning 
methods are divided into three main approaches. Metric-based methods 
are embedding both queries (Q) and support sets (Ss), before assigning to 
the query a class, according to distances computed between Q and Ss 
(Sung et al., 2018; Victor and Bruna, 2018; Yanbin et al., 2019). The 
second approach consists of 1) training a model on a large database, and

3. Results 

The  deep  ResNet  model  trained  on  the  large  AT0  dataset  (3458 
natural thumbnails in average per species) during the first experiment 
obtained a mean accuracy (i.e. percentage of correct classification) of 
78.00%  (standard  deviation  (SD)  of  15.16%)  on  T2  test-dataset 
(Table  2).  With  this  model,  accuracy  varied  among  species  between 
54.14% (Naso brevirostris) and 99.07% (Abudefduf vagiensis). The same
