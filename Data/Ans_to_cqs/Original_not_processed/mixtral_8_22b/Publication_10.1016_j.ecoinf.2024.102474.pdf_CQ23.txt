Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

4.3. The prediction task

In this work, we resorted to purely deterministic variants of these 

architectures.  The  models  were  implemented  using  the  deep  learning 
framework PyTorch Lightning (Falcon, 2019) which is built on top of 
PyTorch  (Paszke  et  al.,  2019)  and  enables  improved  scalability.  The 
hyperparameters were tuned using an Optuna-based (Akiba et al., 2019) 
hyperparameter optimization procedure.

constitute our decoder. Compared to the SGConvLSTM, the number of channels in the inner layers has been increased from 20 to 22. Moreover, the encoder outputs 
are now fed into the layers of the decoder. Thus, only the decoder has a 4-channel RGBI output in the final layer.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To measure the generalizability of their deep learning model, the authors calculate the Ensemble Score (ENS) on four separate test sets. These test sets are designed to evaluate different aspects of model generalizability. However, the specific methods used for creating diverse datasets or implementing techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting are not explicitly mentioned in the given context. Therefore, it can be assumed that the diversity of the dataset might have been ensured by using the EarthNet2021 Challenge data, which includes 23,904 training datacubes spread across Europe. Nonetheless, further details regarding the exact methods employed to guarantee the model's generalizability cannot be determined based solely on the provided information.
