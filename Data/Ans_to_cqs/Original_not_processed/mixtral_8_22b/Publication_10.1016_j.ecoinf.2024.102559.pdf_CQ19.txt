Accuracy metrics for models with entropy feature across window sizes  

Table A.5 
Accuracies and classification results into iceplant (positive class P) and other vegetation (negative class N) from models using spectral, NDVI, and date features together 
with entropy values of each spectral band and NDVI within a window, calculated across multiple window sizes. Accuracies are given in percentages.

%Query
Query: "Which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not explicitly mention which specific deep learning framework was used to build the model. However, one of the references cited is about scikit-learn, which is a popular machine learning library in Python. While it can be used for building deep learning models, it is more commonly associated with traditional machine learning algorithms such as support vector machines, decision trees, and random forests. Therefore, based on this reference alone, we cannot definitively determine if a deep learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch was used.
