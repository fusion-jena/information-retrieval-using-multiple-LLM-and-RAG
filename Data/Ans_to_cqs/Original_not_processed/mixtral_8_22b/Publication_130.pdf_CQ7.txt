Helpful Answer:
The text provides information about splitting the data into training and validation sets for a deep learning model. In this context, the authors aimed to use 1,000 images per bird for training and validation purposes. They allocated 900 images for the training dataset and 100 images for the validation dataset. The training dataset is used to teach the model how to recognize patterns and classify images correctly. On the other hand, the validation dataset serves as an independent set of samples used to compute the accuracy and loss (error estimation) of the model during training. The validation dataset helps determine whether the model is overfitting the training data and not learning essential features for accurate recognition. Additionally, the authors mention using a specific number of images for training and validation based on the species studied, such as needing 500 pictures for training data and 125 for validation for zebra finches.
