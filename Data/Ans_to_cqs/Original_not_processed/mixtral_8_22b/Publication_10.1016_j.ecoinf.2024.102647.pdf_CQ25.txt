Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

The performance of machine learning models was evaluated by four 
criteria:  coefficient  of  determination  (R2),  NSE  (Nash  and  Sutcliffe, 
1970), Kling–Gupta efficiency (KGE) (Gupta et al., 2009), and correla-
tion coefficient (COR) (Sardoei et al., 2024).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the deep learning model used is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm. However, the specific purpose or task of this CNN model is not explicitly stated in the provided information. Typically, CNNs are used for tasks such as image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and more. Without further details, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the exact purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the context.
