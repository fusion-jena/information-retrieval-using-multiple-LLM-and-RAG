Machine learning methods: Modeling net growth in the Atlantic Forest 
of Brazil

The objective of this study was to develop machine learning models 
capable of estimating the net growth in Atlantic Forest fragments based

on forest attributes, land use history, landscape, soil and climatic char-
acteristics. The questions we sought to answer were: (i) What are the 
most important variables to estimate net growth in these forests? (ii) Are 
the evaluated machine learning methods efficient for estimating the net 
growth at plot-level? and (iii) What is the best method to estimate the 
net growth at plot-level?

The trained ANN was the multilayer perceptron, also known as the 
multilayer perceptron (MLP), with a hidden layer. The range of neurons 
in  this  layer  was  defined  by  the  Fletcher-Gloss  method  (Silva  et  al., 
2010): 2 × n0.5 + n2 ≤ n1 ≤ 2 × n + 1; in which: n = number of network 
inputs; n1 = amount of neurons in the hidden layer; and n2 = number of 
neurons  in  the  output  layer.  The  activation  functions  tested  were

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, the performance of the machine learning models, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and Random Forests (RFs), was evaluated using several metrics such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), correlation coefficient (r), and Bias. These metrics help assess the quality of predictions made by the models. However, it should be noted that the specific evaluation metrics mentioned here are not typically associated with deep learning models but rather with regression tasks. For evaluating deep learning models, common metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for classification tasks, while mean squared error or mean absolute error can be used for regression tasks.
