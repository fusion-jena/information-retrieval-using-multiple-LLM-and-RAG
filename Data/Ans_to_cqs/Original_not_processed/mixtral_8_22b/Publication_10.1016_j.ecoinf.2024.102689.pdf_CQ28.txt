GPU  and  utilizes  CUDA  version  11.4.  Python  3.6  serves  as  the  pro-
gramming language, and Pytorch version 1.8.0 is used in conjunction 
with  the  virtual  environment  function  of  Anaconda3.  Optimization  is 
carried out using the Adam optimizer with a Momentum of 0.9 and a 
Batch size of 16. Images are processed at a resolution of 1024 × 1024, 
with an initial learning rate set at 0.001 and a minimum learning rate of 
0.0001. The descent mode is step, and training spans 300 epochs.

Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about which specific platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or any other platform was used based solely on this context.
