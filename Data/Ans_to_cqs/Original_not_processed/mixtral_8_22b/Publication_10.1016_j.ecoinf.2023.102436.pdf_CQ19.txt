thermal comfort, aesthetics, and cost, within the framework based on 
their specific design objectives. As the other steps remain unchanged, 
designers can directly apply the framework to conduct their assessments 
without any hassle.

%Query
Query: "Which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information about which framework is used to build the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot determine if they use TensorFlow, PyTorch, or another framework.
