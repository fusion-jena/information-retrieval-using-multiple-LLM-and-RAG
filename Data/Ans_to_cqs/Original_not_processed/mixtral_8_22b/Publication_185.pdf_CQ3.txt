Image  classification  on  the  CNN  architecture  known  as  AlexNet  was  proposed  by  Alex 
Krizhevsky and won the 2012 ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (Krizhevsky 
et al., 2012). There are eight layers in the network, containing five convolutional layers and three 
fully connected layers (Fig. 3). All feature extractors were initialized with white Gaussian noise 
and learned from data, and the resulting feature maps were passed through rectified linear units 
(ReLUs),  a  type  of  non-linearity  unit.  The  model  was  trained  using  stochastic  gradient  descent 
and  the  backpropagation  algorithm  included  in  Caffe  (Jia  et  al.,  2014),  with  the  learning  rate 
policy set to “step”. The learning rate set to 10-2 for all layers initially for the reason of accept the 
newly  defined  last  fully  connected  layer  set  to  10-2.  The  learning  rate  (lr)  was  decreased  by  a

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any specific mention or discussion about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, generally speaking, these techniques are commonly employed in various stages of the deep learning process, especially when dealing with tasks like object detection, semantic segmentation, or instance segmentation.

Bounding box annotation involves drawing a rectangle around each object in an image, specifying its location within the image. This technique is often used in object detection tasks where the goal is to identify the presence and location of certain objects within images.

Instance segmentation, on the other hand, goes beyond mere localization and aims to delineate the exact pixels belonging to each individual object in an image. It combines aspects of both object detection and semantic segmentation, providing more detailed information about the scene depicted in the image.

In summary, while the given context does not provide explicit details regarding the use of data annotation techniques in the deep learning pipeline, common methods include bounding box annotation and instance segmentation, depending on the specific task requirements.
