24.  Which features will you need for data preprocessing?  

• Data deduplication (Eliminating excessive copies of data)  
• Data  cleansing  (Removing  incorrect,  corrupted,  incomplete 

data)  

• Data transformation (Changing the structure or format of data)  
• Data compression (Modifying or converting the bits structure 

of data)  

• I do not know  
• Not applicable  
• Other  

25.  In data processing, which one do you choose?  

• Using well-labeled training data (Supervised)  
• Combining  labeled  with  unlabeled  training  data  (Semi- 

supervised)  

• Using unlabeled training data (Unsupervised)  
• I do not know  
• Not applicable  

26.  What kind of data analytics do you need?  

• To know what happen (Descriptive analytics)  
• To know how something happen (Diagnostic analytics)  
• To know what will happen (Predictive analytics) 
• To  know  what  should  be  done  if  something  happens  (Pre-

scriptive analytics)

3.2.2.5. Data processing. In data processing features (see Fig. 18), data 
preprocessing aims to prepare and facilitate data processing operations 
(Salma et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2021). The data is cleaned, transformed, 
or  compressed  to  be  ready  for  the  analysis  stage.  Data  cleansing  is  a 
mandatory  feature  in  data  preprocessing,  while  other  features  are 
optional  and  depend  on  the  needs  or  purposes  of  data  analytics. 
Furthermore, in an agricultural system, it is common to see various types 
of  analyzing  the  data,  such  as  descriptive,  diagnostic,  predictive,  or 
prescriptive analytics. Hence, the system uses advanced analytics tech-
niques,  namely  geospatial  analysis,  mathematical  model,  statistical 
analysis, deep learning, and machine learning, depending on analytics 
types or purposes and users’ needs. The machine learning method has its 
own types to analyze the data and specific tasks to generate the analytics

3.2.2.1. Data. Traditionally,  the  farmers  have  applied  handwritten 
notes to evaluate their farm operations. With the development of tech-
nology  in  modern  agriculture,  data  can  be  generated  from  several 
sources and has become a mandatory feature of the agricultural system 
(Fulton and Port, 2018). Salma et al. (Salma et al., 2017) explained that 
this  feature could describe data usage,  state, and  representation. In a 
smart farming system, there are several sub-features of the data feature, 
such as mobility, structure, and data input. Mobility of the data, which is 
batch and stream, can affect the system’s data analysis and processing 
operations  (Salma  et  al., 2017).  Therefore, this  sub-feature should  be 
considered while designing a smart system. The next sub-feature is the 
data structure. There are three types of data structures based on the data 
sources:  structured,  semi-structured,  and  unstructured.  This  feature

analysis techniques such as geospatial analysis, statistical-based models, 
mathematical  models,  deep  learning,  and  machine  learning  when 
designing the smart farming system.

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps may be required to ensure the quality and usability of the dataset. These steps include:

1. Data Cleansing: This involves removing any irrelevant, corrupt, or duplicate data points from the dataset. It also includes handling missing values by either filling them with appropriate values or dropping those records altogether.

2. Data Transformation: This step involves changing the structure or format of the data to suit the requirements of the deep learning algorithm. Common transformations include encoding categorical variables into numerical ones, normalizing or standardizing numerical columns, and reshaping the data matrix according to the network architecture.

3. Data Compression: Depending on the size of the dataset, it might be necessary to compress the data to reduce memory consumption and improve computational efficiency. Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can help achieve dimensionality reduction without losing significant information.

4. Data Augmentation: For image datasets, augmentation techniques like rotation, flipping, zooming, etc., can artificially increase the size of the dataset and introduce more variability, thereby improving the robustness of the trained model.

These preprocessing steps aim to enhance the overall performance of the deep learning model by ensuring that the input data is clean, consistent, and suitable for the chosen algorithm. However, the exact set of preprocessing steps required would vary depending on the nature and complexity of the dataset, as well as the specific requirements of the deep learning task at hand.
