Provide your answer as follows:

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The papers mentioned in the given context discuss various aspects of using unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) or drones for ecological studies, including bird species detection, population estimation, and conservation efforts. However, none of these sources directly address the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipelines employed in these studies.

That being said, it is common knowledge that popular optimization algorithms used in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp), and others. These optimization techniques help minimize the loss function during training by adjusting the model parameters iteratively.

For instance, Chalmers et al. (2021) use deep learning models for acoustic monitoring of animal biodiversity but do not explicitly mention which optimization technique they employ. Similarly, Corcoran et al. (2021) compare drone survey data with traditional ground-based surveys without discussing any specific optimization techniques used in their analysis.

Therefore, based on the information available from the given context, we cannot definitively state which optimization techniques were applied in the deep learning pipelines discussed in these papers. Further investigation into each study would be required to determine this information accurately.
