Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Regularization is a technique used in machine learning and deep learning models to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function during training. In the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific regularization techniques used for preventing overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, some commonly used regularization methods include Dropout and L2 Regularization.

Dropout is a regularization method where randomly selected neurons are ignored or "dropped out" during training, which helps reduce interdependent learning among neurons. This results in a more robust model with better generalization capabilities. The rate of dropout can be adjusted based on the complexity of the problem and the size of the dataset.

L2 Regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the magnitude of all weights in the network to the loss function. By doing so, it encourages smaller weights and prevents any single weight from becoming too large, thus reducing overfitting. The strength of this regularization can be controlled using a hyperparameter called the regularization parameter.

In summary, while the given context does not explicitly state the use of regularization methods such as Dropout or L2 Regularization, these are common techniques employed in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting.
