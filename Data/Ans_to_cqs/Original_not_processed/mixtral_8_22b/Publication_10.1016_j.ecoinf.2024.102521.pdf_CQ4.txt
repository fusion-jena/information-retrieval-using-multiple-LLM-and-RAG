Similar considerations slowed the development of other data-intensive 
fields.  The  solution  lies  in  regulation,  either  by  top  journals  that 
consider  data  sharing  as  a  publication  requirement,  or  by  funding 
agencies wishing to maximize the impact of their investment (Michener, 
2015). STARdbi will urge its users to make their data as open as possible. 
We start by raising this issue here.

2. Materials and methods 

2.1. General 

The  STARdbi  website  and  database  is  hosted  on  a  server  at  Ben 
Gurion University, Israel. It is accessible through the URL https://star 
dbi.cs.bgu.ac.il/home/welcome. All code, both back and front ends, is 
available  at  https://gitlab.com/stardbi.  STARdbi’s  unit  of  data  man-
agement is a field survey performed by a research team, which produces 
images of sticky traps according to some scientific plan. Currently all our 
users are also data contributors. The service that we provide to these 
users  is,  to  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  unique.  We  look  forward  to 
working  with  users  that  perform  larger-scale  cross-survey  projects  as 
well. Below, we describe the pipeline in a top-down fashion, from the 
unique user’s pipeline to the underlying computational infrastructure, 
which is based on established technology. 

2.2. The Pipeline

is training and storing models using an interface provided by the site and 
its computational resources.

2.2. The Pipeline 

The STARdbi pipeline (Fig. 1A) includes: (a) sampling flying insects 
with sticky traps, and covering them with transparent acetate sheets; (b) 
high  resolution  scanning  of  the  traps  with  an  office  scanner;  (c) 
uploading the scanned images and their metadata (time of placement 
and removal, location, scanning resolution, etc.) to the STARdbi data-
base, using its web interface; and (d) automatic detection of insects in 
the images and storage of their position in the database. Once stored and 
processed, the images as well as bounding boxes around the detected

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, scaling, or others used in the deep learning pipeline for STARdbi. However, it can be inferred that since the system uses machine learning algorithms for detecting insects in the uploaded images, it might employ various data augmentation techniques to improve model performance and generalization. These could include image transformations like horizontal or vertical flips, rotations, zooming, cropping, brightness adjustments, and more. Nevertheless, without further information regarding the exact implementation details of the deep learning pipeline, it cannot be confirmed what specific data augmentation techniques are being utilized.
