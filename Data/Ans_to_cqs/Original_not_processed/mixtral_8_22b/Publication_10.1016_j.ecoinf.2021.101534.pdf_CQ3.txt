whole image. Thus, it may minimize the dilution effect and reduce the 
required amount of training data.

Data  augmentation  is  another  powerful  method  to  overcome  the 
problem of limited data and improve model performance (Shorten and 
Khoshgoftaar, 2019). Data augmentation can increase the variability of 
audio  data  in  a  training  dataset  by  transforming  the  data,  such  as 
changing  the  frequency,  pitch,  and  volume  of  audio  signals,  shifting, 
rotating  and  zooming  in  the  time  and/or  frequency  domains  of  spec-
trograms, and adding additional noise (Dai et al., 2021; Ferreira et al., 
2020; Kahl et al., 2021; Lasseck, 2019; Nanni et al., 2020b; Ruff et al., 
2021). Since the augmented dataset can better represent the real-world 
data  than  the  original  dataset,  this  approach  can  improve  the  model 
performance trained with a small dataset (Nanni et al., 2020b; Xie et al., 
2019). However, previous studies show that this approach works well 
only  on  relatively  clean  recordings,  not  soundscape  recordings  (Kahl

The mixed audio clips are then converted into spectrograms as input 
images for model training. The clips are transformed by applying the 
short-time Fourier transform (STFT) with a window size of 1600 sam-
ples,  hop  size  of  400  samples  (75%  overlap),  and  240  mel-scale  fre-
quency bins.  Each spectrogram thus  has a height  of 438 pixels  and a 
width of 436 pixels (Appendix S1: Fig. S4a).

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific data annotation techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, the text does discuss some aspects related to data preparation and processing for a deep learning pipeline.

For instance, the process involves converting mixed audio clips into spectrograms using short-time Fourier transform (STFT) with specified parameters. These spectrograms serve as input images for model training. This suggests that the authors might be using image-based data representation for their deep learning models.

Moreover, the context mentions the application of data augmentation methods to enhance the variability of audio data. Techniques such as changing the frequency, pitch, and volume of audio signals, shifting, rotating, and zooming in the time and/or frequency domains of spectrograms, and adding additional noise are employed. These practices aim to create a more robust and diverse dataset, which could potentially lead to improved model performance when dealing with smaller datasets.

However, without further information about the specific tasks involved in the deep learning pipeline, it is challenging to pinpoint exact data annotation techniques. For instance, if the task were object detection within the spectrogram images, bounding box annotations would likely be relevant. Similarly, if the goal was to identify individual instances of certain sounds, instance segmentation might come into play. But since these details aren't explicitly mentioned in the provided context, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
