Annotating  dataset  images  is  one  of  the  most  tedious  and  time- 
consuming  parts  of  the  modelling  process.  The  size  of  the  dataset  is 
important - a large dataset is needed for model success but it takes a lot 
more time to label. In order to prepare a larger dataset to generalize the 
model for the Greenland data, the model was partially trained to learn 
the data first and then the model itself was used to annotate new data 
before training it further.  The new  dataset annotated by the  partially 
trained model contains 540 training images and 141 validation images. 
The  self-annotation  dataset  was  manually  checked  and  edited  by  a 
human. As a result, a large dataset can be prepared within a day. Since 
the  image  quality  taken  from  the  portable  microscope  in  Kenya  was 
much lower compared to the other two, a small dataset that only con-
tained images from Kenya was used to fine tune the model for this data.

potential of deep learning algorithms in bacterial image recognition of 
environmental samples using these datasets and provide guidelines for 
dataset preparation and training. With the increasing user-friendliness 
of  deep  learning  for  biology  groups  without  much  AI  experience,  we 
found that image annotation equivalent to a few weeks’ work can pro-
vide satisfactory information on bacterial populations within the chips. 
This method is expected to be useful for environmental microbiological 
research  and  analysis  using  imaging  methods,  particularly  on  micro-
fluidic  platforms,  where  the  combination  of  controlled  experimental 
manipulations  and  monitoring  of  processes  with  high  environmental 
realism,  including  chemo-physical  conditions  and  biotic  interactions, 
presents significant potential.

microbe in a soil-analogue environment gained from such methods is

living organisms are as important as the commonly used cell biochem-
ical  constituents.  Enormous  efforts  have  been  done  to  promote  deep

different conditions, allows quantifying bacterial populations, and de-

whereas image analysis-based methods have now been widely adopted 
due to their efficiency and accuracy (Gupta et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 
2021).  The  deep  learning  model  successfully  segments  and  classifies 
various objects at satisfying accuracy. AI-aided soil chip analysis does 
not only allow to study abundance and biodiversity measures following 
local treatments or large biogeographic variations, but even to investi-
gate direct interactions of microbes with each other, or with additives to 
the ecosystem, such as biochar or toxins that can be added into the chips. 
The  approach  can  be  extended  to  other  microbial  groups  including

In the given context, the authors discuss the use of deep learning algorithms for bacterial image recognition in environmental samples. They mention that annotating dataset images is a crucial yet time-consuming part of the modeling process. To overcome this challenge, they employed a semi-automatic annotation technique. Initially, the model was partially trained to understand the data, after which it was utilized to annotate new data before proceeding with further training. This self-annotated dataset consisted of 540 training images and 141 validation images. It was subsequently reviewed and corrected by humans. By leveraging this method, a substantial dataset could be generated within a single day. Furthermore, due to the poorer image quality obtained from the portable microscope in Kenya, a smaller dataset containing solely Kenyan images was employed to refine the model for this specific data. However, the text does not explicitly state the exact data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Nonetheless, based on common practices in computer vision tasks like object detection and semantic segmentation, it can be inferred that similar techniques might have been applied here as well.
