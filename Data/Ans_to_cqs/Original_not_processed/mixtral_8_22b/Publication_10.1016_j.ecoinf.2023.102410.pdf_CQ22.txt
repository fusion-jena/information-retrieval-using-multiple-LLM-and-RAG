Query: "What metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The table presented in the given context does not provide information on any specific evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of a deep learning model such as accuracy, precision, or recall. Instead, it shows the number and percentage of tracks containing different song variants or patterns, which could potentially be used as input features for training a deep learning model. However, without further context regarding the development and application of a deep learning model, we cannot determine what specific evaluation metrics were employed.
