To extract the input information, the SRC3 block employs a parallel 
analysis  of  the  input  feature  map  using  two  convolution  kernels.  In 
contrast to the C3 block, the SRC3 block incorporates two convolution 
kernels prior to the input of the bottleneck block. One of the kernels is 
responsible  for  halving  the  dimension  of  the  feature  map,  while  the 
other  maintains  the  dimension  unchanged.  This  approach  allows  for 
more  comprehensive  processing  of  the  input  features,  enabling  the 
model  to  capture  both  high-level  semantic  information  and  preserve 
relevant details during the feature extraction process. The convolution 
kernel size utilized is 3 × 3, which leads to a broader receptive field of 
information and richer characteristics compared to the 1 × 1 convolu-
tion kernel. The output semantic information can be augmented by the 
action of two convolution kernels. The information output from the first

specific steps are outlined: 

Step 1: Select appropriate water downloading gear and sensors for 
data collection. Pre-processing of the acquired data, such as denoising, 
image enhancement, and correction. In order to train and evaluate un-
derwater target detection models, the dataset needs to be labeled. Then 
separate underwater images collected from the underwater environment 
into training and test images. 

Step 2: Prepare hardware servers capable of training deep learning 
models to deploy the YWnet network. This allows learning weights to 
recognize  underwater  organisms.  Tune  the  hyperparameters  of  the 
model such as learning rate, batch size and network depth to achieve the 
best performance of the model.

3.1.1. Adding the attention module 

Through the attention mechanism, the network may better learn the 
correlation between data and enhance the overall model's performance. 
In this work, CBAM is embedded in the backbone network of YWnet to 
improve the feature extraction of underwater detection information. As 
illustrated in Fig. 2, CBAM is a lightweight, commonly used attention 
mechanism that combines spatial and channel attention. Given an in-
termediate feature map F ∈ RC×H×W as input, CBAM sequentially infers a 
1D channel attention map Mc ∈ RC×1×1  and a 2D spatial attention map 

Ms ∈ R1×H×W. The calculation formula is: 

F' = Mc(F) ⊗ F.

F'' = Ms(F') ⊗ F'.

By weighting spatial elements, spatial attention concentrates on the 
location of the target in the images and gathers specific spatial details of 
each space. As shown in Fig. 4, the output results of the CAM block are 
operated by the max pooling layer and average pooling layer to obtain 
two  1 × H × Wfeature  maps,  and  then  the  two  feature  maps  are 
concatenated, and the feature map is changed by a convolution kernel of 
7 × 7.  The  final  module  output  is  obtained  by  a  sigmoid  activation 
function. The mathematical expression is as follows:

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the given context is not explicitly stated. However, based on the available information, it can be inferred that the model is designed for object detection tasks, specifically for detecting underwater targets or organisms. This is evident from the use of the YWnet network, which is likely a customized version of a popular neural network architecture tailored for underwater image analysis. Additionally, the inclusion of the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) further supports this assumption, as it enhances the feature extraction capabilities of the model, making it more suitable for object detection tasks.
