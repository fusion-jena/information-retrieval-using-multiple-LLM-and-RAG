18. Select Mining Pixels Above 3 pixel sizes (PROCESS) - In order to remove the influence of isolated, small, misclassified pixels (that are usually 
1–2 pixels in size), the minimum size of a mine for this step of the model was deemed as 3 pixels in size (or > 2700 m2 in a Landsat Image). It is a 
common occurrence in LULC classification maps, especially those done on a large scale, to contain isolated, misclassified individual pixels. Therefore, 
only mines above 2700 m2 were selected, removing the influence of small, misclassified pixels on the reclassification of water bodies to ensure the 
most accurate result could be achieved.

boundary of the subarea is considered a barrier. 

The effective mesh size was calculated considering all fragmenting 
elements in the study area combined, and then was re-calculated with 
mining areas excluded as fragmenting elements. The influence of mining 
on the effective mesh size was then directly determined by calculating 
the difference between the two values.

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit information about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model used in the research. However, it can be inferred that the researchers might have employed techniques such as using diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to improve the model's performance and generalization capabilities. These methods are commonly used in machine learning and deep learning applications to prevent overfitting and enhance the model's ability to perform well on unseen data. Nevertheless, without further details regarding the methodology used in developing the deep learning model, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
