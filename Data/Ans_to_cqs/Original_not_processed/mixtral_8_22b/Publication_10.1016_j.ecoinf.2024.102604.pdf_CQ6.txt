on environmental covariates. Essentially, the sampling bias caused by 
the environment (variables) is presented by mapping the environmental 
space to the geographic space. Therefore, this study proposes that cor-
recting sampling bias in environmental spaces is beneficial yet requires 
further testing (El-Gabbas and Dormann, 2018). 

4.3. Method effectiveness

1. Introduction

2.4.3. Model evaluation 

Two indicators were used to evaluate the effectiveness of each model 
in correcting the sampling bias. The area under the receiver operating

gesting  potential  improvements  over  geographic  filtering  limitations 
(Castellanos  et  al.,  2019).  However,  due  to  the  neglect  of  repeated 
presence  points  under  similar  environmental  conditions,  the  environ-
mental  variability  in  species  distribution  may  often  become  overly 
simplified  (Moudrý,  2015).  The  representativeness-oriented  method 
assigns  weights  to  presence  points  during  model  training  based  on 
assessing the representativeness of the underlying sampling effort. This 
approach addresses the issue of uneven sampling effort by emphasizing 
(i.e.,  assigning  a  larger  weight  to)  presence  samples  in  areas  where 
sampling  effort  is  relatively  insufficient.  However,  representativeness 
was assessed by comparing the distribution of environmental conditions 
at  the  sampling  or  observation  locations  with  the  entire  study  area. 
Implementing this method becomes challenging when the available data

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be taken to improve its performance. These include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing any irrelevant, redundant, or incorrect information from the dataset. It also includes handling missing values if present.

2. Normalization/Standardization: This step scales numerical input variables so they have zero mean and unit variance. This is done because many machine learning algorithms perform better when numerical input variables are scaled to a standard range.

3. Feature Scaling: This process rescales the values of features to fit into a small specified range like -1 to 1 or 0 to 1. This is important for optimization algorithms such as gradient descent which are used within neural networks.

4. Encoding Categorical Variables: Deep learning models cannot handle categorical data directly. So, we need to convert these categorical variables into numbers using techniques like label encoding, one hot encoding etc.

5. Splitting Dataset: Before feeding our data into the model, it’s common practice to split the dataset into three parts: Training set, validation set, and test set. This helps us understand how well our model generalizes to unseen data.

6. Data Augmentation: In some cases, particularly with image data, we might not have enough data to train our model effectively. To overcome this problem, we can use various techniques to augment our existing data. For example, flipping images horizontally or vertically, rotating them slightly, zooming in or out, etc.
