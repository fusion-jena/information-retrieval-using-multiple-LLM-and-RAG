2. Public weed dataset survey 

Weed datasets were surveyed based on a systematic search in major 
databases including Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, IEEE 
Xplore, and arXiv. The search keywords included “weed dataset”, “weed 
database”,  “agriculture”,  “machine  vision”  and  “computer  vision”. 
Particularly,  to  facilitate searching  via  Google  Scholar,  the  Python  li-
brary “scholarly”3  was employed to automatically retrieve publication 
records. A total of 451 records were collected from the literature search,

%Query
Query: "What strategies are employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., random seed value)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The papers mentioned do not directly address strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some common practices used by researchers include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility or using techniques like ensemble methods, cross-validation, and bootstrapping to account for variability caused by random initialization or data shuffling. These approaches help improve model performance and robustness when dealing with randomness in the training process.
