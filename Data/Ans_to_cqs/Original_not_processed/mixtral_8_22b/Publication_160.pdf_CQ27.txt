(Table 3, ResNet50–128 and ResNet18–128) performed roughly equally
on validation and test sets, with ResNet18–128 achieving a micro-F1 of
63.44 and ResNet50 63.89 on the test set. However, an epoch for the
ResNet50 took about three times longer than ResNet18. The ResNet50
did not outperform the previously trained ResNet18 with patch size 128
and batch size 512 (see Table 2). The deeper architecture of the Re-
sNet50 made it impossible to train with a batch size of 512.

were independently trained on the four patch sizes. The ensemble was
then fine-tuned: we used a batch size of 128, froze the weights from the
