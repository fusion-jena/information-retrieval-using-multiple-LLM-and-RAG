The  implemented  CNN  corresponded  to  a  modified  version  of 
ResNet50, one of the dominant architectures in bioacoustic tasks, and, 
although other authors have applied previous ImageNet training to the 
bioacoustic  domain  (LeBien  et  al.,  2020;  Zhong  et  al.,  2021),  other 
datasets such as Audio Set (Gemmeke et al., 2017) or VGG-Sound (Chen 
et al., 2020) can be just as good as ImageNet for pre-training, either on 
ResNet or on other architectures, such as VGGish, Inception or Mobile-
Net. Another viable option is to pretrain with synthetic clicks or chirps 
(Glotin  et  al.,  2017;  Yang  et  al.,  2021).  Models  already  available  in 
mobile  apps  that  perform  this  same  spectrogram-based  identification 
task are advancing rapidly. To date (October 2022), the BirdNet appli-
cation (Kahl et al., 2021) allows for the identification of more than 3000 
bird species (Wood et al., 2022). In the short term, this particular model

We applied the transfer learning and fine-tuning technique with the 
deep learning model ResNet50 (He et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2018), which 
was already pre-trained on ImageNet data (Deng et al., 2009). Transfer 
learning is a technique that enabled us to overcome the issue of shortage 
of  training  data  and  construct  a  model  efficiently  by  transferring 
knowledge  from  a  similar  task  to,  in  this  case,  our  target  task.  The 
implemented  architecture  received  RGB  images  of  224×224×3  as 
inputs—in this case, color spectrograms of two-second durations—and 
included  only  the  feature  extraction  layers  from  the  ResNet50,  dis-
carding the superior classification layers (known as the top network). 
The newly created model reconfigured the top network with two fully 
connected  layers  (FC)  that  could  learn  new  features.  To  reduce  over-
fitting and imitate the training of a set of different models, a dropout

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, there are several datasets mentioned that were used in the deep learning pipeline. One of them is ImageNet, which was used to pre-train the ResNet50 model. ImageNet is a dataset containing millions of labeled images belonging to thousands of categories. It has been widely used for image recognition tasks and has played a significant role in the development of deep learning algorithms.

Apart from ImageNet, another dataset mentioned is AudioSet, which contains over 2 million human-labeled 10-second audio clips extracted from YouTube videos. This dataset covers a wide range of sounds, including animal noises, musical instruments, and environmental sounds. Similarly, VGG-Sound is also mentioned, which is a collection of 200,000 video clips covering various types of sounds. These datasets can be useful for pre-training deep learning models for audio recognition tasks.

Additionally, some studies have used synthetic clicks or chirps generated by Glotin et al. (2017) and Yang et al. (2021) for pre-training deep learning models. However, it is not explicitly stated whether these datasets were used in the current study.

Overall, the context suggests that multiple datasets can be used for pre-training deep learning models, depending on the specific application and requirements. While ImageNet is commonly used for image recognition tasks, datasets like AudioSet and VGG-Sound may be more suitable for audio recognition tasks.
