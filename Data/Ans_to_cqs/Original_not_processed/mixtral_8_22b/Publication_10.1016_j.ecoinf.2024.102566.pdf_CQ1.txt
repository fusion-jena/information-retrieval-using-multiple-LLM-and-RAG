field-collected data and machine learning methods on developing AGB 
models.  Moreover,  the  quality  of  training  samples  and  the  layout  of 
sampling  points  are  crucial  for  constructing  accurate  and  reliable 
models for biomass estimation (Morais et al., 2021). In this study, owing 
to  the  insufficiency  of  high-quality  training  samples,  we  employed  a 
method with low data dependency that integrates forest inventory data 
with remote sensing imagery for biomass estimation.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the context that field-collected data is one method used for gathering raw data. Additionally, the use of remote sensing imagery suggests that sensors or satellite data may also be utilized for data collection. Furthermore, references to forest inventory data indicate that survey data might be another source of raw data. Public datasets are not explicitly mentioned but could potentially be included in the data sources.
