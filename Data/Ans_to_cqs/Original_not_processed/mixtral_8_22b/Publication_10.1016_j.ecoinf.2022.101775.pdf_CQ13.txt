Consequently, the unknown parameters bs, bt, ps, qt can be estimated 
optimizing  the  regularized  cost  function  using  stochastic  gradient 
descent:

2.2. Embedding layers 

(5)  

Embedding  layers  are  modules  of  deep  neural  networks  that  are 
generally  implemented  in  natural  language  processing  problems 
(Sharma  et  al.,  2020)  and  collaborative  filtering  (He  et  al.,  2017) 
because they can solve the one-hot encoding problem (Yu et al., 2022), 
where the latent representations in the classic models are composed of 
sparse representations generally using vectors mainly composed of zero 
layers  replace  such  dispersed  vectors  with 
values.  Embedding

where W denotes the matrix of weights in each layer; bi, the bias vector; 
g(.),  the  sigmoid  activation  function;  Θ(j),  the  hyperparameters  of  the 
network, i.e., Θ(j) = {W(j), bi
(j)), j = 1, 2, . . , h +
1; and h, the number of hidden layers in the network.

Lastly, according to (Fan and Cheng, 2018), the model presented in 
Eq.(13) is finally known as DMF. In this case, it will be called DMF1 and 
used to reconstruct the non-observed representations n in matrix M. 

2.4. Variations of the proposed DMF model 

This  section  presents  the  design  of  three  DMF  models  that  can 
complement the DMF1 model (see Fig. 2) by including spatial-temporal 
features,  which  vary  the  dimension  d  of  the  embedding  layers  in 
accordance with the information to be represented. In this sense, the aim 
of this proposal is to consolidate an approach to reconstruct signals that

We  trained  algorithms  with  the  amount  of  data  available  after 
manually  removing  the  testing  set,  as  described  above.  During  the 
training, 10% of data served as the validation set to check for overfitting. 
We used a min-max scaler reverted at the end to compute the perfor-
mance metrics in the test set. In all cases, we used a batch size of 64 
samples and trained the algorithm during 100 epochs using Adam as the 
algorithm  to  optimize  the  network  parameters.  Algorithms  were 
implemented in Pytorch (Paszke et al., n.d.) and models were trained 
and tested in Google Colaboratory.2

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide explicit details about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. However, it mentions that the model uses stochastic gradient descent for optimization and that the Adam algorithm was used to optimize the network parameters during training. Additionally, the text states that the model has a batch size of 64 samples and was trained for 100 epochs. These are examples of hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
