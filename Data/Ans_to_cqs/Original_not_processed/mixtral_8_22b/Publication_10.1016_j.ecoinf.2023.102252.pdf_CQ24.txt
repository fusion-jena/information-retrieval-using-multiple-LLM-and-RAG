FERM was calibrated on daily timestep LAI outputs taken from the 
WAVES  water  and  energy  balance  model  for  Eucalyptus  largiflorens 
(Black Box) from 1949 to 2018 at three grid cells at different distances 
from the river. The Shuffle Complex Evolution method was used to fit 
parameters  by  maximizing  the  Nash-Sutcliffe  Efficiency  (NSE)  as  the 
objective function. An NSE of 1 indicates that the model has fit the given 
data exactly and a value <0 indicates the model performs worse than 
using  the  sample  mean  as  a  predictor.  Minimizing  the  Root  Mean 
Squared Error  (RMSE) as the  objective function  can be used and  will 
return  comparable  results  to  NSE  as  both  are  based  on  the  sum  of 
squared  residuals.  Importantly,  when  using  RMSE  as  the  objective 
function  and as a  metric to evaluate model performance, the statistic 
must be viewed in the context of the magnitude of model outputs. Since

Helpful Answer:
To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, several strategies can be employed. One common approach is to use fixed random seeds across multiple runs or experiments. This ensures that any observed differences between models are due to changes in the model architecture, hyperparameters, or training data rather than random initialization. Another strategy is to perform multiple runs with different random seeds and report average performance metrics along with their standard deviations. This helps quantify the variability introduced by randomness and provides a more robust estimate of model performance. Additionally, techniques such as batch normalization and dropout can help reduce overfitting and improve generalization by introducing controlled noise into the network during training. Finally, it's important to note that some degree of randomness may actually benefit certain aspects of deep learning, such as exploration in reinforcement learning or optimization algorithms like stochastic gradient descent. In these cases, carefully tuning the amount of randomness can lead to improved performance.
