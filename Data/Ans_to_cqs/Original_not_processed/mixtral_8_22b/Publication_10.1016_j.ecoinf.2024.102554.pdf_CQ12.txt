Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

The  landscape  of  aquatic  environmental  monitoring  has  been 
notably transformed by recent technological advancements, particularly 
through the integration of machine learning (ML) methodologies with 
satellite data interpretation. Pioneering studies by (Cao et al., 2020; Kim 
et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2008) have marked a significant leap in refining 
the  precision  of  satellite-derived  analytical  processes,  particularly  for 
the estimation of Chl-a concentrations. Notably, (Binh et al., 2022) have 
spearheaded  the  development of  sophisticated algorithms  tailored for 
atmospheric  correction,  optimized  for  application  with  data  from  the 
Sentinel-3 satellite. Their research has yielded algorithms that demon-
strate marked efficacy in the nuanced analysis of Chl-a concentrations 
within the optically complex waters of shallow lakes.

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide information on the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It mentions the use of machine learning (ML) methodologies with satellite data interpretation but does not specify whether it uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Transformers, or any other deep learning models. Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot determine what type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline.
