By determining which variables are most important we can simplify
the analysis of a dataset, better understand the physical concepts of it,
and exclude the ones that confuse the model achieving better accuracy
and learning/testing speed.

There exist several ways to determine variable importance, e.g.
Decision Trees, Random Forests, Chi-square, and Regression. We deal
with tree-based variable importance, like (Arthur et al., 2010) did. It

3.2. Machine learning algorithms

There exist many supervised machine learning algorithms in lit-
erature, distinguished into several categories, such as Generalized
Linear Models (GLM), Decision Trees (DT), Instance Based (IB), Support

One of the most popular machine learning methods for classiﬁcation
of linear problems are Support Vector Machines (SVMs) (Cherkassky,
1997) with a linear kernel. They try to ﬁnd a set of hyperplanes that

separate the space into areas representing classes. These hyperplanes
are chosen in a way which maximizes the distance from the nearest data
point of each class. The Linear SVC is the simplest and fastest SVM
algorithm assuming a linear separation between classes.

explicit or expanded database is being used.

3.2.5. K-nearest neighbors

It is an non-parametric ‘lazy’ learning algorithm. This means that it
does not make any assumptions on the underlying data distribution and
that it does not use the training data points to do any generalization. It
does not attempt to construct a general internal model, but simply
stores instances of the training data. Classiﬁcation is computed from a
simple majority vote of the nearest neighbors of each point: a query
point is assigned the data class which has the most representatives
within the nearest neighbors of the point.

3.2.6. Decision tree

The Decision Tree Classiﬁer is a simple and widely used classiﬁca-
tion technique. It applies a straightforward idea to solve the classiﬁ-
cation problem by posing a series of carefully crafted questions about
the attributes of the test record. Each time it receives an answer, a
follow-up question is asked until a conclusion about the class label of
the record is reached.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there is no mention of using a specific deep learning model such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers in the pipeline. Instead, the text discusses various traditional machine learning techniques including Support Vector Machines (SVMs), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Trees. Therefore, based on this information alone, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the usage of a particular deep learning model in the pipeline.
