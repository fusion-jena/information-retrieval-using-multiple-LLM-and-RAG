2.3.4. RandomForest (bagging) 

We performed a RandomForest analysis using 200 trees and balanced 
weights. Similar to CART Ensembles and Bagger, RandomForest belongs 
to the tree algorithm family, but then is enhanced via ‘bagging’ (Brei-
man, 2001). Prior studies have shown RandomForest to be a superior 
choice  for  predictive  accuracy  in  classification  problems  (Mi  et  al., 
2017) and inference (Breiman, 2001).

Helpful Answer:
The article does not provide specific details about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions several techniques related to machine learning ensembles and predictive modeling. These include Random Forest, CART, MARS regression splines, and bagging. While these methods do not directly address data bias, they contribute to improving prediction accuracy and reducing overfitting. To specifically tackle data bias, common techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection could be employed. Stratified splitting ensures equal representation of classes in training and testing datasets. Oversampling increases the frequency of minority classes, while undersampling reduces the majority classes. Lastly, collecting diverse data helps ensure that the dataset represents all possible scenarios accurately.
