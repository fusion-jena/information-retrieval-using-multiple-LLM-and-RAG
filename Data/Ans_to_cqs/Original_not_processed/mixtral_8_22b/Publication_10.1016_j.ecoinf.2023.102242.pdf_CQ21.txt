focus on this issue to yield more reliable results.

The  processing  of  high-resolution  remote  sensing  data,  which  en-
compasses  a  plethora  of  feature  information  (Girshick  et  al.,  2014), 
demands  significant  time  and  costs.  This  presents  considerable  chal-
lenges for many researchers (Modzelewska et al., 2020). Prior to clas-
sification, samples require training. The representativeness and quantity 
of  these  training  samples  significantly  influence  the  accuracy  of  the 
classification  models.  Platinum  (Ting,  2016)  demonstrated  that  when 
the training samples are not sufficiently typical, other categories can be 
easily misclassified into the sampleâ€™s category. If the number of training 
samples is insufficient, network training may not meet the requirements. 
Conversely, an excessive number of training samples can lead to data 
redundancy, reducing the efficiency of model training (Shi, 2018). To 
address  this  issue,  this  study  employed  feature  optimization  tools  to

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices. However, it discusses some important aspects related to the processing and classification methods used with high-resolution remote sensing data.

In terms of data processing, the text highlights the challenges associated with handling large volumes of feature information from high-resolution remote sensing data, including the substantial time and cost demands. It also emphasizes the importance of having representative and adequate quantities of training samples for accurate classification models.

Regarding the classification method, the context suggests using feature optimization tools to improve the subsequent classification process. Moreover, it points out potential issues like misclassifications due to non-representative training samples and reduced training efficiency caused by either insufficient or excessively redundant training samples.

Although the context does not directly address the postprocessing steps mentioned in the query, one could infer that common practices such as calculating evaluation metrics (like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score etc.) and generating confusion matrices might still apply here. These techniques help assess the performance of the trained model and identify areas for improvement. Additionally, visualization techniques like saliency maps could potentially aid in understanding the model's decision-making process and identifying critical features contributing to its predictions.
