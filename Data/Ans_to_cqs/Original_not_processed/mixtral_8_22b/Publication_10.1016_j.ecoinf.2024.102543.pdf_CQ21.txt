The  training  set,  comprising  the  majority  of  the  data  (82%),  con-
taining 4000 images, is used to train the model and adjust its parame-
ters, allowing it to learn from a diverse range of examples and patterns in 
the data. The validation set (13%), consisting of 607 images, is utilized 
during  training  to  fine-tune  hyperparameters  and  assess  the  model's 
performance on unseen data, helping to prevent overfitting and ensuring 
generalization. Lastly, the testing set (5%), which included 260 images, 
serves  as  an  independent  evaluation  of  the  model's  performance  on 
completely unseen data, providing a reliable measure of its real-world 
effectiveness and ability to generalize. 

2.3. Performance evaluation 

To evaluate the ablated model results, we use five metrics, namely 
Precision (Eq. (1)), Recall (Eq. (2)), mAP0.5 and mAP0.5:0.95, related to 
Eq. (3), Params(M), Flops(G), Inference(ms) and Time(h).

We  also  consider  Params  and  FLOPs  to  evaluate  the  model.  The 
“Params”  metric  in  a  neural  network  model  refers  to  the  number  of 
learned variables used for making predictions. It is an essential metric 
for  evaluating  the  model's  complexity  and  computational  efficiency.

During  the  preprocessing  phase,  techniques  like  auto-orientation, 
resizing,  tiling,  and  filtering  were  utilized  to  standardize  and  enrich 
the dataset. These steps ensured that the images were consistently ori-
ented,  had  a  uniform  size  of  640  × 640  pixels,  and  contained  a  sub-
stantial  amount  of  annotated  data,  meeting  the  90%  annotation

dataset. By introducing random saturation adjustments to each training 
example, the number of outputs per example was increased to two. This

It is worth noting, however, that increasing the network depth also 
comes with some potential downsides, such as increased computational 
complexity and a greater risk of overfitting the model to the training 
data. So, adding the P2 layer to the YOLOv8 architecture is a tradeoff 
that needs to be carefully balanced with other considerations, such as 
model size and performance requirements. In this sense, we proposed in 
this work a modification in the C2f layer due to its importance in the 
general architecture of YOLOv8, in the sense of making it lighter and 
counterbalancing  the  increase  obtained  with  the  addition  of  the  P2 
feature level layer. In our work, we call this new layer C2f2.

Helpful Answer: After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be employed to analyze and interpret the model's performance. Some common methods include generating saliency maps, calculating various metrics, and creating confusion matrices.

Saliency maps help visualize the regions of input images that contribute most significantly to the model's output. They provide insights into how the model makes decisions by highlighting important features. To generate saliency maps, one can use gradient-based methods, such as GradCAM, or perturbation-based approaches, like Occlusion Mapping.

Calculating different metrics allows us to quantitatively evaluate the model's performance. Based on the given context, the evaluated metrics include Precision, Recall, mAP@0.5, mAP@0.5:0.95, Params(M), Flops(G), Inference(ms), and Time(h). Each metric provides unique information about the model's strengths and weaknesses. For instance, precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions, while recall indicates the fraction of correctly identified positives among actual positives.

A confusion matrix is another useful tool for understanding the model's performance. It summarizes the prediction outcomes by displaying the count of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. Analyzing the confusion matrix helps identify any class imbalance issues or misclassifications between specific classes.

In summary, postprocessing steps after model training may involve generating saliency maps, computing various metrics, and constructing confusion matrices. These techniques aid in interpreting the model's decision-making processes, identifying areas for improvement, and ultimately enhancing overall performance.
