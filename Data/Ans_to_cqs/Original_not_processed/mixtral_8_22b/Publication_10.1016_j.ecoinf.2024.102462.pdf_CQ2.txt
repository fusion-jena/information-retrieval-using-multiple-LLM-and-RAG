3.3. Automatic image processing using DL 

In this section we described the methodology we used to integrate DL 
models into our study. As this is the core technology of our automatic 
framework, we also provide detailed explanations on the metrics used to 
evaluate the results of the whole study. 

3.3.1.

Image classification using deep learning

To  evaluate  current  advancements  in  the  field,  we  compared  the 
ResNet network to three newer architectures with either new processing 
blocks  (i.e.  self-attention)  or  improved  parameter  optimisation  and 
modern network design. Even though it is considered the current state of 
the art in image classification, the ViT network failed to improve on the 
results of ResNet. Nonetheless, a different transformer-based approach, 
the  Swin  network,  and  a  ResNet  evolution,  ConvNeXt,  clearly  out-
performed ResNet with around a 5% improvement: 77.18% and 76.20% 
accuracy, respectively.

experiments also indicated that the performance of these networks was significantly influenced by the similarity 
between the datasets used to fine-tune them and evaluate them. This fact highlights the importance of building 
publicly available images databases to further improve the results.

Image  classification  is  one  of  the  most  well-studied  problems  in 
computer vision (Everingham et al., 2010; Lu and Weng, 2007). This is 
evidenced by the development of one of the largest natural image da-
tabases in the field. Originally released as part of a worldwide compe-
tition  called  the  ImageNet  Large  Scale  Visual  Recognition  Challenge 
(ILSVRC) (Krizhevsky et al., 2012), ImageNet spans 1000 object classes 
in more than 1.2 millions of annotated images and is considered one of 
the most relevant benchmarks for new algorithms. In our study we focus 
on a specific type of image classification problem where given an image, 
the goal is to assign a single label from a set of several options (usually 
represented as a categorical variable). Specifically, given a set of patches 
containing  one  single  shrub  each,  we  want  to  determine  the  species 
(class) that each of them belongs to from the six possible options in the 
site.

Helpful Answer: The text does not explicitly mention the format of the input data used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the data format used is images. The passage discusses the use of deep learning models for image classification tasks, specifically focusing on classifying shrubs in images. It mentions the comparison of various deep learning architectures such as ResNet, ViT, Swin, and ConvNeXt for image classification purposes. Additionally, the discussion revolves around the ImageNet dataset, which consists of annotated images. Therefore, it can be concluded that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is primarily images.
