the calls precisely, we converted the probabilistic predictions into individual detections using a
non-maximum suppression to return the local maximum for each peak in the output predic-
tion (Fig 1E). These local maxima corresponded to the predicted locations of the start of each
search-phase bat echolocation call, with associated probabilities, and were exported as text

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention or discussion about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some common techniques used in machine learning and deep learning pipelines include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same class distribution in both sets. This helps prevent imbalanced classes from affecting the performance of the model.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to balance datasets when dealing with imbalanced classes. Oversampling increases the number of instances in the minority class, while undersampling reduces the number of instances in the majority class. Both methods aim to create a more balanced dataset for better model performance.

Diverse data collection focuses on gathering data from various sources and demographics to ensure that the trained models perform well across different populations and scenarios. This technique aims to reduce potential biases introduced by relying solely on one type of data source or population.

While these techniques are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, they are commonly employed in addressing data bias during preprocessing of deep learning pipelines.
