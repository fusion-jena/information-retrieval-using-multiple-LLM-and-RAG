Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Data augmentation is a strategy used in deep learning pipelines to increase the amount of training data by applying random transformations such as fliping, rotation, scaling, cropping, zooming, shearing, etc. These techniques help prevent overfitting and improve the performance of models. However, it should be noted that not all types of data can benefit from these transformations; for instance, time series or tabular data may not see improvements using traditional image-based augmentation methods.

In the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific data augmentation techniques applied in any deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed description of the exact techniques used in this case. Nevertheless, some commonly used data augmentation techniques in deep learning include:

1. Flipping: This involves horizontally or vertically flipping an input image. It helps create new samples without changing the label.

2. Rotation: Images can be rotated by a certain degree to generate new samples. This technique is useful when dealing with objects that might appear in different orientations.

3. Scaling: Resizing the original image to various dimensions can also produce additional training examples. This helps the model learn features invariant to size changes.

4. Cropping: Randomly selecting portions of the original image and rescaling them to the desired size creates new samples while preserving important features.

5. Zooming: Applying small random zooms to the input image can simulate variations in object distance and perspective.

6. Shearing: Distorting the input image along one axis generates new samples that resemble real-world deformations caused by camera angles or movement.
