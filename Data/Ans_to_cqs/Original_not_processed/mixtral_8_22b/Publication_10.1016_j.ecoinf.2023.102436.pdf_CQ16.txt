reduction reaching as low as (cid:0) 0.632 compared to the baseline. The most 
prominent disparity is observed in the boundary region, particularly in 
proximity  to  nearby  buildings.  The  Iteration  II  (Fig.  7c)  focuses  on 
increasing the density of trees to improve the restorative potential. Since 
the western and southern parts of the park already have sufficient tree 
cover, our primary focus is to intensify tree plantation in the northern, 
eastern,  and central  areas while aligning  with the  size  and  species of 
existing trees. The change resulted in slight improvements (Fig. 7h) in 
the restorative potential, particularly in the central areas. Iteration III 
(Fig. 7d) replaces some vegetation with water in the central area due to 
the park’s lack of water landscape. The results (Fig. 7i) also indicate a 
negligible impact, with the maximum difference from the baseline being 
just 0.05.

where Xi
is the normalized value of i-th metric, represents the original 
value  of  the  i-th  metric,  Xi(cid:0) min  and  Xi(cid:0) max  are  the  minimum  and 
maximum value of i-th metric at baseline, respectively, P represents the 
final score, and wi  is the weight value of the i-th metric. 

Finally, the scores of all grids were aggregated to form the matrix, 
which was then utilized to construct a restorative map (Fig. 3). Given 
that the scores were computed with the central points of each grid, it 
becomes  necessary  to  estimate  the  restorative  potentials  for  the 
remaining regions using a statistical gap-filling technique (Jones et al., 
2017).  To  fulfil  this requirement,  the  study  adopted  the  interpolative 
shading approach and employed the shading function within MATLAB 
to estimate and map the restorative potential across the entire terrain 
area.

time to conduct surveys for restorative assessment and adjust the land-
scape design for quality improvement. To tackle the challenges of the 
lengthy time requirements and subjective nature of the design process, it 
is  imperative  to  develop  a  method  for  quantitative  assessment  of 
restorative quality to improve the effectiveness of landscape planning 
and design.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, common criteria used in machine learning include validation loss plateau, where training stops once the validation loss has stopped decreasing or improving; early stopping, which involves setting a threshold for the number of epochs without improvement before terminating training; and maximum number of epochs, where training ends after a predetermined number of iterations through the dataset. These criteria help prevent overfitting and ensure optimal model performance.
