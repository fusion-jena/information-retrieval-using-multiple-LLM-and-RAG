critical information for digital storage: fish sampling location, date,
species, and life stage. The CM database design is centred on each
physical sample, Fig. 2. The metadata, such as fish length, weight, and
day collected, is typically written on the sample envelopes. Some en-
velopes and glass slides contained no metadata, or were labelled with
only a lab number and species. Furthermore, older labels were often
either illegible or damaged. Therefore, samples that contained the ne-
cessary critical information were prioritized to be catalogued first in the
database and repository. The internal vocabulary (and shorthand) used
during sample labelling within the MI field station changed through
time, and between researchers. Furthermore, the local vocabularies
used were often not in accordance with best practice (Hedden, 2010).
The usage of controlled vocabularies, which is a pre-defined list of
terms, enables consistent and accurate information labelling (Mao

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any direct mention of specific criteria used to determine when machine learning training is complete. However, common practices in machine learning include monitoring metrics like validation loss during training. When this metric reaches a plateau, it may indicate that further training will not significantly improve performance, suggesting that training could be considered complete. This approach aligns with the general principle of avoiding overfitting by stopping training once additional iterations do not yield substantial improvements. Nevertheless, without explicit details about the training process mentioned in the context, we cannot definitively state what criteria are being used to determine completion.
