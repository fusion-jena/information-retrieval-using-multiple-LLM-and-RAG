3.  Differences gains among recording devices: The signal amplitude of a 
microphone depends on the sound pressure that the microphone may 
capture. This depends on the manufacturing materials and its level of 
degradation.  Significant  differences  in  gain  are  expected  from  mi-
crophones of different brands or after severe outdoor use.

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps involved after model training such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, confusion matrix, etc. However, based on general machine learning practices, some common postprocessing steps include:

1. Model Evaluation: After training a model, it is essential to evaluate its performance using various evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curves, etc. These metrics help understand how well the model has learned from the given dataset and can be used to compare multiple models.

2. Hyperparameter Tuning: Postprocessing often involves fine-tuning hyperparameters to improve the model's performance further. Techniques like grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, etc., can be employed to find optimal hyperparameters.

3. Visualization Tools: To better understand the trained model, visualizations like saliency maps, activation heatmaps, gradient-weighted class activation mapping (GradCAM), etc., can be utilized. These tools provide insights into which features contribute most significantly towards predictions made by the model.

4. Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix is another useful tool for evaluating classification models. It provides detailed information about true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives, helping identify areas where the model performs poorly.

5. Error Analysis: Analyzing errors made by the model during prediction helps pinpoint weaknesses and potential improvements. Common techniques include examining misclassified samples, analyzing incorrectly predicted classes, and identifying patterns within these mistakes.
