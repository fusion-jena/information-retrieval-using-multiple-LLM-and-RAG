The entire model runs on one classified map at a time. It was re-run a total of 12 times until all the initial classified maps from the GEE step were 
reclassified. The model worked best when it was run with default parameters (buffer distance of 100 m, threshold of 0.25, and water distance to water 
bodies of 150 m) the first time, and the results were observed. This was done in order to get an idea of which model parameters were most suitable for 
the study area. Once the suitable parameters were identified, they were adjusted accordingly and the model was re-run using the corrected parameters. 
It was noted that the model parameters tended to change for Landsat Images of a different area. This was due to the geography of the area and whether 
it was predominantly urban, semi-urban, or rural. Landsat images containing major urban areas such as large cities, airports, and towns required a

Final notes

There were five LULC classes in the study area: mines, water, forest, 
urban areas, and bare soil. Due to the vast and remote study area, it was 
not  feasible  to  collect  training  or  validation  data  through  fieldwork. 
Landsat images, along with the cluster classification maps were used to 
collect training data. Locations for training sites were chosen by using 
(a) the previously created Landsat image collection as a basemap, (b) the 
previously  created  cloud  mask,  to  avoid  cloud-covered  areas  when 
selecting training  sites,  and (c) the  previously created cluster classifi-
cation map as a further guide for class selection. Seventy training sites in 
the form of points (each point represents one pixel on the map) were 
selected for each of the five classes, making up a total of 350 points per 
image.  The  points  were  selected  using  a  stratified  (by  class)  random 
sampling approach and were distributed across the entire study area.

Helpful Answer:
After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the project. Some common postprocessing steps include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, and creating confusion matrices.

Saliency maps help visualize the importance of input features towards the prediction made by the model. They highlight the regions in the input space that contribute significantly to the decision-making process of the model. These maps can provide valuable insights into how the model interprets the input data and can aid in identifying potential biases or errors in the model.

Calculating various performance metrics is another crucial postprocessing step. Commonly used metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC AUC, etc. These metrics quantify the performance of the model and enable comparison between different models or configurations. Additionally, these metrics can assist in fine-tuning the model hyperparameters and selecting the optimal model architecture.

Creating confusion matrices is yet another important postprocessing step. A confusion matrix provides a detailed breakdown of the predictions made by the model compared to the actual labels. It helps identify patterns in misclassifications and enables the evaluation of the model's performance across individual classes. Furthermore, confusion matrices can reveal imbalances in the dataset and inform strategies for addressing them.

However, based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any specific postprocessing steps employed after the model training phase. Therefore, it cannot be determined if any of the abovementioned techniques were utilized in this particular case.
