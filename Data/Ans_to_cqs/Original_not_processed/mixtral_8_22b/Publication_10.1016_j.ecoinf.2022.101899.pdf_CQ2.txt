Halgamuge et al. (2020) focused on utilizing deep learning to esti-
mate the best optimizer selection methods for wildfire event predictions 
in Australia. They developed an algorithm to collect the data automat-
ically and analyzed six different optimizer models using deep learning 
technology. They concluded that this approach could predict a natural 
disaster, including wildfire events, by investigating historical environ-
mental  conditions  before  and  after  wildfires  occurred  using  the  deep 
learning methodology. Dowdy (2020) focused on demonstrating a sea-
sonal prediction system for wildfire event prediction in Australia. This 
measured  spatio-temporal  variations  and  seasonality  across  several 
datasets  and  utilized  this  methodology  to  predict  wildfire  events, 
focusing on the seasonal predictions using the 2019â€“2020 wildfire sea-
son  as  an  example  and  measuring  long-term  predictions.  Coen  et  al.

Using  the  Code  Editor  tool,  97  images  were  extracted  from  April 
2013 to July 2021. In total, 9841 areas in the forest were analyzed, and 
NDVI  data  was  extracted.  The  method  involved  using  the  map  func-
tionality of the Code Editor tool and scripting all the required calcula-
tions in JavaScript. Mean NDVI scores were calculated for each one of 
these areas, and the percentage of vegetation in these areas with low 
NDVI scores was recorded. The final dataset included the mean NDVI 
score, month date stamp of the time each image was taken, and forest 
vulnerability  as  the  percentage  of  vegetation  with  low  NDVI  scores. 
Some images had to be excluded due to inappropriate NDVI estimates, 
lack of such estimates, and cloud coverage. The study was also extracted 
data during the main wildfire events that spread through the selected 
forest from September 2019 to January 2020. However, at least 75% of

Earth Engine (GEE) (Google, 2021). Images from GEE can be retrieved, 
mapped,  and  analyzed  to  extract  information  about  spectral  indices. 
Spectroscopic analysis using satellite images to study different types of 
landcover  including  forested  land  has  been  around  for  a  long  time 
(Campbell and Wynne, 2011; Tucker, 1979). While research based on 
spectroscopic  analysis  and  remote  sensing  has  been  widely  used  in 
recent  years  across  urban  and  environmental  studies,  there  has  been 
little  research  published  in  relation  to  predicting  wildfires  based  on 
vegetation  vulnerability  to  wildfires  by  using  spectroscopic  analysis

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly state the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that Halgamuge et al. (2020) collected data automatically and analyzed six different optimizer models using deep learning technology. Additionally, the text discusses the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) to retrieve, map, and analyze images to extract information about spectral indices. It is also mentioned that some images had to be excluded due to inappropriate NDVI estimates, lack of such estimates, and cloud coverage. Based on this information, we can infer that the deep learning pipeline likely uses image data, specifically satellite imagery, to estimate the best optimizer selection methods for wildfire event predictions in Australia.
