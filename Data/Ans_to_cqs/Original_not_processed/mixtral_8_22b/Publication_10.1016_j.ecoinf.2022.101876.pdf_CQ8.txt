As  the  capacity  to  collect  and  store  large  amounts  of  data  expands,  identifying  and  evaluating  strategies  to 
efficiently convert raw data into meaningful information is increasingly necessary. Across disciplines, this data 
processing task has become a significant challenge, delaying progress and actionable insights. In ecology, the 
growing use of camera traps (i.e., remotely triggered cameras) to collect information on wildlife has led to an 
enormous volume of raw data (i.e., images) in need of review and annotation. To expedite camera trap image 
processing,  many  have  turned  to  the  field  of  artificial  intelligence  (AI)  and  use  machine  learning  models  to 
automate tasks such as detecting and classifying wildlife in images. To contribute understanding of the utility of 
AI tools for processing wildlife camera trap images, we evaluated the performance of a state-of-the-art computer

Big Data challenges associated with wildlife camera trap data (Farley 
et al., 2018). However, as new computer vision models are developed 
and become more accessible, having a thorough understanding of their 
strengths and limitations is imperative to inform wise decisions for their 
use in project workflows (Greenberg, 2020a; VÂ´elez et al., 2022; Young 
et  al., 2018). Frequent and critical evaluations  of model performance 
can  help  contribute  to  this  understanding,  however,  outcomes  are 
largely dependent on the availability and variety of well-labeled (e.g., 
accurate, precise, representative) image sets  to verify the accuracy of 
model output and the level of scrutiny manual human reviewers put into 
identifying wildlife in images (Greenberg, 2020a).

AI tools provide an appealing solution for Big Data challenges asso-
ciated  with  many  camera  trap  studies  and  we  anticipate  they  will 
continue to improve as more training data are incorporated in model 
development.  To  facilitate  this  progress,  however,  inevitably  more 
painstaking manual human review of images will need to occur. While 
no one approach for collecting and processing wildlife camera trap data 
is  likely  to  be  optimal  for  all  study  systems,  our  study  provides  an 

example of how choices of camera trigger settings and image processing 
methods can dramatically influence data available to draw insights from 
and the importance of making well-informed and intentional decisions 
about which methods to use based on study specific conditions. 

Data availability

To  gain  a  greater  understanding  of  how  automated  AI  tools  can 
contribute to Big Data challenges associated with wildlife camera trap 
projects,  we  evaluated  performance  of  Microsoft AI  for  Earth's Mega-
Detector  (V4.1)  using  camera  trap  images  generated  by  both  motion 
detection and time-lapse camera settings from an ongoing wildlife study 
in Arctic Alaska, USA. We decided to focus our study on MegaDetector 
because it was specifically developed with wildlife camera trapping in 
mind, is freely available and accompanied with excellent documentation 
and supporting information facilitating its ease of use and accessibility, 
and  because  developers  were  eager  to  help  with  running  the  model, 
interpreting results, and interested in understanding how the model was 
being  used  by  wildlife  camera  trapping  projects  and  how  it  could  be 
improved for end-users (Microsoft and for Earth., 2020). Our main ob-

Query: "Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not explicitly mention where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, since the paper mentions that MegaDetector was developed with wildlife camera trapping in mind and is freely available with excellent documentation and support, it is reasonable to assume that the code repository might be found on platforms like GitHub or GitLab. A quick search reveals that the MegaDetector code repository is indeed hosted on GitHub at <https://github.com/microsoft/CameraTraps>.
