neural  network  (CNN).  It  encapsulates  three  operations,  Conv2d 
convolution,  BatchNorm2d  and  an  activation  function,  which  can 
effectively extract and learn useful feature information from the input 
data and provide more expressive input for the subsequent layers of the 
neural network. The C2f module is used for multilevel deep processing 
and abstraction of input features to construct the backbone network of 
CSPDarknet53 (Bochkovskiy et al., 2020), and its design is inspired by 
the  C3  module  and  Efficient  Layer  Aggregation  Network  (ELAN)  to 
realize additional cross-layer connections across branches. This design

enriches  gradient  flow  information  while  maintaining  a  lightweight 
structure.  The  SPPF  module  is  a  module  for  processing  objects  with 
different scales. It modifies parallel max pooling into a combination of 
serial  and  parallel  modes,  enhancing  the  model's  resilience  to  spatial 
layout and object degradation. This module involves a standard Conv 
operation, followed by kernel sizes of 5, 9, and 13 for Max pooling. The 
results are concatenated with the Conv module for extracting shallow 
semantic  features,  which  subsequently  passed  through  a  final  Conv 
module. The neck network is positioned between the backbone network 
and the head network. Feature fusion is performed using two network 
architectures, the feature pyramid network (FPN) and the path aggre-
gation network (PAN), which are used to solve the problem of multiscale 
feature fusion and strengthen the integration and utilization of feature

designs  the  C2flite  module  to  integrate  more  deep  features  into  the 
network.  Thus,  the  number  of  model  parameters  can  be  significantly 
reduced while maintaining high accuracy and speed. Concurrently, we 
conducted  ablation  experiments  and  compared  YOLO_MRC's  perfor-
mance with that of improved models such as YOLOv5s-ECA (She et al., 
2022),  Fast-RCNN  (Mobilenetv2)  (Shen  et  al.,  2018),  YOLOv5Ghost 
(Zhang et al., 2022), and YOLOv7Tiny (Wang et al., 2023) to explore the 
performance advantages of YOLO_MRC on our Bactrocera cucurbitae pest 
dataset. In addition, on the public dataset Pest_24_640, YOLO_MRC is 
used  to  conduct  benchmark  experiments  with  several  other  excellent 
SOTA  models  to  explore  its  performance  on  multiclass  pest  detection 
tasks.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention any well-known datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it refers to two specific datasets used in this study: the Bactrocera cucurbitae pest dataset and the Pest_24_640 dataset. These datasets seem to be custom datasets created specifically for this research, focusing on pest detection tasks.
