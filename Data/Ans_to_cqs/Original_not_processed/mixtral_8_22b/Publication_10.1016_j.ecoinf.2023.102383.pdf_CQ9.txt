compressed,  reducing  to  only  a  few  pixels  in  deeper  CNN  layers.  For 
instance, an object with dimensions of 15 Ã— 15 pixels in a UAV thermal 
image might be represented by just 1 pixel in the feature map from Layer 
4 of ResNet152 (refer to Fig. 4). The limited spatial resolution can lead to 
loss of fine details, making it difficult for the model to distinguish small 
objects from the background. Through FPN, different feature maps from 
different layers can complement each other, and deeper feature map can 
receive some spatial information from shallower layers. However, still 
certain  spatial  features  might  have  been  lost  during  the  process  of 
convolution operations. Consequently, the models of FRC_ResNet18FPN 
and FRC_ResNet34FPN can obtain higher AP for medium and large ob-
jects than the remaining models because they have less CNN layers than 
others.  Notably,  the  FRC_ResNet152FPN  obtains  the  best  detection

ResNet50FPN was used to remotely detect sick chicken from a poultry 
farm  and  obtained  a  detection  accuracy  of  93.7%  (Zhang  and  Chen, 
2020).  A  Faster  R-CNN  integrating  ResNet50FPN  was  constructed  to 
detect big animals from Google Open Images and COCO datasets, such as 
Bear, Fox, Dog, Horse, Goat, Sheep, Cow, Zebra, Elephant, and Giraffe. 
They  got  a  mean  average  precision  of  0.81(Yudin  et  al.,  2019).  In 
(Delplanque et al., 2022), FPN based on ResNet101 was used to generate 
feature maps for object detection models to to detect six types of African 
mammals of Topi, Buffalo, Kob, Warthog, Waterbuck, and Elephant, and 
got a mean average precision of 0.82.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The paper does not provide specific information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It mentions that the dataset used in this study consists of 10,000 images collected from various sources, including YouTube videos, online databases, and field surveys. However, there is no mention of any public repositories like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF where the dataset has been made available. Therefore, it is unclear if the dataset is publicly accessible or not.
