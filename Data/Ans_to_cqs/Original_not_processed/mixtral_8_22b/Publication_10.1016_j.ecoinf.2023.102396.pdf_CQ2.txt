%Query
Query: "What data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., image, audio, video, CSV)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data formats used in deep learning pipelines include images, audio files, videos, and structured data such as CSV or Excel files. The choice of data format depends on the type of problem being solved and the nature of the input data required by the deep learning algorithm. For example, image classification tasks would typically use image data, while speech recognition tasks might use audio files.
