Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific metric used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. However, it does reference classification accuracy as a metric used in evaluating machine learning models. Classification accuracy is a common metric used to measure how often a model predicts correctly out of all predictions made. It is calculated by dividing the number of correct predictions by the total number of predictions made. Other commonly used metrics include precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the curve (AUC), among others. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made, while recall measures the proportion of true positives out of all actual positives. The F1 score combines both precision and recall into a single metric, providing a more balanced evaluation of the model's performance. AUC is another useful metric that provides a summary of the model's overall performance across different thresholds.
