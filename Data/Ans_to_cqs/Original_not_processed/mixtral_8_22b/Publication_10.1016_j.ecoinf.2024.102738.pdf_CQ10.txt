The study area extends from 78
◦
30′ to 6

◦
58′ west longitude, and
06′ to 78
◦
02′ south latitude, covering 2904.96 km2, has elevations from
5
351 to 3684 m.a.s.l. and encompasses the Alto Mara˜n´on II and III inter-
basins, as well as the lower Utcubamba river basin, as shown in Fig. 1.
This area was chosen as a case study because it is currently the most
affected sector by the cultivation of rice, coffee, cocoa, and extensive
livestock farming in the aforementioned watersheds of the Amazonas
and Cajamarca regions,
located in the northwest Peru (Gobierno
Regional de Amazonas (GOREA) and Instituto de Investigaciones de la
Amazonía Peruana (IIAP), 2007; Gobierno Regional de Cajamarca
(GRC), 2010MIDAGRI, 2021).

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no information available regarding the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in this research. The given context does not provide any details about where the source code can be found, such as links to GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, without additional information, it is impossible to determine the specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline utilized in this study.
