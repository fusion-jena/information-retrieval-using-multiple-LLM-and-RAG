thicker  the  line,  the  more  instances  of  co-occurrence  between  theme 
words  and  vice  versa.  As  relatively  low-frequency  keywords  are 
considered  ineffective  in  topic  detection,  previous  studies  (Dai  et  al., 
2020;  Liu  et  al.,  2023b)  typically  set  word  frequency  thresholds  to 
reduce network complexity and improve computational efficiency. Our 
study followed this approach. In word co-occurrence networks, closely 
connected  topic  words  can  be  viewed  as  communities  related  to 
contaminated sites. Modularity is a metric used to evaluate community 
division  quality  (Garg  and  Kumar,  2018);  its  calculation  formula  is 
shown in Eq. 3:

Question: %INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the provided pieces of context to answer the query in less than 400 words. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

%Query
Query: "Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not contain information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions various research papers and sources but does not provide any specific details regarding the location of the code repository. Therefore, it is not possible to determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available based solely on the given context.
