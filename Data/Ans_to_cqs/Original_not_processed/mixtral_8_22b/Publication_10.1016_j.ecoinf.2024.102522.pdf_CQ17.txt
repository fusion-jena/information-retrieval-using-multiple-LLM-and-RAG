results. After the model was validated and shown to be effective, it was 
used to construct a risk map under the influence of multiple variables 
and then spatially overlaid with the host raster map to obtain the final 
risk pattern for the spread of Hyphantria cunea.

From Table 11, the correct prediction rate for “present” was 76.84%, 
the prediction accuracy of the model for “absent” was 77.55%, and the 
overall  validation  accuracy  was  76.17%.  The  results  showed  that  the 
accuracy  of  the  model  in  predicting  the  “present”  sample  points  was 
>70%, and the accuracy of the “absent” sample points was >50%. The 
model  was  effective,  and  the  prediction  accuracy  of  the  model  was 
slightly  greater  than  that  of  the  model  based  on  remote  sensing  data 
without the introduction of nighttime light information.

hosts  and  its  extensive  adaptability  (Ji  et  al.,  2019).  Therefore,  it  is 
necessary to conduct a spreading risk assessment of Hyphantria cunea in 
advance  to  establish  effective  pest  management  practices  and  plant 
protection measures. Previous studies have revealed that the spread of 
Hyphantria cunea mainly relies on short-distance spreading via natural 
elements, such as  wind or natural migratory flight, and long-distance 
propagation via human activities, such as the transpiration of agrofor-
estry  products,  woods,  and  seedlings  (Gilbert  et  al.,  2004;  Muirhead 
et al., 2006). Human impacts play a crucial role in pest transmission, and 
early  warning  analysis  systems  should  consider  essential  ecological 
human factors to improve risk assessments (Lippitt et al., 2008). How-
ever,  human  activities  are  diverse  and  complex  social  processes,  and 
spatial  quantification  can  be  challenging.  Therefore,  the  current  risk

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide specific details about the regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline to prevent overfitting. However, common regularization techniques include dropout and L2 regularization. Dropout involves randomly setting a fraction of input units to 0 during training time, which helps reduce interdependent learning amongst neurons. On the other hand, L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, encouraging smaller weights and preventing any single weight from dominating the output. These techniques help generalize models better by reducing their complexity and avoiding overfitting.
