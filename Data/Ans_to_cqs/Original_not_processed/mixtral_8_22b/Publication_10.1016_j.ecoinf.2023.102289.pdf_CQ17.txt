Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

A.1.2. Loading the pre-trained module 

By default, LaDeco employs the deeplabv3 þ resnet269 model. The deeplabv3 part is a semantic segmentation algorithm developed by Google 
(Chen et al., 2018), and Resnet269 is a 269-layer Resnet neural network (Zhang et al., 2020). Users can switch to other pre-trained models as needed 
(Please refer to https://cv.gluon.ai/api/model_zoo.html#). 

A.1.3. Setting the threshold 

The primary function of LaDeco is to calculate the pixel percentage of each landscape element in the image. Users can set a threshold to filter out 

negligible values; for example, values below 1% can be rounded to zero. This threshold is customizable.

2.3. MXNet and GluonCV 

MXNet  is  an  open-source  AI  platform  that  offers  a  comprehensive 
suite of neural network models and functionalities for AI development 
(Chen et al., 2015). MXNet serves as the central computational module; 
when combined with GluonCV, GluonNLP, and GluonTS, it constitutes a 
robust development system. In this study, we used GluonCV to develop 
LaDeco. 

GluonCV offers a set of 25 segmentation models, ten of which have 
been trained on the ADE20K dataset and are therefore well-suited for 
landscape applications (Ho and Ho, 2022). The ADE20K dataset devel-
oped by the MIT Torralba team contributes significantly to the SS field. 
This dataset focused on the recognition of 150 indoor and outdoor ob-
jects  (Zhou  et  al.,  2018a,  2018b).  In  this  study,  55  outdoor  visual 
landscape elements from the ADE20K dataset were used. 

3. Methodology and materials

(4)  Computational efficiency 

Because  LaDeco  processes  image  data,  high-quality  Graphics  Pro-
cessing Units (GPU) are essential. In this study, for example, a total of 
8301 images were analyzed on a computer with 128GB RAM, an Intel-i9 
CPU,  and  a  Nvidia-RTX5000  GPU,  taking  a  total  time  of  5087  s  (an 
average of 0.61 s per image). To improve the processing speed, espe-
cially  when  dealing  with  large  datasets,  it  is  advisable  to  use  more 
advanced GPU.
