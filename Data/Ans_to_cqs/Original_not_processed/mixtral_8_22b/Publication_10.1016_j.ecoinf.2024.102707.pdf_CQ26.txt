data  and  at  inference  time.  We  used  many  different  sets  of  hyper-
parameters in YOLOv6 but found only marginal improvements; hence, 
we decided to use the default settings. Finally, we tested working with 
different  spatial  resolutions  of  the  imagery,  most  notably  including 
training runs in which the same images were used at different spatial 
resolutions. We did not find this approach to be beneficial.

%Query
Query: "What techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, Diverse data collection)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The paper does not provide explicit information on specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions using a diverse dataset collected from various sources, such as citizen scientists, researchers, and government agencies. This suggests that they may have employed diverse data collection strategies to mitigate potential biases. Additionally, the authors mention training their models using multiple datasets, which could also help reduce any inherent biases present within individual datasets. Nevertheless, without further details, it is impossible to confirm if other common techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling were utilized.
