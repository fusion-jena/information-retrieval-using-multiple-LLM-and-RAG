Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

REC event is in progress and the envelope e falls below τ ⋅ δ, the device 
enters the stop phase and continues the recording for 5 s. If e exceeds 
again τ ⋅ δ within the stop phase, the recording resumes. Otherwise, after 
5 s, the device enters the refractory phase in which no REC event can be 
triggered. Then, the device resumes listening when the recording of the

Therefore, the recording campaign was planned to last an entire year so 
as  to  capture  the  variations  that  goat  vocalizations  demonstrate 
throughout  the  year.  Overall,  we  have  collected  approximately  10  M 
sound  events  lasting  more  than  34,000  h.  Fig.  7  illustrates  the  data 
distribution per farm in terms of number of audio files, annotations and 
durations.

Such  functionality  is  expected  to  assist  in  gathering  data  in  order  to 
improve the classification algorithm in an online mode.

table); it is reconstructed based on the start times and durations of both 
entities. A particular scenario is that of event instances whose duration is 
very short (impulsive events, duration d ≈ 0s) or impossible to detect 
(unknown events, duration d = (cid:0) 1). In these cases, the event is auto-
matically associated with all the audio files that cover its start time.

Query: "What criteria are used to determine when training is complete (e.g., validation loss plateau)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, common machine learning practices often use metrics such as validation loss plateaus, accuracy thresholds, or early stopping rules to decide when a model has been sufficiently trained. Without further information, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the specific criteria used in this case.
