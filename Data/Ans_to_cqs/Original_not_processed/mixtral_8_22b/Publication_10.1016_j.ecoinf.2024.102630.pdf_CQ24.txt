NDVIR = MAX(NDVIi)

(2) 

Among them, NDVIR is the monthly (annual) NDVI value, and NDVI i 

is the value before synthesis. 

2.3.3. NDVI classification analysis 

The Jenks natural breaks optimization method is a statistical tech-
nique designed to determine the optimal classification by maximizing 
the variance between classes and minimizing the variance within clas-
ses, thereby identifying natural groupings in the data (Jenks, 1967). The 
Jenks natural breaks optimization method has been widely applied in 
the classification research of vegetation indices, such as NDVI and Soil 
Adjusted  Vegetation  Index  (SAVI)  classification  research  (Anchang 
et al., 2016; Silva Costa et al., 2023). To accurately compare the dif-
ferences in value sizes between different NDVI products, we used the 
Jenks  natural  breaks  optimization  method  to  divide  the  average  or 
maximum values of four NDVI products at different time scales into six

that the average NDVI of forests is approximately 0.1 higher than that of 
croplands, and the average NDVI of croplands is about 0.1 higher than 
that of grasslands, with shrublands significantly lower than croplands 
(Xue et al., 2021). Additionally, these findings contradict those reported 
by Liu et al., where the average NDVI difference between croplands and 
grasslands was about 0.1 (Liu et al., 2011). Consequently, the ability of 
CDR AVHRR NDVI to discriminate between different vegetation types 
may be questionable.

Helpful Answer:
To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, several strategies can be employed. One common approach is using fixed random seeds for reproducibility. By setting a specific seed value, researchers can ensure that their results remain consistent across multiple runs of the same model. This technique is particularly useful when comparing different models or hyperparameters since it eliminates any potential variability introduced by random initialization. Another strategy involves averaging over multiple runs with different initializations. This approach helps reduce the impact of individual outliers and provides a more robust estimate of performance. Finally, some practitioners advocate for incorporating stochasticity directly into the training process through techniques like dropout regularization or data augmentation. These methods introduce controlled noise during training, which can help improve generalization and prevent overfitting. Overall, managing randomness in deep learning pipelines requires careful consideration and experimentation to find the best approach for each specific application.
