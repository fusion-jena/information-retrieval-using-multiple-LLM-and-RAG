are not enough data available to reliably fit every type of model, espe-
cially  given  the  demanding  nature  of  some  machine  learning  ap-
proaches,  and  computation  time  can  be  a  considerable  limitation  as 
well, such as for more demanding Bayesian models. The package will

tion is not sufficient for inferring a species distribution.

et  al.,  2017).  These  models  are  usually  the  most  computationally 
intensive, but also the most elegant as all integration is done through 
dataset specific likelihoods (Fig. 2h). 

2.3. Different engines

2.4. Model evaluation

The  backbone  of  any  SDM  modelling  are  the  algorithm  used  for 
inference which in ibis.iSDM are called “engines”. To this date ibis.iSDM 
supports  a  total  of  7  different  engines  for  inferring  or  projecting  the 
relative habitat suitability of biodiversity features. Those can broadly be 
classified into engines  using either regressions and or non-parametric 
machine learning approaches and being frequentist or Bayesian in na-
ture. Engines supported are regularized elastic net regressions through 
the glmnet package as also used by the maxnet package (Friedman et al., 
2010; Phillips et al., 2017), Bayesian regularized “Spike-and-Slab”  re-
gressions with the BoomSpikeSlab package (Scott, 2022), Bayesian ad-
ditive  regression  trees  through  dbarts  (Carlson,  2020;  Dorie,  2022), 
monotonic  gradient  descent boosting via  mboost  (Hofner et  al.,  2011; 
Hothorn et al., 2022), Extreme Gradient Boosting through xgboost (Chen

Helpful Answer:
Based on the provided context, it does not appear that any form of deep learning model, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers, is explicitly mentioned or used within the described pipeline. Instead, the text discusses various types of statistical and machine learning algorithms employed for modeling purposes. Specifically, these include regularized elastic net regressions, Bayesian regularized Spike-and-Slab regressions, Bayesian additive regression trees, monotonic gradient descent boosting, and extreme gradient boosting. However, none of these methods fall under the category of deep learning models. Therefore, based solely on the information presented, I cannot determine what type of deep learning model might be used in the pipeline, if any.
