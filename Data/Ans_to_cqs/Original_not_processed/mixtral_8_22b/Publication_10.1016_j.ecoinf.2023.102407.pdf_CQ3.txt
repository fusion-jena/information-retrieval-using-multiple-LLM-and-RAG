et  al.,  2021;  Pham  et  al.,  2021).  A  common  approach  is  to  exploit  a 
teacher–student structure in the training process, which refers to use a 
trained teacher model to teach a student model. However, in most cases, 
a single ANN or deep neural network model is used as the teacher model 
to assign labels (Ali et al., 2022; Asghar et al., 2020). When PL based on a 
single-teacher model is used to predict species distributions, the teacher 
model can be easily biased towards specific environmental data, and the 
labeled data by this model may not represent diverse habitat conditions 
of  the  species  and  may  lead  to  overfitting  of  the  student  model.  In 
addition,  predictive  errors  of  a  single-teacher  model  can  accumulate 
during the training process, reducing the general efficiency of PL (Arazo 
et  al.,  2020).  This  can  be  alleviated  by  considering  different  teacher 
models for label generation and using the most promising model among

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it mentions the use of pseudo-labels for semi-supervised learning in deep neural networks, which is a technique where unlabeled data is labeled automatically during the training process. Additionally, the context discusses the use of a teacher-student structure in the training process, where a trained teacher model is used to teach a student model. It also highlights potential issues when using a single-teacher model for label generation, including bias towards specific environmental data and reduced general efficiency due to error accumulation. To address these challenges, the context suggests considering different teacher models for label generation and selecting the most promising one.
