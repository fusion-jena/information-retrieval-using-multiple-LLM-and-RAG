A landmark architecture for deep learning winning ILSVRC
2012 challenge (31).
Network in Network (NiN) is one of the ﬁrst architectures
harnessing innovative 1 × 1 convolutions (49) to provide
more combinational power to the features of a convolutional
layers (49).
An architecture that is deeper (i.e., has more layers of
neurons) and obtains better performance than AlexNet
by using effective 3 × 3 convolutional ﬁlters (26).
This architecture is designed to be computationally efﬁcient
(using 12 times fewer parameters than AlexNet) while offering
high accuracy (50).
The winning architecture of the 2016 ImageNet competition
(25). The number of layers for the ResNet architecture can be
different. In this work, we try 18, 34, 50, 101, and 152 layers.

25% (757,000) nonempty images and randomly selected 757,000
empty images. This dataset was then split into training and
test sets.

We created a two-stage pipeline by having the VGG model
from the empty vs. animal experiment classify whether the image
contained an animal and, if it did, having the ensemble of models
from the second stage label it. We can ensure the entire pipeline
is as accurate as human volunteers by having the network classify
images only if it is sufﬁciently conﬁdent in its prediction.

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, the pipeline uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) called the VGG model. The VGG model is mentioned in Table 1 as having 22 layers and being part of the pipeline for classifying whether an image contains an animal or not. Additionally, the context mentions other deep learning architectures such as NiN, GoogLeNet, and ResNet, which are also types of CNNs. However, the specific pipeline described here utilizes the VGG model.
