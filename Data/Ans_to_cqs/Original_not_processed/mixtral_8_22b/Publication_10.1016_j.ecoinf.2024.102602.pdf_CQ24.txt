4.5. Opportunities and limitations for monitoring invasive alien plants 

Even though our study is only exploratory, several issues need to be 
emphasised  for  the  general  detection,  mapping,  and  monitoring  of 
invasive alien plants. The process of acquiring data from citizen science 
or social media platforms can be quite easy, either through an API, or 
other  scrapping  methods,  enabling  the  relatively  fast  and  automated 
collection of big digital data. Yet, not all social media and citizen science 
platforms allow data scrapping, according to the terms and conditions of 
use of each platform. Likewise, the use of deep learning can automate 
the process of detecting invasive alien plants from big digital images, 
making  the  monitoring  of  invasive  alien  species  more  time-,  and 
perhaps,  cost-effective  when  looking  into  large  geographic  areas  and 
time  periods,  compared  to  other  conventional  methods  (e.g.,  field

with other plant species. Moreover, there are no other plant species in 
Portugal (our study area) with the same features as C. selloana. Both of 
these particularities may be the source of the high results observed in 
this study.

resolution of publicly available images will enable precise identification 
of the species. Incorporating other forms of online data, such as textual 
information (e.g., tags, captions, comments) may further improve the 
generalization of deep learning tools for invasive alien species detection, 
mapping, and monitoring (Jeawak et al., 2018; Tateosian et al., 2023; 
Terry et al., 2020). Lastly, the spatial concentration bias of social media 
images, particularly the prevalence of photo captures in some areas at 
the  expense  of  other  areas  (e.g.,  due  to  accessibility  limitations, 
appealing attributes, among others; Di Minin et al., 2015), may also lead 
to limitations in the detection of invasive plants (and other species or 
natural assets).

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide specific information on handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, including managing random seed values. However, common strategies used in machine learning and deep learning include setting a fixed random seed value before training models to ensure reproducibility, using techniques like cross-validation to reduce overfitting caused by randomness, and employing ensembling methods to combine multiple models trained with different initializations. These approaches help mitigate the impact of randomness on model performance and stability.

Based on the given context, it appears that deep learning has been successfully applied to monitor invasive alien plants using online digital images. Various pre-trained models have been utilized, such as Faster R-CNN ResNet101, Faster R-CNN ResNet50, and Faster R-CNN Inception-v2, along with datasets like iNaturalist and MS COCO. The study emphasizes the potential benefits of using deep learning for this purpose, including faster processing times and improved efficiency compared to traditional methods.

However, certain challenges remain, such as the limited availability of high-quality images for accurate species identification and the spatial concentration bias of social media images. To address these issues, researchers suggest incorporating additional sources of online data, such as textual information, and utilizing transfer learning-based deep ensemble neural networks for better accuracy and generalizability.
