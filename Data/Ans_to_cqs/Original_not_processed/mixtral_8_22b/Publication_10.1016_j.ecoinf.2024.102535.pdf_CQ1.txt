Motivated  by  the  scenario  described  above,  this  work  investigates 
deep learning-based techniques for substratum classification in hydro-
thermal vent environments. Hydrothermal vents are high-temperature 
fluid  emissions  that  arise  on  the  seafloor  and  that  sustain  unique 
faunal  communities.  Our  main  goals  are  to  reduce  the  human  effort 
involved  in  substratum  characterization;  alleviate  the  subjectivity 
inherent to human photo interpretation; and contribute to reduce the 
costs and time involved in monitoring the deep sea. 

With  those  purposes  in  mind,  we  devised  a  DL-based  solution  for 
automatically labeling deep-sea images, which employs different CNN 
architectures and allows human photo interpreters to audit the DL-based 
predictions,  considering  only  a  small  fraction  of  the  complete  image 
dataset.

Due to its success in modeling complex problems, DL, characterized 
by neural networks encompassing more hidden layers and learning pa-
rameters  than  their  predecessors,  represents  a  promising  alternative. 
Additionally,  the  increasing  availability  of  optical  imagery  datasets 
organized into large-scale temporal habitat maps is very convenient for 
evaluating  the  performance  of  DL-based  techniques  in  deep-water 
studies. However, the limited availability of labeled data for properly 
training DL models in that context still remains a major obstacle.

Query: "What methods are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., surveys, sensors, public datasets)? "

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of optical imagery datasets organized into large-scale temporal habitat maps, suggesting that remote sensing or underwater photography might be employed for gathering such data. Additionally, the paper discusses the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) architectures for automatically labeling deep-sea images, implying that visual data is being processed in this case. Nevertheless, without further details, it cannot be confirmed whether other types of sensors or survey methods were also utilized during the data collection process.
