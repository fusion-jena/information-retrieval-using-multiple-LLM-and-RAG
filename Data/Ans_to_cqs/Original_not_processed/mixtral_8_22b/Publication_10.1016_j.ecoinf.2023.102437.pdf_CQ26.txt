Our  findings  also  revealed  a  significant  reduction  in  computation 
time when ML models, along with preselection, were used. Unlike ex-
pected, pre-selection lowered the accuracy of the results, which likely 
indicates  a  loss  of  information  in  the  database  transformed  using  the 
signature method. As we expected that the Lasso model, in the absence 
of the signature method, would not provide convincing results; there-
fore, we only retained this analysis to maintain consistency in compar-
ison with the ML models. Though it is possible to extract PDPs from RF 
runs  coupled  with  the  signature  method,  their  interpretation  is  not 
possible because of this transformation. The amount of input data, or in 
our case, the size of the time series used during the learning phase of an 
ML  model,  can  have  a  non-negligible  influence  on  predictive  perfor-
mance (Bustillo et al., 2022; Derot et al., 2020b). In other words, a long

data but also historical data on a broader scale. It addresses the long- 
term  dependency  problem  that  often  plagues  conventional  RNNs 
(Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997).

Machine-learning models have been democratized in environmental 
science  over  the  past  few  years.  Several  ML-based  models  can  be 
grouped  based  on  their  architecture.  The  topic  of  neural  networks  is 
addressed in the following section. In this section, we focus on a model 
based on a tree structure. The RF model, which is based on tree struc-
ture, has been frequently used for ENSO (Gibson et al., 2021; Pal et al., 
2020). We compared its performance in forecasting ENSO with that of 
the  Lasso  model. The RF  models are  often  associated  with “ensemble 
learning,”  which is derived from the aggregation of tree structures or 
trees created during the learning phase RF models. Notably, the number 
of trees was defined downstream, and all our models were composed of 
200 trees.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not directly discuss specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, some relevant aspects related to data processing and handling can still be identified.

In the context, it mentions the use of Machine Learning (ML) models alongside preselection, which resulted in reduced computational time. Preselection could potentially refer to selecting a subset of features or instances before training the model, although the exact nature of the preselection process isn't specified here. This might indirectly help mitigate certain types of biases if done carefully.

Additionally, the text highlights the impact of the amount of input data on predictive performance. While this doesn't explicitly mention addressing data bias, managing the quantity of input data can sometimes aid in reducing imbalance issues within datasets.

Lastly, the Random Forest (RF) model mentioned in the context is known for being relatively robust against outliers and noise, making it suitable for dealing with noisy or skewed datasets. However, it should be noted that these properties do not necessarily imply direct handling of data bias.

Overall, while the given context does not specifically cover techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, it touches upon aspects related to data management and handling in the context of ML models.
