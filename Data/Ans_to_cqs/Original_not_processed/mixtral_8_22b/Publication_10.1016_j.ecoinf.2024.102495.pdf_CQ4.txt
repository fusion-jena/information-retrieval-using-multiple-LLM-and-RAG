Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

In the CNN, feature extraction is automatically performed through a 
convolution process that applies a convolution kernel to the input data 
and pooling, which progressively reduces the spatial size of data rep-
resentation (Fernandes et al., 2021). Using convolution layers, pooling, 
and the parameter-sharing feature also makes CNN effective and effi-
cient  in  classifying  data,  such  as  images  and  sound  recordings  (Kim 
et al., 2018). When processing voice-recorded data, a visual represen-
tation of the sound in the form of a spectrogram is generated (Thakur 
and Kumar, 2021). Therefore, as with image data, a CNN can be used to 
map  patterns  from  a  given  sound  recording  data  (a  mosquito  voice 
recording in this case). Additionally, it can produce considerably higher 
accuracy than other deep learning algorithms.

2.2.3. Deep learning 

Once transformed into a matrix or vector, the results of voice feature 
extraction serve as the input for a deep learning algorithm. This algo-
rithm discerns patterns within the data, enabling it to make predictions 
based on these learned patterns, all without the need for explicit pro-
gramming (França et al., 2021; Navamani, 2019). A critical distinction 
between deep learning and traditional machine learning is the feature- 
extraction  process  during  classification.  Feature  extraction  from  data 
typically requires manual or human intervention in traditional machine 
learning.  Contrastingly,  deep  learning  models  are  designed  to  auto-
matically perform feature extraction.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't any information available regarding the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the provided context. The text discusses various aspects of using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying voice-recorded data, specifically focusing on extracting features from mosquito voice recordings using Mel spectrograms. It mentions the implementation of different parameters for the CNN deep learning model but does not provide details about the data augmentation techniques employed.

To summarize, while the provided context offers valuable insights into the application of CNNs for analyzing voice-recorded data and the use of Mel spectrograms for feature extraction, it does not contain information about the data augmentation techniques utilized in the deep learning pipeline.
