2.1. Deep Learning-Based Prediction: GRU. Deep learning
algorithms, particularly recurrent neural networks (RNNs),
have been proven successful in a variety of applications,
including time series forecasting [9, 10]. +e RNN is a
powerful model that can learn a wide range of complex
relationships from an arbitrarily long sequence of data and
has been used to eﬀectively solve many problems [11–13].
However, two well-known problems were raised because of
the depth of RNN, namely, exploding and vanishing gra-
dient. To address the diﬃculties mentioned above, two
variations of the recurrent model were introduced (i.e., GRU
[14] and LSTM [15]). +e GRU and LSTM architectures are
similar in design, and both contain gating techniques for
controlling the ﬂow of data through the unit. Despite this,
due to its complicated structure, the LSTM takes a long time
to train and converge. GRU-DNN is simpler than LSTM and
has a less sophisticated architecture. As a result, it is faster to

+is paper aims to predict the SST and the SWH for the
Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency dataset.
+e proposed work is motivated by comparing the statistical,
machine learning, and deep learning models to understand
the performance gap of these models. +e results of this
work should provide scientiﬁc evidence on which model ﬁts
better the marine data. To anticipate the marine features
eﬃciently, the employed deep learning model combines the
gated recurrent units (GRU) with the regular neural net-
work. In the proposed architecture, the GRU layer is pre-
ceded by an input layer and followed by a fully connected
layer. As a result, the predicted values can be produced from
the output layer. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst use of a
GRU model architecture for forecasting SST and SWH.
Besides, four diﬀerent ML models have been utilized in the
current study, namely, Linear Regression (LR), Decision
Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random

Experimental results have revealed that the deep learning model slightly outperformed the machine learning models for overall
performance, and both of these approaches greatly outperformed the statistical predictive model.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not directly discuss strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some general practices can be applied to manage randomness in deep learning models. These include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, employing cross-validation or bootstrapping methods to reduce variance due to random sampling, and utilizing ensemble methods to combine multiple models trained with different initializations. Additionally, advanced techniques like Bayesian optimization or hyperparameter tuning can help optimize model parameters and improve robustness against randomness.
