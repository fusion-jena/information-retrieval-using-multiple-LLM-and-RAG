3. Results 

3.1. Bacterial abundance

Annotating  dataset  images  is  one  of  the  most  tedious  and  time- 
consuming  parts  of  the  modelling  process.  The  size  of  the  dataset  is 
important - a large dataset is needed for model success but it takes a lot 
more time to label. In order to prepare a larger dataset to generalize the 
model for the Greenland data, the model was partially trained to learn 
the data first and then the model itself was used to annotate new data 
before training it further.  The new  dataset annotated by the  partially 
trained model contains 540 training images and 141 validation images. 
The  self-annotation  dataset  was  manually  checked  and  edited  by  a 
human. As a result, a large dataset can be prepared within a day. Since 
the  image  quality  taken  from  the  portable  microscope  in  Kenya  was 
much lower compared to the other two, a small dataset that only con-
tained images from Kenya was used to fine tune the model for this data.

were  proven  to  succumb  to  complexity,  low  precision  and  reliability, 
whereas image analysis-based methods have now been widely adopted 
due to their efficiency and accuracy (Gupta et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 
2021).  The  deep  learning  model  successfully  segments  and  classifies 
various objects at satisfying accuracy. AI-aided soil chip analysis does 
not only allow to study abundance and biodiversity measures following 
local treatments or large biogeographic variations, but even to investi-
gate direct interactions of microbes with each other, or with additives to 
the ecosystem, such as biochar or toxins that can be added into the chips. 
The  approach  can  be  extended  to  other  microbial  groups  including

3.2. Morphology 

The  deep  learning-based  image  analysis  can  instantly  extract 
morphology information such as cross-sectional area and axis length of 
single object. As shown in Fig. 5, a distinct discrepancy of size distri-
bution can be found between three locations. Both the Greenland and 
Swedish soils have a maximum abundance of bacterial cells at 2μm2. The 
Swedish soil has a larger fraction of bacteria with sizes less than 4μm2, 
whereas the Greenland soil/biocrust has a larger subpopulation of large 
bacteria of 4 μm2  to 6.5 μm2  and around 7 μm2  and generally a higher 
variation of cell sizes. In comparison, bacterial size in Kenya peaked at 
3 μm2  and  the  population’s  size  distribution  is  clearly  shifted  to  the 
larger sizes. Mean sizes over each population are 3.32 μm2, 2.50 μm2, and 
3.40 μm2  respectively.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, a large dataset was prepared using a partial training method where the model was initially trained on existing data and then used to annotate new data before further training. This resulted in a large dataset containing 540 training images and 141 validation images. Secondly, the dataset was manually checked and edited by a human to maintain its quality. Thirdly, due to the poor image quality of the Kenyan data, a separate smaller dataset consisting solely of Kenyan images was created to fine-tune the model specifically for this data. These steps helped improve the robustness and adaptability of the model across different datasets.
