Helpful Answer:

The deep learning model described uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. The model was trained using the stochastic gradient descent algorithm with the softmax cross-entropy loss function for 300 epochs. The batch size was set to 10, and a fixed learning rate of 0.01 was used. The convergence of the loss was visually assessed. The model had two fully connected (FC) layers with 512 and 256 units each, respectively. The dropout rate was determined through five-fold cross-validation. Additionally, it appears that the TensorFlow library version 2.5.0 was utilized for implementing the deep learning model.
