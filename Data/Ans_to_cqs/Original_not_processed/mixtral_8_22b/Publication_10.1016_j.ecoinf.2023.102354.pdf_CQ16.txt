3.10. Drought characteristics (severity, duration, and intensity) 

The regions  experiencing drought,  RED (measured in  percentage), 

were combined using drought indices for every timeframe and step.

RED (t) = 100*

g=1

Dc(t)*Rc

where  RED  represents  regions  experiencing  a  drought  with  time  t,  D 
represents drought (in the form of 0 or 1), R represents region, and g 
represents grid. Eq. 2 provides the percentage of regions experiencing 
drought, which determines the impact of drought in terms of its extent 
or  land  areas  affected  (in  percentage)  (e.g.,  Ndehedehe  et  al.,  2021; 
Wang et al., 2018). Drought severity, DS is evaluated for each drought 
event with t time, starting from ts and ending with te given in Eq. 3 (e.g., 
Diaz et al., 2019).

Here DD stands for drought duration in months, di for ith drought 
event  duration  and  N  for  total  drought  occurrences.  We  divided  the 
drought  in  this  study  into  different  intensities  (extreme,  severe,  and 
moderate), and their distribution was established on the drought criteria 
mentioned (e.g., Ndehedehe et al., 2021). Intensity (I) can be formulated 
as: 

I =

m

SPEIk

Where m represents the number of drought episodes, computed in 
months and the value of SPEIk  represents the SPEI below the threshold 
point  (i.e.,  (cid:0) 1),  and  intensity  is  dimensionless  (Mckee  et  al.,  1993). 
Based on these parameters, a drought is considered to exist when the 
drought  indicator  is  persistently  negative  and  reaches  a  value  of  (cid:0) 1, 
which is considered a moderate drought. A drought episode is consid-
ered  severe  when  the  number  falls  between  (cid:0) 1.5  and  (cid:0) 1.99  and 
extreme when it falls below (cid:0) 2.0. When the indicator turns positive, a 
drought episode comes to an end (Wang et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2015). 
Based on drought criteria, as mentioned by Mckee et al. (1993), each 
drought  occurrence  has  a  duration,  and  the  characteristics  of  the 
drought, including duration, extent and intensity, are investigated here.

Helpful Answer:

Answer: The provided context does not discuss any specific criteria for determining when training is complete. However, based on general machine learning principles, some common criteria for determining when training is complete include reaching a minimum validation loss, achieving a maximum accuracy or F1 score, or observing no further improvement in performance metrics over several epochs. These criteria may vary depending on the specific model and dataset being used. In the case of drought analysis, one possible criterion could be achieving a stable and consistent prediction of drought events across multiple timeframes and steps.
