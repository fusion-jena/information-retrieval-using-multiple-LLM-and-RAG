The dataset is then divided into training sets, which comprise 80% of 
the  data,  and  a  test  set  representing  the  remaining  20%,  in  order  to 
maximise model training while maintaining a sufficient amount of data 
for robust model validation (Adjuik and Davis, 2022; Fern´andez-L´opez 
et al., 2020). This division is done by random sampling to ensure that 
both subsets are representative of the overall dataset and minimise the 
risk  of  bias.  Randomisation  helps  to  preserve  the  distribution  of  key 
features  and  target  variables  across  both  training  and  test  sets, 
enhancing the generalisability of the model. We leverage the scikit-learn 
function GridSearchCV to meticulously fine-tune the hyperparameters of 
each model within the confines of the training set, aiming to enhance 
their predictive performance. A five-fold cross-validation is used and the 
negative mean square error is set as the target measure. Following this

hyperparameter optimisation process, the performance metrics detailed 
in Section 2.5 are meticulously evaluated using the designated test set. 
Subsequently, based on the performance metrics obtained, we discern 
and  select  the  most  effective  models  for  each  target  variable.  For  an 
illustrative overview of this model selection process, kindly refer to the 
visual representation provided in Fig. 4.

The regression hyperparameter tuning has been performed for all the 
nine prediction models (XGB, RF, SVR, GP, EN, KNN, MLP, Tree and LR), 
and  based  on  that,  the  best  regression  parameter  has  been  used  for 
training the model. 

As illustrated in Fig. 8, the x-axis denotes the sequence of observed 
values, and the y-axis represents the differences between the predicted 
and  observed values. As  can be seen, there  is a  constant trend  in the 
distribution of differences between predicted and observed values as the 
observed values increase on the X-axis. Particularly, the values on the Y- 
axis remain consistently close to 0, both above and below the reference 
line,  indicating  relative  stability  in  the  discrepancies  between  pre-
dictions and actual values across the range of observed values.

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, the criterion used to determine when training is complete is not explicitly mentioned. However, it does provide information about how the dataset is split into training and testing sets, with 80% of the data being used for training and the remaining 20% for testing. The training set is further subjected to hyperparameter optimization using GridSearchCV from scikit-learn, with a five-fold cross-validation and negative mean squared error as the target measure. After this optimization process, the performance metrics are evaluated using the test set. Based on these performance metrics, the most effective models for each target variable are selected. Therefore, it can be inferred that the completion of training might depend on achieving optimal hyperparameters or reaching a satisfactory level of performance according to the chosen evaluation metrics.
