A well-known method for further improving classiﬁcation
accuracy is to use an ensemble of models at the same time
and average their predictions. After training all of the nine
models for each stage, we formed an ensemble of the trained
models by averaging their predictions (SI Appendix, Prediction
Averaging). More details about the architectures, training meth-
ods, preprocessing steps, and the hyperparameters are in SI
Appendix, Preprocessing and Training. To enable other groups
to replicate our ﬁndings and harness this technology for their
own projects, we are publishing the software required to run
our experiments as freely available, open-source code. We are
also publishing the ﬁnal DNNs trained on SS so that others
can use them as is or for transfer learning. Both the code and
the models can be accessed at https://github.com/Evolving-AI-
Lab/deep learning for camera trap images.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The context does not provide explicit information regarding the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it is common practice in machine learning to randomly divide the dataset into three subsets: a training set, a validation set, and a testing set. Typically, the training set comprises around 60-80% of the total data, while the remaining data is divided equally between the validation and testing sets. This division allows the model to learn patterns from the majority of the data during training, validate its performance using the validation set, and finally evaluate its generalization capabilities on unseen data using the testing set. It should also be noted that the specific proportions may vary depending on factors such as the size of the dataset, the complexity of the task, and the desired balance between bias and variance.
