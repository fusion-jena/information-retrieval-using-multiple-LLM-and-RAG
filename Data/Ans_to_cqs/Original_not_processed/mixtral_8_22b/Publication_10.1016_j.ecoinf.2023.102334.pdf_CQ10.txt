In the above formula, the number of samples in a batch, the number 
of sample classes, the cosine factor, the cosine interval, the angle be-
tween the feature and the target weight, the angle between the feature, 
and the non-target weight are all denoted by the letters n, C, s, m, θyi , 
and θj, respectively. The network can concentrate its expressive power to

ViT  is the  first significant effort to employ  a  pure Transformer on 
pictures directly, showing that it can totally replace the conventional 
convolution processes with SOTA performance. The training of the va-
nilla ViT model, however, necessitates high computing costs, according 
to  the  experimental  findings.  As  a  result,  the  utilization  of  a  hybrid 
design  that  couples  the  Transformer  with  a  CNN  backbone  (such  as 
ResNet)  is  advocated  here.  The  Transformer  may  concentrate  on 
modelling global attention using the feature that ResNet extracted. Ac-
cording to the experimental findings, the hybrid approach can deliver 
better performance with comparatively less computing work. The main 
objective of this work was to create a model that accurately identifies 
sika deer using the idea.

nism (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). In contrast to CNN, ViT's Self Attention 
was  able  to  combine  the  data  from  the  entire  image,  and  accurately 
model  lengthy  sequence  information.  In  the  standard  ViT  model,  the 
relationship between distinct tokens was crucial since all images were 
turned into fixed-size tokens. By reusing the relationship matrix of the 
image  features,  the  lower  level  ViT  can  perform  more  accurate  rela-
tionship modelling. The images were converted into tokens in a process 
that  is  equivalent  to  downsampling.  A  larger  downsampling  multiple 
indicates that fewer tokens are obtained and more information is lost. 
When  more  tokens  are  acquired  and  the  downsampling  multiple  is 
lower, the lost information is less. When converting a picture to a token, 
the image's content is not taken into account. Such downsampling is too 
fine-grained for complicated pictures, which results in a loss of accuracy.
