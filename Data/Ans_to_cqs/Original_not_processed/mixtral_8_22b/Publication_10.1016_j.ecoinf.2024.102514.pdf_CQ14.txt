2.4.4. Model hyper-parameterization 

The present study employed a hyperparameter tuning methodology 
utilizing  grid  search  to  obtain  the  optimal  values  of  various  hyper-
parameter in order to improve the model(s) performance. Many studies 
have  employed  the  grid  search  approach  to  optimize  the  hyper- 
parameters  of  the  model,  as  this  technique  assesses  the  model's 

performance for each grid cell (Abbaszadeh et al., 2022; Uddin et al., 
2022a).

2.4.5.3. Model efficiency analysis. For the purposes of model efficiency 
analysis, the present study utilized the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) 
index and model efficiency factor (MEF) for identifying the best algo-
rithm based on prediction errors. Recently, several studies have utilized 
these  techniques  to  select  the  best  model  (Sharif  et  al.,  2022;  Uddin 
et al., 2023c). Generally, the NSE determination value ranges from -∞ to 
1, where the worst value = - ∞, and the best value = 1. On the other 
hand, the MEF determination value ranges from 0 to 1, where a value 
close  to  0 of  MEF indicates significant  model performance.  Details  of 
these techniques can be found in Sanchez-Gonzalez et al. (2007). The 
equation of NSE (Eq. (6)) and MEF (Eq. (7)) is as follows: 

NSE = 1 (cid:0)

Helpful Answer:
The hyperparameters of the model were optimized using a hyperparameter tuning methodology utilizing grid search. Grid search is a technique used to find the optimal values of various hyperparameters by evaluating the model's performance for each grid cell. This approach has been widely used in many studies to optimize the hyperparameters of machine learning models. By employing grid search, the present study aimed to improve the model's performance by finding the most suitable hyperparameters.
