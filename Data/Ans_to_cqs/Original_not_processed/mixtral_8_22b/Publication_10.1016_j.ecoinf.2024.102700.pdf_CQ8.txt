Science and SCOPUS), curating specific search terms and synonyms and
used Boolean operators and wildcards (asterisks) to account for word
variants and plural forms. Additional information on search strategy are
provided in the Appendix A along with Table S1 showing all the terms
included in the final search. The literature search was conducted in
January 2023 and considered all studies currently available in the two
databases until 31 December 2022. We did not add any language filters/
restrictions to the search strategy developed so that scientific literature
with an abstract in English but a full text in other languages was
potentially included in the search. Except for conference proceedings,
we did not include grey literature (technical reports, dissertations)
because we wanted to limit our search to the most relevant and
advanced scientific applications on the topic, given the extensive liter-
ature already available.

2.3. Screening process

surveys, they are abundant and have become increasingly available,
thereby constituting promising data sources. Simultaneously, they
exhibit poor quality, lack comprehensive metadata, and often originate
from various sources, necessitating careful consideration due to several
biases. These biases encompass uncertainty in species identification
(resulting from the absence of expert-collected data), improper design,
bias towards most accessible areas, low or unknown sample location
accuracy, incomplete or uneven spatial coverage of the true distribution
of a species, and the potential presence of spatial autocorrelation in
sample locations (Guisan et al., 2017). All these biases must be evalu-
ated and addressed, and a cautious interpretation of these data becomes
imperative (Barve et al., 2011).

field but also serves as a valuable tool for those interested in modelling the distribution of these magnificent and
enigmatic animals, as well as other cryptic species, offering insights that can guide researchers in making
informed decisions in the realm of SDMs.

Query: "Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: Unfortunately, based on the provided context, there is no mention of where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It could potentially be found in one of the databases mentioned, such as Web of Science and Scopus, but without further information, it cannot be determined exactly where it is located.
