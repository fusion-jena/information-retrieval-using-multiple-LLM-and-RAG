Recently, some approaches have been proposed to evaluate the interpretability of deep learning  models33,34 
including methods based on model decomposition, sensitivity analysis, and feature visualisation. The relevance of 
network inputs can for example be obtained by the gradient-based sensitivity analysis (GBSA), which computes 
the prediction function squared partial derivatives with a standard gradient  backpropagation35. The Layer-wise 
Relevance Propagation (LRP)36 propagates the prediction backward in the neural network using propagation 
rules until the input features are reached. Arras et al.37 proposed a LRP for LSTM networks that provided better 
results than the GBSA on a five-class prediction task. Class activation maps were used to point out the most 
discriminative regions used by a CNN to identify a  class38.

The use of deep learning (DL) approaches for the analysis of remote sensing (RS) data is rapidly 
increasing. DL techniques have provided excellent results in applications ranging from parameter 
estimation to image classification and anomaly detection. Although the vast majority of studies report 
precision indicators, there is a lack of studies dealing with the interpretability of the predictions. This 
shortcoming hampers a wider adoption of DL approaches by a wider users community, as model’s 
decisions are not accountable. In applications that involve the management of public budgets or 
policy compliance, a better interpretability of predictions is strictly required. This work aims to deepen 
the understanding of a recurrent neural network for land use classification based on Sentinel‑2 time 
series in the context of the European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). This permits to address
