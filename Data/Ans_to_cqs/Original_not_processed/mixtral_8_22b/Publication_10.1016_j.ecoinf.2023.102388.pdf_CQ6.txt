• No-overfitting. In this setting, the optimization algorithm of CNNs is 
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), with a learning rate of 0.0001 
and a weight decay of 0.5. The batch size is set to 32, the number of 
training epochs to 200 and finally the batch-norm and dropout (0.5) 
are used to reduce the overfitting level.  

• Overfitting.  We  use  the  same  hyperparameters  setting  as  the  no- 
overfitting  but  we  remove  the  use  of  batch-norm,  weight  decay 
and dropout techniques to ensure that the model overfits.

The traditional way of training machine learning models normally 
aims at avoiding the overfitting phenomenon (Ravoor and T.S.B., 2020; 
Santos and Papa, 2022). Indeed, the main concern about overfitting is 
that it occurs when the model performs well on the training data but 
generalizes  poorly  on  unseen  samples  (i.e.,  test  set).  In  the  privacy 
domain,  overfitting  has  also  been  shown  to  make  the  model  more 
vulnerable to privacy attacks as it results in the model memorizing more 
information  about  the  training  set  (Shokri  et  al.,  2017;  Song  et  al., 
2019).

Strengthening the ability of trained models to generalize effectively 
poses  a  significant  challenge  within  the  domain  of  deep  learning. 
Indeed, generalization refers to the variation in a model’s performance 
when applied to data it has been trained on, as opposed to data it en-
counters for the first time during testing. This issue is of fundamental 
importance and has far-reaching implications for applications employ-
ing  deep  neural  networks.  In  particular,  this  challenge  becomes

prominent  in  demanding  tasks  like  the  re-identification  of  marine 
mammals in underwater environments. 

The  challenge  of  generalization  often  arises  as  a  consequence  of 
network overfitting during the training phase. In simplified terms, the 
network’s  weight  parameters  are  adjusted to  optimize  their  fit  to  the 
provided training examples, thus effectively “memorizing” the training 
data. However, when applied to new and unseen data during testing, the 
network’s  response  exhibits  a  more  balanced  consideration  of  the 
diverse training examples. This discrepancy frequently leads to dimin-
ished performance on the test dataset and might persist even after the 
network  has undergone  prolonged training over  numerous epochs.  In 
recent  years,  significant  research  endeavors  have  been  dedicated  to 
mitigating overfitting challenges to enhance model generalization.

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be taken to improve its performance and prevent issues such as overfitting or poor convergence. These steps may include:

1. Data Cleaning: Removing irrelevant, redundant, or corrupted data from the dataset. This step ensures that only high-quality data is used for training the model.

2. Normalization/Scaling: Scaling input features so they fall within a specific range, typically between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. This helps maintain balance among different feature scales and improves the speed and stability of gradient descent algorithms.

3. Feature Engineering: Creating new features based on existing ones to better capture patterns in the data. For example, converting categorical variables into numerical representations using one-hot encoding or label encoding.

4. Data Augmentation: Generating additional synthetic data by applying transformations such as rotation, flipping, zooming, etc., to increase the diversity of the training dataset and help prevent overfitting.

5. Batch Normalization: Applying normalization to each mini-batch of inputs independently, which reduces internal covariate shift and speeds up training. It also acts as a regularizer, reducing the need for other forms of regularization.

6. Dropout: Randomly dropping out neurons during training to prevent complex co-adaptations between neurons and reduce overfitting.

While not all these steps are necessary for every deep learning project, understanding them will enable you to choose appropriate preprocessing methods tailored to your specific problem and dataset.
