Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

• No-overfitting. In this setting, the optimization algorithm of CNNs is 
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), with a learning rate of 0.0001 
and a weight decay of 0.5. The batch size is set to 32, the number of 
training epochs to 200 and finally the batch-norm and dropout (0.5) 
are used to reduce the overfitting level.  

• Overfitting.  We  use  the  same  hyperparameters  setting  as  the  no- 
overfitting  but  we  remove  the  use  of  batch-norm,  weight  decay 
and dropout techniques to ensure that the model overfits.

6.2. Model generalization capability

Strengthening the ability of trained models to generalize effectively 
poses  a  significant  challenge  within  the  domain  of  deep  learning. 
Indeed, generalization refers to the variation in a model’s performance 
when applied to data it has been trained on, as opposed to data it en-
counters for the first time during testing. This issue is of fundamental 
importance and has far-reaching implications for applications employ-
ing  deep  neural  networks.  In  particular,  this  challenge  becomes

Helpful Answer:
The paper uses Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) as the optimization algorithm for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). For the no-overfitting scenario, the learning rate is set to 0.0001, while for the overfitting scenario, the learning rate is set to 0.001. Both scenarios have a weight decay of 0.5. The batch size is consistently set to 32, and the number of training epochs is set to 200. To prevent overfitting, batch normalization and dropout (with a probability of 0.5) are employed in the no-overfitting scenario. However, these techniques are not utilized in the overfitting scenario. Furthermore, the paper mentions using a momentum of 0.9 and applying a decay of 0.5 every 512 iterations, resulting in a total of 2048 iterations.
