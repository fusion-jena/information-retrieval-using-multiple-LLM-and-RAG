The  results  indicate  that  the  Cascade  RCNN  outperformed  other 
models at each training stage, while the FCOS model and Sparse CNN 
model consistently had lower mAP scores than others. This is consistent 
with  the  findings  of  Section  3.1.  Although  12  epochs  were  a  typical 
number of training times, almost all models reached the maximum mAP 
when the number of epochs reached 10. Therefore, for bird recognition, 
not  all  models  are  better  with  more  training  times,  and  choosing 

appropriate  training  times  for  different  models  is  beneficial  to  save 
computing resources. Specifically, the Cascade RCNN model had almost 
no  increase  in  the  mAP  at  9  epochs,  and  the  Faster  CNN  model  also 
showed a similar trend. However, the ATSS and RepPoint growth curves 
continued to 12 epochs, suggesting they require more training data or a 
longer training schedule to perform better.

5. Conclusion 

In this study, we proposed a dataset comprising 9717 images of 15 
wild bird species acquired by camera traps in Chinaâ€™s Northeast Tiger 
and Leopard National Park. Based on this dataset, we employed 8 deep 
learning algorithms for bird object detection and evaluated their per-
formance.  Our  results  indicate  that  deep  learning-based  approaches 
have the potential to detect wild birds in camera traps efficiently. By 
applying  these  approaches,  manual  processing  costs  can  be  reduced, 
enabling  more  efficient  monitoring  of  wildlife  populations  over  wide 
areas and over time. Our findings can help conservation practitioners 
choose  appropriate  models  for  their  detection  tasks,  as  well  as  offer 
insight  on  the  use  of  deep  learning-based  technologies  to  improve 
wildlife monitoring and environmental protection.

their performance in complex, real-world ecological settings. In recent 
years, deep learning-based approaches, such as YOLO (Redmon et al., 
2016) (one-stage) and Faster RCNN (two-stage) (Ren et al., 2015), have 
been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance in object detection 
tasks.  Two-stage  and  one-stage  object  detection  are  two  popular  ap-
proaches for detecting objects in images (Fig. 2).

Helpful Answer: The article does not provide explicit information about the specific preprocessing steps used before training the deep learning models. However, common practices in image classification and object detection tasks often involve resizing images to a standard size, converting them into grayscale or applying color augmentation techniques, normalizing pixel values, and splitting datasets into training and validation sets. These preprocessing steps may vary depending on the chosen architecture and task requirements.
