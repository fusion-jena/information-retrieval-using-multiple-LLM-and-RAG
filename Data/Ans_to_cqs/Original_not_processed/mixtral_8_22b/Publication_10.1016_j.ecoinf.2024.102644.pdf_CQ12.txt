4.3. Advantages and drawbacks 

4.3.1. Model prediction beyond the training ranges

Big-data mining approaches based on Artificial Intelligence models can help forecast biodiversity changes before 
they happen. These approaches can predict macroscopic species distribution patterns and trends that can inform 
preventive measures to avoid the loss of ecosystem functions and services. They can, therefore, help study and 
mitigate climate change implications on biodiversity conservation in fragile ecosystems. Wetlands are particu-
larly fragile ecosystems where climate change poses severe risks and has dramatically reduced their size over the 
past  century,  with  profound  consequences  on  biodiversity  and  ecosystem  services.  Through  big-data  mining 
approaches,  we  can  predict  future  wetland  biodiversity  trends  in  the  context  of  climate  change.  This  paper 
proposes such predictive analysis for a specific wetland: The Massaciuccoli Lake basin in Tuscany, Italy. This

basin is a critical tourist attraction due to its rich biodiversity, making it an area of interest for citizens, tourists, 
and scientists. However, the region’s suitability for native and non-native species is at risk due to climate and 
land-use change. Using machine-learning models, we predict the potential effects of climate change on animal 
spatial  distribution  in  the  basin  under  different  greenhouse  gas  emission  scenarios.  The  results  suggest  that 
habitat suitability has generally improved from 1950 to today, presumably owing to the targeted conservation 
strategies adopted in the area, but climate change will severely reduce bird biodiversity by 2050 while favouring 
several insect species’ proliferation and other species’ habitat change, even under a medium-emission scenario. 
This will lead to significant changes in the basin’s biodiversity. Our methodology is adaptable to other wetland

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific type of deep learning model used in the proposed pipeline. It only mentions that machine-learning models were employed to predict the potential effects of climate change on animal spatial distribution in the Massaciuccoli Lake basin. Therefore, without further details or additional context, it cannot be determined whether a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Transformer, or any other deep learning model was utilized in this particular study.
