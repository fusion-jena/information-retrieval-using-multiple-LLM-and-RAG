7,047,754 learnable parameters gave a F1-score of 84.93% which is even lower. CNN
architectures with many parameters (more than 20,000,000) such as ResNetV50 [38] and
InceptionNetV3 [39] gave a high training accuracy, but a lower validation F1-score of 69.1%
and 81.7%, respectively. This result indicates overﬁtting and that more training data are
needed when such large deep learning networks are used. A very high F1-score of 96.6%
was ﬁnally achieved by transfer learning on ResNetV50 using pretrained weights and only
training the output layers. This indicates that the state-of-the-art was able to outperform
our proposed model, but requires pretrained weights with many more parameters.

Finally, the customized CNN architectures were compared with selected state-of-
the-art CNN optimized architectures. EfﬁcientNetB0 [36] is scaled to work with a small
image input size of 224 × 224 pixel and has 4,030,358 learnable parameters. Using the
moths dataset with the same data augmentation, the EfﬁcientNetB0 achieved a F1-score
of 88.62%, which is lower than our top ﬁve best architectures. DenceNet121 [37] with

To ﬁnd the best CNN architecture for species classiﬁcation, different hyperparameters
were adjusted as described in Section 2.2.3. A total of 64 architectures were trained using a
dropout probability of 0.3 after the second to last hidden layer. The average F1-score for all
classes was used as a measure for a given architecture’s performance.

The ﬁve best architectures had high F1-scores, which only varied by 0.02, but had a
varying number of learnable parameters (Table 2). Compared to SGD, Adam turned out to
be the superior optimizer for training of all models. In the end, the architecture that had
a rating among the three highest F1-score but the lowest amount of learnable parameters
(2,197,578) was chosen. The reason for this is that an architecture with many parameters
and few training data would increase the risk of overﬁtting the neural network.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the provided context, it does not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning models. However, there are some clues about possible preprocessing techniques used. For instance, the text mentions that the moths dataset was used with the same data augmentation while comparing the customized CNN architectures with selected state-of-the-art CNN optimized architectures. Data augmentation is a technique used to artificially expand the size of a dataset by applying various transformations like rotation, zooming, flipping, etc., to the existing images. Additionally, the use of dropout probability of 0.3 after the second to last hidden layer suggests that regularization techniques might have been employed during the training process to prevent overfitting. Dropout is a commonly used regularization method where randomly selected neurons are ignored or 'dropped out' during training to reduce interdependent learning amongst them. Lastly, the fact that the average F1-score was used as a measure for a given architecture's performance implies that the target variable could be imbalanced, requiring appropriate handling during preprocessing. Therefore, although the exact preprocessing steps are not mentioned, we can infer that data augmentation, regularization methods, and possibly handling imbalance in the target variable might have been part of the preprocessing pipeline.
