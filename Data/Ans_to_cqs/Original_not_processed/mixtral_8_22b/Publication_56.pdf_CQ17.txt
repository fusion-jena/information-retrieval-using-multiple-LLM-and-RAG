Recently, some approaches have been proposed to evaluate the interpretability of deep learning  models33,34 
including methods based on model decomposition, sensitivity analysis, and feature visualisation. The relevance of 
network inputs can for example be obtained by the gradient-based sensitivity analysis (GBSA), which computes 
the prediction function squared partial derivatives with a standard gradient  backpropagation35. The Layer-wise 
Relevance Propagation (LRP)36 propagates the prediction backward in the neural network using propagation 
rules until the input features are reached. Arras et al.37 proposed a LRP for LSTM networks that provided better 
results than the GBSA on a five-class prediction task. Class activation maps were used to point out the most 
discriminative regions used by a CNN to identify a  class38.

These analyses help to understand the behaviour of deep learning models in agricultural applications. In par-
ticular, in the CAP activities in which payments to farmers must be well-founded, the use of classification models 
providing explainable predictions are of great interest. The conducted work not only confirm well established 
knowledge in remote sensing science but also opens the door to new studies in the field of the comprehensibility 
of deep learning algorithms in agricultural and environmental applications.

sample with its corresponding remote sensing sequence of data. Finally, 70% of the data were used for training 
the algorithms whereas the remaining 30% were used only for validation.

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, it is common practice in deep learning to employ various regularization techniques to mitigate overfitting and improve generalization performance. Regularization methods include weight decay (also known as L2 regularization), dropout, early stopping, and batch normalization. These techniques aim to constrain the complexity of the learned model, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting.

Weight decay (L2 regularization) adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights, encouraging smaller weights and thus simpler models. Dropout randomly sets a fraction of neurons to zero during each iteration of training, effectively creating an ensemble of sub-models and preventing co-adaptation between neurons. Early stopping halts the training process when the validation error stops decreasing, avoiding unnecessary iterations and potential overfitting. Batch normalization scales and shifts the activations of each layer, improving convergence speed and stability while acting as a form of regularization.

In summary, although the provided context does not directly discuss regularization methods for preventing overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, commonly employed techniques include weight decay (L2 regularization), dropout, early stopping, and batch normalization. Each method serves to control the complexity of the learned model and enhance its ability to generalize from the training data to unseen examples.
