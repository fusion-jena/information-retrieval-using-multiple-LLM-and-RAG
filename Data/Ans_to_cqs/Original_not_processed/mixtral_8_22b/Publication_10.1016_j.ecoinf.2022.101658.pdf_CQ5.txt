our study, is due to the deep learning method’s loss function, which is 
biased toward overrepresented classes. This represents a performance 
barrier for any study using semantic segmentation with few images and 
high class-imbalance.

in  semantic  segmentation  training  and 
testing were limited to data collected at PM

The  semantic  segmentation  deep  convolutional  neural  network 
trained  using  the  manually segmented  nadir images  from  PM  and  CL 
field sites was evaluated on 40 images reserved for testing, using two 
standard metrics from computer vision: mean intersection over union 
(mIoU),  which  is  the  proportion  of  overlap  between  the  manually 
segmented  photo  and  the  prediction  output;  and  accuracy,  which  is 
calculated as the proportion of pixels in the image that were correctly 
classified. We obtained an overall mIoU of 0.352, a rather low value, but 
an accuracy of 0.95, indicating that 95% of the pixels were classified 
correctly and that our trained model accurately predicts the prominent 
vegetation  classes  in  individual  images.  A  low  mIoU  value  can  be 
misleading since it assigns equal weights to every type of ground cover, 
irrespective of its proportion in an image. Table 3 shows the same per-

Helpful Answer:
In this study, the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned as popular datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the authors use custom datasets consisting of field measurements and raw photos collected at three different field sites: Pelican Mountain (PM), Calling Lake (CL), and Conklin (CK). The manual classification of fuel types used in semantic segmentation training and testing were limited to data collected at PM and CL. Additionally, field measurement data and raw photos from the CK field site were used solely for independent validation. Therefore, the specific datasets used in this study are unique to the research and not publicly available benchmark datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
