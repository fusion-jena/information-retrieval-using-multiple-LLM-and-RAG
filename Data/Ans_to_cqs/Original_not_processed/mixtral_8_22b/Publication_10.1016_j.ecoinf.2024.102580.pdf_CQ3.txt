et al., 2023; Hodgson et al., 2018; Ventura et al., 2018). These two deep 
learning approaches require initial ground-truth datasets consisting of 
annotated images, which are used to train a model that iteratively im-
proves  by  evaluating  its  output  against the  provided  annotations  and 
adjusting its parameters to match the desired output. Once trained, the 
models can be applied to new datasets for automatic classification, of-
fering  flexibility  and  power  by  learning  directly  from  image  output. 
Recent advancements in open-source user frameworks have made deep 
learning more accessible (Christin et al., 2019; Paszke et al., 2019; Perry 
et al., 2022). With this study, we aim to further stimulate the uptake of 
deep  learning  techniques  in  ecology  and  conservation  by  providing 
open-access scripts that can be adapted to various ecosystems, including 
challenging coastal environments.

4.3. Limitations of deep learning methods 

High accuracy was achieved in classifying vegetation and bare sub-
strate, but the classification of the ‘other’  class (reflecting rocks, coral 
and debris) was less successful. This is likely due to fewer pixels of this 
class being present in the images, resulting in lower-quality training data 
for  this  class.  This  limitation  highlights  the  importance  of  quality 
training data in deep learning. Creating accurate annotated imagery for 
training  can  be  time-consuming,  however,  new  tools  are  continually 
being  developed,  which  utilise  artificial  intelligence  to  assist  in  the 
annotation of ground-truth images, such as ©v7 labs (www.v7labs.com) 
and ©AnyLabeling (AI Curious, 2023).

Helpful Answer: The text does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in their deep learning pipeline. However, it does state that they use "annotated images" for training their models, which suggests that some form of manual or automated annotation process was employed. Given that the authors discuss semantic segmentation for vegetation mapping, it can be inferred that pixel-level annotation might have been utilized. Additionally, the paper mentions limitations related to the 'other' class, indicating that multiple classes were involved in the annotation process. Unfortunately, without explicit information on the exact annotation technique used, one cannot definitively state whether bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, or other methods were implemented.
