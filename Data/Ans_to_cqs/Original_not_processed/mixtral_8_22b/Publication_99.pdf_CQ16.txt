ratios on the test set. Despite this trend, the PSNR of the Pix2Pix model 
was observed to be consistently better than that of the Pconv models. 
However,  while  looking  at  the  standard  deviation,  the  Pconv  models 
seemed to have more stable PSNR results compared to that of Pix2Pix 
model. The observed behavior depicts the challenging task of training 
GANs models.

3.3.3. Classification 

Pretrained classification models such as VGG16 have demonstrated 
to perform well on various plant species identification tasks (Pang and 
Lim,  2019).  To  train  our  classification  model,  we  adapted  the  vgg16 
network  pre-trained  on  ImageNet  dataset  (Simonyan  and  Zisserman, 
2014). The fully connected layers of the networks were replaced with a 
global max-pooling layer, a dropout layer with a dropout ratio of 0.5 as a 
network regularizer and single hidden layer with a total of 256 units for 
a larger image sized model(512 × 512) and 128 units for a smaller image 
size model (256 × 256). Both networks were trained for 20 epochs with 
a  batch  size  of 32  and  various data augmentation  techniques such as 
height and width shift, flipping, zooming and brightness changes were

image with ImageNet values and then rescaled between 0 and 1. Since 
our dataset was balanced, both networks were trained with a learning

Query: "What criteria are used to determine when training is complete (e.g., validation loss plateau)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly state the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it can be inferred that the training process continues until a certain number of epochs are reached. For instance, the classification networks are trained for 20 epochs. Additionally, the use of early stopping or monitoring validation metrics like validation loss could also be employed to decide when to stop training, but these are not mentioned explicitly in the given context.
