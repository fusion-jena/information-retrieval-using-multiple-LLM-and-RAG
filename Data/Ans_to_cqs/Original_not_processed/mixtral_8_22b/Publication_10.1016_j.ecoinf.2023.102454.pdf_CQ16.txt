Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide information on the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, common criteria include reaching a validation loss plateau, achieving a desired level of accuracy or performance, or exceeding a predetermined number of epochs or iterations. These criteria can vary depending on the specific machine learning model and task.
