Access  to  required  computing  resources  is  another  challenge. 
Training  deep  neural  networks  for  semantic  segmentation  and  object 
detection traditionally requires expensive computational resources with 
multiple high-end GPUs (e.g., available on high-performance computing

%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of which specific cloud platform or service provider was used to deploy the deep learning model. The text only mentions that training deep neural networks typically requires expensive computational resources such as multiple high-end GPUs often available on high-performance computing clusters. Therefore, without additional context, we cannot determine the exact platform used to deploy the deep learning model.
