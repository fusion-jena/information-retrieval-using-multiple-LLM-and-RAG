observations where the dominant type occupies more than 55% of a grid 
cell. In addition, for all complete observations, we individually measure 
prediction errors for each vegetation cover type and separately measure 
errors for non-zero and zero-valued targets. Such approach allows us to 
dissect the effects of predictive performance: (1) whether the types that 
can grow in a given environment are predicted correctly, and (2) to what 
extent  the  relative  shares  of  those  types  in  a  given  environment  are 
predicted correctly. 

The  scheme  or  performance  evaluation  with  simplified  numerical 

examples is provided in Fig. 6.

4.2. Performance of predictive models 

The performance of compared predictive models is summarized in 
Tables 2–4. When using only complete targets for training, the MAE of 
complete  observations  of  the  test  set  is  the  lowest.  However,  experi-
mental  results  on  evaluating  the  prediction  accuracy  of  dominant 
vegetation  cover  types  show  that  using  this  approach,  the  prediction 
accuracy of incomplete observations is more than 10% less than using 
other approaches. This suggests that complete observations do not carry 
full information about the distribution of the natural vegetation cover 
worldwide.  It  confirms  existing  findings  (Nikoloski  et  al.,  2021)  that 
better performance can be achieved if incompletely labeled data is used 
in model training instead of discarding it.

An example training instance for different weakly-labeled settings. Here yj indicates the targets of an instance. Red indicates an 
error in the training data (deviation from ground truth) – it is not known to the user where errors occur. Note that in the weak 
j=1yj = 1 and yj⩾0). In our setting 
label setting, only 0s may be errors. Shading represents a constraint (in this example, that 
(structurally incomplete), the constraint may not be met, but errors are neither random deviations. Mixtures of these settings 
are possible, e.g., we may have structurally incomplete with missing labels, etc.
