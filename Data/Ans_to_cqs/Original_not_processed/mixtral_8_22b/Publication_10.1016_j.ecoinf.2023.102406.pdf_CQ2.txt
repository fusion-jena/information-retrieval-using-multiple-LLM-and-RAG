1.4. Modeling approaches 

Modeling also includes selection of the classifier (or probability of 
occurrence estimator), which encompasses hundreds of different options 
(FernÂ´andez-Delgado  et  al.,  2014),  although  general  linear  models, 
MaxEnt,  and  random  forests  are  among  the  most  commonly  applied 
classifiers  (Santini  et  al.,  2021).  For  the  selected  classifier,  modeling 
package  options  enable  automated  tuning  for  parameters  through 
resampling and standard default values to reach the most accurate final 
model configuration. Multiple methods may be applied to detect over-
lapping outcomes, allowing some strength of evidence within a study 
rather  than  only  comparing  support  from  other  studies,  but  multiple 
methods may be too burdensome when hundreds or thousands of models 
are generated due to numerous species, predictor variable combinations, 
and time intervals.

%Query
Query: "What data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., image, audio, video, CSV)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The information provided does not specify the type of data format used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the data format used is image, audio, video, CSV, or any other format.

Based on the given context, we can see that the author discusses various aspects of ecological modeling, including selecting classifiers, using modeling packages, and applying multiple methods to detect overlapping outcomes. However, there is no mention of the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, without additional context, it is impossible to determine what data formats were used in this particular case.
