speed is increased by 11 times, and the number of parameters is reduced 
by  1/6.8  (Tan  and  Le,  2021).  Based  on  this  network,  we  designed  a 
backbone  to  improve  the  training  speed  of  the  model  while  ensuring 
detection accuracy and speed.

EfficientnetV2 is an efficient, lightweight feature extraction network. 
The  EfficientNet  series  comprises  a  set  of  lightweight  convolutional 
neural networks. In the EfficientNetV1 series, Googleâ€™s focus was pre-
dominantly on optimizing the accuracy, parameter count, and compu-
tational  requirements  of  the  model  (Tan  and  Le,  2019).  The 
EfficientNetV2  series  further  reduces  the  number  of  parameters  and 
computations  while  preserving  the  accuracy  of  the  model,  leading  to 
significant  decreases  in  model  training  and  inference  duration. 
Furthermore, the EfficientNetV2 network uses an improved progressive 
learning approach that dynamically adjusts the regularization method 
based on the training image size. This method can improve the training 
speed  and  accuracy  of  the  network.  Compared  with  some  previous 
networks, the experimental results of this method show that the training

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, or validation sets. However, generally, in machine learning and deep learning models, the dataset is often divided into three subsets: training, validation, and testing datasets.

The training dataset is used to fit the model, i.e., to learn the relationship between input features and target variables. The validation dataset is used during the model development phase to fine-tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Lastly, the testing dataset is used after the final model has been selected to evaluate its performance on unseen data.

Typical criteria used to split the data include random sampling, stratified sampling, or time-series based splitting. Random sampling involves randomly selecting instances from the entire dataset to create each subset. Stratified sampling ensures that each subset maintains the same class distribution as the original dataset. Time-series based splitting is useful when dealing with sequential data, where the order of observations matters.

Without specific details regarding the dataset or the problem domain, it is difficult to determine which criterion would be most appropriate for splitting the data in this case.
