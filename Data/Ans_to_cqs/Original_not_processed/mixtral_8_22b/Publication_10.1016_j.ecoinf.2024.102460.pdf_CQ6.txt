4.3.3. LSTM model 

The  long  short-term  memory  (LSTM)  model  is  a  common  deep 
learning model used to solve the prediction problem of time series data 
(Tang  et  al.,  2023).  Compared  with  traditional  machine  learning 
models, the LSTM model has better performance and ability to manage 
the  prediction  problem  of  time  series  data,  especially  the  long-term 
dependency  problem  and  multivariate  time  series  data,  and  has 
obvious  advantages  (Liu  et  al.,  2021;  Tang  et  al.,  2023;  Zhou  et  al., 
2023). Fig. 3 shows the prediction process of the LSTM model and the BP 
model.  This  study  compares  these  two  models  and  the  Markov  chain 
model.

5.2. Land type conversion drivers 

We  added  the  extracted  land  type  expansion  raster  to  LEAS  and 
imported  the  driver  raster  map.  Subsequently,  the  RFC  was  used  to 
obtain the probability of development and the contribution of drivers for 
each land category. We also set the sampling rate to 0.1, the number of 
decision trees to 20, the number of features used to train the random 
forest to 9, and the number of parallels to 12 to improve the execution 
speed. In summary, the contribution rates and root mean square errors 
of each driving factor to the expansion of each land type were obtained 
(Fig. 6). The root mean square error (RMSE) of the PLUS model's analysis 
of the drivers of expansion for the six land types in the YRB-SX for the 
years  2000–2010  and  2010–2020  was  less  than  0.2,  and  the  model 
performed well. 

The higher the variable contribution rate is, the greater the impact of

The cellular automata (CA) model has received widespread attention 
for its effectiveness in simulating land use expansion (Deep and Saklani, 
2014). The CA model and the Markov chain prediction model (Markov- 
CA) can be used to forecast land conversion under different scenarios 
(Deep  and  Saklani,  2014;  Ghosh  et  al.,  2017).  In  addition,  the  paral-
lelized  urban land  use simulation (PLUS) model,  which combines  the 
Markov-CA  model  and  the  random  forest  classifier  (RFC)  forecasting 
method, has been widely applied (Liang et al., 2021; Nie et al., 2023). 
The  PLUS  model,  which  combines  spatial  econometrics  and  environ-
mental science, provides an excellent data mining framework and land 
evolution  mechanism  and  can  predict  land  conversion  trends  more 
accurately  (Xu  et  al.,  2023a).  However,  as  the  PLUS  model  uses  the 
Markov chain prediction model to infer future land use conversion, it

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps may be required depending on the specific application and dataset. These steps help ensure that the input data is suitable for the model and can lead to improved performance. Some common preprocessing techniques include:

1. Data Cleaning: Removing or correcting erroneous, missing, or inconsistent data points from the dataset. This step helps maintain data quality and prevent any potential issues during model training.

2. Normalization/Scaling: Scaling numerical values to a standard range (usually between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1), ensuring all features have similar magnitudes. Common methods include Min-Max scaling, z-score normalization, and log transformation. Normalization improves convergence speed and overall model performance by reducing the effect of outliers and maintaining feature balance.

3. Feature Engineering: Creating new features based on existing ones to capture additional information or relationships within the data. Examples include polynomial features, interaction terms, or binning continuous variables into categorical ones. Properly engineered features can significantly enhance model accuracy and interpretability.

4. Encoding Categorical Variables: Converting categorical variables into numerical representations, such as one-hot encoding or label encoding. This allows the model to handle both numerical and categorical inputs effectively.

5. Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing the number of input features while preserving essential information. Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) can simplify complex datasets and reduce computational requirements.

6. Data Augmentation: Generating synthetic samples by applying transformations to the original data, such as rotations, translations, or noise injection. Data augmentation increases dataset size and diversity, improving model robustness and generalizability.

These preprocessing steps should be tailored to the specific needs of the project and chosen carefully to avoid introducing bias or overfitting.
