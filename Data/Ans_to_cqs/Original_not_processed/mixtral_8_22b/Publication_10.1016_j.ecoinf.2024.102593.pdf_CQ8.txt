accuracy  limits  that  we  encountered  training  DNN  models  with  the 
detailed-labelled NIPS4Bplus dataset (Bravo Sanchez et al., 2021). We 
drilled down on the results using another high-quality model (BirdNET) 
and  compared  it  to  our  SincNet  trained  models.  For  that,  we  experi-
mented  with  dimensionality  reduction  of  embeddings  and  an  initial 
dimensionality reduction technique (t-SNE). We generated embeddings

%Query
Query: "Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The code repository of the deep learning pipeline used in this research is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. However, one of the references cited in the text mentions a GitHub repository related to bird sounds: 'Google Creative Lab/AI Experiments Bird Sounds, 2016. <https://github.com/googlecreativelab/aiexperiments-bird-sounds>.' It is possible that this repository contains some relevant code or resources, but without further information, I cannot confirm if this is the exact code repository used for the deep learning pipeline in this study.
