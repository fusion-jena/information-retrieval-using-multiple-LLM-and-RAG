The root trimmed mean squared prediction error (RTMSPE) is uti-
lized to select the appropriate values for the tuning parameters τ and ϕ, 
removing  the  impact  of  heterogeneous  observations.  The  RTMSPE  is 
defined as follows:

To simultaneously carry out shrinkage estimation and variable se-
lection,  we  employ  the  penalized  loss  function  with  an  L1  penalty 
(Tibshirani, 1996), defined as follows:

where lΞ  is the loss function minimized by solving the estimating eqs. (2)

and (3), and is given by eq. (10) in Appendix A. We set ϕ0
ϕ (k ∕= 0, ϕ ≥ 0) as a constant tuning parameter. The loss function has no 
penalties for the intercept parameter β0 of the intensity function and the 
coefficient  paramter  α  for  the  detection  probability  model.  We  can 
compute the L1  penalized estimates using the gradient ascent method 
(Goeman,  2010).  The  detailed  computation  algorithm  is  provided  in 
Appendix C.
