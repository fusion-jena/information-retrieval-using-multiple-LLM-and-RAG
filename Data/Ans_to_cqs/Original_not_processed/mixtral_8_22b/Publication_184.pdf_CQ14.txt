Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

In  order  to  train  the  model,  it  is important to provide not only 
the  class  of  the  object  but  also  the  bounding  box  data  of  the 
object  as  correct  answer.  In  this  context,  we  parsed  the  x,  y 
coordinates, width and height of the fish in the annotation of the 
image’s  dataset.  In  addition,  we  used  data  augmentation  to 
extend the amount of data. 

The  model  has  better  performance  as  number  of  epochs 
increases.  However,  when  number  of  epochs  exceeds  200,  the 
network  seems  to  be  overfitted  to  training  data.  As  a  result, 
Table  I  shows  the  hyper-parameters  used  to  train  and  validate 
the Yolo model.

                   Confidence = Pr(Object) × IoU(GT, pred)     (1)  
Where:        Pr (Object) ∈ [0, 1]. 

Five  predictions  will  be  done  by  each  grid  cell:  x,  y,  w,  h, 
confidence  and  C  class  probabilities.  (x,  y)  are  the  center 
coordinates  of  the  box,  and  (w,  h)  represent  the  width  and 
height of the box.

Where:   N x N: is the number of the grid cells of the system

               scales

               objectness score 
               C: is the number of classes we train our model on.  

This permits to induce better semantic information from the up-
sampled features and finer-grained information from the earlier 
feature map.

circumstances: (a) separated fish in seagrass, (b) a shoal (a 
group of fish), (c) tiny fish, (d) occlusion by corals, and (e) 
shading and light conditions.

The graph illustrates the loss while training the neural network 
and the average loss is reduced to 0.54%. That means the model 
is  affected  by  training  data.  A  total  of  4000  iteration  were  run 
and  it  took  14  hours  to  complete  the  training.  The  model 
improved swiftly in terms of precision, recall and mean average 
precision  before  plateauing  after  about  1000  iterations,  and 
around 1000 iterations the loss showed a rapid decline. 

For  each  epoch,  64  images  are  randomly  selected  and  used  to 
train  the  model.  Each  image  is  used  multiple  times  due  to  the 
limited  number  of  samples.  Figure  8,  shows  some  training 
samples, and the number zero indicates the fish class.

Helpful Answer:

Unfortunately, based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention or explanation regarding how the hyperparameters of the model have been optimized, such as through methods like grid search or random search. Therefore, without further information, it cannot be determined which method was employed for hyperparameter optimization.
