sub-basins of the GAB region.

3.10. Drought characteristics (severity, duration, and intensity) 

The regions  experiencing drought,  RED (measured in  percentage), 

were combined using drought indices for every timeframe and step.

where  RED  represents  regions  experiencing  a  drought  with  time  t,  D 
represents drought (in the form of 0 or 1), R represents region, and g 
represents grid. Eq. 2 provides the percentage of regions experiencing 
drought, which determines the impact of drought in terms of its extent 
or  land  areas  affected  (in  percentage)  (e.g.,  Ndehedehe  et  al.,  2021; 
Wang et al., 2018). Drought severity, DS is evaluated for each drought 
event with t time, starting from ts and ending with te given in Eq. 3 (e.g., 
Diaz et al., 2019).

Question: %INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the provided pieces of context to answer the query in less than 400 words. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

%Query
Query: "What are the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model (e.g., learning rate, optimizer)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no information available regarding the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model mentioned in the provided context. The text only discusses the application of deep learning algorithms for understanding groundwater-climate interactions and identifying climatic hotspots within sub-basins of the Great Artesian Basin (GAB) region. It also describes methods for calculating drought characteristics such as severity, duration, and intensity but does not provide any details about the implementation of the deep learning models themselves. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information on the hyperparameters used in this particular case.
