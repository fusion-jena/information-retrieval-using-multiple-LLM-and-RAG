feature class as ‘L', ‘Q', ‘LQ', ‘LQP’, and set the regularization multiplier 
from 0.5 to 5, using the delta in the Akaike minimum information cri-
terion (delta.AICc) as the metric to determine the best tuning parame-
ters. The optimal model is the one with the minimum delta.AICc value 
(delta.AICc = 0), and a model with delta.AICc <2 is considered credible 
(Phillips et al., 2017). The Continuous Boyce Index (CBI)(Hirzel et al., 
2006) was employed in addition to the Area under the Receiver Oper-
ating Characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) because AUC-ROC is not reliable 
when  obtaining  true  absences  is  challenging  (Jim´enez  and  Sober´on, 
2020). The final optimal parameters were identified as the feature class 
‘LQP’ and a regularization multiplier of 3.5 (Fig. A.2). The mean AUC- 
ROC  stands  at 95.5%,  while the  average  CBI  index  for the  validation 
dataset is 82.6%.

the five models. Nine algorithms—Bioclim, Mahalanobis, Domain, GLM 
(gaussian),  GLM  (binomial),  GLM  (poisson),  MaxEnt,  Random  Forest, 
and SVM—were evaluated using AUC-ROC and Cohen's KAPPA metrics. 
Our analysis revealed that MaxEnt emerged as the most suitable model, 
striking  a  commendable  balance  between  accuracy  and  robustness

Helpful Answer:
The authors used cross-validation to monitor the model performance during training. They created five subsets of data, each containing both presence and absence records. Four subsets were used for training, and the remaining subset was used for testing. This process was repeated five times until all subsets had been used once for testing. The threshold was then derived from the average output of these five models. Additionally, they evaluated nine different algorithms using AUC-ROC and Cohen's Kappa metrics to select the most suitable model. Ultimately, MaxEnt was chosen due to its balance between accuracy and robustness.
