Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

4.2. Machine learning models

2.6. Machine learning models

Learning models applied. In Section 3 results from CA, TSA and Machine
Learning models’ prediction are displayed and these results are dis-
cussed in Section 4.

3.3. Machine learning models

Based on the results of clustering and times series analysis, data from
six sites (RZ01, AA01, RS03, RS04, RS07, and RS09) were included in

%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about which platform was used to deploy the machine learning or deep learning models. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform were utilized based solely on this context.
