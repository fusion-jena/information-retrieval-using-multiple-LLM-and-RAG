Image enhancement plays a crucial role in improving visual quality 
and  extracting  meaningful  information  from  images.  Over  the  years, 
researchers  have  explored  various  methodologies  to  enhance  images, 
with  two  prominent  streams  of  investigation  emerging.  One  branch 
primarily focuses on leveraging traditional image processing techniques, 
while the other harnesses the power of deep learning algorithms. In this 
section,  we  review  some  of  the  currently  available  solutions  using 
classical and deep learning-based approaches. 

2.1. Classical image enhancement techniques

Qi et al. (Qi et al., 2022) proposed SGUIENet for image enhancement 
using semantic information as input for region-wise feature learning in 
the enhancement process. Such design allowed for better extraction of 
local features for enhancement, resulting in a consistent and superior 
enhancement.  Huang  et  al.  (Huang  et  al.,  2022)  proposed  a  novel 
adaptive group attention (AGA) used to select complementary channels 
based on dependencies, reducing the number of parameters in attention. 
Furthermore, the proposed AGA is integrated with Swin Transformer for 
an end-to-end underwater image enhancement network. Cai et al. (Cai 
et al., 2023) proposed a CURE-Net that systematically enhances image 
quality  stepwise.  The  proposed  model  comprises  three  subnetworks, 
where  the  initial  two  subnetworks  employ  attention  mechanisms  and 
gate fusion to acquire comprehensive contextual features across multi-

Deep learning techniques have been successfully applied to under-
water  image  enhancement  tasks,  helping  to  improve  the  quality  and 
visibility of images captured in underwater environments. In this sec-
tion, we briefly discuss a few examples. For instance, Li et al. (Li et al., 
2018) developed WaterGAN deep learning-based generative adversarial 
network model that performs network training for reducing the color 
deviation  in  underwater  images.  Fabbri  et  al.  (Fabbri  et  al.,  2018) 
developed UGAN by taking the idea of CycleGAN (Zhu et al., 2017) that 
performs domain transformation to reconstruct degraded images. Guo 
et al. (Guo et al., 2019) developed a novel multi-scale dense GAN by 
adding a residual multi-scale dense block to the generator, improving 
enhancement performance. Islam et al. (Islam et al., 2020a) presented 
FUnIE-GAN  by  introducing  a  multi-model  objective  function  in  the

structures with an increasing number of output channels, encouraging 
the network to learn complex representations. To enhance the network's 
capacity  for  capturing  fine-grained  features  and  context,  Spatial  and 
Channel Attention (SCA) modules are integrated into the architecture. 
These modules act as mechanisms for focusing on relevant spatial re-
gions  and  channel-wise  information,  respectively.  These  attention 
mechanisms are integrated at multiple stages in the network to enrich 
the feature representations. The decoder upscales the feature maps and 
fuses  information  from  the  encoder  using  skip  connections.  Each 
decoder block consists of a transposed convolutional layer to increase 
spatial  resolution,  followed  by  batch  normalization  and  ReLU  activa-
tion.  The  final  stage  of  the  network  involves  upsampling  the  feature 
maps, followed by a convolutional layer with 4 Ã— 4 filters to produce the

The given text does not provide any specific details about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotation, scaling, etc. However, it does mention several classical and deep learning-based methods for image enhancement.

In terms of classical image enhancement techniques, Qi et al. proposed SGUIENet which uses semantic information as input for region-wise feature learning in the enhancement process. This allows for better extraction of local features for enhancement, resulting in a consistent and superior enhancement. Huang et al. proposed a novel adaptive group attention (AGA) used to select complementary channels based on dependencies, reducing the number of parameters in attention. Furthermore, the proposed AGA is integrated with Swin Transformer for an end-to-end underwater image enhancement network. Cai et al. proposed a CURE-Net that systematically enhances image quality stepwise. The proposed model comprises three subnetworks, where the initial two subnetworks employ attention mechanisms and gate fusion to acquire comprehensive contextual features across multiple structures with an increasing number of output channels, encouraging the network to learn complex representations.

Regarding deep learning techniques, Li et al. developed WaterGAN deep learning-based generative adversarial network model that performs network training for reducing the color deviation in underwater images. Fabbri et al. developed UGAN by taking the idea of CycleGAN (Zhu et al.) that performs domain transformation to reconstruct degraded images. Guo et al. developed a novel multi-scale dense GAN by adding a residual multi-scale dense block to the generator, improving enhancement performance. Islam et al. presented FUnIE-GAN by introducing a multi-modal objective function in the generator.

However, none of these studies specifically mention the use of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, or scaling in their respective pipelines. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to your query based on the given context.
