Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The article does not provide information on the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model for machine-learning aiding sustainable Indian Ocean tuna purse seine fishery. The study focuses on using various machine-learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Multilayer Perceptron, Naive Bayes, and SKJ, but it does not delve into the details of the hyperparameters used in these models. Therefore, without additional information, we cannot determine the exact hyperparameters employed in this research.
