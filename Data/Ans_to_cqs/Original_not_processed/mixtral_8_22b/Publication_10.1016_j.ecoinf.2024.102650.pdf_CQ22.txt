Machine learning methods require text preprocessing, such as word 
segmentation and stop word removal, followed by the selection of a text 
portion to manually annotate emotions for accuracy verification. Among 
machine  learning  models,  the  enhanced  representation  through 
knowledge  integration  (ERNIE)  model  achieved  significant  results  in 
previous studies by learning prior semantic relationships and word order 
features from massive amounts of data (Sun et al., 2019). The ERNIE 
model  directly  models  prior  semantic  knowledge  units,  thereby 
enhancing model semantic representation (Wang et al., 2020). Test re-
sults for various Chinese tasks showed that the model performed better 
than  the  bidirectional  encoder  representations  from  the  transformer 
model proposed by Google AI (Sun et al., 2019). At the International 
Workshop on Semantic Evaluation 2020, the ERNIE model earned first 
place  for  a  mixed-language  emotional  analysis  task.  Detailed  de-

where P(D) represents perplexity, D represents the test set in the corpus, 
M represents the number of texts, Nd  represents the number of words in 
text  d,  wd  represents  the  words  in  text  d,  and  p(wd) represents  the 
probability of the occurrence of the word wd  in text d. Sk  represents the 
intensity of the kth topic, and p(θkd) represents the probability of topic k 
appearing in text d. We used Python’s pyLDAvis Library to cluster and 
visualize  topics  in  tweets  involving  contaminated  sites.  The  pyLDAvis 
interface  displays  the  ranking  of  keywords  related  to  each  topic,  for 
which relevance was determined by λ  and could be adjusted between 
0 and 1. The setting λ = 1 indicates ranking themes by frequency, and 
the setting λ = 0 indicates ranking themes based on uniqueness.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the deep learning model. However, common metrics used to evaluate deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), among others. These metrics help measure how well the model is performing and its ability to generalize to unseen data. Without additional context, it cannot be definitively stated which metrics were used in this case.
