During training the model optimi zes cross-entropy loss via mini-
batch  stochastic  gradient descent  [26].  We  use  a constant learning 
rate  of 0.01  and  apply  dropout [27]  to  the  input of the  last two lay 
ers  with  probability 0.5.  L2-regularization  is  applied to  the  weights 
of the last two layers  with  a penalty  factor  of 0.001.  The  model  is 
trained for  100 epochs and is  checkpointed after each epoch.  A val 
idation  set  is  used to  identify  the  parameter setting  (epoch)  achiev 
ing the  highest classification accuracy.  The CNN is  implemented  in 
Python using Lasagne [28] , and data stream  multiplexing (for train 
ing)  is implemented using Pescador [29].

The  automated  classification  of  migrating  birds'  ftight  calls  has 
the  potential  to  yield  new  biologieal  insights  and  conservation  ap 
plications  for  birds  that  vocalize  during  migration.  In  this  paper 
we  explored  two  state-of-the-art classification  techniques  for large 
vocabulary  bird  species  classification  from  flight  calls:  a  "shallow 
learning" unsupervised dietionary learning  method and  a deep con 
volutional  neural  network  combined  with  data  augmentation.  The 
models  were evaluated on a dataset of 5428  ftight  calls from 43  dif 
ferent  species, and  were  compared  against  a  baseline  model  based 
on  MFCCs.  We  showed  that  the  two  models  perform  comparably, 
yielding  a  mean  classification  accuracy  of 0.94  and  significantly 
outperforming  the  MFCC  baseline  (0.85).  We  also  compared  the 
performance of the CNN model  with  and  without augmentation and

In  particular, automated c1assification of migrating birds'  flight calls 
could yield new biological insights and conservation applications for 
birds that vocalize during  migration.  In this paper we explore state

a deep convolutional  neural network combined with data augmenta

of 5428  flight  calls spanning 43  different species, with  both  signifi

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, there are some implicit strategies mentioned that help manage variability and improve performance. These include:

1. Mini-batch Stochastic Gradient Descent: This optimization strategy helps reduce variance in the updates by averaging over multiple examples. It introduces some level of randomness through sampling batches but ensures more stable convergence than pure stochastic gradient descent.

2. Dropout Regularization: By randomly dropping units from the neural network during training, dropout regularization prevents overfitting and improves generalization. This introduces another layer of randomness into the process, which ultimately leads to better overall performance.

3. Data Augmentation: While not explicitly stated as a means to handle randomness, data augmentation involves applying various transformations to the input data, effectively increasing its size and diversity. This can be seen as introducing controlled randomness to the training process, helping the model become more robust and accurate.

Although these strategies do not directly address managing specific sources of randomness like random seed values, they collectively contribute to creating a more robust and reliable deep learning pipeline.
