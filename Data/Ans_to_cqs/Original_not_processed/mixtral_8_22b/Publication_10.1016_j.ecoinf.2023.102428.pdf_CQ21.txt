2.3. Research design and data processing 

The research workflow of the study is organised into three stages, 
viz., data processing and classification, change detection and prediction, 
and  valuation  of  C  sequestration.  At  the  first  stage,  pre-processing  of

2.5. Model description 

2.5.1. MLPnn-MC modelling 

MLPnn-MC  modelling  integrates  the  multi-layer  perceptron  (MLP) 
algorithm  and  Markov  chain,  which  unravels  robust  future  LULC 
simulation (Gebresellase et al., 2023; Nasiri et al., 2019). The novelty of 
this model lies in the fact that it utilises deep machine learning to learn 
the model in automated mode in less calibration time through complex, 
multivariate, and non-linear relationships to create several transitions 
and predict unseen data within the model at a single time by compre-
hending the hidden relationships (Kumar and Agrawal, 2023). MLP is 
the  most  prevalent  machine  learning  algorithm  in  ANN  (Artificial 
Neural Network) modelling (Alla et al., 2021; Band et al., 2020), which 
uses  back  propagation  (BP)  or  the  reverse  method  of  automatic

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps used after the model training. However, common practices for postprocessing include calculating metrics such as accuracy rates, skill measures, and root mean square errors (RMS). These can be seen in Table 7 under the Results section with values for Training RMS, Testing RMS, Accuracy Rate, and Skill Measure (%). Additionally, confusion matrices could have been created but aren't explicitly mentioned. Saliency maps also aren't discussed in this context. In summary, based on the available information, the postprocessing steps likely included calculating various metrics like accuracy rates, skill measures, and RMS errors.
