The following configuration optimized the performance of the model 
and was accordingly adopted for analysis: Adam solver (Kingma and Ba, 
(cid:0) 4,  constant  learning 
2014),  10 neurons  per  hidden  layer, alpha  = 10
rate, and rectifier activation function, also called Rectified Linear Unit 
(ReLU) activation function, defined as:

In the case of the RF, the hyperparameters include the number of 
decision trees in the forest, the maximum depth of the decision tree, the 
number of features considered by each tree when splitting a node, etc. 
This  set  of  hyperparameters  was  tested  using  the  grid  configuration 
shown below:  

1.  Number of decision trees: from 100 to 1000 (in steps of 100);  
2.  Number of features to consider at every split (max features): auto,

sqrt, log2, None;  

3.  Maximum number of levels in decision tree: None, or from 10 to 100 

(in steps of 10);

model (Sowmya et al., 2020). The best model is selected comparing the 
performance scores of all possible combinations of hyperparameters.

This section describes the design and implementation of the exam-
ined ML models. As a starting point, four models were initially tested: 
Linear Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVR), Random Forest 
(RF),  and  Multi-Layer  Perceptron  (MLP).  From  preliminary  results, 
omitted  here  for  the  sake  of  brevity,  only  MPL  and  RF  models  were 
selected  for  their  ability  to  model  the  nonlinear  evapotranspiration 
phenomena. The models were implemented using the scikit-learn library 
(Pedregosa  et  al.,  2011),  an  open-source  ML  library,  for  the  python 
programming language. Furthermore, the code developed in this work is 
released open source to the scientific community (Git Repository, 2023). 
This  will  allow  repeatability  and  ease  future  research  efforts  in  the 
development of environmentally sustainable irrigation solutions. In the 
following, an introduction to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and RF

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information on which specific deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch were used to build the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the scikit-learn library was used for implementing the machine learning models, including the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Random Forest (RF) models. Scikit-learn is a popular Python library for machine learning but is not typically associated with building deep learning models. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot determine which deep learning framework was used to build the model.
