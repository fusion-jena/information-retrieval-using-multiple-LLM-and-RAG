This is the ﬁrst study to our knowledge to investigate the pheno-
logical features in improving the performance of deep learning. As re-
vealed in our results, we have seen great potential in developing phe-
nological knowledge based deep learning methods. Recent literature
has documented the applications and beneﬁts of deep learning, a new
branch of machine learning, in various ﬁelds (LeCun et al., 2015).
However, it is still a controversial topic whether deep learning is more
suitable than traditional machine learning methods for Landsat image
classiﬁcation (Heydari and Mountrakis, 2018; Li et al., 2016). Never-
theless, this study aims to evaluate the hypotheses that applying phe-
nological knowledge as input data of deep learning can improve the
performance in the detection of invasive S. alterniﬂora. A comparison
experiment between SAE and SVM with six diﬀerent types of Landsat
images was conducted (see Table 2). The best performance was

achieved with Ppf-CM based SAE method, suggesting SAE beneﬁted
more than SVM from combining data in the two phenological stages
using Ppf-CM (Table 4). This was mainly because, compared to the
traditional machine learning method (SVM), deep learning method
(SAE) can easily capture and exploit more complex information with its
deep network structure and strong self-learning ability (Penatti et al.,
2015; Xie et al., 2015).

Capturing these three stages with spectral data should further enhance
the spectral separability between paddy rice and others.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information on which specific frameworks were used to build the deep learning models. However, it mentions that the study uses deep learning, a branch of machine learning, and specifically employs the Stacked Autoencoder (SAE) method. Both TensorFlow and PyTorch support building deep learning models using stacked autoencoders. Therefore, either or both of these frameworks could potentially be used to implement the deep learning models mentioned in the study.
