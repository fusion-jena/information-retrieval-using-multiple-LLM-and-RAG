Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

All analyses were performed using Python 3.8.5 and corresponding 
packages.  A  list  of  packages  and  their  versions,  python  code  for  our 
analyses as well as a demo dataset with functions and documentation to 
apply FCM-based complex networks for any kind of power spectra from 
the urban AE is provided on GitHub (https://github.com/THaselhoff/Co 
mplex-networks-for-analyzing-the-urban-acoustic-environment). 

4. Results 

4.1. Diel cycle of average shortest path length

two examples for the LUTs “Main Street” and “Urban Forest”, depicting 
every step from the FCM, to thresholding, to the adjacency matrix and its 
respective network representation.

3.2.3. Complex network measures 

After the network is constructed, a plethora of quantitative network 
measures become available (Newman, 2018). We investigate the utility 
of the network’s Average Shortest Path  length (ASPL) for the studied 
networks. ASPL can be defined as (Barab´asi, 2013): 

ASPL =

d(s, t)
n(n (cid:0) 1)

∑

s, t ∈ V
s ∕= t

However,  although  research  on  the  urban  AE  gained  traction  in 
recent years, sophisticated methods to quantify its complex properties 
on  a  larger  scale  are  still  scarce.  This  is  especially  true  for  big  audio 
datasets, which are so extensive that listening to the files becomes no 
longer  feasible.  To  date,  few  approaches  have  been  used  to  quantify 
large datasets of the urban AE. Classical approaches reach their limits 
when  it  comes  to  analyzing  longer  recording  periods  (e.g.  several 
months) (Gage et al., 2017). In recent years, sound event classification 
using  machine  learning  approaches  became  more  popular  (Phillips 
et al., 2018; Sethi et al., 2022; Stowell et al., 2019; Ulloa et al., 2018), 
but is still not ready to be deployed unconfined (Alcocer et al., 2022). In 
psychoacoustics, mostly smaller field studies have been conducted (Hall 
et  al.,  2013;  Ma  et  al.,  2021;  Montoya-Belmonte  and  Navarro,  2020;

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The text mentions the use of Python 3.8.5 and corresponding packages but does not specify which deep learning framework was employed or what hyperparameters were chosen for training the model. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based on the given context.
