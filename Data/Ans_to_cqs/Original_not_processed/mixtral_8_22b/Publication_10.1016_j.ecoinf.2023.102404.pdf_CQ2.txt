points  that met  specific  filtering  conditions.  Specifically,  the  function 
first extracted the ‘quality_flag’ band from the GEDI image and retained 
the pixels where the ‘quality_flag’ value was equal to 1, indicating good 
data quality. Additionally, the function checked the ‘degrade_flag’ band 
and retained the pixels with a value of 0, indicating data points without 
degradation. The combination of these filtering conditions ensured that 
only high-quality and reliable GEDI data was used for subsequent ana-
lyses.  The  application  of  the  quality  mask  plays  a  critical  role  in 
enhancing the validity and robustness of the findings presented in this 
paper,  enabling  accurate  assessments  of  forest  structure  and  biomass 
based on the GEDI spaceborne LiDAR data.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The papers mentioned primarily focus on remote sensing applications, specifically using satellite or airborne data such as LIDAR, SAR, and multispectral imagery. Therefore, the primary data format used in these studies is raster data, which includes satellite or airborne images. These images may be in various formats like GeoTIFF, JPEG, or other common image file types. Some studies also use vector data, such as shapefiles or CSV files containing point locations or polygon boundaries. However, none of the papers explicitly mention using audio or video data formats within their deep learning pipelines.
