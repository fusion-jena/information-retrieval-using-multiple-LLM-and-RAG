approach (Li et al., 2022) have also been efficiently used in satellite
image-based vegetation indices for predicting forest canopy cover. The
application of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) for semantic
segmentation has also been investigated across various types of young
vegetation cover (Cameron et al., 2022). Regarding advanced machine
learning approaches, the RF and SVM were the foremost priorities for
the researchers for canopy cover modelling from O'brien, 2007 to 2017,
as reported by Thanh Noi and Kappas (2017). Other advanced ML ap-
proaches have recently been added to similar studies (Li et al., 2022;
Zhou et al., 2020). The boosting methodology represents a synthesis of
robust prediction techniques, frequently surpassing the performance of
individual models such as single decision trees. The emergence of
refined ensemble machine learning techniques like light gradient
boosting machines
represents notable advancements

linear as a simple statistical model and the rest of the advanced machine
learning models as machine learning. The regression analyses were
conducted using Python 3.12.2, distributed by Anaconda Inc. The Scikit-
learn library (Pedregosa et al., 2011) was employed for all models except
those utilising XGboost and LightGBM. For XGboost and LightGBM
models, the respective Python libraries “xgboost” (Chen and Guestrin,
2016) and “lightgbm” (Ke et al., 2017) were utilised. Additionally, a 5-
fold cross-validation grid search strategy was implemented to tune
hyperparameters within the training dataset for all machine learning
models, leveraging functionalities inherent in their respective Python
packages. The information on hyperparameters and their optimised
value for all machine learning models are presented in Table 4. More-
over, we converted the canopy cover output percentage to a fraction
(0–1) for convenience and smoothness in the further calculation.

construct regression equations. We used multiple linear regression, Enet,
SVM, RF, XGboost and LightGBM to predict canopy cover from planet
data. In general, all the mentioned models are used in machine learning
as they use algorithms to automatically learn patterns and relationships
from data to make predictions or decisions. However, we categorised
