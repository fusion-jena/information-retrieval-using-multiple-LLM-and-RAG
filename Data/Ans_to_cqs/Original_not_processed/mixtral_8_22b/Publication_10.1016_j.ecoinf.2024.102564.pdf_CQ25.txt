Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are computational models inspired 
by the structure and functioning of the human brain. The neural network 
is composed of multiple layers of neurons that carry out linear combi-
nations of the input values from the preceding layer. Then, a non-linear 
activation function is applied. The trainable parameters of the network 
are the weights associated with the linear combinations performed by 
each  individual  neuron  (Domingues  et  al.,  2020;  Kantarcioglu  et  al., 
2023). 

Random Forests (RF) is an ensemble learning method that combines 
multiple decision trees to make predictions. Each tree is trained on a 
random  subset  of  the  data,  and  the  final  prediction  is  determined  by 
aggregating the predictions of all trees. Random Forest releases robust 
results  even  when  the  number  of  observations  is  smaller  than  the 
number  of  variables  or  the  variables  are  correlated  (Breiman,  2001; 
Nguyen et al., 2019).

Machine learning methods: Modeling net growth in the Atlantic Forest 
of Brazil

The trained ANN was the multilayer perceptron, also known as the 
multilayer perceptron (MLP), with a hidden layer. The range of neurons 
in  this  layer  was  defined  by  the  Fletcher-Gloss  method  (Silva  et  al., 
2010): 2 × n0.5 + n2 ≤ n1 ≤ 2 × n + 1; in which: n = number of network 
inputs; n1 = amount of neurons in the hidden layer; and n2 = number of 
neurons  in  the  output  layer.  The  activation  functions  tested  were

We found that machine learning methods were efficient and impor-
tant  tools  for  modeling  growth  in  forest  fragments  in  the  Brazilian 
Atlantic  Forest.  They  can  help  in  understanding  the  biome  and  in 
developing management strategies aimed at recovering biodiversity and 
reducing  the  deleterious  effects  of  fragmentation.  Their  ability  to 
analyze complex data, capture non-linear relationships, provide accu-
rate predictions, scale up, and support decision-making processes makes 
them  invaluable  for  understanding  and  conserving  this  unique  and 
threatened ecosystem. 

The Random Forest method showed superiority over the others for 
modeling growth in the Atlantic Forest. The metrics and the graphs of 
observed and estimate residuals used corroborate this statement. Studies

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the deep learning model being referred to is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), specifically a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). However, the exact purpose of this model is not explicitly stated in the provided text.

In general, deep learning models like ANNs can be used for various purposes such as classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, among others. Given that the context mentions the use of these models for "modeling growth in forest fragments," we can infer that the purpose of this specific ANN could be either regression or time series forecasting, as both tasks involve predicting continuous numerical outputs rather than discrete classes.

Regression involves finding a relationship between dependent and independent variables, while time series forecasting aims to predict future values based on historical data points. Both techniques could potentially be useful for modeling growth patterns in ecological systems like forests.

However, without more specific information about the nature of the 'growth' being modeled (e.g., whether it refers to population size, vegetation density, etc.) or the type of inputs and outputs involved in the ANN, it is difficult to definitively determine its precise purpose.
