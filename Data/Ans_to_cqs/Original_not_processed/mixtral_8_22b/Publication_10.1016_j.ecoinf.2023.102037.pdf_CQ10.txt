2021a; Wang et al., 2020c). Wang et al. (2020a, 2020b, 2020c) obtained 
a mean Average Precision (mAP) score of 63.54% using YOLOv3 (Red-
mon  and  Farhadi,  2018)  while  detecting  and  classifying  pest  species 
from  the  images  in  their  “Pest24”  dataset.  The  dataset  consisted  of 
25,378  annotated  images  coming  from  24  pest  species  that  were  all 
collected by an automatic imaging trap. Rustia et al. (2021) designed a 
multi-stage deep learning method including object detection, insect vs. 
non-insect  separation  and  a  multi-class  insect  classification  for  insect 
identification. Data were acquired by multiple wireless imaging devices 
installed  in  greenhouses  –  under  varying  lighting environments  -  and 
their classification model reached average F1-scores of up to 0.92. Hong 
et  al.  (2021)  developed  an  AI-based  pest  counting  method  for  moni-
toring  the  black  pine  bast  scale  (M.  thungergianae)  which  reached  a

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The paper by Rustia et al. (2021) mentions the use of a deep learning pipeline for insect identification but does not provide any specific information about the code repository link. Similarly, the papers by Wang et al. (2020a, 2020b, 2020c) also discuss the use of deep learning models for pest detection and classification but do not mention any code repository links. However, there are some other resources mentioned in the given context that might be helpful. For instance, Skalski (2019) provides a link to a GitHub repository called'make-sense', which could potentially contain relevant code for building a deep learning pipeline. Additionally, the SmartProtect platform (2022) offers a search function that may lead to useful resources related to pest detection and classification. Unfortunately, without more specific information or references, it is difficult to determine the exact code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in these studies.
