4.1. Evaluation of fusion quality 

(1)  The  feature  dataset,  training  samples,  and  validation  samples 
were used as input into five base models to generate prediction 
results  (TKNN,  TRF,  TAdaBoost,  TXGBoost,  TLightGBM)  of  the  training 
samples  and  prediction  results  (VKNN,  VRF,  VAdaBoost,  VXGBoost, 
VLightGBM) of the validation samples.  

(2)  TKNN, TRF, TAdaBoost, TXGBoost, and TLightGBM  were combined in a 
column manner to obtain T, and VKNN, VRF, VAdaBoost, VXGBoost, 
VLightGBM were combined in a column manner to obtain V.  
(3)  Using T in the base model as training data for the meta-model, the 
RF  algorithm  was  used  to  generate  the  prediction  results 
(α1, α2, α3, α4, α5) of  training  data  T  by  5-fold  cross-validation.

and the accuracy of the cross-validation were calculated. The relation-
ship between the number of  features and  cross-validation accuracy is 
depicted in Fig. 12. The results demonstrated a notable increase in the 
cross-validation accuracy with a progressive increase in the number of 
features. This phenomenon can be attributed to the acquisition of a large 
number  of  valuable  features  using  the  model.  When  the  number  of 
features  exceeded  40,  the  cross-validation  accuracy  fluctuated  and 
increased  with  the  number  of  features  until  the  optimal  value  was 
reached. The optimal number of feature combinations was 184, which 
yielded the highest cross-validation accuracy of 0.88. Importance scores 
were used to rank each feature variable, and the top 184 features were 
selected for this study.

(2)  The features with the lowest importance scores are removed from 
the  current  feature  combinations,  and  the  process  of  feature 
pruning  is  repeated  recursively  until  the  cross-validation  accu-
racy reaches the highest level. In the RFECV process, a five-fold 
cross-validation  was  used  to  select  the  number  and  combina-
tions of features.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the deep learning model. However, it mentions the use of cross-validation accuracy as a metric to determine the optimal number of feature combinations. Cross-validation accuracy is a common evaluation metric used in machine learning to estimate how accurately a predictive model will perform on unseen data. It involves dividing the original sample into a training set to train the model and a test set to evaluate it. This process is then repeated several times, with different partitions used as the training and test sets. The average error across all trials is computed to produce a single estimation. Although the text does not mention other evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall, these could also have been used to further evaluate the performance of the deep learning model.
