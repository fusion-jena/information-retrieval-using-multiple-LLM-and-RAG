This article presents a new high-quality NDVI image product and a
technical framework for regularizing dense-time-series data with high
spatial resolution. This framework offers a feasible method for recon-
structing cloud-free high-resolution NDVI datasets. Using the SOWCEM
technology framework, we successfully produce a Sentinel-2 normalized
NDVI time-series dataset with a 10 m spatial resolution for crop growth
physiological cycles. The key concept of the algorithm is the introduc-
tion of optimal weighted allocation, which calculates and allocates
optimal weights for the prediction simulation results based on spatial
and temporal dimensions. By minimizing the sum of squares of the
combined prediction errors within a specific time period, the algorithm
achieves an optimal combination of prediction model results at the pixel
scale. This method effectively combines the temporal and spatial feature
information of two prediction models, providing a robust approach for

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be applied to improve the quality of input data and enhance the performance of the model. These steps may include:

1. Data Cleaning: Removing or correcting erroneous, missing, or inconsistent data points to ensure the integrity and reliability of the dataset.

2. Normalization/Standardization: Scaling numerical features to have zero mean and unit variance or between a certain range (e.g., 0-1). This helps prevent any single feature from dominating the others due to its scale and improves convergence during optimization.

3. Feature Selection/Extraction: Identifying relevant features that contribute significantly to the target variable and discarding irrelevant ones. Alternatively, creating new features by combining existing ones to better capture underlying patterns.

4. Encoding Categorical Variables: Converting categorical variables into numerical representations using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

5. Handling Outliers: Detecting and dealing with extreme values that might negatively impact the model's performance. Techniques such as clipping, winsorizing, or removing outliers altogether can be employed.

6. Data Augmentation: Generating additional synthetic samples through transformations like rotation, flipping, zooming, etc., especially useful when working with limited amounts of labeled data.

7. Splitting Dataset: Dividing the dataset into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate the model's generalization capabilities accurately.

These preprocessing steps help prepare the data for efficient training and accurate predictions while reducing computational overhead and avoiding overfitting. However, not all steps are necessary for every problem; it depends on the nature of the dataset and the specific requirements of the task at hand.
