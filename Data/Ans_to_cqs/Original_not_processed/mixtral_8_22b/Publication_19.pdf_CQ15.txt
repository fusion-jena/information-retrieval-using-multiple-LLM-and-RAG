C.  Results 

  As  Table  III  show  all  models  performed  reasonably  well 
with macro-F1 averages above 91%. Because the models are to 
be deployed on IoT edge devices, the size of each model is an 
important  consideration.  As  Table  III  shows 
the  best 
performing model was Inception-V3 with a macro Average F1 
score of 0.93, and the smallest size of 175 MB.

Inception-V3,  MobileNet-V2,  ResNet-18,  and  DenseNet-
121, were all trained on this data. All architectures were pre-
initialized  to  ImageNet  weights.  Initially,  the  models  were 
trained by freezing the feature extraction layers and training the 
classification layers only. However, better results where the F1-
score  improved  by  about  20-30%,  were  obtained  when  both 
feature extraction and classifier layers of each architecture were 
configured to be trainable. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) 
was  used  as  the  optimizer  for  all  four  models.  Other  hyper-
parameters like batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs 
were  obtained  using  the  grid  search.    The  models  were 
implemented  using  Keras  (https://keras.io/).  The  resulting 
hyperparameters for each model are shown in Table II.

However, a number of issues need to be addressed further.  First 
the data is highly unbalanced, and therefore, using SMOTE [23] 
or  similar  data  balancing  techniques  may  help  improve  the 
results further.  Secondly, recent architectures like EfficientNet 
[19]  that  performed  well  in  creating  smaller  networks  can  be 
explored  further.  In  fact,  our  initial  investigations  show  that 
EfficientNetB1 produced performance similar to Inception-V3 
(F1-score  macro  average  =  0.94)  on  this  data  set  as  well  but 
with a much smaller model size (~ 54 MB).  
   This  paper  showed  that  potentially  significant  gains  can  be 
achieved in reducing both the time to reporting, and the effort

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text mentions that Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) was used as the optimizer for all four models. No other optimization techniques are explicitly mentioned in the given context. Therefore, based on the information available, it appears that SGD was the primary optimization technique employed in the deep learning pipeline.
