3.4. Accuracy evaluation metrics

This study utilizes a consistent color ramp and stretch function to
render all of the NDVI images. Four evaluation metrics, the coefficient of
determination (R2), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute
error (MAE), and error relative global accuracy (ERGAS), are employed
to assess and contrast the disparities between the predicted and actual
images.

R2 reflects the goodness-of-fit of the predicted images to the refer-
ence images, with values ranging from -∞ to 1. An R2 value of 1 in-
dicates perfect alignment between the predicted and true values, while
R2 = 0 indicates that all of the predicted values are equal to the mean of
the true values. Values below zero indicate no correlation. The calcu-
lation formula is as follows:

R2 = 1 (cid:0)

dl represents the ratio of pixel sizes between images. The input
data for this study consists of fused predicted NDVI data with a spatial
resolution of 10 m; hence, the value is set to 1. μ(l) denotes the mean
value of the corresponding band. RMSE is the root mean square error. B
represents the number of bands, which has a value of 1 in this study.

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not explicitly state the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the data used in the studies mentioned are primarily related to remote sensing imagery, specifically Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) images. These images are derived from satellite or airborne sensors and are typically stored in raster data formats such as GeoTIFF or other similar formats suitable for geospatial data. Additionally, some studies may use ancillary data in various formats like CSV or Excel files for metadata or additional variables. Nonetheless, without explicit mention of the exact data format used in the deep learning pipeline, we cannot definitively confirm the specific file types utilized.
