the output layer we used the sigmoid activation function. We used the 
LSTM method by adding a long short term memory block on the DNNâ€™s 
architecture  previously  described.  The  implementation  of  the  classifi-
cation methods was carried out in Python using the libraries TensorFlow 
and Scikit-learn (Van Rossum and Drake Jr, 1995). Finally, we obtained 
the accuracy, true positive rate and false positive rate using the afore-
mentioned training-test splits of the time series.

in most comparisons while providing interpretability rather than being a black-box method. It is an improvement 
over current state-of-the-art machine learning tools, especially by non-specialists, such as ecologists aiming to use

descriptive advantages combined with its predictive power.

Table 2 shows that the PBP method is competitive with state-of-the- 
art  machine  learning  methods,  such  as  the  commonly  used  Random 
Forest (RF) algorithm. The criterion of a false positive rate of at most 0.2 
provides an accuracy of 91.0%, a false positive rate of 8% and a true 
positive  rate  of  75%.  Only  DNN  could  obtain  similar  values  of  true

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is not explicitly stated. However, based on the information provided, one can infer that the model is designed for classification tasks. This is evident from the mention of the sigmoid activation function used in the output layer, which is typically employed for binary or multi-class classification problems. Furthermore, the text mentions obtaining accuracy, true positive rate, and false positive rate, metrics often used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. Additionally, the model uses LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), a type of recurrent neural network architecture particularly useful for sequence prediction problems, suggesting that the model might be applied to time series data for classification purposes.
