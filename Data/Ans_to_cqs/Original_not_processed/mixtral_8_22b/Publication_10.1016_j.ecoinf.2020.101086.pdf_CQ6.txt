2.5. Parameterization of the correction methods

The knowledge found in the literature and provided by experts of
the ecology of the An. darlingi species were used to parameterize the
correction methods described in paragraph 2.1 (Table S1 summarizes
the key aspects of such parameterizations).

equally biased (Phillips et al., 2009). This is achieved by transforming
the model input data using four approaches which can be categorized
according to two criteria: i) the dataset concerned with the transfor-
mation (presence sites or background sites); and ii) the implementation
spaces of the transformation (geographical or environmental space).
When the presence dataset is considered, the authors aim at modifying
its distribution to tend toward a uniform distribution, and the back-
ground set is obtained via a uniform random selection. The im-
plementation space of such an approach is either the geographical space
(see for example Boria et al., 2014; Kramer-Schadt et al., 2013) or en-
vironmental feature space (see Fourcade et al., 2014; Varela et al.,
2014). This approach seems to be eﬀective, but requires many presence
sites (Fourcade et al., 2014). When the background set is considered, it
is built according to a selection bias that reﬂects the same sampling bias

observed and U, the set of pixels where the species is known to be

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps may be involved depending on the nature of the data and the specific requirements of the model. Some common preprocessing techniques include:

1. Normalization: This involves rescaling the values of features so they fall within a specified range, often between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. Normalization helps prevent certain features from dominating others during training due to their larger scale.

2. Scaling: Similar to normalization, scaling also adjusts the range of feature values. However, instead of rescaling all features to a fixed range, scaling typically involves standardizing features to have zero mean and unit variance. This ensures that all features contribute equally to the model's performance.

3. Cleaning: Data cleaning involves identifying and handling missing, incorrect, or inconsistent data points. Common techniques include removing outliers, filling in missing values through interpolation or imputation, and correcting errors in the data.

4. Feature engineering: This process involves creating new features based on existing ones to improve the model's ability to learn patterns in the data. Examples include binning numerical variables into categories, extracting features from text data, or combining multiple features into a single one.

5. Encoding: For categorical features, encoding converts them into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms. Techniques like label encoding, one-hot encoding, or ordinal encoding can be applied depending on the type of variable and its relationship with other features.

These preprocessing steps help ensure that the input data is well-suited for training a deep learning model, improving both its accuracy and efficiency.
