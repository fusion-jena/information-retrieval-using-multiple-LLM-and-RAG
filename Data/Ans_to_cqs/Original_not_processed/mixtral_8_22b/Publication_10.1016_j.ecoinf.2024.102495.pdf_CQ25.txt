In a CNN, a convolution layer performs convolution operations be-
tween the pixels on the input and several kernels or filters. The math-
ematical equation of the convolution process is as follows, where f is the 
input data and h is the kernel size. 

G[m, n] = (f *h)[m, n] =

h[j, k]f [m (cid:0)

2.2.4. Convolutional network 

CNN  represents  an  algorithm  type  or  neural  network  model 
commonly used to process two or more dimensions of data with high 
complexity, such as images or sound data (Fernandes et al., 2021). A 
CNN consists of several parts, one of which is the feature extraction layer 
and the other is the fully connected layer (Albawi et al., 2017; Kim et al., 
2018; Navamani, 2019). In the feature extraction section, several com-
binations  of  convolution  layers,  activation  functions,  and  pooling  are 
used to extract features from the given input data. In the fully connected 
layer,  several matrix-merging  processes  and  output  mapping occur  in 
the  SoftMax  activation  function  layer.  Furthermore,  the  classification 
process occurs from the data processed in the feature extraction section.

2.2.3. Deep learning 

Once transformed into a matrix or vector, the results of voice feature 
extraction serve as the input for a deep learning algorithm. This algo-
rithm discerns patterns within the data, enabling it to make predictions 
based on these learned patterns, all without the need for explicit pro-
gramming (França et al., 2021; Navamani, 2019). A critical distinction 
between deep learning and traditional machine learning is the feature- 
extraction  process  during  classification.  Feature  extraction  from  data 
typically requires manual or human intervention in traditional machine 
learning.  Contrastingly,  deep  learning  models  are  designed  to  auto-
matically perform feature extraction.

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in this context is not explicitly stated. However, based on the information provided about the components of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), we can infer that the deep learning model might be used for image processing tasks such as classification, segmentation, or object detection. Specifically, the mention of using combinations of convolution layers, activation functions, and pooling for feature extraction suggests that the model could be employed for identifying patterns or objects within complex datasets like images or sounds. Additionally, the reference to the fully connected layer and the SoftMax activation function indicates that the model may also be utilized for making predictions or classifying inputs based on the extracted features.
