sampling  effort  e.g.,  some  species  records  were  sourced  from  surveys 
that  recorded absence  in  addition  to  presence-only incidental  records 
from the public. All records were combined to create a bias grid (using 
the previous upweighted area combined with a weighted distribution of 
occurrences), calculated using the Gaussian function:

4. Discussion 

Despite sampling bias being widely acknowledged as a concern in 
invasive  Species  Distribution  Models  (iSDM)  and  a  large  number  of 
studies  attempting  to  address  the  problem,  no  conclusion  has  been 
drawn as to the best method to deal with it (Kramer-Schadt et al., 2013; 
Verbruggen et al., 2013). Here, three very different options to reduce 
sampling bias were examined i) weighted background points, ii) filtered 
(pre-thinned)  records  and  iii)  targeted  background  points,  fitted  to 
various  spatial  extents.  AUC  values  were,  in  the  main,  higher  when 
adopting more expansive input extents than restricted extents. However, 
it is known that these can be misleading; reflecting artificial inflation as

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information on the specific methods or tools used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that some species records were sourced from surveys that recorded both presence and absence, as well as incidental records from the public. This suggests that the data collection process may have involved a combination of structured surveys and crowdsourcing efforts. Additionally, the use of occurrence records implies that sensor data could also have been employed. Therefore, while the exact methods remain unclear, we can infer that the study likely incorporated multiple approaches such as surveys, public contributions, and potentially sensor data to gather its raw dataset.
