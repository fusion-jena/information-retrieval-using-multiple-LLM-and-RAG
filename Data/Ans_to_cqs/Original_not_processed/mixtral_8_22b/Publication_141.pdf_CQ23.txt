cies level (Table 2). The network performed surprisingly well con-
sidering the ImageNet dataset does not contain any similar object
(e.g., does not contain non-biting midges). As expected, the results
further improved when ﬁne-tuning was applied in the second
training phase, where the whole network was trained allowing
the model to learn additional features speciﬁc to our dataset.

pixels with 3 colour channels are transformed into a 2048 feature vector that is
subject to classiﬁcation using the fully connected layer. A normalized exponential
function (softmax) then takes the input vector and normalizes it into a probability
distribution to determine the probability for each class.

factors: network architecture, protocol type of image acquisition
(Martineau et al., 2017), and robustness of input matrix (number
of entities and replicates). Our choice to use a ResNet-50 network
architecture, in combination with transfer learning, data augmen-
tation, and dropout proved appropriate for the current number of
taxa in our demonstration dataset. ResNet-50 network architecture
represents a midsize solution in the ResNet palette (18, 34, 50, 101,
152 layers) that combines both representation power and lower
complexity that allows relatively fast training of the models. How-
ever, the protocol for image acquisition inﬂuences the complexity
of features, which will be processed by CNNs. Controlled object
position during the collection of images can also govern the level
of feature variability. Our dataset was constructed under the lab-
based protocol of image acquisition with fully controlled position
of the larvae (ventral point of view). This was not the case in pre-

Helpful Answer:
The authors took several measures to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model. Firstly, they employed a technique called transfer learning, which involves fine-tuning a pre-trained model on a new task. In this case, they used a ResNet-50 network architecture, which had been previously trained on the ImageNet dataset. Despite the fact that the ImageNet dataset did not contain any similar objects to those in their study, the network still performed well. This suggests that the features learned from the ImageNet dataset were useful for their specific task.

Secondly, they used a process called data augmentation, which involves creating new training examples by applying transformations such as rotation or scaling to existing examples. This helps to increase the diversity of the dataset and reduce overfitting.

Thirdly, they used a technique called dropout, which randomly drops out neurons during training to prevent overfitting.

Finally, they ensured that their dataset was representative of the population by performing stratified sampling. They divided their dataset into two parts: 80% for training and 20% for validation. Importantly, this division was done per category (chironomid taxa), ensuring that each category was represented equally in both the training and validation datasets.

Overall, these measures helped to ensure that the deep learning model was able to generalize well to unseen data.
