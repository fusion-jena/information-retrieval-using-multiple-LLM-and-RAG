Accuracy metrics for models with average and entropy features across window sizes  

Table A.6 
Accuracies and classification results into iceplant (positive class P) and other vegetation (negative class N) from models using spectral, NDVI, and date features together 
with average and entropy values of each spectral band and NDVI within a window, calculated across multiple window sizes. Accuracies are given in percentages.

classification processing. This step reduced the average number of pixels 
per scene the classification model had to analyze to 3,757,323 and took, 
on average, 18 s per scene.

%Query
Query: "What are the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model (e.g., learning rate, optimizer)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no information available regarding the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model mentioned in the provided context. The papers cited do not provide details about the learning rate, optimizer, or any other hyperparameters used in their respective models. Therefore, it would be impossible to accurately determine which hyperparameters were utilized without further information.
