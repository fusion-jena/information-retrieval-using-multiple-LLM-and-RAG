3.1.3. Predicted intensity maps 

Figs.  3  to  6  show  the  predicted  intensity  maps  with  80%  hidden 
observations for the different combinations of lasso regularization and 
bias correction. The results for 20% and 50% hidden observations are 
shown in Appendix A.1.2. The following intensity prediction maps do 
not  display  all  methods  tested  previously.  We  focus  on  the  best  per-
forming methods across the performance measures (knn, LoopT) as well

the ppmlasso package.;  

• sp.scale: the spatial resolution for the quadrature grid in km—as defined in the ppmlasso package;  
• cov.bias: The column number of the variable chosen as a proxy for the observer bias in quadsenv. The default value is set to NULL;  
• kVal: the value to factor out of the observer bias proxy cov.bias. The default value is set to NULL;  
• n.fits: the number of models to fit through the regularization path—as defined in the ppmlasso package. The default value is set to 50. 

To run the ppmlassoMixEngine, we can use the following lines:

The  elements  returned  by  this  function  are  the  same  as  the  ones presented  by  the  ppmMixEngine function  in  the  supporting  information  of 

Guilbault et al. (2021). 

B.1.2.2. Loop methods. The ppmlassoLoopEngine function applies the Loop methods with extensions. The following arguments are the same to 
those developped in ppmLoopEngine and in the section above:

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps may be involved depending on the nature of the data and the specific requirements of the model. Some common preprocessing techniques include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing or correcting any inconsistencies, errors, or missing values in the dataset. It also includes handling outliers and dealing with categorical variables if necessary.

2. Normalization/Standardization: These techniques help bring all features to the same scale, which is crucial when working with datasets containing features measured in different units. Normalization scales the data between 0 and 1, while standardization transforms the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

3. Feature Scaling: Similar to normalization and standardization, feature scaling rescales the range of features so they can contribute proportionately during the learning process. Common methods include Min-Max scaling and Robust Scaling.

4. Encoding Categorical Variables: Deep learning models typically work better with numerical input. Therefore, it might be necessary to convert categorical variables into numerical representations using encoding techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

5. Dimensionality Reduction: In some cases, reducing the dimensionality of the dataset can improve computational efficiency and reduce overfitting. Techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), or t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) can be used for this purpose.

6. Splitting Dataset: Before training the model, the dataset should be split into three subsets: training, validation, and testing sets. This helps evaluate the model's performance accurately and prevents overfitting.
