resolution at the landscape scale. To achieve this, we use predictive models based on machine learning algo-
rithms and a fungal database resulting from the sampling of more than 100 permanent sampling plots over 20 
years. We estimate that current and future productivity patterns differ among species, under different climate 
change scenarios and bioclimatic regions. Our results suggest that optimal productivity areas may be shifted to 
higher  elevations,  making  those  species  with  higher  productivity  at  higher  elevations  the  most  affected  by 
climate change. This would mean that some species with high socioeconomic value, such as Lactarius deliciosus 
and Boletus edulis, could be negatively affected in their total productivity in the study area. This study highlights 
the need to anticipate the potential effects of climate change on fungal productivity and in particular on high

Mediterranean  forest  ecosystems.  To  our  knowledge,  this  is  the  most 
extensive database of macrofungal productivity in the world.

%Query
Query: "What are the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., bounding box annotation, instance segmentation)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it can be inferred that the authors have employed machine learning algorithms and potentially deep learning methods due to references to papers discussing applications of deep learning in ecology and a fast implementation of random forests for high-dimensional data.

One possible technique mentioned indirectly is image-based species identification using machine learning, which might involve object detection or classification tasks requiring appropriate data annotations like bounding boxes or class labels. Nevertheless, without explicit information about the exact data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, one cannot provide a definitive answer.
