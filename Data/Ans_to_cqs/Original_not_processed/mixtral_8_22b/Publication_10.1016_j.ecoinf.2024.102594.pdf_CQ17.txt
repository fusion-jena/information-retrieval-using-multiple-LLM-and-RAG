ReduceLROnPlateau was as follows: If the validation loss value did not 
decrease  after  5  consecutive  epochs,  the  learning  rate  was  halved.  If 
there was no decrease in the validation loss value after 10 consecutive 
epochs, the training process was terminated. Both model training and 
inference were executed on a GeForce RTX 3070 GPU.

During the DeepLabV3+ model training process, feeding large-size 
images directly to the network may lead to memory overflow. There-
fore, it is necessary to cut all remote sensing images and semantic labels 
of land cover classes into a series of regular image blocks for input. To 
maximize the sample size and maintain consistency with the cropping 
approach in the model prediction stage, we set the cropping size to 32 ×
32  pixels  with  a  redundancy  rate  of  0.5.  In  continuing,  70%  of  the 
dataset  was  used  for  training  and  the  remaining  for  validation.  The 
training set was enhanced by: (i) Flipping the images and labels along 
the X or Y axis; (ii) Exchanging between multiple image channels while 
the  labels remain unchanged; (iii)  Randomly rotating  the images and 
◦
labels by 90
; and (iv) randomly adding noise to the 
images  while  maintaining  the  labels  unchanged  (Ye  et  al.,  2022).

3.1. DeepLabV3+ algorithm 

DeepLabV3+ is a CNN algorithm for semantic segmentation, which 
is the latest version of the DeepLab algorithms family (Scepanovic et al., 
2021).  In  the  encoding  stage,  DeepLabV3+ introduces  dilated  convo-
lutions,  which expands  the  receptive field  without losing information 
(Fig.  3).  The  Atrous  spatial  pyramid  pooling  module  with  dilated 
convolution  has  been  mainly  designed  to  appropriately  incorporate 
multi-scale information. During decoding, it is capable of enhancing the 
accuracy  of  segmentation  boundaries  by  further  integrating  low-level 
features with high-level features (Liu et al., 2021a).

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit details about specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, there are some techniques mentioned that can be considered as forms of regularization.

Firstly, the ReduceLROnPlateau method is employed during the training process. This technique reduces the learning rate when the validation loss stops decreasing for a certain number of epochs. By doing so, it helps prevent overfitting by slowing down the learning process when the model starts to fit too closely to the training data.

Secondly, the use of data augmentation techniques like flipping images, exchanging channels, random rotation, and adding noise contributes to preventing overfitting. These techniques increase the diversity of the training dataset, making the model more robust and generalizable to new, unseen data.

Lastly, although not explicitly stated, the choice of architecture itself could also contribute to preventing overfitting. For instance, the DeepLabV3+ algorithm uses dilated convolutions and incorporates multi-scale information, which might help improve the model's ability to generalize better.
