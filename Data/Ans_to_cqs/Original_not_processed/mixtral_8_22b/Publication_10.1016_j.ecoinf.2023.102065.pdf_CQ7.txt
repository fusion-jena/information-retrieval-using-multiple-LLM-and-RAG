Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

ence data available for training were limited, so we sought to explore 
different network sizes in conjunction with pre-training with additional 
acoustic reference data from outside of our audio domain, followed by 
fine-tuning with ROI data from our study site.

The  recordings  for  each  ROI  were  cut  using  start/stop  times  and 
sequentially appended to create a single merged .wav file for each spe-
cies and set (i.e., train, validation) combination. Each merged .wav file 
was  then  sliced  into  2-s  increments  and  mel-spectrograms  computed. 
Note that since there were some ROIs from the pattern matching that 
were >2 s, some 2-s recording clips included parts from different ROIs. 
Performing data augmentation on training datasets is a widely used 
technique in deep learning, including sound classification applications, 
to  regularize  models  and  provide  more  robust  features  (Salamon  and 
Bello, 2017). We performed data augmentation by splitting the merged . 
wav  training  file  for  each  species  in  half  and  then  adding  these  two 
halves sample-wise. This augmented .wav file was similarly split into 2-s 
increments as above and mel-spectrograms were computed. The training

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the data was split into training and validation sets for the purpose of deep learning model training. However, the specific criteria used to perform this split are not explicitly mentioned. In general, when working with machine learning or deep learning models, data is often divided into three subsets: training, testing, and validation. The training dataset is used to fit the model, while the validation dataset is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Finally, the testing dataset is used to evaluate the final performance of the model. It can be assumed that similar principles were applied here, but without further information, it cannot be confirmed what exact criteria were used to divide the data into training and validation sets.
