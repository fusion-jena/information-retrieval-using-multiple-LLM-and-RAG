Overall, the complete dataset has a length of 1430 days and contains 
12 features (U2,Rs,RHmin,RHmax,Tmin,Tmax,ETo,SWC, NDVI, NDWI, DOY, 

The  available  database  includes  weather  data  recorded  by  the 
weather station from January 2018 to November 2021, as well as the 
micro-meteorological data acquired by the EC tower from March 2019 
to  November  2021,  in  both  cases  registered  at  sub-hourly  time-steps. 
The  former  dataset  was  used  to  estimate  ETo,  by  Eq.  (3).  The  latter 
dataset  was  processed, using  a  specific  software  developed  by  Manca 
(2003),  excluding  all  the  records  acquired  in  days  where  the  rainfall 
height was higher than 2.5 mm. The suitability of the records acquired 
by  the  EC  tower  was  assessed  based  on  the  energy  balance  closure

Helpful Answer:

The study utilizes several methods for collecting raw data in its deep learning pipeline. For instance, it employs weather stations to record meteorological data such as wind speed, air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, and precipitation. Additionally, micro-meteorological data is collected through an eddy covariance (EC) tower, which measures variables like net radiation, sensible heat flux, latent heat flux, soil heat flux, and carbon dioxide concentration. These measurements are taken at sub-hourly intervals. Furthermore, the study uses remote sensing techniques to gather Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) data. Lastly, the research also makes use of publicly available datasets, including the world map of the Köppen-Geiger climate classification and the global digital elevation model.
