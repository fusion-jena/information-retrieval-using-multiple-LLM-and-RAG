Active  learning  iterations  used  a  batch  size  of  64,  ten  epochs  and 
learning rate of 0.001. We used a grid search technique (Mohri et al., 
2018) to tune hyperparameters of the final model including the number 
of epochs, batch size and learning rate. 

2.3.3. Active learning framework 

We  applied  an  active  learning  approach  to  iteratively  train  and 
improve  the  CNN  model.  The  active  learning  approach  is  depicted 
within Fig. 3 and described below.

3.1. CNN model development with active learning 

The CNN model performance stabilised within five active learning 
iterations (Fig. 4). The majority of model performance improvement was 
achieved within the first two iterations, with a 34.3% decrease in macro- 
averaged MAE between iterations one and three, compared to a 12.1% 
decrease in macro-averaged MAE between iterations three and the final 
model (Fig. 4). Most of the training data added between iterations one 
and  three  consisted  of  non-target  calls  (Table  1),  which  led  to  rapid 
improvements in the model’s ability to differentiate non-target sounds, 
resulting in a reduction in false positives.

validation  (Section  2.3)  and  test  datasets  (Section  2.4)  prior  to  the 
commencement of CNN development. The training/validation dataset 
comprised  6363  h  of  audio  from  ten  independent  sites  (five  solar- 
powered bioacoustic recorders and five Audiomoth recorders) and the 
test dataset comprised 2735 h of audio from nine independent sites (four 
solar-powered bioacoustic recorders and five Audiomoth recorders) that 
were different from the training/validation dataset. All audio data were 
unlabelled at the commencement of the study. 

All recorders were set to record 10-min files continuously between 6 
am and 6 pm daily, which reflected the diurnal activity patterns of SBTF. 
We stored audio data as FLAC files at a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz for the 
solar-powered bioacoustic recorders and WAV files at a 32 kHz sampling 
rate for the Audiomoth recorders.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning model. However, it does mention that all audio data were unlabelled at the commencement of the study. This implies that some form of labeling or annotation process might have been performed as part of the preprocessing step. Additionally, the context mentions that the recorders captured audio data as FLAC files at a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz for the solar-powered bioacoustic recorders and WAV files at a 32 kHz sampling rate for the Audiomoth recorders. Therefore, it can be assumed that the raw audio data might have undergone format conversion and resampling to ensure consistency across the dataset. Furthermore, common practices in audio processing include noise reduction, silence removal, and feature extraction techniques such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) or spectrogram generation. Although these methods aren't explicitly mentioned in the context, they could potentially be included in the preprocessing pipeline based on standard procedures in audio signal processing and machine learning applications.
