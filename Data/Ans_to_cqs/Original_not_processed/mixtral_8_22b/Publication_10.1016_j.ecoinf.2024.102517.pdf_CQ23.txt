2.3.3. Experimental setting 

In our experiment, a deep learning environment based on Python and 
Tensorflow – GPU as well as CUDA was constructed under the Windows 
operating system. The deep feature loss bird noise reduction network 
model was trained for 50 epochs on an RTX 2080 Ti GPU using the Adam 
(cid:0) 4. In each 
optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014) with a learning rate of 10
epoch, the entire training set was presented in a random order, with one 
noisy bird sound signal per iteration. 

2.4. Comparative algorithms 

Using the same test  set, we compared the  denoising results of the 
deep feature loss-based bird sound noise reduction network with several 
other  bioacoustics  noise  reduction  algorithms,  namely  SEGAN, 
WebRTC, wavelet transform (Priyadarshani et al., 2016), Wiener filter 
(Loizou, 2017), and MMSE STSA (Brown et al., 2017) algorithms.

increased with each layer, from 20 in the first dilated convolutional layer 
to 212 in the 13th dilated convolutional layer. However, this was not used 
for the 14th  or final dilated convolutional layers. Batch normalization 
was performed using the adaptive normalization operator proposed by 
Chen  et  al.  (2017),  whereas  a  non-linear  operation  was  implemented 
using a leaky rectified linear unit (LReLU). The framework of the deep 
feature loss-based bird sound noise reduction network is shown in Fig. 4.

Let  Λ0, ……, Λ15  represent  the  16  connected  layers  of  the  noise 
reduction network, where Λ0  and Λ15  represent the input and output 
layers,  respectively.  For  k = 1, …, 14,  each  intermediate  layer  Λk ∈

and Λ14. For the output layer Λ15, a linear transformation was used to

Helpful Answer:
The paper does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it mentions that the deep feature loss bird noise reduction network model was trained for 50 epochs on an RTX 2080 Ti GPU using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 10. In each epoch, the entire training set was presented in a random order, with one noisy bird sound signal per iteration. This approach could help improve the model's ability to handle various types of noise and bird sounds, contributing to its generalizability. Additionally, the authors compare their method with other bioacoustic noise reduction algorithms, which can also indicate the robustness and applicability of their model across different scenarios.
