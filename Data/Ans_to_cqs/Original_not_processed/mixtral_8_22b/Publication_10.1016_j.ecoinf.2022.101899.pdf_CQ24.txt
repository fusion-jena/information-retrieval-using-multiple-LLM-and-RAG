Halgamuge et al. (2020) focused on utilizing deep learning to esti-
mate the best optimizer selection methods for wildfire event predictions 
in Australia. They developed an algorithm to collect the data automat-
ically and analyzed six different optimizer models using deep learning 
technology. They concluded that this approach could predict a natural 
disaster, including wildfire events, by investigating historical environ-
mental  conditions  before  and  after  wildfires  occurred  using  the  deep 
learning methodology. Dowdy (2020) focused on demonstrating a sea-
sonal prediction system for wildfire event prediction in Australia. This 
measured  spatio-temporal  variations  and  seasonality  across  several 
datasets  and  utilized  this  methodology  to  predict  wildfire  events, 
focusing on the seasonal predictions using the 2019â€“2020 wildfire sea-
son  as  an  example  and  measuring  long-term  predictions.  Coen  et  al.

probability of having a wildfire event with high accuracy based on the

dictors.  Thus,  it  can  lead  to  more  efficient  preventive  measures  and 
disaster management prior to having a catastrophic event.

Helpful Answer:
The authors do not explicitly discuss strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, they mention employing Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA), which is a statistical technique used to account for model uncertainty when multiple models are available. BMA combines the strengths of various models by averaging their predictions, weighted by each model's posterior probability. By incorporating BMA into their analysis, the researchers may be able to mitigate some of the effects of randomness introduced by factors like random seed values. Additionally, the use of ensemble methods or cross-validation techniques might also help manage randomness in the deep learning pipeline, but these specific strategies are not mentioned in the given context.
