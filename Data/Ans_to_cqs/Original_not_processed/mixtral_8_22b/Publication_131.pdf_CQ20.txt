proper databases for CNN training.

Fourth, at the level of resources, the application that runs the CNN takes 16.4% of the
CPU capacity and 8.7% of RAM. These results let us conclude that the available computing
resources are adequate for running this sort of application.

On the cyber system side, implementation was based on a workstation with an AMD
Threadripper Pro 3955WX processor with 32 GB RAM and GPU NVIDIA Quadro P620,
running Windows 10 Pro. The communication between the cyber and the physical system
was made using the TCP/IP protocol. A Python application was designed to train the
CNN based on a selected dataset. This cyber system is responsible for interacting with a
ﬁnal user (biologist) who is responsible for ordering the new trainings of the CNNs and
new updates of the trained CNNs on the physical nodes or on their digital twins to carry
out simulations or cooperative classiﬁcations.

CNN on the graphical processing unit (GPU), or pre-process the audio signal and execute the CNN on the CPU. In the work proposed here, both the pre-processing of the audio signal and the execution of the CNN are carried out by the CPU using a TensorFlow Lite library [26]. The platform used for the testbeds is based on the System of Chip (SoC) BCM2835, which includes the microprocessor ARM1176JZF-S at 700 MHz—it can reach 1 GHz doing overclocking using GPU VideoCore IV. The communications were implemented using a LoRa® with a data rate of around 5kbps using a spread factor of 7 and a bandwidth of 125 kHz [27]. Nodes are provided with a weatherproof microphone and a solar cell for an autonomous power supply.  On the cyber system side, implementation was based on a workstation with an AMD Threadripper Pro 3955WX processor with 32 GB RAM and GPU NVIDIA Quadro P620, running Windows 10 Pro. The communication between the cyber and the physical system was made using the TCP/IP protocol. A

Helpful Answer:
The text mentions that the CNN is executed on the CPU using the TensorFlow Lite library. However, it also states that the implementation was based on a workstation with an AMD Threadripper Pro 3955WX processor, 32 GB RAM, and GPU NVIDIA Quadro P620. Despite the fact that the CNN is executed on the CPU, the presence of a GPU suggests that it could potentially be utilized for training the deep learning model. Nevertheless, the text does not explicitly state whether the GPU is used for training the CNN. Therefore, based on the given information, we can only confirm that the CPU is used for executing the CNN, but the involvement of the GPU in training the deep learning model remains uncertain.
