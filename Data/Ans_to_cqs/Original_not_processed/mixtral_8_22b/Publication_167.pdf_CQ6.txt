Input Data

In this paper, the input data are 40-dimensional data. Due to the large time span and large land
area in the training data, there are large diﬀerences in the distribution between diﬀerent batches of
training data in the training stage, and there is a certain distribution diﬀerence between the training set
and the test set. Therefore, batch normalization is performed on the input data, where the speciﬁc
calculation/transformation of BatchNorm (Algorithm 1) is shown below. First, the mean of each
channel in the current batch is calculated, and then, the variance of each channel in the current batch is
calculated. The mean is subtracted from the input, and the result is divided by the standard deviation
to obtain the normalized output ˆχ
i is multiplied by the scale parameter γ, and the shift
parameter β is added to obtain the ﬁnal output yi:

Network Structure

mask. (3) Training set: grid with neighborhood features of six years (1986, 2005, 2008, 2010, and 2013). The features include the LU type, soil, topography, elevation, slope, aspect, distance to settlements, distance to roads, distance to rivers in this grid unit, and the 4 neighborhood grid units. (4) Constraint Factors: The statistical data and the quantity simulated by the backtracking of the Markov model are combined, and the numbers of different LU types in 2000 after modification by the simulation numbers are as follows (Table 1): 2.4.2. Deep Learning Module Probability maps (Figure 9): Water and settlements are constraint factors and can be determined by manual interpretation, and thus, no simulation is needed.  Figure 9.

The data of a certain year are used as the test set, and the remaining data are the training and
validation set. The training and validation set ia divided into ten parts using the 10-fold cross-validation
method, in which nine of the parts are used as a training set and one is used for the validation set.
The percentage of the training, validation, and testing sets is 5.4:0.6:1. The training set is the data
sample used for model ﬁtting. The validation set is a set of samples set aside separately during the
model training. It can be used to adjust the hyperparameters of the model and to conduct a preliminary
evaluation of the model’s capabilities. The testing set is used to evaluate the generalization ability of
the ﬁnal model. However, it cannot be used as a basis for algorithm-related selection such as parameter
tuning and selection of features. The mean value of the ten results is used to estimate the accuracy of

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps may be involved depending on the nature of the dataset. In the given context, the authors mention performing batch normalization on their input data due to significant differences in the distribution between different batches of training data and between the training and test sets.

Batch normalization is a technique used to improve the performance and stability of neural networks. It involves calculating the mean and variance of each feature across a mini-batch of inputs, then normalizing each input based on these statistics. This process helps reduce internal covariate shift, making the network more stable and easier to train.

To perform batch normalization, first, calculate the mean (μβ) and variance (σ²β) of each feature within the current mini-batch. Then, normalize each input (xi) by subtracting its corresponding mean (μβ) and dividing by the square root of the variance plus a small constant (ε), which prevents division by zero. Finally, apply a learnable scale factor (γ) and bias term (β) to the normalized values to maintain representational power.

In summary, the preprocessing step mentioned in the given context involves applying batch normalization to the input data before training the deep learning model. This technique aims to stabilize the learning process and improve overall performance.
