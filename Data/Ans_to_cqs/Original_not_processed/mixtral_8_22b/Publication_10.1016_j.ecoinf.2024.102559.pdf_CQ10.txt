Technologies to remotely collect large streams of environmental data 
combined  with  artificial  intelligence  techniques  create  a  unique  op-
portunity to accelerate and transform how we monitor biodiversity and 
evaluate the efficacy of restoration and conservation actions (Cavender- 
Bares et al., 2022; Galaz García et al., 2023a; Tuia et al., 2022), opening 
the  door  to  understanding  biodiversity  and  ecosystems  at  spatial  and 
temporal scales that would not be achievable through intensive empir-
ical data collection (Beery et al., 2022; Brown et al., 2022; Murray et al., 
2020). Indeed, machine learning (ML) applied to remotely sensed im-
ages has shown great promise in detecting and mapping the occurrence

%Query
Query: "What is the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific code repository link of any deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository containing such a pipeline. However, some of the references mentioned in the context may contain relevant information regarding the development and implementation of deep learning pipelines for remote sensing applications. For instance, Vali et al. (2020) review various deep learning approaches used for land use and land cover classification using hyperspectral and multispectral Earth observation data. Additionally, Blondel et al. (2011) discuss scikit-learn, a popular open-source library for machine learning in Python, which could potentially include tools for developing deep learning pipelines. Nevertheless, without further details or additional resources, it is impossible to pinpoint the precise location of a deep learning pipeline related to this topic.
