Many  ecosystems,  particularly  wetlands,  are  significantly  degraded  or  lost  as  a  result  of  climate  change  and 
anthropogenic  activities.  Simultaneously,  developments  in  machine  learning,  particularly  deep  learning 
methods, have greatly improved wetland mapping, which is a critical step in ecosystem monitoring. Yet, present 
deep  and  very deep  models necessitate  a greater  number  of  training data, which  are costly,  logistically  chal-
lenging,  and  time-consuming  to  acquire.  Thus,  we  explore  and  address  the  potential  and  possible  limitations 
caused  by  the  availability  of  limited  ground-truth  data  for  large-scale  wetland  mapping.  To  overcome  this 
persistent  problem  for  remote  sensing  data  classification  using  deep  learning  models,  we  propose  3D  UNet 
Generative Adversarial Network Swin Transformer (3DUNetGSFormer) to adaptively synthesize wetland training

On the other hand, transformers are the most frequently deployed 
techniques in natural language processing (NLP) (Vaswani et al., 2017). 
Researchers  are now exploring the capability of transformers  in com-
puter  vision  and  remote  sensing,  given  their  huge  success  in  the  lan-
guage domain. They have recently proven to be practical in a variety of 
applications,  including  the  classification  of  remote  sensing  imagery 
(Bazi et al., 2021; D. Hong et al., 2021; J. He et al., 2020). Transformers 
utilize  an  attention-based  approach  rather  than  using  convolutional 
operations utilized by CNNs. As such, transformers, unlike CNNs, can 
acquire global contextual knowledge through self-attention. This means 
that transformers have a better generalization capability as compared to 
CNN algorithms. For example, the state-of-the-art vision transformer of 
Swin Transformer incorporates a hierarchical transformer with shifting

The objective function and expected function are denoted by U(D, G) 
and E. D and G presents the discriminator and generator networks. D(x) 
calculates the likelihood that x is the true data (i.e., real data) that is 
based  on  training  reference  samples.  In  the  3D  GAN  network,  we 
employed a conditional map unit to produce synthetic samples from a 
random  noise  vector,  like  the  Generative  Adversarial  Minority  Over-
sampling (GAMO) (Subhra Mullick et al., 2019) and 3D-HyperGAMO (S. 
K.  Roy  et  al.,  2021),  only  for  classes  with  a  low  number  of  training 
samples.  The  benefit  of  such  a  methodology  is  that  it  eliminates  the 
problem of imbalanced data, which is typical in wetland mapping. In 
particular, in the 3D GAN model, the 3D patch generator uses seven (c (cid:0)
1, c presents the number of classes) units, one unit for each of the classes 
g samples (see 
with minor ground-truth data. Thus, the unit Ui generates γi
Eq. 2).

Helpful Answer:
Regularization methods are techniques used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. Two common regularization methods mentioned in the provided context are dropout and L2 regularization. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to reduce interdependent learning amongst them. This leads to a more robust model that can perform well even when some input features are missing. On the other hand, L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages large weights in the model. By doing so, it encourages smaller and simpler models that are less likely to overfit the training data. Other regularization methods not explicitly mentioned in the provided context include early stopping, data augmentation, and batch normalization. Early stopping involves halting the training process before the model starts to overfit. Data augmentation increases the size of the training dataset by applying random transformations to existing examples, while batch normalization standardizes the inputs to each layer, reducing internal covariate shift and improving convergence speed.
