This   rising   number   of   digitised   herbarium   sheets   provides   an   opportunity   to   employ
computer-based   image   processing   techniques,   such   as   deep   learning,   to   automatically
identify species and higher taxa (Carranza-Rojas et al. 2017, Younis et al. 2018, Carranza-
Rojas   et   al.   2018)   or   to   extract   other   useful   information   from   the   images,   such   as   the
presence   of   pathogens   (as   done   for   live   plant   photos   by   Mohanty   et   al.   2016).   Deep
learning is a subset of machine learning methods for learning data representation. Deep
learning   techniques   require   huge   amounts   of   training   data   to   learn   the   features   and
representation of those data for the specified task by fine tuning parameters of hundreds or
thousands of neural networks, arranged in multiple layers. Learning the value of these
parameters can take vast computer and time resources, especially on huge datasets.

Abstract

As   herbarium   specimens   are   increasingly   becoming   digitised   and   accessible   in   online
repositories, advanced computer vision techniques are being used to extract information
from them. The presence of certain plant organs on herbarium sheets is useful information
in various scientific contexts and automatic recognition of these organs will help mobilise
such information. In our study, we use deep learning to detect plant organs on digitised
herbarium   specimens   with   Faster   R-CNN.   For   our   experiment,   we   manually   annotated
hundreds   of   herbarium   scans   with   thousands   of   bounding   boxes   for   six   types   of   plant
organs and used them for training and evaluating the plant organ detection model. The
model worked particularly well on leaves and stems, while flowers were also present in
large numbers in the sheets, but were not equally well recognised.
