Another considerable experimental result is that Elastic Net can improve the perfor-
mance of the proposed model. A good deep learning model usually requires abundant
data to train and analyze, while the limitations of obtaining DNA barcode sequences of ﬁsh
species from different families and the problem of overﬁtting in small datasets are more
and more serious. To solve the overﬁtting problem in training process on small datasets
is of great importance. In our study, Elastic Net is used to solve overﬁtting problem and
improve the generalization ability of the ESK model. Moreover, genetic characteristics
of species belong to high-dimensional data, which are time consuming during training.
However, directly combining a set of fully connected EN-SAE is often has little effect for
extracting useful information. Elastic Net provides sparse connection, which can also save
training time. Therefore, Elastic Net can improve the performance of proposed model.

Abstract: Fish is one of the most extensive distributed organisms in the world. Fish taxonomy
is an important component of biodiversity and the basis of ﬁshery resources management. The
DNA barcode based on a short sequence fragment is a valuable molecular tool for ﬁsh classiﬁcation.
However, the high dimensionality of DNA barcode sequences and the limitation of the number of
ﬁsh species make it difﬁcult to reasonably analyze the DNA sequences and correctly classify ﬁsh
from different families. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning method that fuses Elastic
Net-Stacked Autoencoder (EN-SAE) with Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), named ESK model. In
stage one, the ESK preprocesses original data from DNA barcode sequences. In stage two, EN-SAE is
used to learn the deep features and obtain the outgroup score of each ﬁsh. In stage three, KDE is
used to select a threshold based on the outgroup scores and classify ﬁsh from different families. The

Deep learning, a method for learning and extracting useful representations from
raw data, training model, and then using the model to make predictions, has made great
progress in recent years [36]. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel method using
DNA barcode sequences through deep learning model to classify ﬁsh from different families
and determine which ﬁsh are regarded as outgroups, called ESK model. First, the method
aligns DNA sequences to obtain the sequences with the same length, then, converts them
into numerical data by using one-hot encoding. Second, the model uses Elastic Net-Stacked
Autoencoder (EN-SAE) to learn data features and obtains an outgroup score of each object.
Finally, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is used to generate a threshold and predict which
ﬁsh are outgroups base on the threshold. To verify the effectiveness of ESK model, three
families with a large number of species and obvious interspeciﬁc variation are selected as

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any specific details about the application of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, or scaling in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the proposed deep learning method aligns DNA sequences to obtain sequences with the same length and converts them into numerical data using one-hot encoding. This could be considered as a form of data preprocessing rather than data augmentation. It would be best to refer to other sources or consult domain experts for accurate information regarding the use of data augmentation techniques in this particular case.
