Automated  Remote  Biodiversity  Monitoring  Network  (ARBIMON; 
hereafter  referred  to  as  Arbimon)  is  an  online  open-source  platform 
linked  to  the  Rainforest  Connection  website  (https://arbimon.rfcx. 
org/),  with  a  combination  of  hardware  and  software  for  automating 
data acquisition, data management, and species identification based on 
audio recordings (Aide et al., 2013). From the several tools available to 
the user, we used a random forest model, which is a machine learning 
model based on decision trees and has shown to be robust and powerful 
(Breiman,  2001).  The  model  works  with  one  or  two  ROIs  (region  of 
interest, template, that contains the desired vocalization), the training 
data that contain validated recordings of the presence or absence of the 
vocalization provided by the user, and the threshold value set by the 
user. The threshold value ranges from 0 to 1. A score close to 0 means

Helpful Answer:
Answer: The text does not provide information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the automated remote biodiversity monitoring network (Arbimon) is linked to the Rainforest Connection website (<https://arbimon.rfcx.org/>). This suggests that the deployment might have been done using resources related to this website or platform. But without explicit mention of a cloud service provider like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform, it cannot be definitively determined from the given context.
