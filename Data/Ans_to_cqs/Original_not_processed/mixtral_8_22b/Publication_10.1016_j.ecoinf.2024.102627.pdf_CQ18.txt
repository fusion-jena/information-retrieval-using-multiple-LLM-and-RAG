(IDRIS). A full description of the model architecture, dataset spatial split 
and training procedure can be found in supplementary information (SI) 
Box A. Finally, the settings of our species assemblage model are sum-
marised in the Fig. 1.

Final test set performances at epoch 69 are A30 = 0.87 and MSA30 =
0.48. This means that i) the correct label is returned among the first 30 
species  for  87%  of  the  test  observations  (representative  of  common 
species),  and  ii)  when  each  species  in  the  test  set  is  given  the  same 
weight, the correct label is within the first 30 classes returned almost 
half the time. This second metric may seem low, but it actually measures 
a particularly difficult task, given that the test set contains 4166 species

Fig. 1. Method summary scheme. The orchid observation set of 999,258 occurrences from 14,129 species (Section 2.1.1 and Box D) is enriched with predictive 
features: WorldClim2 bioclimatic variables, Soilgrids pedological variables, Human Footprint rasters, terrestrial ecoregions of the world and location (description Box 
E, list Table S2 and examples Fig. S5). Next, the Inception v3 model (Szegedy et al., 2016) is first trained with the observation set (Section 3.1.1). Secondly, it is used 
to predict the most likely species assemblages on a global regular grid of 30-s resolution (Section 2.4.1). The calibration step, which determines the threshold λ on the 
relative probability of species presence, is described theoretically in Section 2.2.2 and set in Section 3.1.2. When the model is provided with a predictor tensor in 
inference, the final output is the associated species assemblage Sλ.

2.1.2. Predictive features 

A large environmental context around each observation is collected 
and provided to the model: 64 × 64 2D tensors sampled at the kilometre- 
scale  resolution  and  centred  on  the  observation.  Predictors  include 
WorldClim2  bioclimatic  variables,  Soilgrids  pedological  variables, 
human  footprint  rasters,  terrestrial  ecoregions  of  the  world  and  the 
observation location (longitude and latitude), see SI Box E for details. 
Examples of input are shown in Fig. S5 and the full list of predictors is 
given in Table S2.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, we can infer that the authors might have monitored the model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., based on the mention of 'test set performances'. Additionally, they could have used techniques like cross-validation or early stopping to prevent overfitting and ensure optimal performance. But without specific details mentioned in the provided context, these assumptions remain speculative.
