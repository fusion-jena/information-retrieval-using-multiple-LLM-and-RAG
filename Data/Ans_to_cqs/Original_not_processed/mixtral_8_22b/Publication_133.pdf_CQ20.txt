the loss function, and modifying their parameters according
to the loss function’s gradient. Thus,
the loss declines in
each training round (aka epoch), and the model’s annotation
accuracy increases (Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure 1).
As the number of parameters of a typical deep learning
model
is large, overﬁtting is a major concern. A common
(partial) remedy is the use of validation data, which are set-
aside while training, yet their annotations by the models are
the training
monitored. The validation data help to limit
duration, thereby reducing the risk of overﬁtting. In this study
we used 30 epochs per training task, based on our validation
runs (Figure 2).

Deep Learning for Insect Ecoinformatics

INTRODUCTION

Machine learning methods are increasingly applied to
biological problems that involve classiﬁcation of images and
extracting information from them. The current leading approach
to such tasks is supervised learning using deep neural networks

(DNNs), and particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs),
which are able to extract abstract high level features from images.
Identifying objects within the image and classifying them may
be treated as separate tasks. Yet, more recent methods, such as
“Faster R-CNN” (Ren et al., 2015), and YOLO (Redmon et al.,
2016) consider both problems at the same time.

data points describe the performance attained by a model that
accepts all identiﬁcations, as its Tcs is minimal (0). Such a plot
can guide users in adjusting model parameters to their needs. If
fewer detections are accepted (low recall), precision increases.

Tables 3, 4 illustrate the types of recall (Table 3) and precision
(Table 4) errors made by the model when the conﬁdence
threshold was set to 0.7. The model rarely confused between our
three focal species (gray areas in Tables 3, 4). It made some false
positive predictions, particularly for the class “Psyllaephagus”
(bold text in Table 4, not tagged by the expert but predicted
by the model). Most of the missed predictions, however, were
false negatives (bold text in Table 3, tagged by the expert but not
identiﬁed by the model).

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no explicit mention of the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model in the given context. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware resources were utilized during the training process.
