Our study leverages ML for multi-layer classification to accurately 
identify  areas  affected  by  wildfires.  Given  the  critical  importance  of 
precision in wildfire mapping, we evaluated our model’s performance 
using two primary metrics, OA and Cohen’s Kappa statistic, which are 
vital for understanding the model’s effectiveness. 

OA  is  the  proportion  of  correctly  predicted  instances  (wildfire- 
affected  and  unaffected  areas)  out  of  the  total  instances  evaluated. 
Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

In the domain of WSM utilizing ML models, optimizing data struc-
tures is paramount. Our study’s engagement with this challenge has led 
to identifying efficient data structures for ML classification. This opti-
mization focuses on the strategic selection of predictors from S2 imagery 
and  the  integration  of  XAI  techniques.  Specifically,  we  optimize  the 
input  matrix  X  = i  × j,  where  I  represents  the  number  of  predictors 
(columns) and j represents the number of training points (rows). We aim 
to select the 12 most pertinent predictors from S2 imagery to enhance

For the hyperparameter optimization task, we employ two predom-
inant models— RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV—provided by 
the  scikit-learn  library  to  meticulously  refine  the  RF  algorithm’s  per-
formance.  The  tuning  methodology  encompasses  an  initial  broad 
exploration of the hyperparameter space using RandomizedSearchCV, 
followed by a focused and exhaustive search using GridSearchCV to fine- 
tune the model. RandomizedSearchCV performs a probabilistic search 
over  the  predefined  hyperparameter  space,  offering  a  computational 
advantage  by  evaluating  a  user-specified  subset  of  hyperparameter 
combinations.  This  method  aids  in  efficiently  navigating  vast  hyper-
parameter  spaces  and  is  particularly  advantageous  when  there  is  un-
certainty  regarding  the  optimal  values.  It  generates  a  sample  of  the 
parameter settings based on specified distributions, allowing the incor-

poration of prior knowledge, which  is crucial when exploring contin-
uous parameters. Following the random search, we utilize GridSearchCV 
to  conduct  an  exhaustive  search  in  the  vicinity  of  the  best  hyper-
parameters discovered by RandomizedSearchCV. GridSearchCV evalu-
ates  every  possible  combination  within  a  predefined  grid  of 
hyperparameter  values,  guaranteeing  that  the  optimal  parameter

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, generally speaking, various methods can be employed depending on the nature of the problem being addressed. These may include surveys or questionnaires for gathering human input, sensors for capturing real-time environmental data, or publicly available datasets such as those found in open repositories like UCI Machine Learning Repository or Kaggle. Each method has its own advantages and limitations, and the choice depends on factors such as cost, time constraints, availability of resources, and the desired level of accuracy and reliability.

This study utilizes machine learning for multi-layered classification to precisely identify areas impacted by wildfires. To ensure precision in wildfire mapping, the model's performance was assessed using two main evaluation metrics: overall accuracy (OA) and Cohen's Kappa statistic. OA measures the ratio of correctly classified instances (both wildfire-affected and unaffected areas) to the total number of instances evaluated.

To optimize the data structure for machine learning classification, the researchers selected the 12 most relevant predictors from Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery. They also integrated explainable AI (XAI) techniques into their approach. For hyperparameter optimization, they employed both RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV from the scikit-learn library to improve the performance of the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. Initially, RandomizedSearchCV was used to explore the hyperparameter space broadly, followed by a more targeted and comprehensive search using GridSearchCV to fine-tune the model.
