3.1.1.1. Johnsbach  data. We also achieved very good results with the 
standard semantic segmentation analysis of the two Johnsbachtal data 
subsets. The segmentation of the Johnsbachtal camera dataset led to an 
accuracy of 88.56% and a mIoU 74.87,98%. The precision, recall and 
F1-score are 78.22%, 68.26% and 68.30% respectively. The segmenta-
tion  of  the  Johnsbachtal  mobile  phone  dataset  led  to  an  accuracy  of 
91.39%  and  a  mIoU  80.16%.  The  precision,  recall  and  F1-score  are 
80.58%, 81.54% and 80.34% respectively. Some representative classi-
fication results are shown in Fig. 5. 

3.2. Joint energy based approach

To evaluate the model performance, we use two metrics: classifica-
tion accuracy and intersection over union (IoU). The classification ac-
curacy gives a ratio of the correct classifications and all classifications 
and thus describes the percentage of correct classifications. For unbal-
anced  datasets  this  measure  is  not  very  significant.  If  you  consider  a 
binary classification of an image dataset, where 95% of the pixels are 
classified  as  class  1  and  only  5%  are  classified  as  class  2.  The  model 
could reach an excellent prediction accuracy of 95% by just predicting 
class 1 all the time, although the prediction is totally meaningless. To 
overcome  this  issue,  a  second  evaluation  metric  was  used,  the  Inter-
section over Union (IoU), also referred to as Jaccard Index (Fletcher and 
Islam, 2018; Rezatofighi et al., 2019). For a binary classification task 
with two sets of classified quantities A, B ∈ ℝn  the IoU is calculated as 
follows. 

IoU =

processing  of  the  recorded  images.  In  some  cases,  deep  learning 
models perform quite poorly when the training data and the test data are 
recorded with different types of cameras, different illumination condi-
tions  and/or  different  acquisition  geometries.  Hence,  additional  con-
siderations  concerning  transferability  of  the  model  are  needed,  if 
training  and  model  application  are  based  on  datasets  taken  with 
different devices, as e.g., reflex camera and smartphone, respectively.

Helpful Answer:
Two metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model: classification accuracy and intersection over union (IoU). Classification accuracy provides a ratio of the correct classifications and all classifications, describing the percentage of correct classifications. However, for unbalanced datasets, this measure may not be very significant. To overcome this issue, a second evaluation metric called Intersection over Union (IoU) or Jaccard Index is used. This metric considers both false positives and false negatives, providing a more balanced assessment of the model's performance.

The paper presents the results of standard semantic segmentation analyses performed on two subsets of the Johnsbachtal data. For the Johnsbachtal camera dataset, the segmentation resulted in an accuracy of 88.56% and a mean IoU (mIoU) of 74.87%. The precision, recall, and F1-score were 78.22%, 68.26%, and 68.30%, respectively. On the other hand, the segmentation of the Johnsbachtal mobile phone dataset yielded an accuracy of 91.39% and a mIoU of 80.16%. The precision, recall, and F1-score were 80.58%, 81.54%, and 80.34%, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the deep learning models in accurately segmenting and classifying the given datasets.
