%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about which specific platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, it is impossible to determine whether the model was deployed on platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform.
