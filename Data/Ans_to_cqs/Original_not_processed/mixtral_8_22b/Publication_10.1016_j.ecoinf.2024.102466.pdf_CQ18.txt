Ortmann and Johnson, 2021). Secondly, dataset noise is another factor 
that  affects  the  algorithmâ€™s  performance  in  identifying  specific  bird 
species.  This  noise  can  arise  for  a  number  of  reasons,  for  example, 
vandalism, animal damage, loss of power or extreme weather. According 
to Foster (2008), we believe that it is common and may be difficult to 
avoid. In complex environments, environmental clutter and ambiguities 
may affect the bird detection dataset, resulting in a noisy dataset. These 
conditions  make  it  difficult  for  the  algorithm  to  accurately  learn  the 
features of a particular bird species during training, thus affecting its 
detection and recognition capabilities.

The benchmarking species results indicate that the Cascade RCNN 
models performed the best across most of the bird species, achieving AP 
scores of over 0.60 for all species except for Poecile montanus. In contrast, 
the  Sparse  RCNN  model  consistently  had  the  lowest  AP  scores  across 
almost all species, suggesting that its sparse feature learning approach 
may not be as effective for this bird detection. The RetinaNet and FCOS 
models both had relatively low AP scores compared to the other models 
among  bird  species,  especially  for  bird  species  such  as  Phasianus  col-
chicus and Turdus hortulorum. The RepPoints model, while performing 
better  than  RetinaNet  and  FCOS,  still  fell  behind  the  top-performing 
models such as Faster RCNN and Cascade RCNN. Moreover, the ATSS 
and Deformable-DETR models had varying performances depending on 
the bird species. The ATSS model achieved high AP scores for species

The  results  indicate  that  the  Cascade  RCNN  outperformed  other 
models at each training stage, while the FCOS model and Sparse CNN 
model consistently had lower mAP scores than others. This is consistent 
with  the  findings  of  Section  3.1.  Although  12  epochs  were  a  typical 
number of training times, almost all models reached the maximum mAP 
when the number of epochs reached 10. Therefore, for bird recognition, 
not  all  models  are  better  with  more  training  times,  and  choosing 

appropriate  training  times  for  different  models  is  beneficial  to  save 
computing resources. Specifically, the Cascade RCNN model had almost 
no  increase  in  the  mAP  at  9  epochs,  and  the  Faster  CNN  model  also 
showed a similar trend. However, the ATSS and RepPoint growth curves 
continued to 12 epochs, suggesting they require more training data or a 
longer training schedule to perform better.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves evaluating the mean Average Precision (mAP) scores of various models at different stages of training. The text mentions that the Cascade RCNN model outperformed other models at each training stage, while the FCOS model and Sparse CNN model consistently had lower mAP scores than others. It was observed that almost all models reached the maximum mAP when the number of epochs reached 10, indicating that not all models benefit from longer training times. For instance, the Cascade RCNN model showed little improvement after 9 epochs, while the ATSS and RepPoint models required more training data or a longer training schedule to achieve higher performance. Thus, the strategy appears to involve monitoring the mAP scores of the models throughout the training process and adjusting the training duration accordingly to optimize their performance and conserve computing resources.
