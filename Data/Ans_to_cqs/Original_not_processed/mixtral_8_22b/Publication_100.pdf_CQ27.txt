Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

4.5. Implementation details

We have implemented our models in PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2017).
We trained ùëÄ = 5 models with batch size ùêµ = 64 and a base learning
rate ùõº = 10‚àí4. The learning rate is automatically reduced by a factor
of 0.1 when the validation loss has not improved for 15 consecutive
epochs. We apply weight decay to control the strength of the unit
Gaussian prior, with an empirically chosen magnitude of 10‚àí3 that
is inversely proportional to the hyperparameter ùúÜ from Eq. (1). We
chose ùõΩ1 = 0.9, ùõΩ2 = 0.999 and ùúñ = 10‚àí8 as hyper-parameters for the
Adam optimizer. Each neural network was trained on a single Nvidia
RTX2080Ti GPU for ‚àº14 days.

to get blurred (as information over an increasingly larger receptive
field is mixed through repeated convolutions). We visualize our model
architecture in Fig. 5 and in the following, the data flow in the model
is described in more detail.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, based on common practices in machine learning projects, we can infer some possible steps taken during the deployment phase.

After training the model using PyTorch, it would typically be saved or serialized into a file format such as.pt or.pth. This allows the model architecture, weights, and other parameters to be stored and loaded later for inference purposes.

As for platform selection, there are various options available depending on the specific requirements of the project. Some popular choices include cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, which offer services for hosting and managing machine learning models. Alternatively, custom solutions could also be developed using tools like Flask or Django for creating web applications that utilize the trained model for predictions.

In summary, while the exact process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model is not mentioned in the provided context, it likely involved saving the model using PyTorch's built-in functionality and then selecting an appropriate platform for hosting and serving predictions.
