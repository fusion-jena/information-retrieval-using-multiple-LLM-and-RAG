Fig. E.2. Marginal posterior distributions for each estimated parameter. Individual plot titles provide the marginal posterior means, standard deviations (in pa-
rentheses)  and  effective  sample  sizes.  Posterior  means  are  indicated  by  a  solid  vertical  line.  95%  credible  intervals  are  indicated  by  dashed  vertical  lines.  The 
parameter value the data were produced from is indicated by a vertical dotted line. Posterior distributions are indicated by a curve with a solid line (with shading 
below the curve). Prior distributions are indicated by a curve with a solid line and no shading below the curve (note these have very little density, relative to the 
posterior). Prior means are not displayed, to enable the shape of posterior marginal distributions to remain clear.

begin in an area of high posterior density, no samples were removed as a 
‘burn-in’.  No  posterior  samples  were  removed  via  thinning,  as  the 
resulting file sizes still allow for fast post-processing (Link and Eaton, 
2012). Convergence was assessed using the Gelman-Rubin diagnostic. 
To  visualise  posterior  marginal  distributions,  Guassian  kernel  density 
estimation was used, with bandwidth equal to one fifth of the sample 
standard deviation of posterior samples for each respective parameter.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention any criteria for determining when training is complete. However, it mentions that convergence was assessed using the Gelman-Rubin diagnostic. This suggests that the completion of training might be determined based on convergence criteria rather than metrics like validation loss plateaus. Additionally, the text notes that no samples were removed as 'burn-in', indicating that the initial phase of the sampling process was considered part of the converged solution. It also states that no posterior samples were removed via thinning, suggesting that all samples generated during the training process were deemed valuable for understanding the posterior distribution. Therefore, while the exact criteria for determining the completion of training are not specified, they likely involve some form of assessment of convergence or stability in the sampled values.
