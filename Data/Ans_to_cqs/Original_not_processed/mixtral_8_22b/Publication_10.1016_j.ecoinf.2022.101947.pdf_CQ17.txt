mean of the predicted test set size diverges from the actual test set size. 
Optimal classification accuracy was obtained when the test set size 
was smallest relative to the training set. However, even when the test to 
training set  ratio  was  32:12, the  predicted value  was  close  to the  ex-
pected value, demonstrating the robustness of the model.

Further algorithm validation was undertaken using holdback trials, 
to establish the minimum number of trails required for testing. Although 
the predicted mean for each test:training set size was close to the actual 
test size up to the 32:12 combination, after a ratio of 20:24 the amount 
of  variation  in  the  sequential  trials  increased,  potentially  resulting  in 
reduced algorithm accuracy.

was plotted against itself (black circle), against the predicted value for the test 
size  (black  X)  and  against  the  mean  predicted  value  for  each  test  size 
(blue square).

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information about the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. Regularization methods such as dropout and L2 regularization can be used to prevent overfitting in deep learning models. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored or "dropped out" during training, which helps to reduce interdependent learning amongst neurons. L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages large weights and encourages smaller ones, thus preventing overfitting. Other regularization techniques include early stopping, weight decay, and batch normalization.
