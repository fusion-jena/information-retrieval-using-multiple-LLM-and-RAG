Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

whilst providing very reasonable data and computational requirements. 
In Section 6, we discuss the advantages and limitations of the model and 
future work. And finally, we summarize the main findings in Section 7.

The condition score is then calculated using Eq. (9).

D0 is the wet spell duration required in a year for the ecological target to 
maintain good health, calculated as:

(6)  

D0,  min  defines the time taken for the ecological target to reach a con-
dition score of 1- ε from a condition score of 0. FERM then assumes that 
the time taken to reach a condition score of 1- ε is linear within respect to 
the condition score at the start of the wet spell. Epsilon is used to solve 
the asymptotic nature of the curve, which allows for physically-based 
parameterization.

FERM returns condition scores between 0 and 1, the RMSE score may be 
low  when  a  potential  calibration  of  FERM  is  performing  significantly 
worse than the sample mean. Each calibration run was given a maximum 
of  150,000  iterations,  though  all  runs  terminated  early  after  around 
10,000  interactions  without  further  improvement  of  the  objective 
function.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of specific evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of a deep learning model such as accuracy, precision, or recall. The text primarily focuses on discussing the calculation of condition scores using equations and various parameters. It also mentions the use of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for evaluating the performance of FERM, but it does not provide information about any other evaluation metrics related to a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding the specific evaluation metrics used for the deep learning model mentioned in the context.
