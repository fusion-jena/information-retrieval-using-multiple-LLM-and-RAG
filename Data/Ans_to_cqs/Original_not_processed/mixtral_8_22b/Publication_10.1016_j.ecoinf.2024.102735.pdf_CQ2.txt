Data-driven models have evolved as effective decision-support tools
for HABs monitoring and prediction. These models are essential for
using patterns between water quality parameters and ecosystem vari-
ables to predict algal-related parameters such as chlorophyll-a, phyco-
cyanin, algal cells, and toxins (Busari et al., 2023; Kimambo et al.,
2019). Machine learning (ML) models such as random forest (RF),
Multilayer perceptron (MLP), long-short term memory (LSTM), and
support vector regression (SVR) have been used successfully to predict
different algal-related parameters and help identify drivers of HABs (Liu
et al., 2019; Qian et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2015, Busari et al., 2023).
Model predictions are, however, influenced by varying degrees of un-
certainty (Gawlikowski et al., 2023). According to Guzman et al. (2015),
uncertainty refers to the variation between the actual state of a variable
and its theoretical assessment at a particular time. These prediction

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on Table 4, it can be inferred that the data is likely in a structured format, possibly a CSV file or similar, since it includes columns for various measurements like temperature, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, saturated DO, ORP, specific conductivity, pH, and chlorophyll-a levels. The data appears to consist of numerical values rather than images, audio, or video files. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is most likely a structured format such as CSV.
