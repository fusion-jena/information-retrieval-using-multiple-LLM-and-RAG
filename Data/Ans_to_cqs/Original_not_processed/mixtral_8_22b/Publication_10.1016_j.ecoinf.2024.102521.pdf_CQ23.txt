Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Similar considerations slowed the development of other data-intensive 
fields.  The  solution  lies  in  regulation,  either  by  top  journals  that 
consider  data  sharing  as  a  publication  requirement,  or  by  funding 
agencies wishing to maximize the impact of their investment (Michener, 
2015). STARdbi will urge its users to make their data as open as possible. 
We start by raising this issue here.

4.  A modular classification scheme. A taxonomic classification system 
requires  training data  that includes  at  least  hundreds  of  manually 
labeled individuals per class. Thus, a general purpose, yet high res-
olution, system for taxonomic classification is probably not feasible. 
Instead we envision a (gradually growing) set of custom-made AI- 
based classification models. Labeling of individual insects by experts 
is  already  implemented  in  STARdbi,  but  the  other  aspects  of  this 
vision - training, storage, retrieval and application of classification 
models  -  are  not  yet  operational.  We  are  already  creating  task- 
specific  classifiers  on  users’  requests.  The  performance  of  such  a 
classifier is presented in the Results section as case study 1.

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model used for bulk arthropod abundance, biomass, and diversity estimation. However, it can be inferred from the context that the authors have considered the importance of diverse datasets and expert labeling for improving the accuracy and applicability of their models.

In the context, there is a reference to a paper titled "Bulk arthropod abundance, biomass, and diversity estimation using deep learning for computer vision" published in Methods in Ecology and Evolution in 2022. This suggests that the authors may have employed deep learning techniques for image analysis and classification tasks related to arthropods. Additionally, the context mentions the use of a modular classification scheme with custom-made AI-based classification models, which implies that the authors have developed multiple specialized models tailored to different tasks or species.

While the context does not provide explicit details about the methods used to ensure the generalizability of these models, some common practices in machine learning include using diverse datasets, employing cross-validation techniques, and performing stratified sampling during the training process. These approaches help prevent overfitting and improve the ability of the models to perform well on unseen data. Given the emphasis on expert labeling and the creation of task-specific classifiers mentioned in the context, it is reasonable to assume that the authors might have incorporated similar strategies to enhance the robustness and reliability of their deep learning models.
