During the training of the MLP, Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba,
2015) is used, as well as the scheduler which adjusts the learning rate
when the network reaches a plateau. For the training, various parameter
values and different regularization techniques were explored, with the
option of using either Cross-Entropy or Focal Loss (Lin et al., 2017). In
detail, the learning rate was set to 0.00001 and 0.0001, batch sizes of 8,
16, 32, and 64 were tested, and weight decay was varied between
0.0001 and 0.001 with a dropout of 0.1. Additionally, Focal Loss (Lin
et al., 2017) introduce additional parameters to investigate: α and γ. The
former serves as a balancing factor, either as a fixed value for all classes
or as the inverse of each class frequency. The latter regulates the impact
of the scaling factor; specifically, when set to zero, Focal Loss is equiv-
alent to Cross-Entropy Loss. We experimented with α set as the inverse of

During training, the diffusion model is provided with a dataset
comprising trajectories of fixed length. Determining the appropriate
length of these trajectories is a non-trivial task, as it can significantly
impact the performance of the final model. To address this, we initially
plotted the histogram of the original trajectory lengths and extracted
statistics including the minimum, maximum, average, and median
lengths. The analysis revealed that the majority of trajectories have a
length of 13. Consequently, we established a standard trajectory length
of 13 for our model. After segmenting the trajectories into fixed lengths
of 13, we discard segments shorter than 6 detections. For segments with
6 to 12 detections, we replicate their data points until they reach the
required length of 13. Finally, we scale each coordinate of the fish
detection within the range of [(cid:0) 1,1].

Various parameter values, including learning rate (i.e., 0.0001, 0.001,
0.01, and 0.1), batch size (i.e., 32, 64, 128, 256, and 512), and latent
dimension (i.e., 128, 256, 512, 2048), have been explored and
evaluated.

During the training and validation of the models, a stratified train-
test split was employed. This procedure is particularly beneficial for
imbalanced datasets as it maintains the proportion, in our case 80%–
20%, for each class of the original dataset. This means that every class
have approximately 80% of its samples in the train set and approxi-
mately 20% in the validation set. This ensures that all classes participate
in both the training and validation phases of the model. However, this
stratified train-test split was not applied to the dataset composed of
trajectories of length 13, but rather to the original trajectories of vari-
able length. This was done to ensure that each trajectory belongs
exclusively to either the train or validation splits, but not both. As a
consequence, in terms of fixed-length trajectories, each with a length of
13, we obtained 13,489 samples in training and 3448 samples in
validation.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does indicate that during the training of the MLP, a scheduler is used that adjusts the learning rate when the network reaches a plateau. This suggests that one possible criterion for determining when training is complete could be based on observing a plateau in the validation loss. When the validation loss stops improving or starts increasing, it may indicate that the model has started overfitting the training data and further training would not improve the model's generalization ability. Therefore, reaching a plateau in the validation loss could serve as a signal to stop training.
