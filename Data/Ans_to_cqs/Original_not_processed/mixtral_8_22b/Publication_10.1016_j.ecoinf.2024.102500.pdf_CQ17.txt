Individual machine learning models address large datasets and dy-
namic water quality data well but are commonly overfit. Researchers 
have employed model to address this issue. Combining weak learners 
reduces overfitting and strengthens the prediction model (Mosavi et al., 
2020). Adedeji et al., 2022 predicted stream water quality using SVM, 
RF,  XGB,  ensemble  RF-XGB,  and  ANN  models.  Panahi  et  al.  (2022) 
predicted stream flow and water quality with data pre-processing based 
on  an  ensemble  bagging  technique  combined  with  the  SVM  model. 
(Haghiabi et al., 2018) analyzed various aspects of water quality in the 
Tireh River in Iran, employing models based on ANN, group method of 
data handling (GMDH), and SVM. Among these models, the SVM model 
utilizing  the  radial  bias  function  demonstrated  outstanding  perfor-
mance,  highlighting  its  effectiveness  in  accurately  predicting  water

model  hyperparameters  selected  for  nitrate  and  DO  prediction  to 
maximize  performance.  Subsamples  reduce  overfitting  and  min_-
child_samples  control local pattern  sensitivity. Overfitting is  prevented 
via reg_lambda. As mentioned, n_estimators, learning_rate, max_depth, and 
random_state were used. 

3.2.2.9. GB  model  hyperparameter  tuning. As  seen  in  Table  2,  the 
hyperparameter values for the nitrate and DO model are reported below. 
As described in the preceding sections, each of these parameters is uti-
lized. These hyperparameter settings were carefully chosen to enhance 
the nitrate and DO model performances.

Hyperparameter  tuning  plays  a  crucial role  in  optimizing  the  per-
formance of a model by improving its ability to predict observed and 
predicted ranges. The tuning process maximizes the models training and 
testing  performance.  It  will  control  overfitting  or  underfitting  issues 
(Elshawi et al., 2019). Though the process is complex and takes a long 
time,  many  optimizing  methods,  such  as  Manual  Tuning,  Bayesian 
Optimization,  and  random  grid  search  methods,  simplify  the  process 
(Yang  and  Shami,  2020).  Nevertheless,  choosing  which  optimizing 
method is best for specific data is challenging. Hyperparameter tuning of 
the decision tree model are usually configured with maximum depth and 
minimum number of samples required to split a node. For the RF model, 
extensive  experimentation  was  conducted  using  varying  numbers  of 
trees  for  the  optimal  fit.  The  gradient  boosting  model  is  tuned  with

This evaluation helps choose hyperparameters that reduce prediction 
errors and improve model precision. After testing many combinations, 
the best ones were found. During model overfitting, n_estimators, max_-
depth,  and  subsample  were  most  affected.  These  variables  govern  the 
modelâ€™s  complexity  and  generalization  to  prevent  overfitting  the 
training  set.  Decisions  were  based  on  whether  final  hyperparameter 
combinations could reduce overfitting and increase model functionality. 
Overfitting  is  common  with  boosting  models.  Hyperparameters  effec-
tively address these  difficulties. Initial hyperparameter  values  for col-
sample_bytree,  learning  rate,  max_depth,  and  n_estimators  were  varied. 
Collapse_by_tree, learning rate, max_depth, and n_estimators range from 0 to 
1, 1, 20, and 200.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not explicitly mention any regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines like dropout or L2 regularization. However, it discusses several techniques used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models, particularly ensemble methods and hyperparameter tuning.

Ensemble methods combine multiple weak learners to create a strong learner, reducing overfitting and improving the overall prediction accuracy. Examples include Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), and ensemble RF-XGB. These methods have been applied in studies to predict stream water quality and analyze various aspects of water quality.

Hyperparameter tuning also plays a significant role in preventing overfitting. By adjusting hyperparameters such as subsamples, min_child_samples, reg_lambda, n_estimators, learning_rate, max_depth, and random_state, one can effectively control overfitting and improve the model's performance. This optimization process involves selecting the best combination of hyperparameters through manual tuning, Bayesian Optimization, or random grid search methods.

In summary, while the given context does not directly address regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines, it highlights ensemble methods and hyperparameter tuning as effective strategies to prevent overfitting in machine learning models.
