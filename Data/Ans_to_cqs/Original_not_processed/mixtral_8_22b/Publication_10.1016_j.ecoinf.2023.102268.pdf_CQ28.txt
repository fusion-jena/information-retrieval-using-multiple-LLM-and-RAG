Hydrophone deployment and recovery were facilitated by O. Caretti, 
with  assistance  from  R.  Patrick  Lyon,  E.  Voigt,  and  K.  Simmons.  The 
members of the Jones Bay Club generously provided use of their boat 
ramp  for  instrument  deployment  and  recovery.  This  work  benefited 
from discussions with S. Ricci and D. Eggleston, as well as from early 
testing and critical conversations with O. Caretti and R. Van Hoeck.

These  spectrogram images  are  input  into  the  ResNet-50  deep  (50- 
layer) convolutional neural network (CNN), which was developed and 
pre-trained using millions of label images in over 1000 categories (He 
et  al.,  2015).  Although  ResNet-50  was  not  explicitly  trained  on  spec-
trograms, many studies have shown that CNNs pre-trained for one task 
can  extract  meaningful  features  distant  from  the  original  training 
dataset  (e.g.,  Almabdy  and  Elrefaei,  2019;  Bousetouane  and  Morris, 
2015; Copiaco et al., 2019; Razavian et al., 2014). A suite of features is

Fig.  6. Feature  extraction  and  classification  work-
flows as applied to the same data segments in Fig. 5. 
An  850-ms  long  data  segment  (boxes)  is  extracted 
from the unfiltered waveform around each detection 
to  form  a  frequency-reassigned  spectrogram  image. 
These  images  are  fed  into  ResNet-50  CNN,  and  acti-
vations  from  the  fully  connected  layer  (fc1000)  are 
used as a feature vector for each detected signal. The 
SVM  classifier  is  used  to  classify  the  candidate  de-
tections based on the layer activations. Signals in the 
‘other’  class  represent  false  alarms  identified  by 
detection stage.

%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which platform was used for this purpose.
