as  the  validation  dataset  to  assess  the  performance  of  BirdNET  and 
Kaleidoscope  Pro.  The  software  performance  was  evaluated  by 
comparing the recall rate and the percentage of occurrences detected 
using each software when compared to the ones obtained in the vali-
dation dataset. The recall rate is an index commonly used in bioacoustics

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide specific information on the criteria used to determine when training is complete for automated recognition software such as BirdNET or Kaleidoscope Pro. However, generally speaking, common criteria used to determine when training is complete include a validation loss plateau, where the model's performance on the validation set stops improving; early stopping, where training is stopped once the model's performance on the validation set starts degrading; or reaching a predefined number of epochs or iterations. These criteria help prevent overfitting and ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data.
