accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrices, among others, to compre-
hensively assess the performance and effectiveness of our model. 

Specifically,  the  use  of  confusion  matrices  will  provide  us  with 
detailed information regarding both correct and incorrect classifications 
made  by  our  model.  This  valuable  insight  will  enable  us  to  identify 
potential  deficiencies  in  classifying  specific  classes  or  categories.  In 
conclusion,  we  will  present  the  evaluation  results  through  the  use  of 
figures  and  numerical  data.  Graphical  visualizations  will  effectively 
portray the performance estimation achievement. 

4. Discussion and results

We  consider  the  false  positive  (FP)  and  false  negative  (FN)  per-
centage to measure how good the model fit is. These metrics allow us to 
know the percentage of hits that our model achieves for each class. In 
addition, we have observed that the metrics such as balanced accuracy 
(B.  Acc),  F-measure  Fβ,  Cohen’s  kappa  coefficient  k  and  Matthew’s 
correlation  coefficient  (MCC)  have  proven  to  be  adequate  in  similar 
contexts, although they have their own limitations (Chicco et al., 2021; 
Chicco  and  Jurman,  2020;  Lee  et  al.,  2021).  For  this  reason,  Table  1 
presents the results of these metrics in relation to the parameters of our 
model and the final results obtained in our real fire. Using these alter-
native measures gives us a more complete and accurate picture of the 
performance of our model, which is essential to properly evaluate. 

We use the following partitions, which determine the importance of ρ 

in our estimations:

However, for machine learning algorithms like backpropagation to 
be successful, a critical condition must be met: all functions involved 
must be differentiable to compute gradients accurately. As said above, 
to make the update criterion differentiable, we use the Gumbel softmax 

function.  So,  by  changing  our  update  criterion  to 

̃
Uk,  we  manage  to 

compute the gradients. 

This new data-driven architecture aims to learn the neighbourhood 
relationship Rk to improve the results of our model. In addition, learning 
the  neighbourhood  relationship  has  value  in  itself,  as  it  allows  us  to 
know and learn how the different elements of the system interact. For 
this purpose, as we can see in Fig. 13 a neural network ANN (or other 
objects) might be defined as Rk, which may take two kinds of inputs:

Helpful Answer:
The text mentions several metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. These include accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrices. The use of confusion matrices provides detailed information about both correct and incorrect classifications made by the model, enabling the identification of potential deficiencies in classifying specific classes or categories. Additionally, the false positive (FP) and false negative (FN) percentages are considered to measure how well the model fits. These metrics help understand the percentage of hits the model achieves for each class. Other metrics mentioned include balanced accuracy (B. Acc), F-measure Fβ, Cohen’s kappa coefficient k, and Matthew’s correlation coefficient (MCC). These alternative measures give a more comprehensive and accurate picture of the model's performance, which is crucial for proper evaluation.
