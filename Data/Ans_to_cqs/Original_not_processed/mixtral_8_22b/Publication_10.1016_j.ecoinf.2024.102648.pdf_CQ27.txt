2.2. Machine learning and deep learning tools 

In the present study machine learning (bootstrap forest, boosted tree) 
and deep learning (artificial neural network) models were employed to 
forecast  the  percent  disease  incidence  of  CLCuD  under  the  prevailing 
weather data on minimum, maximum and average temperature, stan-
dard meteorological week (SMW)-wise growing degree days (henceforth 
mentioned  as  GDD),  minimum  relative  humidity  (RHmini.),  maximum 
relative humidity (RHmax.), average relative humidity (RHave.), cumu-
lative rainfall (mm) and whitefly per three leaves. The weather param-
eters recorded from 2011 to 2019 at weather stations based at all four 
locations  were  used  for  calculating  the  GDD  as  per  the  following 
equations.

including multiple linear regression, machine learning (bootstrap forest, 
boosted tree), and deep learning (ANN) models through statistical and 
machine learning methods and compare them for prediction accuracy. 
The ultimate aim was to develop a holistic model with better accuracy 
and reliability for the prediction of CLCuD which ultimately can help 
timely application of management decisions in the prevailing climatic 
conditions.

training  = 0.80 and R2

models (Table 4). Further, to reduce the dependency on data other than 
temperatures  and  improve  prediction  ability  we  analyzed  ML  tools- 
ANN, -BSF and BST models using growing degree days (GDD) data. The 
model was tested and validated for various activation functions as well 
as different testing and training data sets.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it is not possible to determine the exact process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, some common steps involved in deploying a deep learning model include model serialization, platform selection, and integration into existing systems or applications. Model serialization involves saving the trained model parameters and architecture in a file format such as.h5 or.pkl, so that they can be loaded later for making predictions. Platform selection involves choosing a suitable environment for running the deployed model, such as cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure, or local servers. Integration into existing systems or applications may involve writing custom code to call the model and handle its input/output, or using pre-built libraries or APIs. Without more specific details about the deployment process used in this study, it is not possible to provide a more detailed answer.
