improves  upon  the  limitations  of  traditional  methods  in  representing 
non-linear processes and also incorporates thresholds in drought indices 
to differentiate the levels of drought severity. A hybrid model is con-
structed  by  integrating  Convolutional  Neural  Networks  (CNN)  with 
Long Short-Term  Memory networks (LSTM) to effectively capture the 
intricate process of drought propagation (Ghimire et al., 2021; Khorram 
and Jehbez, 2023). CNNs are effective at modeling the linear and non- 
linear relationships between influencing factors and drought propaga-
tion time and the interactions among influencing factors. Meanwhile, 
LSTMs  are  used  to  learn  the  time  lags  in  the  responses  of  drought 
propagation time to various influencing factors.(Ghimire et al., 2021; 
Qu  et  al.,  2021).  The  hybrid  model,  constructed  by  integrating  both 
elements, can handle the complex process of drought propagation. This

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the paper. However, generally speaking, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and landmark annotation. These techniques help label the input data, which is then fed into the deep learning models for training purposes.

Based on the context, it appears that the authors have employed a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM) to develop a hybrid model for capturing the intricate process of drought propagation. While this information suggests that some form of image or spatial data was likely used, there is no explicit mention of the type of data annotation technique utilized in the study. Therefore, without further details, it is difficult to determine the exact data annotation techniques used in this particular deep learning pipeline.
