The training process was performed for a number of iterations in which all the training
data were exposed to the network until the loss function reached its minimum value. The
model score reached its maximum after approximately 5000 iterations with a NVIDIA
Titan X GPU (3584 CUDA cores). The number of trainable parameters was 85,569 and the
computational run-time was approximately 4 h with a training batch size of 1024.

Deep learning approaches have shown promising results in many scientiÔ¨Åc applica-
tions [67,68] but do not always guarantee better outcomes [69,70]. Therefore, we compared
the performance of the proposed DL model with a RF regression model as a baseline, since
RF showed reasonable results and is popular in various machine learning applications [71].
To determine the best values of the hyperparameters (number of trees, maximum tree
depths, and the maximum number of features) in the RF model, a grid search was used.

Regarding the DL framework, our proposed models were based on the most typical
type of neural network, using pixel-wise inputs due to the characteristics of the data used
in this study. As mentioned in Section 2.4, general image-based CNN architectures may
not be appropriate for our data; applying one-dimensional CNN [81,82] or recurrent neural
networks [83] in the temporal domain, or graph convolutional networks for handling graph
structures between samples [84] should be interesting topics, as these are more advanced
approaches. Additionally, super-resolution using a generative adversarial network [85]
would further improve the spatial resolution of species richness map.

Korea for model training and testing. TensorFlow (https://tensorflow.org (accessed on 24 June 2021)), which is an end-to-end open source platform for DL, was used to develop our species richness estimation model. In developing DL models, there are several hyperparameters that need to be tuned prior to training the model, but there are common sets of rules or heuristics governing parameter tuning. After iterative grid search parameter tuning, using a small subset of our data, 5 hidden layers (ùêáùëó,ùëó=1,2,‚ãØ,5) were used, and the number of neurons (n) in Remote Sens. 2021, 13, 2490

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, it is stated that the proposed models were based on the most typical type of neural network, using pixel-wise inputs due to the characteristics of the data used in this study. However, the exact type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly mentioned. It can be inferred that the authors used a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) because they mention using pixel-wise inputs, which is a characteristic of CNNs. Furthermore, the authors discuss the possibility of using other types of deep learning models such as one-dimensional CNN, recurrent neural networks (RNN), and graph convolutional networks, suggesting that the current model is different from those. Therefore, it can be concluded that the authors used a CNN in their pipeline.
