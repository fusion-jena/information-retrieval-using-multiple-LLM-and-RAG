Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information regarding the availability or location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in this study is not explicitly mentioned within the given context. Therefore, it cannot be determined where the code repository is located based solely on these details. It could potentially be found on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket, but further research would need to be conducted to find its exact location.
