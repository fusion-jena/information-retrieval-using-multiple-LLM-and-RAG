As  the  capacity  to  collect  and  store  large  amounts  of  data  expands,  identifying  and  evaluating  strategies  to 
efficiently convert raw data into meaningful information is increasingly necessary. Across disciplines, this data 
processing task has become a significant challenge, delaying progress and actionable insights. In ecology, the 
growing use of camera traps (i.e., remotely triggered cameras) to collect information on wildlife has led to an 
enormous volume of raw data (i.e., images) in need of review and annotation. To expedite camera trap image 
processing,  many  have  turned  to  the  field  of  artificial  intelligence  (AI)  and  use  machine  learning  models  to 
automate tasks such as detecting and classifying wildlife in images. To contribute understanding of the utility of 
AI tools for processing wildlife camera trap images, we evaluated the performance of a state-of-the-art computer

images  that  need  to  be  reviewed  and  analyzed  (Norouzzadeh  et  al., 
2018; Swanson et al., 2015). These data processing tasks often represent 
a significant bottleneck in the research process from the collection of 
images  to  having  useful  information  to  answer  research  questions.  In 
response  to this challenge, many have  turned  to the field  of artificial 
intelligence (AI) to build computer vision models that leverage machine 
learning to help automate these data processing tasks (Christin et al., 
2019; Miao et al., 2019; Norouzzadeh et al., 2018; S. Schneider et al., 
2018; Tabak et al., 2019; Thomson et al., 2018; Tuia et al., 2022; VÂ´elez 
et  al.,  2022).  With  rapid  adoption  and  advancement  of  automated 
methods,  the  time-consuming  burden  of  manually  reviewing  and  la-
beling images has been significantly reduced, ultimately reducing the 
lag between data collection and application and alleviating some of the

AI tools provide an appealing solution for Big Data challenges asso-
ciated  with  many  camera  trap  studies  and  we  anticipate  they  will 
continue to improve as more training data are incorporated in model 
development.  To  facilitate  this  progress,  however,  inevitably  more 
painstaking manual human review of images will need to occur. While 
no one approach for collecting and processing wildlife camera trap data 
is  likely  to  be  optimal  for  all  study  systems,  our  study  provides  an 

example of how choices of camera trigger settings and image processing 
methods can dramatically influence data available to draw insights from 
and the importance of making well-informed and intentional decisions 
about which methods to use based on study specific conditions.

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not directly address the handling of randomness in the deep learning pipeline or the use of random seed values. However, it discusses the use of AI and machine learning models to automate tasks such as detecting and classifying wildlife in images collected by camera traps. This involves using computer vision models built through machine learning techniques, but it doesn't explicitly mention strategies for dealing with randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

In general, when working with deep learning pipelines, there are several ways to manage randomness. One common strategy is setting a fixed random seed value before running any code involving random processes. By doing so, researchers ensure reproducibility and consistency across different runs of their experiments. Another method is employing cross-validation techniques like k-fold validation, where the dataset is divided into multiple subsets, and each subset serves as a test set once while the remaining ones form the training set. This helps reduce overfitting and improves the robustness of the model. Lastly, ensemble methods combine multiple models trained independently to produce better predictions, effectively mitigating the impact of randomness during individual model training.
