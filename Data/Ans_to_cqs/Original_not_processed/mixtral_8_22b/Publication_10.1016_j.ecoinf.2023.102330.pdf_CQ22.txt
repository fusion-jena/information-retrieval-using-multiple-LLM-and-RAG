Recordings were analyzed using a previously developed CNN model 
(Nolan  et  al., 2022)  trained on covey call  spectrogram data collected 
separately to this study from Di-Lane and other sites around Georgia and 
Alabama,  USA.  Our  covey  call  acoustic  CNN  is  trained  to  detect  and 
localize all covey calls per ARU during the recording period and note 
their associated time and peak power (dB). We chose to use a relatively 
conservative  score  threshold  echoing  that  of  other  similar  studies 
ˇ
Sirovi´c, 2021; Ruff et al., 2020), where only calls that 
(Rasmussen and 
received a score of 0.95 or higher were officially classified as a positive 
bobwhite detection. All CNN detections at a 0.95 score threshold from a 
random sample of five one-hour files from each year were then manually 
reviewed to evaluate model accuracy and to calculate a false positive 
rate “i.e. how many calls were incorrectly labelled as bobwhite”. Across

Our ARU DS model was slightly more complex, and consisted of four 
sub-models:  1)  detection  probability  as  a  function  of  peak  power,  2) 
peak power as a function of the distance between calls and ARUs, 3) the 
number of calls for each covey, and 4) the number of coveys. We used 
the linear relationship between peak power and distance (eq. 9) to first 
convert  peak  powers  obtained  from  our  CNN  to  distances  for  each 
detected  or  simulated  covey  call  j.  We  used  a  half  normal  detection 
function to estimate the scale parameter for the ARU data (σARU) and 
model  the probability  of detecting  each  call at  each  ARU using  these 
estimated  distances.  We  used  informative  priors  based  on  the  values 
from Wilhite et al. (2020) (mean, precision) for these parameters:: ao ~ 
Normal (76.45, 10), a1 ~ Normal ((cid:0) 0.147, 1e6), tauj  ~ Exponential (1/ 
5) where ∈j  = pow(tauj, (cid:0) 2) and σ ~ Normal (96, 10).

Helpful Answer: The text does not explicitly mention specific metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does indicate that a conservative score threshold of 0.95 was chosen for classifying positive bobwhite detections, which suggests that some form of classification evaluation metric was employed. Furthermore, the manual review of CNN detections from a random sample of five one-hour files from each year aimed to evaluate model accuracy and calculate a false positive rate. This implies that the authors considered both correct and incorrect classifications when assessing the model's performance. Therefore, while the exact metrics may not be specified, we can infer that the authors evaluated the model's performance by considering its ability to correctly identify true positives and minimize false positives.
