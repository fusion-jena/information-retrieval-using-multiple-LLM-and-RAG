Kalkan and Maktav, 2018). For this reason, the first action taken was to 
perform atmospheric correction on the images in QGIS.

Nguyen et al. (2018) employed three distinct machine learning al-

of fire risk maps that exhibit enhanced efficacy in fire-sensitive forest 
ecosystems  can  be  achieved  by  utilizing  diverse  remote  sensing  data 
characterized by high spatial resolution, particularly Unmanned Aerial 
Vehicle (UAV) images incorporating multispectral bands. Additionally, 
employing  various  modeling  techniques  such  as  artificial  neural  net-
works, deep learning, and logistic regression can further contribute to 
refining these maps.

forests  using  564  fire  ignition  points  and  ten  different  variables.  The 
Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (AUC = 0.894) demonstrated the 
best performance, and NDVI was among the variables analyzed. Corre-
lation analysis of forest fire ignition points and variables showed that the 
NDVI (r = 0.51) index was the most reliable predictor of fire occurrence. 
In contrast, Iban  and  Sekertekin (2022) developed  a fire  risk map 
using  seven  machine  learning  techniques,  RS  data,  and  GIS.  Thirteen 
different variables affecting forest fire risk were employed in this study. 
The accuracy of the maps obtained using seven machine-learning tech-
niques ranged from 0.817 to 0.879, as measured by AUC values. NDVI 
was  among  the  variables  used  in  this  study.  The  correlation  analysis 
showed that the elevation variable (r = 0.626) had the highest corre-
lation with fire risk, while NDVI (r = 0.256) exhibited a low correlation.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there is no specific mention of which hardware resources were used for training the deep learning models. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether GPUs, TPUs, or other types of hardware resources were utilized for training the deep learning models. Further information would be required to provide a more accurate response.
