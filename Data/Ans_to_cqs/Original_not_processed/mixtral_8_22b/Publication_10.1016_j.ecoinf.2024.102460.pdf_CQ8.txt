1.62%, respectively, of the total area and 96.83%, respectively, of the 
net increase in built-up area. 

From 2000 to 2020, the overall dynamic land use degree was 0.11%, 
and the overall change was stable. The reduction rate of unused area 
reached 0.3% (Fig. 5). The annual average growth rate of the built-up 
area  was  the  highest  at  4.51%.  From  a  regional  perspective,  Yulin's 
built-up area grew at an annual average rate of 28.36%, far exceeding 
that of other prefecture-level cities.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given information, there is no explicit mention or reference to a specific code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the research. Therefore, it cannot be determined where the code repository is available, such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. It might be possible that the code is not publicly accessible or shared by the researchers. To obtain accurate information about the code repository, one should contact the corresponding author(s) directly or refer to any additional resources related to the paper.
