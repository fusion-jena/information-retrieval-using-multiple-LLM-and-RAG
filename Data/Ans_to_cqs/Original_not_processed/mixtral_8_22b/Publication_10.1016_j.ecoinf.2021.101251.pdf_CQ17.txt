As  data  becomes  more  accessible,  data  consumers  are  able  to 
incorporate data from many data packages into an analysis. However, 
when a large number of data packages have been used, properly citing 
the data in the reference section without going over page limits can be 
difficult. For example, a paper based on the data from all the AmeriFlux 
sites, all of the NGEE-Tropics data packages, or all of the WFSFA data 
packages would need to include 350, 70, and 96 citations, respectively, 
in the references section. This large number of required citations often 
leads to the citations for the data being provided in the supplementary 
materials, within data/metadata files, or as a table of identifiers. In all of 
these cases, it is difficult to programmatically find the citation of the 
data and thus is unlikely to be counted in the data’s citation metrics. A 
solution to this challenge would be to provide a single citation that can

the best way for data producers to receive credit but are time consuming 
and  result  in  a  static  view  of  the  data.  Challenging  decisions  such  as 
defining  authorship  and  following  usage  policy  requirements  such  as 
attribution are not directly solved. In cases where usage rules for the 
integrated data are not the same, a method for unifying the data usage 
policies is needed. In our experience, treating all the data as having the 
most restrictive policy can work if the policies are compatible. That is an 
approach  we used  with FLUXNET  which  often  has  two different  data 
usage policies.

Data  consumers,  particularly  modelers  and  machine  learning  de-
velopers, are utilizing data from many data packages and sources at a 
greater  pace  than  ever  before.  Citation  of  large  collections  of  data 
packages or specific integrated data within and across data packages is 
an  under-appreciated  challenge.  We  described  some  of  the  options 
currently available to repositories for providing integrated citations as 
well  as  their  pros  and  cons.  Which  option  is  best  depends  on  the 
particular  use  case.  In  all  cases,  these  options  have  the  potential  to 
enable a compact citation for a paper. However, both data collections 
and  especially  dynamic  data  citations  require  significant  specialized 
infrastructure and interfaces to be built at the repository to create them 
and  to  ensure  appropriate  credit  to  data  producers,  and  none  of  the 
options have seen broad universal adoption. Data papers are currently

The context does not contain information about regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, I can still provide an answer to your query. Regularization methods are techniques used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function during training. Two common regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines are Dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to make the model more robust and prevents overfitting. During each iteration of training, a certain percentage of neurons are temporarily removed along with all its incoming and outgoing connections. This forces the network to learn redundant representations of the input features, making it less likely to rely too heavily on any one feature.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function equal to the sum of squares of all the weights in the network. This encourages smaller weights, which makes the model less complex and less prone to overfitting. It also helps to reduce the variance of the model, improving its generalization performance.

Other regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines include L1 regularization, early stopping, and batch normalization. Each of these methods works differently, but they all aim to improve the model's ability to generalize to new data by preventing overfitting.
