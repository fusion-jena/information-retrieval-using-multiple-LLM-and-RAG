Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Halgamuge et al. (2020) focused on utilizing deep learning to esti-
mate the best optimizer selection methods for wildfire event predictions 
in Australia. They developed an algorithm to collect the data automat-
ically and analyzed six different optimizer models using deep learning 
technology. They concluded that this approach could predict a natural 
disaster, including wildfire events, by investigating historical environ-
mental  conditions  before  and  after  wildfires  occurred  using  the  deep 
learning methodology. Dowdy (2020) focused on demonstrating a sea-
sonal prediction system for wildfire event prediction in Australia. This 
measured  spatio-temporal  variations  and  seasonality  across  several 
datasets  and  utilized  this  methodology  to  predict  wildfire  events, 
focusing on the seasonal predictions using the 2019â€“2020 wildfire sea-
son  as  an  example  and  measuring  long-term  predictions.  Coen  et  al.

burn-in  steps,  171  thinning  steps  and  4  chains  were  extracted.  The 
resulting MCMC diagnostics are very similar to the informative model 
and  show  no  issues  with  representativeness  and  accuracy.  Diagnostic 
plots are given in Appendix. The model efficiency was 23.1 min on the 
same machine used in previous models, which is still efficient in terms of 
implementation time, considering the complexity of the model.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. However, it does provide information about the implementation time of the model being 23.1 minutes on the same machine used in previous models. Without further details, we cannot determine the exact hardware resources used for training the deep learning model.
