XGBoost  offer  a  quantitative  measure  of  the  influence  of  each  input 
feature on the model's predictive accuracy. Specifically, Random Forest 
determines  feature  importance  by  assessing  the  reduction  in  the  Gini 
impurity each time the feature is used for splitting across all trees in the 
ensemble.  XGBoost  computes  feature  importance  based  on  the  gain, 
which indicates the improvement in accuracy brought by a feature to the 
branches which it is on.

higher  MS is needed to better capture the index response to wildfire. 
Compared to the default parameters, the overall accuracy and kappa of 
optimized  parameters  can  improve  by  up  to  8.4%  and  36.8%, 
respectively.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some indications that suggest potential strategies employed. For instance, the use of Google Earth Engine for planetary-scale geospatial analysis implies access to diverse datasets from various regions around the world. This could contribute to enhancing the model's ability to perform well when applied to new data outside its training set. Additionally, the mention of using XGBoost, a powerful machine learning algorithm known for its robustness against overfitting, suggests that the researchers might have considered techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting during their modeling process. These methods help prevent overfitting and improve the model's performance on unseen data. Nevertheless, without more detailed information regarding the exact steps taken to validate the model, we cannot definitively state what measures were specifically implemented to ensure its generalizability.
