where t and h represent temperature and humidity resp. 
b.Modification  of  the  update  criterion  and  application  of  ma-
chine learning: We will seek to improve our model by modifying the 
update  criterion,  maintaining  stochasticity  but  making  it  differen-
tiable. This will allow us to take advantage of machine-learning tools 
and turn our model into an intelligent cellular automaton. 
c.Optimising  the  scope:  We  will  make  changes  in  the  partitions 
used to increase the number of cells exposed in each iteration. This 
will become another adjustable parameter to improve the accuracy 
and efficiency of the model. 
d.Strategies of variance-reduction: As previously mentioned, the 
estimator  given  by  Eq.  6  may  not  have  the  minimum  variance. 
Therefore, it opens the possibility to investigate and develop new and 
more sophisticated estimators by using variance reduction strategies 
such as the importance sampling, stratified sampling, Quasi-Monte

makes our model a powerful tool for predicting real-world phenomena 
such as wildfire spreads or pest plants propagation, since we take into 
account the most important variables in the representation.

Fig.  7  represents  in  Log  scale  the  probability  of  getting  the  Von 
Neumann dynamics according to n, with p0 = 0.5. We observe that the 
probability  decreases  when  n  increases,  so  even  though  such  a  seed 
exists,  it  is  computationally  expensive  to  find  it. Moreover,  thanks to 
Property 4.3 we can deduce that the optimal value for getting this dy-
namic also depends on the grid size and is

Therefore, while our classification model harnesses the power of the 
Monte Carlo method, its practical application requires careful consid-
eration  of  the  computational  challenges  and  the  need  for  a  sufficient 
number of trials to ensure reliable results. Exploring innovative variance 
reduction  techniques  (Kleijnen  et  al.,  2010;  Botev  and  Ridder,  2017) 
would help to improve the model’s accuracy and broaden its applica-
bility in future research and real-world applications. 

5.2. Application to a real wildfire 

Since our model can be used as a Monte Carlo method, we apply it to 
a  real  case.  We  consider  the  wildfire  in  Vall  de  Gallinera  (Valencian 
Community, Spain) in August 2020, see Fig. 10. This is part of a database 
of  wildfires  in  our  community,  which  we  are  setting  up,  see  Supple-
mentary Data. 

Then, the estimate that our model would make is given by Fig. 12, 

assuming Fig. 11 as our climate conditions for θ and ρ.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about specific optimization techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that they plan to modify their update criterion to maintain stochasticity but make it differentiable. This modification allows them to leverage machine learning tools and transform their model into an intelligent cellular automaton. Additionally, they discuss optimizing the scope by changing partitions to expose more cells in each iteration, creating another adjustable parameter to enhance the model's accuracy and efficiency. These modifications suggest that some form of optimization technique might be employed, although the exact methods remain unspecified in the provided context.
