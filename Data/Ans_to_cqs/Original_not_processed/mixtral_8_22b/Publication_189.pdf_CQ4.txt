initialization in this model, a coco weight initialization file was 
used  but  it  didn’t  serve  the  purpose.  So,  the  model  has  been 
initialized with random weight initialization in later stages. This 
model  was  tested  with  and  without  image  data  augmentation 
[27] for each training image with several flips and rotations. The 
augmented  data  that  has  been  used  while  training  provided  a 
little  deeper  understanding  of  the  objects  to  the  model  and 
improved the segmentation.

Helpful Answer:
The text mentions that the model was tested with and without image data augmentation [27] for each training image with several flips and rotations. However, it does not provide specific details about the exact data augmentation techniques applied or their parameters. Nevertheless, based on the information given, we can infer that the data augmentation techniques used include flipping and rotation. These are common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines to increase the size of the dataset and improve the model's ability to generalize. Flipping involves creating new images by horizontally or vertically flipping existing ones, while rotation involves rotating images by a certain degree. Other popular data augmentation techniques include scaling, cropping, zooming, shearing, and adding noise. It is important to note that the choice of data augmentation technique depends on the nature of the problem and the characteristics of the dataset.
