The  snow  leopard  training  pipeline  described  here  may  be  repur-
posed rather quickly to train new models if more users utilize the system 
and  additional  data  is  submitted.  The  existing  model  may  also  help 
bootstrap that data-curation process. There is a considerable possibility 
for  regional  and  global  research  collaborations  with  snow  leopard 
research  institutions  to  curate  and  independently  identify  data  that 
would advance these existing models toward greater sophistication and 
improved performance. Deep learning systems have the ability to sur-
pass humans in the re-identification of animals, even in the absence of 
obvious patterns and markings, if sufficient datasets and collaboration

original base data features and can be used to enrich a data set, sup-
plemented by as much as 10Ã— the amount of data while also reducing 
overfitting of the model (Bansal et al., 2022; Howard, 2013; Lv et al., 
2017; Shorten and Khoshgoftaar, 2019).

Models were trained and tested by tuning the number of required 
epochs and then inspecting the model outputs and error outcomes for 
signs of overfitting. If the model focuses excessively on data fitting, it 
may imitate insignificant noise rather than the broad properties of in-
terest, resulting in overfitting.

that our novel deep learning methods will encourage other academics to

Helpful Answer:
Answer: Based on the given context, there isn't explicit mention of specific techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection being employed to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some relevant techniques are mentioned.

To prevent overfitting, which could lead to biased models, the authors use data augmentation techniques like left-right mirroring. Data augmentation helps increase the diversity of the dataset without actually collecting new data, thereby potentially addressing any inherent biases present in the original dataset.

Additionally, the authors discuss the importance of having large amounts of data for deep learning tasks. They note that their contribution includes the largest fully labeled snow leopard dataset for deep learning research. This suggests that the authors believe that having a larger and more comprehensive dataset can help mitigate issues related to data bias.

However, it should be noted that while these strategies might indirectly help reduce data bias, they do not directly tackle the problem of data bias. Techniques such as stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, or ensuring diverse data collection would need to be explicitly implemented to specifically target and address data bias.
