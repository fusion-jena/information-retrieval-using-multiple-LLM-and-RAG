Further research could increase the performance and variety of species identified by our CNN-model. For 
instance, the model could be improved by increasing the number of samples and variety of atmospheric and sea 
conditions in the training datasets, by building hierarchical training datasets with different behaviour across 
different species67, by using more spectral bands and temporal information68, and by artificially increasing the 
spatial resolution of the images through rendering69. In addition, as it is a fast and scalable method, it can even be 
transferred to very high spatial resolution images (<10 cm) captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for the 
automatic identification of specific individuals70.

Preliminaries on CNN models for image classification and object detection in images.  Deep 
Neural Networks (DNNs) are a subset of machine learning algorithms able to learn from a training dataset to 
make predictions on new examples called testset. They are built using a hierarchical architecture of increasing 
sophistication, each level of this hierarchy is called layer. One of their main particularities is their capacity to 
extract the existent features from data automatically without the need of external hand crafted features. Under the 
supervised learning paradigm, DNNs provide a powerful framework when trained on a large number of labelled 
samples.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not contain explicit information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the type of optimizer employed. However, based on general practices in deep learning, some common hyperparameters include the learning rate, which controls the step size during gradient descent; the batch size, which determines the number of training examples used in one iteration; the number of epochs, which specifies the number of times the entire training dataset will be passed through the network; and the choice of optimizer, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, or RMSprop. Additionally, depending on the specific application and architecture, other hyperparameters may also be relevant, like weight decay, momentum, dropout rate, etc. To find out the exact hyperparameters used in the mentioned studies, please refer to the original papers or contact the authors directly.
