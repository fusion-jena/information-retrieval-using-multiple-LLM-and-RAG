Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Trails  were  collected  from  free-ranging  Amur  tiger,  of  unknown 
identity, at the study sites. Table 2 reports the trail ID collected for each 
trail. As described above (Section 3.1) sub-trails were formed where >10 
footprints existed in any one trail. For example, the table indicates that 
using the 25 left hind footprints from trail MW09, we were able to derive 
four sub-trails. Section 3.5 below explains how the sex classification for 
images and the resulting designations for each trail were made. 

3.3. Data validation to determine the optimal size for algorithm training 
and test sets

mean of the predicted test set size diverges from the actual test set size. 
Optimal classification accuracy was obtained when the test set size 
was smallest relative to the training set. However, even when the test to 
training set  ratio  was  32:12, the  predicted value  was  close  to the  ex-
pected value, demonstrating the robustness of the model.

Further algorithm validation was undertaken using holdback trials, 
to establish the minimum number of trails required for testing. Although 
the predicted mean for each test:training set size was close to the actual 
test size up to the 32:12 combination, after a ratio of 20:24 the amount 
of  variation  in  the  sequential  trials  increased,  potentially  resulting  in 
reduced algorithm accuracy.

was plotted against itself (black circle), against the predicted value for the test 
size  (black  X)  and  against  the  mean  predicted  value  for  each  test  size 
(blue square).

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). Instead, it focuses on data collection methods for studying free-ranging Amur tigers and validating the optimal size for algorithm training and test sets. It discusses the use of holdback trials to establish the minimum number of trails required for testing and mentions achieving optimal classification accuracy with smaller test set sizes compared to training set sizes. However, without explicit mention of optimization techniques like SGD or Adam, I cannot definitively state which ones were employed in their deep learning pipeline based solely on this context.
