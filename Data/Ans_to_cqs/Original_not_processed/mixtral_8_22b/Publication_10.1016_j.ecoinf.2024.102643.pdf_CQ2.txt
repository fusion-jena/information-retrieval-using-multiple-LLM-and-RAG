Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not directly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on common practices in machine learning and deep learning, various data formats can be utilized depending on the problem domain. These include images, audio files, videos, text data, or structured data like CSV files. In this case, since no explicit details about the dataset or the nature of the task are given, it is impossible to determine which specific data format is being employed in the deep learning pipeline.
