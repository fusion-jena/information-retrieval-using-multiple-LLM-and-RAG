suggests convergence on the maximum test sensitivity plus specificity 
(TSSmax) as the single most appropriate threshold (Guisan et al., 2017). 
However, in this case we used two different test data sets and thus two 
different  thresholds  would  have  been  generated  making  each  non- 
comparable to the other. Thus, in this case we used the 10th percen-
tile training presence (Elith et al., 2010) which was the same across both 
test datasets allowing model evaluation metrics to be directly compared.

obscuring  local  ecological  relationships  in  the  process.  A  different 
method  is  to  thin  out  clustered  records  based  on  their  geographical 
density, whereby the probability of a record removal is proportional to 
the density of occurrence records in the area of a kernel density grid 
(Verbruggen et al., 2013). Weighting background point selection allows 
for the manipulation of the model building process itself; altering the 
selection  of  background  points  to  match  the  bias  in  species  records. 
Some software programmes, including Maxent, allow the inclusion of a 
bias file to offset the effects of clustering by increasing the selection of 
background  points  from  high-density  locations  (Elith  et  al.,  2010). 
Alternatively,  linear  modelling  approaches  can  be  weighted  to

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps may be involved depending on the nature of the dataset and the problem being solved. Some common preprocessing techniques include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing or correcting any inconsistencies, errors, or missing values within the dataset. It also includes handling outliers and dealing with categorical variables if necessary.

2. Normalization/Standardization: These techniques help bring all features into a similar scale, improving the performance of machine learning algorithms. Normalization scales the data between 0 and 1, while standardization transforms the data to have zero mean and unit variance.

3. Feature Scaling: Similar to normalization and standardization, feature scaling rescales the input features so they fall within a specified range. Common methods include Min-Max scaling and Robust scaling.

4. Encoding Categorical Variables: Deep learning models typically work with numerical inputs. Therefore, it might be necessary to convert categorical variables into numerical representations using encoding techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding.

5. Splitting Dataset: Before training the model, the dataset should be split into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set helps tune hyperparameters, and the testing set evaluates the final model's performance.

6. Data Augmentation: In some cases, especially when working with image data, data augmentation techniques like rotation, flipping, zooming, etc., can be applied to increase the size of the dataset and improve the model's ability to generalize.
