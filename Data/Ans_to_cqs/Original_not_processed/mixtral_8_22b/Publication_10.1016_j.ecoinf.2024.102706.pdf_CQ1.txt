and time overhead (Ke et al., 2017). LightGBM sets itself apart from
other tree-based methods through its leaf-wise splitting approach, which
generates more intricate trees. These trees are adept at minimising loss,
leading to enhanced accuracy. The splitting process is guided by a
unique sampling method called Gradient-Based One Side Sampling
(GBOSS) (Ke et al., 2017). This method excludes data with small gra-
dients while utilising the remainder for estimating information gain and
facilitating tree growth. A collection of hyperparameters, such as lear-
ning_rate, max_depth, bagging_fraction, bagging_freq, and n_estimators,
controls the algorithm. These parameters are crucial in shaping how the
leaves are structured within the trees. The model's complexity gradually
rises as the tree grows, guided by these parameters. Simultaneously, loss
decreases, and the algorithm becomes more adept at learning from the
data, thereby improving its efficiency. Moreover, this model is suscep-

image-based vegetation indices for predicting forest canopy cover. The
application of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) for semantic
segmentation has also been investigated across various types of young
vegetation cover (Cameron et al., 2022). Regarding advanced machine
learning approaches, the RF and SVM were the foremost priorities for
the researchers for canopy cover modelling from O'brien, 2007 to 2017,
as reported by Thanh Noi and Kappas (2017). Other advanced ML ap-
proaches have recently been added to similar studies (Li et al., 2022;
Zhou et al., 2020). The boosting methodology represents a synthesis of
robust prediction techniques, frequently surpassing the performance of
individual models such as single decision trees. The emergence of
refined ensemble machine learning techniques like light gradient

resolution. However, exploring additional machine learning algorithms and explicitly boosting methods when
computing forest canopy cover using satellite remote sensing is strongly advised.

construct regression equations. We used multiple linear regression, Enet,
SVM, RF, XGboost and LightGBM to predict canopy cover from planet
data. In general, all the mentioned models are used in machine learning
as they use algorithms to automatically learn patterns and relationships
from data to make predictions or decisions. However, we categorised

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of satellite image-based vegetation indices for predicting forest canopy cover, suggesting that satellite imagery could be one source of raw data. Additionally, the text refers to Planet data, implying that publicly available datasets might also be used. Nevertheless, without explicit mention of survey methods, sensor usage, or other data collection techniques, it cannot be definitively stated what methods are employed for gathering raw data in this particular case.
