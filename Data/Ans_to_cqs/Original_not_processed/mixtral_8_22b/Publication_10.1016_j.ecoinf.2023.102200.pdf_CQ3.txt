Yin  and  Wang  (2019)  used  traditional  MCWS  and  RG  algorithms  to 
segment  individual  mangrove  trees  based  on  a  LiDAR-derived  CHM. 
When  the  traditional  algorithm  was  applied  to  relatively  dense 
mangrove  plots,  individual-tree  segmentation  results  were  relatively 
poor, with an accuracy of <35%. Deep learning (DL), an emerging data 
mining technology, is widely used in image object detection and seg-
mentation research (Hussain and Badola, 2010). Jin et al. (2018) used 
three-dimensional  (3D)  convolutional  neural  networks  (CNNs)  to 
segment  individual  plants  in  maize  plots  using  ground-based  LiDAR 
data. DL achieved good results, with R, P, and F values above 0.9 for the 
three experimental sites with different planting densities. Wang et al. 
(2019a) used the R-CNN method for individual rubber tree segmentation 
based on ground-based light detection and ranging data. Segmentation

Helpful Answer:
The papers mentioned in the given context primarily focus on various applications of remote sensing and machine learning techniques for tasks such as tree canopy segmentation, individual tree crown segmentation, and wetland vegetation species classification. However, they do not explicitly discuss the specific data annotation techniques used in their respective deep learning pipelines. Nevertheless, we can infer some commonly used data annotation techniques based on the nature of these studies.

In general, deep learning models require large amounts of labeled data for training purposes. For object detection and segmentation tasks, common data annotation techniques include bounding box annotation and instance segmentation. Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangular boxes around each object of interest within an image, while instance segmentation requires pixel-level labeling of each object instance.

For example, Jin et al. (2018) employed three-dimensional CNNs for individual plant segmentation in maize plots using ground-based LiDAR data. Although the paper does not specifically mention the use of bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, it is reasonable to assume that one or both of these techniques may have been utilized during the data preparation phase. Similarly, other studies focusing on object detection and segmentation tasks likely employ similar data annotation techniques, even if not explicitly stated in the papers.

Therefore, while the exact data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipelines of the referenced papers remain unspecified, it is safe to conclude that bounding box annotation and instance segmentation are popular choices for object detection and segmentation tasks in remote sensing applications.
