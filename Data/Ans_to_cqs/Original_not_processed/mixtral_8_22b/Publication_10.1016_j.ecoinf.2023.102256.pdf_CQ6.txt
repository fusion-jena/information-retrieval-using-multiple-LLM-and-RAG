3.4. Training and testing the models

embedding space between words throughout the training phase.

The baseline model comprised a simple CNN architecture that had 
two  convolutional layers (8  filters of  size 16 × 16,  with ReLU activa-
tions), followed by max pooling (4 × 4), a flattening operation, and two 
fully-connected layers (32 ReLU and 22 softmax units respectively) (see 
Fig. 2). Given only a spectrogram input, the baseline model produced a 
probability for each of the 22 species. 

3.3.2. Case II: One-hot encoding 

Different methods were explored and tested to enhance the neural 
network with contextual information. One straightforward approach to 
incorporate additional information into a deep learning classifier, while 
maintaining  model  simplicity,  is  to  utilize  a  multi-branch  CNN.  As  a 
result, we investigate this approach as the initial method to integrate

Over  the  past  few  years,  deep  learning  has  revolutionized  several 
research  fields  such  as  bioinformatics  (Li  et  al.,  2020)  and  medicine 
(Piccialli et al., 2021) by enabling automated processing of large and 
complex  datasets.  Considered  a  branch  of  machine  learning,  deep 
learning refers to algorithms, commonly called deep neural networks, 
able  to  automatically  detect  very  complex  and  highly  discriminating 
patterns  in  data  (Chollet,  2018).  The  succession  of  processing  layers 
performing  linear  and  non-linear  transformations  allows  the  neural 
networks  to  learn  representations  of  data  with  multiple  levels  of 
abstraction  (LeCun  et  al.,  2015).  This  ability  makes  deep  learning 
particularly  relevant  for  solving  complex  problems  such  as  speech 
recognition, object detection, computer vision, and many other domains 
(Taigman et al., 2014; Hinton et al., 2012). Naturally, these practices

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, there isn't explicit mention of specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred from general practice in deep learning that some common preprocessing techniques might have been applied. These could include:

1. Normalization or Scaling: This involves adjusting values measured on different scales to a common scale. In image analysis tasks like this one, pixel intensities may be scaled to lie within a small specified range, often [0, 1] or [-1, 1].

2. Cleaning: This step involves removing noise from the dataset. For instance, if the audio recordings used to generate the spectrograms contained background noises irrelevant to bird sounds, those would ideally be filtered out during preprocessing.

3. Data Augmentation: While not explicitly mentioned, data augmentation is another common technique used in deep learning to increase the amount of training data available. It involves creating new examples by applying random (but realistic) transformations to existing ones.

4. Embedding Space Between Words: Although this phrase appears in the context, it seems more related to natural language processing tasks rather than image classification tasks. Therefore, it likely doesn’t apply here.

Without further details about the exact preprocessing steps taken, these points provide a reasonable guess based on typical practices in deep learning projects.
