4.3.3. LSTM model 

The  long  short-term  memory  (LSTM)  model  is  a  common  deep 
learning model used to solve the prediction problem of time series data 
(Tang  et  al.,  2023).  Compared  with  traditional  machine  learning 
models, the LSTM model has better performance and ability to manage 
the  prediction  problem  of  time  series  data,  especially  the  long-term 
dependency  problem  and  multivariate  time  series  data,  and  has 
obvious  advantages  (Liu  et  al.,  2021;  Tang  et  al.,  2023;  Zhou  et  al., 
2023). Fig. 3 shows the prediction process of the LSTM model and the BP 
model.  This  study  compares  these  two  models  and  the  Markov  chain 
model.

Optimizing land allocation through a multiobjective programming 
(MOP) model combined with uncertainty analysis methods can provide 
a reference for decision makers.

Spatial reconstruction and scenario simulation of historical processes and future trends of land use/cover change 
(LUCC) can help to reveal the historical background of land conversion and the spatial distribution of future land. 
Moreover, there is a close relationship between the spatiotemporal dynamics of land use/cover and changes in 
different ecosystem services (ESs). Using this relationship to simulate future land use scenarios is important. In 
this study, an LUCC dynamic analysis framework (LSTM-PLUS-FMOP) was constructed based on a deep learning 
time  series  forecasting  model  (LSTM),  a  parallelized  urban  land  use  simulation  (PLUS)  model  and  a  fuzzy 
multiobjective programming (FMOP) model. The PLUS model was used to analyze the driving mechanism of land 
expansion and explore the land conversion pattern. In addition, three land conversion scenarios were established:

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. However, it mentions that the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model is used for solving the prediction problem of time series data. The LSTM model is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture commonly used for sequence prediction tasks. Typical hyperparameters for training an LSTM model include the number of layers, hidden units per layer, learning rate, batch size, epochs, optimizer, loss function, and regularization techniques like dropout or weight decay. Without further information from the authors regarding their implementation details, we cannot determine the exact values of these hyperparameters used in their study.
