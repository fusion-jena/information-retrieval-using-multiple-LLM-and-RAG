Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

During the DeepLabV3+ model training process, feeding large-size 
images directly to the network may lead to memory overflow. There-
fore, it is necessary to cut all remote sensing images and semantic labels 
of land cover classes into a series of regular image blocks for input. To 
maximize the sample size and maintain consistency with the cropping 
approach in the model prediction stage, we set the cropping size to 32 ×
32  pixels  with  a  redundancy  rate  of  0.5.  In  continuing,  70%  of  the 
dataset  was  used  for  training  and  the  remaining  for  validation.  The 
training set was enhanced by: (i) Flipping the images and labels along 
the X or Y axis; (ii) Exchanging between multiple image channels while 
the  labels remain unchanged; (iii)  Randomly rotating  the images and 
◦
labels by 90
; and (iv) randomly adding noise to the 
images  while  maintaining  the  labels  unchanged  (Ye  et  al.,  2022).

classification  results  of  the  MRS_DeepLabV3+ model  with optimal  SP 
selection  were  superior  to  the  DeepLabV3+ model  with  an  accuracy 
enhancement  of  about  3%  (Table  4).  This  approach  was  capable  of 
solving  the  problem  of  fragmented  spatial  edge  information  often 
encountered when using pixel-based CNNs to extract target categories 
(Liu et al., 2019). Compared to previous studies on the classification of 
wetlands using DeepLabV3+ (Buchsteiner et al., 2023; Gonzalez-Perez 
et al., 2022), the classification results of this study showed a significant 
lack of the salt-and-pepper phenomenon. The MRS_DeepLabV3+ model 
was  not  only  capable  of  correcting  the  misclassifications  made  by 
DeepLabV3+ but also enhancing the delineation of PlatSpe and SurfObj

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any information regarding which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, I do not have enough information to determine whether the model was deployed on platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform.
