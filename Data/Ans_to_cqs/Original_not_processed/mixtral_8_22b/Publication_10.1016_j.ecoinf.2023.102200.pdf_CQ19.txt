3.3. Effect of LiDAR point density on the CHM quality

Yin  and  Wang  (2019)  used  traditional  MCWS  and  RG  algorithms  to 
segment  individual  mangrove  trees  based  on  a  LiDAR-derived  CHM. 
When  the  traditional  algorithm  was  applied  to  relatively  dense 
mangrove  plots,  individual-tree  segmentation  results  were  relatively 
poor, with an accuracy of <35%. Deep learning (DL), an emerging data 
mining technology, is widely used in image object detection and seg-
mentation research (Hussain and Badola, 2010). Jin et al. (2018) used 
three-dimensional  (3D)  convolutional  neural  networks  (CNNs)  to 
segment  individual  plants  in  maize  plots  using  ground-based  LiDAR 
data. DL achieved good results, with R, P, and F values above 0.9 for the 
three experimental sites with different planting densities. Wang et al. 
(2019a) used the R-CNN method for individual rubber tree segmentation 
based on ground-based light detection and ranging data. Segmentation

Helpful Answer:
The papers cited do not explicitly mention which specific deep learning frameworks were used to build their models. However, they do provide some information about the types of deep learning architectures employed. For instance, Yin and Wang (2019) utilized traditional MCWS and RG algorithms for segmenting individual mangrove trees based on a LiDAR-derived CHM. On the other hand, Jin et al. (2018) used three-dimensional CNNs to segment individual plants in maize plots using ground-based LiDAR data. Lastly, Wang et al. (2019a) implemented the R-CNN method for individual rubber tree segmentation based on ground-based light detection and ranging data. These methods suggest that popular deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch could have been used, but without explicit confirmation from the authors, it remains speculative.
