distinctive  annotation  profiles  influenced  by  the  complexity  of  vocalizations  and  the  annotators’  strategies, 
ranging from conservative to permissive. To address the challenges of annotation discrepancies, Convolutional 
Neural Networks (CNNs) are trained on annotations from both novices and the expert. The results show varia-
tions in model performance. Our work highlights the importance of annotation guidelines encouraging a more 
conservative  approach  to  improve  overall  annotation  quality.  In  an  effort  to  optimize  the  potential  of  multi- 
annotation  and  mitigate  the  presence  of  noisy  labels,  two  annotation  aggregation  methods  (majority  voting 
and  soft  labeling)  are  proposed  and  tested.  The  results  demonstrate  that  both  methods,  particularly  when  a 
sufficient number of annotators are involved, significantly improve model performance and reduce variability:

During  the  campaign,  methods  are  proposed  to  assess  inter- 
annotator  variability  and  aggregate  annotation  sets.  Those  methods 
will help to define the minimal number of annotators needed [Dubus 
et al., 2023; Walter et al., 2022]. Increasing the number of annotators 
per sample could be helpful if the variability is too high. Finally, the two 
grouping  methods:  majority  voting  (Section  2.2.3)  and  soft  labeling 
(Section 2.3.2) can also be used to produce relevant annotation sets for 
deep learning. 

6. Conclusion 

In this study, new approaches were explored to improve the accuracy 
and  efficiency  of  cetacean  vocalization  detection  using  deep  learning 
models. Leveraging multi-annotation campaigns involving both expert 
and novice annotators aimed to address the challenges associated with 
the scarcity of ground truth data in underwater PAM studies.

CNN  models  were  trained  using  each  annotation  set  to  study  the 
impact  of  inter-annotator  variability  on  the  performance  of  deep 
learning models. All trained models were evaluated on different data-
sets, in different areas with different recording devices and with multiple 
expert annotations.

To  evaluate  the  performance  of  the  CNNs  trained  on  different 
annotation sets, datasets containing other SEIO PBW vocalizations and 
blue whale’s Dcall were chosen. Only a small portion of those datasets 
were used to reduce computational time, as hundreds of networks were 
trained and compared. 

For the evaluation of the SEIO PBW vocalizations, 7 h of audio sig-
nals recorded during the OHASISBIO program were used [Royer, 2009; 
Torterotot et al., 2020]. These recordings were collected at the SWAMS 
site, located in the Indian Ocean’s oceanic zone, between Kerguelen and 
Amsterdam Island. This dataset is called SWAMS in this paper. The re-
cordings were made in March 2015 using a hydrophone deployed at a 
depth of 1000 m. The sampling rate was 240 Hz. A total of 102 vocali-
zations were manually annotated by a second expert.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text mentions that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used in the pipeline. Specifically, CNN models are trained using each annotation set to study the impact of inter-annotator variability on the performance of deep learning models. Therefore, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is CNN.
