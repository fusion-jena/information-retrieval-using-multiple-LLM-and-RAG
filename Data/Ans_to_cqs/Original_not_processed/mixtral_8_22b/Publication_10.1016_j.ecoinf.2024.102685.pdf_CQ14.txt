et al., 2015; Zoffoli et al., 2020). In the second set, the response variable 
was  the  training dataset divided in  4 classes  according to  the species 
present, namely (1) Z. marina, (2) N. noltei, (3) C. nodosa, (4) absence 
(hereafter  indicated  as  species  meadows).  The  species  presence  was 
considered if its cover was >20% (Buia et al., 2004). For each dataset, 4

of a plethora of runs with different number of trees (Probst et al., 2019). 
For  the  best  split  selection  measurement,  the  Gini  Index  was  used 
(Breiman,  2001).  The  number  of  variables  used  for  each  node  (mtry) 
were  automatically  selected  by  using  repeated  cross  validations  per-
formed  with  10  folds  and  10  repetitions  for  the  seagrass  meadow 
models, while 5 folds and 5 repetitions were used for species meadow 
models. The available validation dataset was used to create a confusion 
matrix for image classifications. Based on the confusion matrix, metrics 
as  overall  (O.A.),  producer  (P.A.)  and  user  (U.A.)  accuracy  for  each 
classified class were calculated (Congalton, 1991). O.A. represents the 
proportion  of  correctly  classified  validation  samples  (found along  the 
diagonal in the error matrix) to the total number of validation samples, 
irrespective of class. P.A. quantifies the proportion of accurately clas-

Performance comparison (expressed as overall accuracy, O.A.) of the different RF models generated for the classification of presence/absence of seagrasses (seagrass 
meadows) and species classification (4 classes, species meadows) for 2010. The images date column reports the acquisition date of the image from Landsat 5TM on the 
study area. Input variables indicates the number of multispectral bands (6 each image) used by the model to generate the classification. Mtry represents the number of 
variables to randomly sample as candidates at each split.

Query: "How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The hyperparameters of the model are optimized through repeated cross validations performed with 10 folds and 10 repetitions for the seagrass meadow models, while 5 folds and 5 repetitions were used for species meadow models. The number of variables used for each node (mtry) were automatically selected during this process. Additionally, a plethora of runs with different numbers of trees were conducted to find the optimal configuration.
