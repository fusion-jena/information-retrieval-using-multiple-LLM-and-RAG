5.1.4. Total model parameters 

Total  parameters  in  a  neural  network encompass  the  aggregate of 
trainable weights and biases, serving as a direct measure of the model’s 
architectural complexity. This parameter count is pivotal in defining the 
model’s capacity for feature extraction and pattern recognition. High- 
parameter  models  are  adept  at  discerning  intricate  data  patterns  but 
are  susceptible  to  overfitting,  particularly  in  scenarios  with  limited 
training samples. Furthermore, such models escalate computational and 
memory  requirements,  potentially  impeding  deployment  in  resource- 
constrained environments.

classification tasks. The evaluation of model performance was based on 
the  accuracy  metric.  Each  model  underwent  training  for  10  epochs, 
utilizing  a  batch  size  of  32.  The  class  mode  was  set  to  ‘categorical,’ 
indicating  that  the  labels  were  encoded  using  one-hot  encoding  for 
multi-class  classification  tasks.  These  generalized  parameter  settings 
were consistently applied across all models, ensuring comparability and 
standardization throughout the study experiments.

The experiments were performed using GPU acceleration to expedite 
computations.  The  models  were  initialized  with  pre-trained  weights 
obtained from the ‘imagenet’ dataset. To tailor the models to the specific

3.2.3. EfficientNet 

EfficientNet comes under the family of pre-trained CNN that delivers 
cutting-edge performance with improved efficiency. These models use a 
compound scaling method to balance network depth, width, and reso-
lution to achieve optimal performance. EfficientNet models have been 
pre-trained  on  large-scale  datasets,  enabling  them  to  learn  highly 
discriminative  features.  Its  ability  to  efficiently  scale  up  in  capacity 
makes it a compelling choice for accurately diagnosing YVMV, ensuring 
high reliability in various diagnostic scenarios.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available in the given context to provide a detailed explanation about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, I can share some common steps involved in deploying a deep learning model which might be helpful.

Model Serialization: After training the deep learning model, the first step usually involves saving or serializing the model architecture along with its learned weights and biases into a file format like.h5,.onnx, etc. This allows us to reuse the same model later without having to train it again.

Platform Selection: Once the model has been serialized, we need to choose a platform where our model will run. Depending upon the application requirement, this could range from cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, etc., to edge devices like Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA Jetson, etc.

Deployment: Based on the chosen platform, different methods may apply for deploying the model. For instance, if we chose a cloud platform, we would typically create an API endpoint using services like Flask, FastAPI, Django, etc., and then integrate our saved model within these APIs. On the other hand, if we selected an edge device, we would directly load the saved model onto the device and perform real-time predictions.

Monitoring & Maintenance: Post-deployment, it's crucial to monitor the model's performance regularly and maintain it by retraining with new data when necessary. Tools like TensorFlow Serving, Kubernetes, etc., help manage and update deployed models effectively.
