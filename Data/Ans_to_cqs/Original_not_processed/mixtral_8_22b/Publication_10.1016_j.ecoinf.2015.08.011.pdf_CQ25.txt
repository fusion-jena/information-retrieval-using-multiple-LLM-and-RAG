Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

To develop a robust ANN, we have to consider the selection of the
number of layers, the number of neurons in the hidden layer, the learn-
ing rates, and the number of epochs for model training carefully. For ex-
ample, if we consider an insufﬁcient number of neurons in the hidden
layer, then the ANN cannot reﬂect nonlinearity within the training
data. Conversely, if we consider too many neurons, then the ANN has
an overﬁtting problem, and hence, this leads a lack of generalizability.
In this study, we applied a trial-and-error method, which is known to
be the best method to determine the appropriate number of neurons
and learning rate (Shamseldin, 1997; Hill and Minsker, 2010), and an
early stopping technique to hinder overﬁtting.

The ANN requires that the learning rate, number of nodes in a single
hidden layer, and maximum number of training epochs are speciﬁed
(Hill and Minsker, 2010). In this study, we used the optimal number
error approach. The number of nodes in the hidden layer was varied be-
tween 5 and 23, and the learning rate was varied from 0.01 to 1.0 in in-
crements of 0.05. For each conﬁguration, the mean square error (MSE)
between the model output and the measured data was calculated.
Fig 2 illustrates the optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer

and the optimal learning rate having the maximum model performance
as indicated by MSE. The number of neurons in the hidden layer and the
optimal learning rate were selected using a trial-and-error method.
The ﬁnal ANN structure had ﬁve input variables with one node
accounting for bias, 19 hidden neurons with one node accounting for
bias, a 0.7 learning rate, and one output variable of the output layer
(Figs. 2 and 3).

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the purpose of the deep learning model, specifically an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), is not explicitly stated for classification, segmentation, or detection tasks. However, the context does provide information about the application of the ANN in determining the optimal number of neurons and learning rate, which suggests that the model might be used for prediction or forecasting purposes.

The study applies a trial-and-error method to find the optimal number of neurons and learning rate, aiming to achieve the highest model performance as indicated by Mean Square Error (MSE). This implies that the goal of the ANN is to minimize the difference between predicted values and actual measurements, suggesting its use in predictive modeling.

Furthermore, the context mentions that the final ANN structure includes five input variables, nineteen hidden neurons, a learning rate of 0.7, and one output variable. This configuration indicates that the ANN could be employed for mapping complex relationships between multiple inputs and outputs, potentially for making predictions based on those relationships.

However, without explicit mention of the specific task or objective of the ANN, such as classifying images, detecting objects, or segmenting regions, it is difficult to definitively state the exact purpose of the deep learning model beyond its apparent role in optimizing parameters for predictive modeling.
