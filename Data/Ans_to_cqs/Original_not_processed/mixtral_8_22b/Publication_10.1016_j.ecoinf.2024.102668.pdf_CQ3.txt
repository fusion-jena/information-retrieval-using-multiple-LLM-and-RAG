%Query
Query: "What are the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., bounding box annotation, instance segmentation)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not directly discuss specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it mentions the importance of reducing device bias when using different recording devices for collecting acoustic data. This is relevant because consistent feature spaces are required for applying machine learning and deep learning methods. In this case, the focus seems to be on analyzing and comparing acoustic signals rather than visual data annotations. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot provide details about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
