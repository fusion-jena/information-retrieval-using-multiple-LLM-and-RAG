In order to solve this problem, we used a DL approach. DL networks 
can be seen as non-linear functions with a large number of parameters. 
The parameters of each DL are adjusted using annotated data (usually 
referred  to  as  a  “supervised  approach”).  Once  this  process  (called 
training the network) is finished, the evaluation of the network on the real 
problem  is  performed  by  feeding  it  an  independent  data  set  not  seen 
during training (the testing data set). DL techniques are currently a hot 
topic in machine learning with applications in a variety of fields, and are 
considered the current state of the art for CV applications. In fact, in 
some disciplines, this technology is considered to have exceeded human 
capabilities (Buetti-Dinh et al., 2019; He et al., 2015).

the  experts.  Then  the  network  is  fed  this  annotated  data  and  the  pa-
rameters of the model are adjusted following an optimization process. 
Once this training process is finished, the model is ready to process new 
unseen  data.  DL  networks  are,  thus,  able  to  capture  statistics  and  re-
lationships directly from the data following human expertise. If the data 
used  for  training  the  model  is  representative  of  the  problem  and  the 
annotations are carefully generated, the resulting network can perform 
at a similar level with any input data set. This capacity to translate the 
training to other independent datasets is called the generalization power 
of the network. In practice, differences in performance between the re-
sults with the training data (or data that is similar to it, i.e., from the 
same  site  and  acquired  at  the  same  time)  and  those  of  independent 
datasets (often in research papers referred to as the testing data set) can

conditions or with trees from a different site). Consequently, when there 
is  data  leakage,  properties  of  the  testing  data  leak  into  the  training 
process,  the  estimation  of  the  generalization  power of  the  network is 
compromised. See (Diez et al., 2021), section 3.1 for more details.

(both June and October orthomosaics were combined for both sets). This 
process was repeated four times to ensure that all subsites where used 
once as the testing set.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide specific information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, it mentions that the parameters of the deep learning network are adjusted using annotated data through an optimization process. This suggests that some form of optimization technique was employed to adjust the parameters of the model. Common methods for optimizing hyperparameters include grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and gradient-based optimization. Without further context, it cannot be determined which method was specifically used in this case.
