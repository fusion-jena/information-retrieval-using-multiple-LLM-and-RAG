Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific details about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, some commonly used data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, and shifting. These techniques help improve the performance and generalization ability of deep learning models by increasing the amount of training data available and introducing variations into the dataset. It should be noted that the choice of data augmentation technique depends on the nature of the problem and the characteristics of the input data. For instance, flipping may not be suitable for datasets containing text or images with directionality, while rotation might not work well for certain types of medical imagery where orientation matters. Therefore, it is essential to carefully select appropriate data augmentation techniques based on the requirements and constraints of each specific use case.
