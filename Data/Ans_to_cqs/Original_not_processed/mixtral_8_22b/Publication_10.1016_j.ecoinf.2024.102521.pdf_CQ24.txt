caught  individuals.  Several  simple  and  effective  traps  exist,  such  as 
malaise traps, sticky traps, and pitfall traps. However, identifying and 
counting  the  trapped  specimens  is  labor-intensive  and  requires  taxo-
nomic expertise,  thus  limiting the  scale  of monitoring. Several  recent 
stud/ ies harnessed the power of deep-learning (DL) based image pro-
cessing  to  alleviate  the  burden  on  app/  b/lied  entomologists  who 
monitor  specific  forestry,  agricultural  and  medical  pests  (For  recent 
reviews, see Schneider et al., 2023, Teixeira et al., 2023). Such efforts 
comprise four steps: (a) collection of insect images; (b) labeling of in-
dividual insects by experts, to generate two or more classes (e.g., ‘pest’, 
‘natural  enemy’,  and  ‘other’);  (c)  building  a  statistical  model  of  the 
classes (training in the machine learning jargon); and (d) applying the 
model to new instances, such as field caught insects (inference). These

Helpful Answer:
The provided sources do not directly address the issue of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, particularly regarding random seed values. However, some general strategies can be applied to manage this aspect.

Random seeds are often used in various stages of deep learning pipelines, including weight initialization, shuffling training examples, and dropout regularization. The use of random seeds ensures reproducibility and consistency across different runs of the same experiment. To handle randomness related to random seed values, one common strategy is to fix the seed value before running any code involving random processes. This way, each time the code is executed, it will produce the same results, ensuring reproducibility.

Additionally, when working with multiple models or experiments, maintaining separate random seeds for each instance can help avoid interference between them. This approach allows for better control over the randomness introduced into each model or experiment, making it easier to compare their performance and draw meaningful conclusions.

In summary, while the provided sources do not explicitly discuss strategies for managing randomness due to random seed values, fixing the seed value and maintaining separate seeds for individual models or experiments are commonly employed practices to ensure reproducibility and minimize interference between different components of the deep learning pipeline.
