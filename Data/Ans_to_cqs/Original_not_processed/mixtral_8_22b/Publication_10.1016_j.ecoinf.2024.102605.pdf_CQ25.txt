2.3.3. Pest damage identification model 

In the current study, a machine learning algorithm, a CNN, was used 
to construct a pest hazard class classification model. The specific results 
are shown in Fig. 4. The above results are the experimental results of the 
author's  team,  specifically  referring  to  the  study  of  Ma,  L.  (Lei  et  al., 
2022). These sensitive spectral vegetation indices perform well in the 
1D-CNN model, with an overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient of 
89.50% and 0.8666, respectively. Figs. 4-a, 4-b, and 4-c show the results 
of  identifying  the  degree  of  damage  to  forest  trees  by  EJD  in  June, 
August, and September in the study area obtained based on the 1D-CNN 
algorithm, and its distribution was basically consistent with the distri-
bution of the actual affected forest trees.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the given context is to identify the degree of damage caused by Emerald Ash Borer (EAB) to forest trees in different months (June, August, and September) within the study area. This model uses a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) algorithm to achieve this objective. The performance of the model is evaluated through metrics such as overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient, which indicate how accurately the model can distinguish between damaged and undamaged forest areas. In summary, the primary goal of this deep learning model is to provide accurate information about the extent of EAB infestations in forests, enabling better management strategies and conservation efforts.
