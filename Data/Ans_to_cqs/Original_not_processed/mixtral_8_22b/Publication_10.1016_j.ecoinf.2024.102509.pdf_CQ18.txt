predicted variables, as well as assist in combining multiple data sources 
to improve overall prediction accuracy (Deb et al., 2017). In practice, 
ANN models have often outperformed other conventional methods with 
respect  to  prediction  accuracy,  processing  rapidity,  and  nonlinear 
problem-solving capacity (Tiryaki and Aydın, 2014; Yang et al., 2018). 
Conversely, the accuracy of ANN’s training process relies on the quality 
and quantity of the sample dataset (Yang et al., 2018). Moreover, the 
optimal  numbers  of  hidden  layers  of  an  ANN  model  depend  on  the 
problem itself and the over-fitting problem can occur at any instance 
(Tiryaki and Aydın, 2014). Therefore, repeated training and testing are 
necessary  to  develop  an  optimal  neural  network  and  attain  highly

the  loss  function.  Moreover,  as  a  supervised  model,  it  operates  by 
modifying the weights and biases of the network’s neurons in order to 
minimize the gap between the anticipated output and the actual target 
values (Tiryaki and Aydın, 2014). The BP-ANN used here entailed an 
input layer with n co-variates, two hidden layers consisting of p hidden 
neurons, and one output layer having one output neuron. The selection 
of hidden layers and neurons was determined through a process of trial 
and error, aiming to optimize the network’s structure (Supplementary 
material 1). The ‘neuralnet’ package of R 4.1.2 software, mostly applied 
for training multi-layer perceptrons in regression analyses, was consid-
ered here for developing a BP-ANN model (Yang et al., 2018).

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions that the 'neuralnet' package of R 4.1.2 software was considered for developing a Backpropagation Artificial Neural Network (BP-ANN) model. This package might include built-in functions or procedures to evaluate the model's performance during training. Additionally, the text suggests that the selection of hidden layers and neurons was determined through a process of trial and error, aiming to optimize the network’s structure. This implies that some form of monitoring and adjustment took place during the development of the BP-ANN model. Furthermore, the table presented shows various performance metrics such as Adjusted R^2, Mean Squared Error (MSE), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) for different regression methods including ANN. These metrics could be used to assess the model's performance during training. However, without more specific details, it cannot be definitively stated what exact strategy was employed to monitor the model performance during training.
