2021), have proven their potential in predicting distributions of various 
species. However, these models require large amounts of observational 
data for the target species to learn appropriate environmental charac-
teristics. When such data are not sufficient, ML-based SDMs suffer from 
poor prediction performance due to overfitting or generalization failure 
(Gaul  et  al.,  2020;  Wisz  et  al.,  2008).  This  data  shortage  problem  is 
especially  common  for  rare  or  endangered  species,  and  for  invasive 
species in their early stages of introduction (Lomba et al., 2010; Zhang 
et al., 2020). Several strategies have been suggested to solve this prob-
lem.  Typical  examples  include  spatial  extrapolation  using  models 
trained  with  sufficient  observational  data  for  external  areas  (Farashi 
et al., 2013) and the integration of multiple observational datasets (e.g., 
citizen science dataset) collected by different sampling designs (Tehrani

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, it mentions some challenges related to poor prediction performance due to overfitting or generalization failure when there is insufficient observational data for the target species. To address this issue, several strategies have been suggested, including spatial extrapolation using models trained with sufficient observational data for external areas and integrating multiple observational datasets collected by different sampling designs. These approaches could potentially improve the generalizability of machine learning-based Species Distribution Models (SDMs). Additionally, the use of diverse datasets, cross-validation, and stratified splitting can help prevent overfitting and enhance the model's ability to generalize well to unseen data.
