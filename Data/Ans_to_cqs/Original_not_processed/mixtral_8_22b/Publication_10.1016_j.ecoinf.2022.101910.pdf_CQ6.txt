et al., 2021; Stowell et al., 2019). Some of the state-of-the-art techniques 
for  handling  big  datasets,  such  as  deep  learning  and  convolutional 
neural networks (Stowell, 2022; Stowell et al., 2019), can be difficult to 
run for ornithologists, managers, and researchers without bioacoustics 
or  engineering  backgrounds.  However,  user-friendly  and  ready-to-use 
machine  learning  approaches  have  recently  been  developed  and  are 
increasingly accessible to respond to real-life monitoring challenges and 
the general public (Cole et al., 2022). Among these approaches is Bird-
NET, a research project between The Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the 
Chemnitz University of Technology. BirdNET facilitates the automated 
detection and classification of bird vocalizations, through a developed 
deep neural network, from sound recordings (Kahl et al., 2021). Bird-
NET is able to identify over 3000 bird species (Wood et al., 2021) and is

identify which of the candidate sounds are vocalizations of the desired 
species (e.g. Rycyk et al., 2022).

Passive acoustic monitoring is a powerful tool for monitoring vocally active taxa. Automated signal recognition 
software reduces the expert time needed for recording analyses and allows researchers and managers to manage 
large  acoustic  datasets.  The  application  of  state-of-the-art  techniques  for  automated  identification,  such  as 
Convolutional Neural Networks, may be challenging for ecologists and managers without informatics or engi-
neering expertise. Here, we evaluated the use of AudioMoth — a low-cost and open-source sound recorder — to 
monitor a threatened and patchily distributed species, the Eurasian bittern (Botaurus stellaris). Passive acoustic 
monitoring was carried out across 17 potential wetlands in north Spain. We also assessed the performance of 
BirdNET —  an automated and freely available classifier able to identify over 3000 bird species —  and Kalei-

mainly three settings can be adjusted in BirdNET: the detection sensi-
tivity,  overlap  of  prediction  segments,  and  the  minimum  confidence 
threshold (Kahl et al., 2021). We set these values to 1.5 (highest allowed 
value),  1.5  s  of  overlap,  and  0.4,  respectively.  The  low  confidence 
threshold may result in increased recall and false positive rates, but the 
value employed was similar to the one used by Kahl et al. when evalu-
ating BirdNET accuracy on 984 bird species (value of 0.5, Kahl et al., 
2021).

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does discuss some aspects related to deep learning models, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and their application in identifying bird species using audio data.

In general, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization involves adjusting the range of pixel intensity values so they fall within a certain range, often between 0 and 1. Scaling refers to resizing images to fit the input size required by the model. Cleaning involves removing noise or irrelevant information from the dataset.

While the context does not provide explicit details about preprocessing steps, it mentions that BirdNET uses a deep neural network to detect and classify bird vocalizations from sound recordings. This implies that some form of preprocessing might have taken place to convert raw audio data into a format suitable for analysis by the deep learning model. Additionally, the context mentions that BirdNET has a configurable parameter called 'detection sensitivity,' suggesting that there could be some level of thresholding or filtering applied during preprocessing.

However, without more specific information regarding the exact preprocessing steps used in this particular case, it is impossible to definitively answer the query based solely on the provided context.
