Each optimization run consisted of 3000 train iterations with a batch 
size of 25 individuals to pick a pair of similar and a pair of dissimilar 
photos (i.e., a batch size of 100 images), and validating each 300 iter-
ations. TensorBoard —a set of visualization tools included in the open- 
source  library  for  machine  learning  TensorFlow—  was  used  to  study 
the performance of the runs. The selected parameters correspond to the 
run shown in Supplementary Fig. S3.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention the specific optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does provide some information about the parameters that were optimized during model training. These include the learning rate, momentum, SD threshold, and input size. The learning rate and momentum are common hyperparameters found in many optimization algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). Therefore, while it cannot be definitively stated which optimization algorithm was used, it can be inferred that one of these methods may have been employed due to the presence of these parameters.
