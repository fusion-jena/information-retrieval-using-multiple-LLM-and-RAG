The  successful  prediction  is  also  attributed  to  the  robust  deep 
learning models. Lamichhane et al. (2019) reviewed soil carbon map-
ping methods and reported that deep learning is a promising technique 
for improving SOC prediction. The emphasis on deep learning has also 
been noted by Wadoux et al. (2019), who used this technique to predict 
soil  C.  They  found  that  the  deep  learning  technique  significantly 
increased  prediction  accuracy.  In  addition  to  SOC  prediction,  some 
recent studies have used deep learning in the field of ecological infor-
matics and  demonstrated the  ability of this technique  to improve the 
prediction  of  ecological  components  such  as  forest  vegetation  cover 
(Kalinaki  et  al.,  2023)  and  agriculture-related  elements  (Attri  et  al., 
2023).  According  to  them,  deep  learning  has  the  potential  to  be  a 
valuable technique for ecological analysis.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
In the process of creating a deep learning model for soil organic carbon (SOC) prediction, several methods can be employed for gathering raw data. These include surveys, sensors, and utilizing publicly available datasets. Surveys involve direct measurements of SOC content through sampling and laboratory analyses. Sensors, like remote sensing devices or proximal soil sensors, can provide real-time data on soil properties related to SOC. Publicly accessible databases, such as the one mentioned in the context, offer extensive collections of SOC data across different locations and timeframes. This particular study extracted a set of 2207 SOCS data points from a depth of 0 to 20 cm between 2010 and 2014 from a public database. Additionally, multi-source data integration can further enhance the quality and diversity of input data for deep learning models, as shown by Wadoux et al. (2019).
