whole image. Thus, it may minimize the dilution effect and reduce the 
required amount of training data.

The  standardized  recordings  are  then  segmented  into  clips  with  a 
fixed duration. There has to be a trade-off between a short clip which 
may include only part of a sound of some species and a long clip which 
increases  the  requirement  of  computing  time  in  model  training.  We 
segment recordings into 3-s clips because the duration of most sound 
classes in our database is less than 3 s. Kahl et al. (2021) used the same 
clip length in their model for identifying the sounds of 984 bird species 
in North America and Europe.

3.4. Model training and evaluation 

3.4.1. Model training 

We  used  YOLOv5s,  the  smallest  weight  of  YOLOv5,  to  build  the 
sound identification model. The model was trained for 100 epochs with 
32 batch size and the input image dimension 640 × 640. We used default 
data  augmentation  including  scaling,  color  space  adjustments,  and 
Mosaic  augmentation  during  the  training  process.  Under  this  setting, 
four  original  spectrograms  were  randomly  selected,  resized,  cropped, 
color jittered (i.e., changes in hue, saturation and exposure) and then 
merged into one big input image for model training. The model training 
was performed using a workstation equipped with the following speci-
fications: Intel Xeon E5–2660 V4 CPU * 2, DDR4 2400 ECC 16GB RAM * 
8, NVIDIA Titan RTX GPU * 2, and WD black AN1500 4 TB NVMePCIe 
SSD * 2.

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, based on the information available, we can infer that the model is likely being used for sound identification or classification. This is suggested by several factors:

1. The mention of "YOLOv5s" - YOLO stands for You Only Look Once, a real-time object detection system. In this context, it seems to be used for detecting specific sounds within audio recordings.

2. The reference to "spectrograms" - these are visual representations of the spectrum of frequencies of a signal as it varies with time. They are often used in sound analysis, suggesting that the model is dealing with audio data.

3. The mention of "bird sound classification" in one of the cited papers - this further supports the idea that the model is being used for sound classification, specifically for bird sounds.

Therefore, while it cannot be definitively confirmed without more explicit information, it appears that the deep learning model is being used for sound classification, possibly for bird sounds.
