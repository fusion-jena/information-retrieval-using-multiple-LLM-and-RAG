MTMI-SMF is formulated to work with imperfect data, which can be 
due to training locations having locational errors or not ideally matching 
with  image  pixels.  MTMI-SMF  groups  pixels  surrounding  a  training 
location  that  could  have  invader.  Most  other  machine  learning  algo-
rithms require a single pixel to represent a training location, which often 
leaves the user making an educated guess on which pixel best represents 
that training location. Here, we compare MTMI-SMF classification (i.e., 
confidence values with a threshold applied) to a commonly used ma-
chine learning classification approach, random forest.

torelli et al., 2014). Most machine learning approaches are not designed 
to handle training data that is not ‘pure’ or 100% representative of the 
target invader (Roberts et al., 1998).

Often,  the  challenge  with  using  machine  learning  algorithms  for 
ecology  and  conservation  applications  is  matching  training  data 
collected in the field or high spatial resolution imagery to pixels in the 
target  imagery.  The  imperfect  nature  of  training  data  can  arise  from 
several common issues. Frequently, an invader does not form dense or 
large stands on the landscape, or the phenology of the invader results in 
cover  changes  (Nagendra  et  al.,  2013;  Pettorelli  et  al.,  2014).  These 
situations typically result in a mixed pixel, which is comprised of mul-
tiple  species  or  surfaces.  To  compound  this  effect,  training  data  is 
commonly  developed  on  higher  spatial  resolution  imagery  (e.g.,  un-
manned aerial vehicles or aircraft) where the invader might be present 
in  100%  cover  but  is  often  scaled  to  the  coarser  spatial  resolution  of 
target  imagery  resulting  in  mixed  pixels  (Nagendra  et  al.,  2013;  Pet-

Invasive species remain a challenging and costly problem (Crystal- 
Ornelas  et al., 2021; Hiatt et al., 2019), and  long-term monitoring  of 
invasions  can  provide  valuable  ecological  information  to  guide  man-
agement decisions (Blossey, 1999). Remote sensing may be the ideal tool 
to  fill  this  need  by  providing  accurate  and  affordable  repeat  imagery 
(Bradley, 2014). However, training datasets can be riddled with vari-
ability  or  errors  that  complicate  training  of  machine-learning  ap-
proaches. Here, we showed that a multiple-instance learning algorithm, 
which allows for variability or imprecision in the training dataset, can 
detect a highly problematic invasive plant species using multispectral 
airborne and satellite imagery. Using Brazilian peppertree in the Ever-
glades  National  Park,  we  showcased  that  an  invader  can  be  detected 
with >70% accuracy using NAIP, RapidEye, and Landsat 8 imagery. This

The query asks about regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. Regularization methods are techniques used to reduce the complexity of models and prevent them from memorizing the training data instead of generalizing patterns. Two popular regularization methods mentioned in the query are dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a technique introduced by Srivastava et al. (2014) to improve neural network performance and prevent overfitting. During training, dropout randomly sets a fraction of input units to zero, effectively removing those neurons from the network for that iteration. This helps prevent complex co-adaptations between neurons and encourages each neuron to learn useful features independently. Dropout has been shown to significantly improve model performance across various tasks and architectures.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the weights. By penalizing large weights, L2 regularization discourages the model from relying too heavily on any one feature and promotes more even distribution of importance among inputs. This leads to smoother decision boundaries and better generalization to new data. L2 regularization is widely used in many deep learning applications due to its simplicity and effectiveness.

Other regularization methods include L1 regularization, early stopping, and batch normalization. L1 regularization adds a penalty term based on the absolute value of the weights, encouraging sparse solutions with fewer nonzero parameters. Early stopping monitors validation error during training and halts optimization when it starts increasing, preventing further fitting to noise in the training set. Batch normalization standardizes layer activations within mini-batches, reducing internal covariate shift and improving convergence speed and stability.

These regularization methods help combat overfitting by constraining model capacity, promoting simpler representations, and encouraging robustness against noisy or irrelevant features. They play a crucial role in building effective deep learning pipelines capable of handling diverse real-world problems.
