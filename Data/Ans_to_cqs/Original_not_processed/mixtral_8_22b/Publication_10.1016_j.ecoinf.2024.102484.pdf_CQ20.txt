In tropical regions, grasslands are mostly concentrated at the edges 
of forests and cultivated land (Li et al., 2022). Soil resource degradation 
in  grasslands  must  be  considered  within 
forest-
–grassland–cultivated  land  ecosystem;  (Salazar  et  al.,  2015).  In  com-
parison to forest and cultivated land, grassland is a more fragile natural 
ecosystem due to the lack of energy inflow; therefore, it is at greater risk 
of  ecological  degradation  (Chang  et  al.,  2022).  In  this  study,  when 
combined with the findings of Wu et al. (2022), DEM was identified as 
the  most  important  influence  on  vegetation  degradation  and  soil 
degradation in grasslands. The DEM, especially when paired with LDR 
and VPOP, was associated with increased degradation of vegetation and 
soil in grasslands (Wu et al., 2022). The construction of roads and res-
idential areas will significantly increase anthropogenic interference with

Query: "Which hardware resources are used for training the deep learning model (e.g., GPUs, TPUs)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model mentioned in Huang et al.'s paper. Therefore, I cannot determine whether they used GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware resources for their research.
