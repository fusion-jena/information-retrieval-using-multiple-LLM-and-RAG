The features used as input vectors of the learning significantly impact 
the performance of machine learning-based systems. The limited set of 
patterns used as features in the paper is what the HMM requires, not 
specific characteristics, as needed for LSTM. Using a finite number of 
patterns  has  the  advantage  of  facilitating  the  analysis  of  C.  elegans 
response behavior using statistical analysis or metrics like Levenshtein 
distance  (Kang  et  al.,  2012).  However,  this  clustering  step  inevitably 
leads to information loss, which may result in performance degradation 
of water quality assessment methods. Conversely, the proposed LSTM- 
based method can directly use the BLS profile without clustering, and 
it can be expected to achieve relatively higher accuracy because it uses a 
larger  feature  domain.  Additionally,  computational  measures  such  as 
BLS entropy have limitations in capturing important information found

2.4.4. System structure 

We endeavored to design the model structure as simple as possible to 
ensure its usability on devices with limited computing power and enable 
real-time predictions, as long as the performance was not significantly 
reduced. Our aim was to create a model that balances performance and 
efficiency.  The  selected  system's  structure  consists  of  an  input  layer, 
three LSTM hidden layers, one dropout layer, and one dense layer. In the 
case of binary classification, a dense layer with a single output is used, 
and σ is employed as the activation function. For tasks involving more 
than two classes, the dense layer has multiple outputs and the softmax 
function is used as the activation function. The overall structure of the 
model is depicted in Fig. 5.

challenging.  This  difficulty  may  be  attributed  to  the  fact  that  bio-
monitoring systems, unlike water quality analysis studies, require sig-
nificant  time  and  effort  to  collect  data  for  training.  As  a  result,  the 
integration  of  deep  learning  into  biomonitoring  for  water  quality 
pollution detection is an area that has yet to see widespread exploration. 
Nevertheless, despite these challenges, recent developments in various 
fields  of  ecology  have  demonstrated  high  performance  in  time-series 
data  analysis  using  the  LSTM  model,  a  type  of  DRNN  model  (Con-
cepcion et al., 2023; Dehghani et al., 2023; Guo et al., 2023; O'Donncha 
et  al.,  2022;  Zhang  et  al.,  2023).  In  this  study,  we  showed  that  the 
performance of a biomonitoring system using time-series data, such as 
the swimming behavior of C. elegans, can be significantly improved by 
introducing  the  LSTM  model.  It  showed  a  high  detection  accuracy  of

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, the text does indicate that a dropout layer is included in the designed model structure. Dropout is a commonly used regularization technique in deep learning to prevent overfitting. During training, dropout randomly sets a fraction rate of input units to 0 at each update, which helps to avoid complex co-adaptations on training data. By doing so, dropout improves the generalization ability of the model and reduces overfitting. Other common regularization methods include L1 and L2 regularization, early stopping, and data augmentation. These methods were not explicitly mentioned in the provided context but could also potentially be applied to improve the model's performance and reduce overfitting.
