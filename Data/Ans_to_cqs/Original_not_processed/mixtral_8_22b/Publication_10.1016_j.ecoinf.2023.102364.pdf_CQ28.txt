information system (GIS) platform and then added 68 open-access predictor layers, including socio-economic U. 
S. Census data. We trained, tested, and evaluated the performance of an ensemble of machine learning models, 
resulting in predictions of gull-abundance hotspots and coldspots, at 100-m resolution for inference. We find that 
Short-billed Gulls prefer the synergy of industrial areas near man-made water bodies, impervious surfaces, gravel 
pits, strip malls, transfer sites (garbage dumps) and some young forest vegetation. This study is a first-known 
attempt  to  utilize  a  blended  ‘Big  Data’  approach,  in  combination  with  traditional  multi-year  field-based data 
collection and alternative model assessments, in order to characterize an urban seabird niche. Our findings, and 
the digital infrastructure herein, provide an interdisciplinary baseline for potential applications in urban plan-
ning and monitoring the spread of disease reservoirs.

Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The article does not mention which specific platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. It only mentions that the authors utilized a geographic information system (GIS) platform and added open-access predictor layers, including socio-economic US Census data. They also mentioned training, testing, and evaluating the performance of an ensemble of machine learning models but did not specify the deployment platform. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
