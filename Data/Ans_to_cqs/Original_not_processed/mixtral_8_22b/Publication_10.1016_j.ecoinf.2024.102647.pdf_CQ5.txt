Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not explicitly mention any specific dataset used in the deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it can be inferred that the study uses various types of environmental data related to soil salinity, water resources, land use, climate type, topography, etc. These data might include remote sensing data, geospatial data, hydrological data, meteorological data, and other relevant datasets. Specifically, the study mentions the use of satellite imagery, well data, and possibly other sources of data. Unfortunately, without more detailed information about the exact nature of these datasets, it is impossible to provide a more precise answer.
