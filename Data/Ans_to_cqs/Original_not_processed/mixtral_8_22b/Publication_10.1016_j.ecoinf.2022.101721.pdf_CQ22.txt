include all observations in statistical modeling, rather than excluding observations, an approach which can affect 
the reliability of studies. This study also, to a great extent, explains the poor performance of software attempting 
automated bat ID. Implementing Bayesian algorithms, and thereby allowing users to interact with the software, 
should significantly improve their performance.

developers could expand on the code in supplement S1 to implement 
more  predictor  variables  and  write  a  custom  algorithm.  Finally,  the 
classification accuracy of software incorporating an informative prior in 
their algorithm should not be determined through training and testing 
data sets alone. The performance must also be evaluated through the 
number  of  correct  classifications  using  real  world  examples.  Current 
software attempting to ID bats are locked in a vacuum. Bats in the real 
world are not!

in  predicting  means,  SDs  and  finally  population  sizes  based  on  the 
observed data (e.g. Bhattacharya, 1967), thus reducing manual labour to 
a minimum.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it mentions classification accuracy as one metric for evaluating the performance of software incorporating an informative prior in their algorithm. Additionally, it suggests that the number of correct classifications using real-world examples is another important factor in determining the performance of such models. While these are not explicitly stated as evaluation metrics for deep learning models, they do suggest that accuracy and real-world applicability are important considerations when assessing the performance of such models. Other common metrics used to evaluate deep learning models include precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC). These metrics help quantify different aspects of a model's performance, such as its ability to correctly identify positive instances (precision), its sensitivity or true positive rate (recall), and its overall effectiveness (F1 score and AUC). Without more specific information from the given context, however, we cannot definitively state which metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this case.
