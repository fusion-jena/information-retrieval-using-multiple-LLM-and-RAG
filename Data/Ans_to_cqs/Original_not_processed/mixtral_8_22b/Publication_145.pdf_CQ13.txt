Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

as a sum of two terms: binary cross-entropy and Dice coefﬁcient-related loss of the three predicted
masks [50–52]. We used the optimizer RMSprop (unpublished, adaptive learning rate method proposed
by Geoff Hinton here http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~tijmen/csc321/slides/lecture_slides_lec6.pdf)
with an initial learning rate of 0.0001. We trained our network for 300 epochs with 24 images per batch.
