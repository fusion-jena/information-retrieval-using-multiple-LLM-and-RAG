In the supervised fine-tuning phase, the labelled dataset is used in 
training the model to predict particular words or phonemes. Fig. 3 de-
picts the process and components in the fine-tuning phase of wav2vec. 
Phonemes are the smallest unit of sound, usually one or two letters, in 
the language. During fine-tuning, the quantization module is removed. 
Instead, a linear projection layer is added to the context network. Then 
the model is fine-tuned on connectionist temporal classification (CTC) 
loss for the Automatic Speech Recognition task. So, the wav2vec model 
has a general understanding of phonemes present in human speech.

Wav2vec is one of the latest state-of-art models for Automatic Speech 
Recognition  and  other  audio-related  problems  (Boigne  et  al.,  2020) 
(Shibano et al., 2021). The architecture of the Wav2vec is based on the 
transformer's  encoder,  with  a  training  objective  like  BERT's  masked 
language modelling objective but adapted for speech instead of text. The 
self-supervised  way  of  training  allows  Wav2vec  to  pre-train  on  unla-
belled data, which is more accessible (Hendrycks et al., 2019). Later, the 
model can be fine-tuned on a particular dataset for a specific purpose. 
This  approach  shows  remarkable  improvement  in  the  model's  perfor-
mance, especially if the dataset size is very small with label.

3.1. Feature encoder 

The feature encoder of the pre-trained Wav2vec model reduces the 
dimensionality of the audio data, converting the raw waveform into a 
sequence of feature vectors Z every 20 milliseconds. The main compo-
nent of the feature encoder's architecture is seven layers of a 1D con-
volutional neural network with 512 channels at each layer. The size of 
the kernel and strides decreases as the layer progresses in the network. 
The waveform is normalized before passing through the convolutional 
layer, followed  by  layer  normalization and  GELU  activation function. 
Finally,  latent  feature  vectors  represent  the  latent  feature  of  bird 
vocalization.  Thus,  it  helps  the  model  to  identify  and  understand  the 
sequential information in the vocalization audio of multi-bird species. 

3.2. Context network

Attention-based  hybrid  CNN-LSTM  is  a  deep  learning-based  archi-
tecture that hybridizes CNN and LSTM with an attention mechanism for 
the classification of audio recordings (Hamdi et al., 2022) (Zhang et al., 
2021).  The  main  advantage  of  an  Attention-based  CNN-LSTM  over  a 
simple CNN-LSTM is that it can focus on the most important parts of the 
input  data  when  making  predictions.  An  Attention-based  model  can 
learn to assign higher weights to the most important parts of the input 
data and lower weights to the less important parts. It can lead to better 
performance, as the model can focus on the most relevant parts of the 
data  instead  of  being  distracted  by  irrelevant  parts.  Furthermore, 
attention-based models can lead to higher interpretability because the 
model  is  more  explicit  about  which  input  data  elements  has  to  pay 
attention.

Helpful Answer:

Regarding the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, the given context mentions diversity loss as a method used in the pre-training phase of the Wav2Vec model. Diversity loss is not a standard regularization technique such as dropout or L2 regularization, but rather a custom loss term introduced specifically for this model. This loss term encourages the model to produce diverse representations for different inputs, thus preventing overfitting and improving its ability to generalize to new data. However, the context does not provide details on how exactly this diversity loss is calculated or applied within the model.

As for standard regularization techniques, while the context does not explicitly mention them, they could still be employed in various stages of the deep learning pipeline. For instance, dropout could be used during both pre-training and fine-tuning phases to randomly ignore some neurons during training, effectively creating an ensemble of simpler networks and reducing overfitting. Similarly, L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, could be applied to penalize large weights and encourage smaller, more generalizable ones. These techniques would help improve the model's performance and robustness, even though they are not mentioned in the provided context.
