2.3. Data analysis 

In  recent  times,  the  use  of  powerful  analytical  tools  have  proven 
beneficial  in  modelling  and  predicting  the  drivers  of  invasive  species 
diversity, with immense implications in guiding invasion management 
and mitigation measures (Lenzner et al., 2019). To examine the relative 
importance of the selected environmental and anthropogenic variables 
on  the  invasive  plant  species  richness  and  abundance  separately,  we 
employed  the  random  forest  (RF)  model  using  the  spatialRF  package 
(Benito,  2021)  in  R  4.2.2  software  (R  Core  Team,  2021).  The  RF 
modelling  approach,  a  particular  kind  of  bagging,  has  an  enhanced

impacts.

2) What are the relative roles of these drivers in determining the rich-

ness and abundance of invasive alien species in the region?  

3)  Does the relative importance of these drivers differ between the two 

diversity metrics (i.e., species richness and abundance)?

Helpful Answer:
Regularization is a technique used in machine learning and deep learning models to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise along with underlying patterns, which can lead to poor generalization performance on new, unseen data. Regularization helps to reduce overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function during optimization, encouraging simpler models with smaller weights or fewer active neurons. Two common regularization techniques used in deep learning pipelines are Dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a regularization method where randomly selected neurons are temporarily removed ("dropped out") from the network during each iteration of training. This forces the remaining neurons to learn more robust features and prevents any single neuron from becoming too influential. During testing, all neurons are included but their outputs are scaled down proportionally to the dropout rate used during training, effectively averaging multiple thinned networks.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term proportional to the sum of squared weights to the loss function. This encourages smaller weights, leading to simpler models that are less likely to overfit. In practice, this is often implemented as a multiplier on the gradient update step for each weight, shrinking them slightly after every iteration.

Both Dropout and L2 regularization can be combined within a single deep learning pipeline to further combat overfitting. Other regularization techniques include early stopping, which halts training once validation error starts increasing, and L1 regularization, which promotes sparse solutions by penalizing absolute weight values rather than squares. However, Dropout and L2 regularization remain popular due to their simplicity and effectiveness across various architectures and tasks.
