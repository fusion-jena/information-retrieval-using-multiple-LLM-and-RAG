Power plants can emit significant amounts of 
carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere ( 
Pandey, 2020). Furthermore, the 
combustion of furnace oil or diesel in power 
plants produces substantial amounts of 
sulfur oxides (SOx) and nitrogen oxides 
(NOx) (Kouravand and Kermani, 2018). 
Landfills can contribute to air pollution by 
releasing dust and gases such as methane 
(CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and etc. ( 
Iravanian and Ravari, 2020).

%Query
Query: "What process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model (e.g., Model serialization, Platform selection)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no information about the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily discusses various studies related to air quality prediction using machine learning techniques, but it does not provide details regarding the deployment process of these models. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to this query based on the available context.
