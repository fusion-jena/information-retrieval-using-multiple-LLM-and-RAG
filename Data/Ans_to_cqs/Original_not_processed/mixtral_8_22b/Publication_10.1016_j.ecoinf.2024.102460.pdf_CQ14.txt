Water area 

Built-up land 

Unused land

Total number of grid cells occupied by land use type k in the 
window. 
The weight between different land use types due to different 
neighbourhood effects, for different land use types, has a default 
value of 1, but it can be defined by the model user. 
Difference between current quantity and future demand for land use 
type k in t-1 and t-2 iterations. 
Random values from 0 to 1. 
Generating new land use patch thresholds for land use type k, as 
determined by the model user. 
Approximate land use demand step size. 
The decreasing threshold of the decay factor, which ranges from 0 to 
1 and is set by the expert. 
A normally distributed random value with a mean of 1 and a range 
from 0 to 2. 
Decay steps. 
A transition matrix which defines whether land is allowed to be 
converted to type c using type k.

4.4.2. Uncertainty analysis 

The  MOP  model  achieves  ecological  protection  by  simulating  the 
value of ecosystem services, but fluctuations in crop prices directly affect 
the estimation of net crop income and indirectly cause uncertainty risk 
in the optimization model. However, the IFS can effectively reflect the 
uncertainty  of  numerical  values.  Compared  to  traditional  fuzzy

%Query
Query: "How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The paper does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. Therefore, we cannot determine if they used methods such as grid search or random search.
