The values of predictors were finally extracted for the whole study
area in a regular 10 × 10 m square grid and used for wall-to-wall pre-
diction of VWC using the developed GAM model. Figures showing the
spatial distribution of predicted VWC, and its standard error were
created.

land reclamation. Forecasting accurate spatiotemporal soil moisture
pattern is a critical element for success of model. Topographic frame-
work is crucial for estimating digital elevation models are a vital part of
soil moisture modeling dynamics. Understanding the spatial and tem-
poral variability of soil moisture is essential for effective land manage-
ment, water resource allocation, and climate change adaptation
(Vereecken et al., 2014). This study delves into the complex interplay of
factors influencing soil moisture dynamics, harnessing the power of
multi-source data fusion to develop a predictive model for volumetric
water content (VWC) (Larson et al., 2022).

Helpful Answer:
In addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same proportions of classes or labels within each set. This ensures that the classifier learns from a representative sample of the entire dataset.

Oversampling is a technique where synthetic samples are created from existing minority class examples to balance the dataset. This helps prevent the classifier from being biased towards the majority class.

Undersampling, on the other hand, involves reducing the size of the majority class to match the minority class. However, this method may result in loss of information if important features are discarded.

Diverse data collection entails gathering data from various sources to ensure that the dataset is representative of all possible scenarios. This reduces the risk of overfitting and improves the generalizability of the model.

These techniques help mitigate data bias and improve the performance of deep learning models. It is essential to choose the appropriate technique based on the nature of the dataset and the problem at hand.
