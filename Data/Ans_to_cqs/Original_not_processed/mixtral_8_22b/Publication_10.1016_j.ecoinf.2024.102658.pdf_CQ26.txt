4.2.1. Baseline model: random forest 

Random forest (Breiman, 2001) utilizes an ensemble of classification 
or regression trees; each tree is grown from a bootstrap sample of the 
training dataset, and represents a series of sequential decisions, in which 
each node of the tree is a binary split made on a predictive feature (e.g., 
whether  the  mean  annual  temperature  is  above  25 
C).  Further,  a 
random subset of features is considered when finding the optimal split at 
each node (we use a value of sqrt(n), n being the number of potential 
predictors, for the size of this subset). When used for classification, the 
outputs from the component trees are put through a majority vote to 
create a single output. This is known to be a simple but powerful method 
of retaining the complex non-linearity of decision trees while avoiding 
overfitting.

The list of features. We utilize two feature sets selected through different CV 
processes  in  a  previous  study  (Mechenich  et  al.,  2024),  which  we  name  the 
‘random-CV’ feature set and the ‘spatial-CV’ feature set, respectively. The two 
feature sets share six common features.

amount  of  data,  distribution  data  for  machine  learning  models  and 
physiological data for process-based models. For both types of models, 
the  data  is  difficult  and  costly  to  collect.  This  poses  a  bottleneck  for 
building SDMs for practical use.

Following this, forward feature selection (FFS) was performed. FFS is 
a  common  stepwise  selection  procedure  (Hastie  et  al.,  2020),  which 
begins with an empty model, and iteratively selects the next feature from 
the initial set which most improves model performance. Candidate lo-
gistic  regression  and  random  forest  models  were  evaluated  via  (1) 
random cross-validation (CV) and (2) spatial CV (Roberts et al., 2017), 
in which the full training dataset was partitioned into spatial blocks like 
those shown in Fig. 2. 

Because model performance estimated via spatial CV is dependent on 
the spatial configuration of the CV folds, the procedure was repeated 
over 100 random blocking configurations; those features selected most 

Fig.  2. One  spatial-CV  fold  pattern  used  in  feature  selection.  This  particular 
fold was also utilized when calculating numerical scores for the models.

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some relevant information can still be extracted.

Firstly, it is mentioned that Random Forest is used as the baseline model. Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees and aggregating their results. It helps reduce overfitting and improve prediction accuracy. Although not directly addressing data bias, using such methods can help mitigate its effects indirectly.

Secondly, the text mentions that candidate logistic regression and random forest models were evaluated via (1) random cross-validation (CV) and (2) spatial CV. Cross-validation is a technique used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models and prevent overfitting. In random CV, the dataset is randomly divided into k subsets or 'folds', where one fold serves as the test set and the remaining k−1 folds form the training set. This process is repeated k times, ensuring every observation has been part of the test set once. Spatial CV, on the other hand, involves dividing the dataset based on spatial criteria rather than purely random assignment. Both these approaches can help ensure that the trained model generalizes well across various parts of the input space, thus reducing any potential biases introduced due to uneven representation of certain classes or regions within the dataset.

Lastly, the table lists several features used in the analysis, including BIO03, TN10P, GSL, TNX, BIO08, TXX, BIO02, TN90P, ID, BIO14, BIO18, CWD, RX1DAY, WSDI, and others. These features likely represent various environmental variables or characteristics that could influence species distributions. By carefully selecting and engineering appropriate features, researchers can potentially minimize the impact of data bias on their models.

However, without more detailed information about the preprocessing steps applied to the dataset, it is impossible to provide a definitive answer regarding the specific techniques employed to address data bias.
