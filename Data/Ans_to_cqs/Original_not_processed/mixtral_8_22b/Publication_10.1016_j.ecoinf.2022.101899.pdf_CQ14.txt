To consider the model uncertainty, the models given in Fig. 15 are 
considered  as  the  set  of  models,  Ψ  of  Section  2.2.2.  Then  the  BMA 
approach is implemented. Each model’s prior probability is set to 0.2 to 
give equal chances a priori. The resulting posterior model probabilities, 
P(m| D), and Bayes factors to compare the models are given in Fig. 15. 
Bayes factors can also be interpreted as the improvement in the proba-
bility of occurrence for a given model. This analysis provides insights 
into  which  model  is  most  impactful  in  predicting wildfire  occurrence 
probabilities  and  provides  evidence  on  if  forest  vulnerability  is  the 
dominant  predictor.  The  results  indicate  forest  vulnerability  as  the 
dominant predictor, as this model is 2.5 times more likely to occur based 
on the posterior odds. The model that includes forest vulnerability with 
mean  wind  speed  is  the  second  most  likely, with  2.3  times  improved

the model parameters. For example, the β-parameter for forest vulner-
ability is moderately positively correlated with the β-parameter for the 
mean  temperature.  So,  we  a  priori  induce  that  the  impact  of  forest 
vulnerability  on  having  a  wildfire  is  moderately  positively  correlated 
with the impact of mean temperature on having a wildfire. Then, this 
reflects  the  prior  information  on  the  mediating  effects  of  the  forest 
vulnerability and the mean temperature.

The model defined in Section 2.2.1 induces independent normally 
distributed  prior  distributions  on  the  model  parameters.  These  priors 
can either be informative or noninformative. The exponential of each βj 
parameter,  exp(βj),  represents  the  increase  in  the  odds  of  having  a 
wildfire for each unit increase in the predictor Xj. Thus, the exponential 
of the mean of a normal prior, exp(Mj), is set to the prior information 
about the odds of having a wildfire for each unit increase in the predictor 
Xj.  The  weight  of  the  prior  information  (degree  of  belief  in  the  prior 
information) is expressed by using the variance of a normal prior, Sj. The 
lower the prior variance, the higher the weight of prior information in 
the resulting parameter estimates. In that sense, we get a noninformative 
prior for high values of Sj and vice versa. However, this approach does 
not  incorporate  the  mediating  effects  that  can  exist  between  the  pre-

Algorithm 1  

1.  Quantify  the  magnitude and  direction  of  the  correlations  between 
the  pairs  of  model  parameters  to  represent  the  mediating  effects 
between  the  predictors  of  wildfire  probability.  Let  ρjk  show  the 
quantified correlation between βj and βk for j, k = 1, …, 5, and Φ =
(ρjk) be the corresponding correlation matrix, where ρjk = ρkj and ρjj 
= 1.  

2.  Set σjj of the prior covariance matrix to 1.  
3.  Then, we have β~MVN(μ, Φ) from Σ = diag (σjj)Φ diag (σjj) = Φ.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the provided context, there isn't any explicit mention of how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, such as through methods like grid search or random search. Instead, the focus seems to be on setting prior probabilities and incorporating prior knowledge into the model.

In the context, it's mentioned that each model's prior probability is set to 0.2 to give equal chances a priori. Additionally, the text discusses the use of independent normally distributed prior distributions on the model parameters, which can either be informative or noninformative. The exponential of each beta parameter is used to represent the increase in the odds of having a wildfire for each unit increase in the predictor. Prior information about these odds is incorporated into the model via the mean of a normal prior distribution, while the degree of belief in the prior information is expressed using the variance of the normal prior distribution.

Furthermore, Algorithm 1 is presented to quantify the magnitude and direction of the correlations between pairs of model parameters to represent the mediating effects between the predictors of wildfire probability. However, this algorithm doesn't seem to directly address the optimization of hyperparameters.

Therefore, without additional context, it cannot be determined how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.
