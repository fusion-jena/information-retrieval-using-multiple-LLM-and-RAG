WT-HMM using varying dataset sizes over 10 runs.

Furthermore,  the  comparison  between  recording  months  provides 
valuable insights into the tradeoffs  associated with dataset size  selec-
tion. The superior performance of the WT-HMM in the 8 to 20-h dataset 
size  range  for  both  months  suggests  the  most  suitable  range  for 
achieving  high  accuracy.  This  finding  resonates  with  studies  empha-
sizing the importance of selecting appropriate sample sizes for effective 
model training (Kahl et al., 2021).

The observed increasing trend in both accuracy and F1-score for the 
WT-HMM across different dataset sizes aligns with findings in similar 
studies.  Previous  research  in  bioacoustics  has  highlighted  the  impor-
tance of dataset size in training robust models for cetacean vocalization 
classification  (Lu  et  al.,  2021;  Ogundile  et  al.,  2020;  Ogundile  et  al., 
2021; Usman et al., 2020). Larger datasets provide models with more 
diverse examples, aiding in the generalization of learned features and 
patterns. The consistent improvement in accuracy and F1-score for both 
recording periods indicates that the WT-HMM is not only effective for 
smaller datasets but also scales well as the dataset size increases. This 
scalability  is  a  crucial  characteristic,  especially  in  bioacoustic  moni-
toring where datasets can vary significantly in size (Xie et al., 2020).

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available from the given context to determine what specific process was used to deploy the trained deep learning model. Details such as model serialization or platform selection are not mentioned. Therefore, it cannot be determined how the WT-HMM model was deployed after being trained.
