Development of automated classification routines, if accurate, serves to 
improve the efficiency, reduce the subjectivity, and decrease the cost of 
analyzing large datasets.

These  two  examples  of  small  sample  sizes  highlight  a  conflict  in 
preferred protocol. Ideally, (1) all species would be included in a clas-
sification model, so as to better represent the local species diversity, (2) 
all events would ideally be included in the classification model, so as to 
better represent the variability found in the area, and (3) only confident 
‘ground truth’ classifications would be considered in the training model. 
Unfortunately, in species where identity must be determined based on 
call characteristics (rather than visual confirmation of species identity in 
the field), it can sometimes be difficult to confidently determine species 
identity when calls are highly variable and do not include at least one 
call  that  provides  high  confidence  of  species  identity.  In  the  case  of 
beaked whales, we recommend that training data include a high level of 
confidence for inclusion. This is especially critical for species with small

While  BANTER  provides  an  efficient  and  consistent  approach  to 
classification, there are significant limitations that must be considered. 
BANTER  is  a  supervised  machine  learning  tool  and  requires  reliable 
training  data  for  success.  Training  data  should  consist  of  labels  with 
strong confidence in species identity (ideally determined by agreement 
from more than one analyst) and sample sizes should be large enough to 
explain the natural variability in the data.

BANTER  may  serve  as  an  option  for  automated  machine  learning 
classification.

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention a specific strategy for monitoring the model performance during training. However, it does provide some insights into the requirements for successful implementation of the BANTER model, which is used for automated machine learning classification.

The text suggests that reliable training data is crucial for the success of the BANTER model. This includes labels with strong confidence in species identity, ideally determined by agreement from more than one analyst. Additionally, the sample sizes should be large enough to explain the natural variability in the data. These requirements imply that careful attention needs to be paid to the quality and quantity of the training data to ensure the model performs well.

Moreover, the context mentions that all species and events would ideally be included in the classification model to better represent the local species diversity and variability found in the area. This indicates that comprehensive coverage of the dataset is important for effective modeling.

However, the context also acknowledges that there might be challenges in determining species identity when calls are highly variable and do not include at least one call that provides high confidence of species identity. In such cases, it recommends that training data include a high level of confidence for inclusion, particularly for species with small sample sizes.

In conclusion, while the context does not directly address the strategy for monitoring the model performance during training, it emphasizes the importance of using reliable and representative training data for the successful implementation of the BANTER model. Regular evaluation of the model's performance against these criteria could potentially serve as a strategy for monitoring its performance during training.
