(Zhang and Benveniste, 1992), Bayesian learning machine (Xu, 1997),
and so on. Researchers have extended the application and improve the
algorithms based on classical neural network models afterwards. Since
2006 deep learning started to boom in academia and industry. The deep
learning algorithm broke the limitation of the traditional neural net-
work on the number of layers. According to demands of designers, the
number of network layers was chosen and trained by large-scale data to
obtain deeply hidden characteristic information and features which is
beyond imagination before (Hinton and Salakhutdinov, 2006).

Neural networks have been playing an increasingly important role
in solving complex problems in various ﬁelds in real life recently (Ata,
2015). The main advantages of artiﬁcial neural networks over tradi-
tional methods are high speed, simplicity and ability to solve complex
nonlinear relationship among variables, and easy feature extraction
from training data (Kalogirou, 2003). Werbos (1974) and Varﬁs and
Versino (1990) applied an artiﬁcial neural network to analyze eco-
nomic problems in daily life and showed that a neural network has good
capability for economic simulations. Following this study, various
scholars have introduced neural network models to study the economy,
environment, and society (Lek and Guégan, 1999; Li et al., 2010; Liu
et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2016;Wang et al., 2017). Neural networks in-

after individual trials from BPNN2-1 (insuﬃcient ﬁtting ability) to
BPNN7-1 (overﬁtting and unstable), BPNN4-1 oﬀers the lowest mean
square error and the most 17 stable average performance at 0.000694,
with a maximum allowable training time of 1000. We choose an
adaptive strategy to modulate the learning rate to improve the neural
network convergence rate. The results show a benchmark learning rate
of 0.01, a learning rate up to 1.07 as the error steadily decreases, a
learning rate down to 0.70 as the error increases, a limit of the training

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific details about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, it mentions that researchers have improved algorithms based on classical neural network models, including the use of large-scale data to train deeper networks with more layers. This suggests that optimization techniques may be employed during the training process to minimize errors and improve the overall performance of the deep learning models. Additionally, the text refers to an adaptive strategy being used to modulate the learning rate, which could indicate the use of optimization techniques like gradient descent variants or other adaptive learning rate methods.
