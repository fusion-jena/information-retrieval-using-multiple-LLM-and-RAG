Accuracy metrics for models with average and entropy features across window sizes  

Table A.6 
Accuracies and classification results into iceplant (positive class P) and other vegetation (negative class N) from models using spectral, NDVI, and date features together 
with average and entropy values of each spectral band and NDVI within a window, calculated across multiple window sizes. Accuracies are given in percentages.

classification processing. This step reduced the average number of pixels 
per scene the classification model had to analyze to 3,757,323 and took, 
on average, 18 s per scene.

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The paper does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using diverse datasets or employing techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting. However, it is mentioned that the accuracy metrics for models with average and entropy features were calculated across multiple window sizes, which could be interpreted as a form of parameter tuning to improve the robustness and generalization performance of the model. Additionally, the study used both producer's and user's accuracies along with overall accuracy to evaluate the performance of the models, providing a more comprehensive assessment of their effectiveness.
