Appendix C. Site: S2 

C.1. Coherence 

Fig. C.12 presents the results of applying the coherence measure to the data from site S2. In the top panel, note how in the frequency range of 7-8 
kHz, the frequency responses are not comparable as they do not exceed the established threshold. This is due to the behavior change exhibited by the 
SM4 recorder at this frequency range, which can be observed in the bottom panel of Fig. C.12. In addition, the frequency response at this site is not 
comparable over 12 kHz, which is consistent with the other sites.

Appendix F. Controlled test 

The Fig. F.19 highlights intra- and inter-recorder variability, demonstrating how frequency responses can be affected by manufacturing conditions 
and wear. Through power spectral density and coherence data, it underscores the variations between and within recorders, indicating that even 
devices of the same model can exhibit differing responses. This variability, attributed to differences in manufacturing and the potential wear over time, 
emphasizes the need for coherence metrics. Such metrics are essential for identifying frequency bands where recorders show comparable performance, 
offering a strategy to adjust for these variances in ecoacoustic data analysis, and ensuring more reliable acoustic index evaluations.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't enough information to provide a direct answer regarding the strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. However, we can infer some relevant details about the topic discussed in the text. The context primarily focuses on comparing different recording systems for detecting and monitoring songbirds using various methods such as coherence measures and power spectral densities. It also discusses the importance of considering factors like manufacturing conditions, wear, and device models when analyzing ecoacoustic data. Unfortunately, none of the sources mentioned in the context directly address strategies for monitoring model performance during training. Therefore, based on the available information, it is not possible to determine what specific strategy was implemented to monitor the model performance during training.
