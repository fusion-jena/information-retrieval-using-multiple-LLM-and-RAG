During the validation phase of the machine learning algorithms, a K- 
fold cross-validation technique was implemented. Additionally, a four- 
fold  cross-validation  was  conducted  on  the  training  dataset,  as  illus-
trated in Fig. 4. The dataset was initially extracted, and the feature set 
was randomly divided into four mutually exclusive folds through strat-
ified sampling (Guo et al., 2021; Psychalas et al., 2023). Each fold served 
as  the  validation  set,  while  the  remaining  three  folds  constituted  the 
training set for model training. To address imbalances, random under 
sampling (RUS) was applied to the training set, while the validation set 
remained unchanged. The model underwent training using the balanced 
three-fold  training  dataset  for  a  specified  number  of  epochs  and  was 
subsequently  tested  on  the  validation  fold to  generate  predictions for 
that specific fold. This process iterated four times with distinct valida-

both  on-site  and  RS  datasets,  integrating  them  comprehensively  into 
both training and validation phases (Aptoula and Ariman, 2021; Escoto

NN, a powerful and widely utilized machine learning model, excels 
in tasks such as classification and regression (Arbib, 2003; Niroumand- 
Jadidi  et  al.,  2022).  Comprising  interconnected  nodes  (neurons)  ar-
ranged  in  layers,  NN  processes  and  transforms  input  data  to  produce 
desired  outputs  (Goodfellow  et  al.,  2016;  Niroumand-Jadidi  et  al., 
2022). The fundamental structure encompasses an input layer, one or 
more hidden layers, and an output layer (Hardesty, 2017). The number 
of  neurons  in  the  input  layer  aligns  with  the  count  of  input  features, 
whereas  in  this study, only  wind  speed  is  considered. The number of 
neurons  in  the  output  layer  corresponds  to  the  number  of  outputs  or 
classes  (Hardesty,  2017).  An  essential  consideration  of  NN  design

The study ensured the generalizability of its deep learning models by implementing several measures during the validation phase. Firstly, a K-fold cross-validation technique was used, specifically setting K to four. This approach differs from traditional methods that separate data into distinct sets, as it maximizes the use of both on-site and remote sensing datasets by incorporating them into both training and validation phases.

Moreover, a four-fold cross-validation was performed on the training dataset. The feature set was randomly split into four mutually exclusive folds via stratified sampling. Each fold functioned as the validation set, while the remaining three formed the training set for model training. To tackle class imbalance issues, random undersampling (RUS) was applied to the training set, leaving the validation set untouched. The model was then trained using the balanced three-fold training dataset for a certain number of epochs before being evaluated on the validation fold to yield predictions for that particular fold. This procedure was repeated four times with unique validation sets.

In terms of model selection, neural networks (NN) were chosen due to their versatility and widespread application in various tasks such as classification and regression. Neural networks consist of interconnected nodes called neurons arranged in layers, which process and transform input data to generate desired outputs. In this study, only wind speed was considered as the input feature.

Additionally, Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) was employed, denoted as f(x) ~ GP(m(x), k(x, x')). GPR is a nonparametric probabilistic model capable of handling high dimensionality and noise in data. It provides not only point estimates but also insights into prediction uncertainty. Hyperparameters in GPR are determined from the data using techniques like maximum likelihood estimation or Bayesian approaches, catering to diverse datasets with different levels of complexity.
