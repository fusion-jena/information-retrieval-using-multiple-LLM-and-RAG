3.2. Model performance 

The five  component  models (GLM,  MaxEnt,  RF, GBM,  and  MARS) 
demonstrated variable  performance (Table 2).  Notably, the  RF model 
and the GLM model demonstrated the best and worst performance for all 
studied species, respectively (Table 2). 

3.3. Variable contributions to habitat suitability 

In the ensemble habitat suitability model, distance to mining roads, 
distance  to  roads,  distance  to  CAs,  and  distance  to  water  resources 
played  important  roles  in  predicting  habitat  suitability  for  the  three 
species (Table  3). Response curves  detailing the  relationship between 
habitat suitability and environmental variables in the best-performing 
model  (the  RF  model),  are  presented  in  Supplementary  Materials

The ensemble prediction was generated using a weighted-averaging 
approach,  assigning  weights  to  individual  models  based  on  their  pre-
dictive  accuracy  on  the  test  data  (Thuiller,  2014).  Evaluation  and 
comparative analyses were conducted for both individual models and 
the ensemble model via two widely recognized metrics: the area under 
the curve (AUC) and the true skill statistic (TSS). AUC values exceeding 
0.9 were considered as excellent, 0.9–0.8 as good, 0.8–0.7 as moderate, 
and < 0.7 as poor (Eskildsen et al., 2013). Similarly, TSS values were 
categorized as excellent (>0.75), good (0.75 to 0.4), and poor (<0.4) 
(Eskildsen et al., 2013). This comprehensive assessment ensures a robust 
understanding of model performance and aids in reliable predictions of 

species distribution across the central Iranian plateau.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The evaluation and comparative analyses of the deep learning models were conducted using two widely recognized metrics: the area under the curve (AUC) and the true skill statistic (TSS). AUC values exceeding 0.9 were considered as excellent, 0.9–0.8 as good, 0.8–0.7 as moderate, and < 0.7 as poor. Similarly, TSS values were categorized as excellent (>0.75), good (0.75 to 0.4), and poor (<0.4). These metrics ensure a robust understanding of model performance and aid in reliable predictions of species distribution across the central Iranian plateau.
