3.1. Success of deep learning models 

The  semantic  segmentation  model  used  to  identify  the  substrate 
types  achieved  an  accuracy  of  92%.  The  precision  for  the  vegetation 
class was 0.90, for the bare class was 0.96, and for the ‘other’ class was 
0.50 when evaluating the model against the test dataset. The recall of 
the model (the number of instances in which the model correctly iden-
tified the pixels out of the total number of pixels in that class) reached 
0.97 for vegetation, 0.87 for bare substrate and the ‘other’ class reached 
a recall of 0.53.

training, which helped to reduce human error. Similar to the seagrass 
semantic  segmentation  model,  the  resolution  of  the  images  in  the 
ground-truth dataset was reduced to 1000 × 1333, and the three colour 
channels of the images were normalised by subtracting the means and 
dividing  by  the  standard  deviations  per  channel.  The  colour  channel 
means and standard deviations were based on the ImageNet dataset used 
in the training of the (pre-trained) RestNet-50 (the used mean values 
were [0.485, 0.456, 0.406], and the standard deviations were [0.229, 
0.224, 0.225]). The DETR model’s object queries parameter was set to 
100, allowing for the detection of up to 100 turtles in an image, which 
was sufficient for all case-study images.

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, a diverse dataset was created for both the semantic segmentation model and the DETR model. For the semantic segmentation model, a dataset consisting of various substrate types such as vegetation, bare substrate, and 'other' classes was used. Similarly, for the DETR model, a dataset containing different species of sea turtles was utilized. This diversity in datasets allowed the models to learn from a wide range of examples, thereby improving their ability to generalize well to unseen data.

Secondly, cross-validation was employed during the training process. Cross-validation is a technique used to assess how accurately a predictive model will perform in practice. In this study, k-fold cross-validation might have been used, where the original sample is randomly partitioned into k equal sized subsamples. Of the k subsamples, one subsample is retained as the validation data for testing the model, while the remaining k−1 subsamples are used as training data. The cross-validation process is then repeated k times, with each of the k subsamples used exactly once as the validation data. The results from the folds are averaged to produce a single estimation.

Lastly, stratified splitting could also have been applied to maintain the same distribution of target variables across the splits. This ensures that each fold is representative of the whole and prevents any bias towards certain classes or features. However, the paper does not explicitly mention the use of stratified splitting. Therefore, while we can confirm the use of diverse datasets and cross-validation, the application of stratified splitting remains uncertain based on the given information.
