An alternative approach to enhancing the accuracy of LULC maps is 
to leverage deep learning techniques. These techniques operate patch- 
wise,  where  each  patch  incorporates  sophisticated  features  extracted 
from satellite imagery. This enables them to recognize intricate patterns 
effectively.  Particularly,  Convolutional  Neural  Networks  (CNNs)  are 
highly  effective  for  LULC  classification.  These  models  automatically

Despite  collecting  a  complete  training  dataset  with  sufficient  di-
versity (covering all land types) as well as encompassing various pixel- 
level  and  object-level  features  for  training  classifiers,  since  the 
training dataset has been collected for a specific geographic location, the 
model's  performance  can  be  influenced  by  changing  the  study  area. 
However, the framework can be successfully implemented in other study 
areas in case of providing training samples from the new target regions. 
Working  with  satellite  images  presents  significant  challenges, 
including the presence of incomplete information and potential biases. 
For instance, cloud coverage can obstruct valuable data for LULC map-
ping in the target study area. Moreover, complex classes within the LULC 
scheme may pose challenges when relying solely on one remote sensing 
source. In this research, even with the best classification strategies, class

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) mapping. However, it mentions the use of satellite imagery and the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which suggests that the datasets could include satellite or aerial image datasets. The authors also reference previous works such as Zhu et al.'s So2Sat LCZ42 dataset, which is a benchmark dataset for global Local Climate Zone (LCZ) classification. Additionally, they mention the use of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data in their deep learning fusion network. Therefore, while the exact datasets used are not specified, we can infer that the researchers likely utilized satellite or aerial image datasets along with relevant indices like NDVI for their deep learning pipeline.
