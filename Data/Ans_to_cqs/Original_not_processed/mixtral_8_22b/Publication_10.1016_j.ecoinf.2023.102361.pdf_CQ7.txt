Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

2.2. Split the datasets 

In this research, the datasets were randomly divided into three parts 
for training, validation and testing. Here, 60% of the data was used to 
train the deep learning models, and 20% of them was kept to validate the 
models. The remaining 20% data was used to evaluate the performance 
of the models. Table 1 show the number of data in the dataset and how 
they are separated for training, testing and validation. 

2.3. Deep learning models

2.6.4. Model training with selected patches 

We trained the same deep learning models as mentioned in Section 
2.5. For training, we resized all the patches of images to a resolution of 
256 × 256 pixels. Although after dividing the image into patches, there 
were images with lower resolution, i.e., 64 × 64 and 128 × 128 pixels, 
they were converted into a uniform size. 

2.6.5. Evaluation of the models 

An image was divided into patches first to predict its class label. Then 
the important patches were selected using the approach mentioned in 
Section 2.6.3. After that, the model predicted the class label for each 
patch. The weighted majority voting technique was used to predict the 
class label of the image from the predicted labels. 

2.7. Experimental setup

diction  of  the  deep  learning  model.  This  dataset  was  taken  to  verify 
whether our proposed approach can handle that issue. The dataset was 
shared  by  Jiang  et  al.  (2020)  through  the  Github  repository: 
https://github.com/zhangchuanyin/weed-datasets.

Helpful Answer: In this research, the datasets were randomly divided into three parts for training, validation, and testing. Specifically, 60% of the data was used to train the deep learning models, while 20% of it was reserved for validating the models. The remaining 20% of the data was utilized to assess the performance of the models. This distribution is summarized in Table 1, which shows the number of data points in the dataset and their allocation for training, testing, and validation purposes.
