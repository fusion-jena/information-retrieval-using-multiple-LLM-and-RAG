with  challenges  in  data  requirements  and  interpretability  (see  (Barak

we not only maintain the interpretability of traditional models but also 
benefit from the predictive capabilities of machine learning, advancing

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, based on common practices in machine learning and deep learning, several techniques can be employed to mitigate data bias. These include stratified splitting, which ensures that each subset of the data maintains the same distribution of classes or labels as the overall dataset. Oversampling is another technique where minority class examples are duplicated to create a more balanced dataset. Undersampling involves removing samples from the majority class to achieve a similar effect. Lastly, diverse data collection aims to gather data from multiple sources or populations to reduce bias and improve the model's performance on unseen data.
