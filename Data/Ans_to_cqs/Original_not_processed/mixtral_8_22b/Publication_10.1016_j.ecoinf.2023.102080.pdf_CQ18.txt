Fig. 4. Average computation time (seconds) for the 50 species needed for (A) running the overall covariate selection procedure and model fitting steps under each of 
the three main covariate selection procedures (“embedded”, “filter”, and “random”), and (B) model fitting only under each of the three main covariate selection 
procedures and by modelling algorithm (GLM: Generalized Linear Model, GAM: Generalized Additive Model, and RF: Random Forest). Wilcoxon tests were used to 
assess statistical significance in differences between methods with ****: p < .0001; ***: p < .001; **: p < .01; *: p < .05; ns: non-significant.

Table 2 
Percentage of species (n = 50) for which a given covariate selection procedure (Em: “embedded”, Fi: “filter”, and Rd: “random”) led to the top Score value (average 
value of Somers’ D, maximum True Skill Statistic, and continuous Boyce index) for each modelling algorithm (GLM: Generalized Linear Model, GAM: Generalized 
Additive Model, and RF: Random Forest). Results are shown for all species, species with the highest number of records (3rd tercile: “More records”), species with the 
lowest number of records (1st tercile: “Less records”), species with the widest spatial coverage in Switzerland (3rd tercile: “High coverage”), and species with the lowest 
spatial coverage (1st tercile: “Low coverage”). See Supplementary material 1: Table S1 for details on species data.

3.4.3. Computation time 

The overall average computation time for running both the covariate 
selection procedure and model fitting steps was ~1.5 time higher with 
the embedded procedure compared to the two alternatives (Fig. 4.A), 
which is the same order of magnitude as the gain in model accuracy. 
However, models from the embedded procedure were faster to fit (Fig. 4. 
B), presumably because the more relevant the covariate set, the faster 
the algorithms converged. 

4. Conclusion

We compared the average computation time needed for (i) running 
the overall covariate selection procedure and model fitting steps under 
each of the three main procedures, and (ii) model fitting only. Analyses 
were run using a 10-core central processing unit strategy with AMD® 
EPYC 7402 on the University of Lausanne HPC cluster.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the provided information, there is no direct mention of the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it can be inferred that the authors used various metrics such as Somers’ D, True Skill Statistic, and continuous Boyce index to evaluate the performance of their models. These metrics were likely used to compare different covariate selection procedures and modeling algorithms. Additionally, the authors mentioned using Wilcoxon tests to assess statistical significance in differences between methods. Therefore, while the exact monitoring strategy is not explicitly stated, it appears that the authors employed multiple evaluation metrics and statistical testing to ensure the quality of their models.
