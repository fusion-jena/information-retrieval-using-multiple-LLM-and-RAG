To our knowledge, this is the first application of UMAP to directly 
estimate species distribution based on an analysis of bioclimatic vari-
ables.  Other  studies  have  used  DRM  to  visualize  results  from  deep 
learning models; e.g., Deneu et al. (2022) used tSNE (another DRM) to 
visualize input data and the results of applying a convolutional neural 
network to model the distribution of species at a fine resolution. On the 
other hand, we applied clustering to identify groups containing species 
and near background points to highlight how bioclimatic heterogeneity 
between clusters in the reduced dimension translates to geographic re-
gions, i.e., to show that groups in the reduced dimension have similar 
bioclimatic  properties  within  a  group,  but  differ  among  groups  (see 
Figs. 6, 7). This behavior underlines the nature of UMAP in that back-
ground points near species samples share similar bioclimatic properties

The  volume  of  multivariate  data  increases  as  more  information  is 
generated in fields such as genomics, image analysis, population ecol-
ogy, and text processing. Dealing with multivariate data is a complex 
task that may lead to the curse of dimensionality; i.e., redundant or non- 
significant variables, degradation of model performance, and difficulty 
in visualizing the relationships between features (Anowar et al., 2021). 
To  address  these  problems,  dimensionality  reduction  methods  (DRM) 
provide tools to explore linear and non-linear featured relationships and 
help select and extract these from a multivariate space. Some examples 
of  linear  DRM  are  Principal  Components  Analysis,  Single  Value 
Decomposition,  and  Singular  Value  Decomposition  (Ayesha  et  al., 
2020).  However,  linear  DRM  cannot  address  more  complex  relation-
ships,  and  non-linear  DRM  have  thus  gained  importance  in  research.

UMAP builds  a high-dimensional weighted graph representing the 
data, and an objective function is then defined to preserve the original 
graph traits. The algorithm subsequently finds a low-dimensional rep-
resentation that satisfies the objective function. The weights represent 
the likelihood of connecting two nodes (McInnes and Healy, 2018). This 
method downsizes the multivariate space, with the results usually pre-
sented  as  a  two-dimensional Cartesian  plane  with colors  representing 
the different classes. Points in close proximity indicate a similarity in the 
higher  dimension.  UMAP  has  been  applied  to  visualize  patterns  in 
datasets  comprising  many  features,  and  to  detect  clusters  of  similar 
items (Diaz-Papkovich et al., 2021). It has also been used to visualize 
and  detect  protein  interactions  for  Saccharomyces  cerevisiae  (Dorrity

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to provide a detailed answer about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, I can give you some general insights into common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. These include:

1. Bounding Box Annotation: This technique involves drawing boxes around objects in images to help train object detection algorithms. Each box contains metadata related to the object it encloses.

2. Semantic Segmentation: In semantic segmentation, each pixel in an image is assigned a class label. This helps in understanding the overall scene better.

3. Instance Segmentation: Similar to semantic segmentation, instance segmentation assigns a class label to every pixel. But unlike semantic segmentation, it identifies each object instance separately.

4. Polygon Annotation: This method is used when the shape of the object is irregular. Here, polygons are drawn along the edges of the object.

5. Landmark Annotation: Also known as key point annotation, landmarks are used to define important features of an object. They are often used in facial recognition systems.

6. Line Annotation: Used mainly in autonomous vehicle training datasets, line annotations are used to mark lanes, roads, etc.

Again, without more specific details about the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context, it's not possible to determine which of these techniques were used.
