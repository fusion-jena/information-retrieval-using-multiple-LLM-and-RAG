Description and Parameters

execute_all() method, by which a user can get all available data in the 
NASA server for a given product and location. The call of the methods 
execute_many,  execute_all,  and  their  respective  asynchronous  versions, 

According to the NASA specification, there is a limit of a maximum of 
ten dates per request. In order to avoid this limitation, the execute_many 
() method has been implemented. The execute_many() accepts the same 

async_execute_many and async_execute_all is reported in Listings 3 and 4.

When  nasawebservice  has  to  deal  with  large  volume  of  requests,  the 
choice to use an iterator improves the memory management for the data 
ingestion  operations.  The  same  approach  has  been  pursued  in  the
