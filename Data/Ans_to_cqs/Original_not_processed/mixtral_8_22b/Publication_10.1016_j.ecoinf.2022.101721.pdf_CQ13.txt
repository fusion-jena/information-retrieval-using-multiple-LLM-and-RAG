include all observations in statistical modeling, rather than excluding observations, an approach which can affect 
the reliability of studies. This study also, to a great extent, explains the poor performance of software attempting 
automated bat ID. Implementing Bayesian algorithms, and thereby allowing users to interact with the software, 
should significantly improve their performance.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in any deep learning model. The context discusses various aspects such as prediction methods for means, standard deviations, and population sizes based on observed data, species identification using machine learning, inclusion of all observations in statistical modeling, and implementation of Bayesian algorithms. However, it does not mention any details regarding the use of deep learning models or their associated hyperparameters like learning rates or optimizers. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information based on the given context.
