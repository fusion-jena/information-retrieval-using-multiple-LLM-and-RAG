over which the quality measures and results fail to continue improving. 
Benkendorf and Hawkins (2020), analyzing the effect of sample size on 
deep neural networks, similarly concluded that by increasing the num-
ber of hidden layers, which can be interpreted as adding more training 
recordings in our software, the neural network can largely improve the 
performance of the model.

Automated  Remote  Biodiversity  Monitoring  Network  (ARBIMON; 
hereafter  referred  to  as  Arbimon)  is  an  online  open-source  platform 
linked  to  the  Rainforest  Connection  website  (https://arbimon.rfcx. 
org/),  with  a  combination  of  hardware  and  software  for  automating 
data acquisition, data management, and species identification based on 
audio recordings (Aide et al., 2013). From the several tools available to 
the user, we used a random forest model, which is a machine learning 
model based on decision trees and has shown to be robust and powerful 
(Breiman,  2001).  The  model  works  with  one  or  two  ROIs  (region  of 
interest, template, that contains the desired vocalization), the training 
data that contain validated recordings of the presence or absence of the 
vocalization provided by the user, and the threshold value set by the 
user. The threshold value ranges from 0 to 1. A score close to 0 means

obtain biologically relevant data.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention the use of a specific type of deep learning model such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers. However, it mentions the use of a random forest model, which is a machine learning algorithm based on decision trees rather than a deep learning model. Therefore, there is no clear indication of the use of any particular deep learning model in the given context.
