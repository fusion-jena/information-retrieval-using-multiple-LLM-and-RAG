mask. (3) Training set: grid with neighborhood features of six years (1986, 2005, 2008, 2010, and 2013). The features include the LU type, soil, topography, elevation, slope, aspect, distance to settlements, distance to roads, distance to rivers in this grid unit, and the 4 neighborhood grid units. (4) Constraint Factors: The statistical data and the quantity simulated by the backtracking of the Markov model are combined, and the numbers of different LU types in 2000 after modification by the simulation numbers are as follows (Table 1): 2.4.2. Deep Learning Module Probability maps (Figure 9): Water and settlements are constraint factors and can be determined by manual interpretation, and thus, no simulation is needed.  Figure 9.

DM in series. The deep learning method can model complex spatiotemporal dependencies, fit the drivers and mechanisms of the LUCC, derive the probability maps needed for the SM, and perform further LU simulations.  Figure 4. Deep learning module. A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is also known as an ANN. In addition to the input/output layer, it can have multiple hidden layers in between. The simplest MLP contains only one hidden layer, i.e., a total of three layers, and its structure is shown in Figure 5. The MLP has full connections between the layers. The bottom layer of the MLP is the input layer, the middle layer is the hidden layer, and the top layer is the output layer. Assuming that the input layer is denoted by the vector X, then the output of the hidden layer is f (W1X + b1), where W1 is the weight and b1 is the offset. The commonly used functions (f) include the sigmoid function, tanh function, ReLU function, among others. Remote Sens. 2020, 12, 3314

Remote Sens. 2020, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 22  2.3.3. Deep Learning Model Models based on artificial neural networks (ANNs), i.e., deep learning-based models, are gaining attention in the remote sensing domain [30–34]. The neural networks are used to fit the drivers and mechanisms of the LUCC. The drivers and mechanisms of the LUCC greatly influence the LUCC trajectories, play a dominant role in the study of the LUCC mechanism, and are the forces that cause changes in the LU patterns. Currently, the drivers of LUCC often include natural, socioeconomic, and political factors. The current consensus is that natural conditions control the basic trends and processes of the overall LUCC and the changes in the natural environment, such as climate change, and change the spatial distribution pattern of LU to a great extent. Human activities and socioeconomic factors are the main drivers of LUCC on a small spatiotemporal scale. LUCC is mainly driven by socioeconomic factors over short

A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is also known as an ANN. In addition to the input/output layer,
it can have multiple hidden layers in between. The simplest MLP contains only one hidden layer,
i.e., a total of three layers, and its structure is shown in Figure 5. The MLP has full connections between
the layers. The bottom layer of the MLP is the input layer, the middle layer is the hidden layer, and the
top layer is the output layer. Assuming that the input layer is denoted by the vector X, then the output
of the hidden layer is f (W1X + b1), where W1 is the weight and b1 is the oﬀset. The commonly used
functions (f) include the sigmoid function, tanh function, ReLU function, among others.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The paper uses a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model, which is a type of Artificial Neural Network (ANN). This model is not explicitly mentioned as being a specific type of deep learning model like a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer. However, since the MLP model has multiple hidden layers, it can still be considered a form of deep learning.

In summary, the pipeline employs a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model, which falls under the category of deep learning due to its multiple hidden layers.
