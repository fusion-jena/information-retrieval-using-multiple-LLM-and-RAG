However, random search without filtering is inefficient. To compensate 
for  the  motion  more  accurately,  an  AdaLAM-based  module  (Cavalli 
et al., 2020) was introduced by integrating local spatial consistency and

As shown in Table 2, the MOTA of the SORT model was much lower 
than that of the Deep SORT model using FENs. In addition, the number 
of IDs allocated by the SORT model exceeded the number of IDs allo-
cated  by  the  Deep  SORT  model.  This  indicates  that  the  FEN  network 
extracts more and richer target information features in the process of

features  from  images,  comprising  three  convolutional  layers:  Con-
v+BatchNorm+SiLU integration module (CBS), Efficient Layer Aggre-
gation Networks (ELAN), and Hybrid Convolutional (MPConv). As  an 
efficient aggregation network, the ELAN layer is designed with a multi- 
stream  structure  to  learn  various  features  through  different  convolu-
tional  streams. Unlike  the normal  pooling layer,  the  MPConv layer  is 
branched into a CBS layer and a Maxpool layer. Features extracted from 
each layer were fused through the Concat operation, facilitated by the 
aggregated feature pyramid structure. With the SPP pyramid structure, 
the header network is designed for multiple inputs and transferring in-
formation from the bottom to the top. Finally, the RepConv structure is 
utilized to adjust the number of channels for different scaled features.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it mentions several techniques used to improve efficiency and accuracy in object tracking models like Deep SORT and SORT. These include integrating an AdaLAM-based module for better motion compensation, utilizing Feature Extraction Networks (FENs) to extract richer target information features, employing Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) for robust fitting, and incorporating efficient aggregation networks like ELAN and hybrid convolutional structures like MPConv. While these methods do not directly address randomness due to factors like random seed values, they contribute to enhancing overall performance and stability in deep learning pipelines.
