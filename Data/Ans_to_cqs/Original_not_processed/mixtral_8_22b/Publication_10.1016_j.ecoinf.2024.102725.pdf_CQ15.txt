coverage, thereby enhancing the accuracy of the prediction results.

3.4. Accuracy evaluation metrics

This study utilizes a consistent color ramp and stretch function to
render all of the NDVI images. Four evaluation metrics, the coefficient of
determination (R2), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute
error (MAE), and error relative global accuracy (ERGAS), are employed
to assess and contrast the disparities between the predicted and actual
images.

R2 reflects the goodness-of-fit of the predicted images to the refer-
ence images, with values ranging from -∞ to 1. An R2 value of 1 in-
dicates perfect alignment between the predicted and true values, while
R2 = 0 indicates that all of the predicted values are equal to the mean of
the true values. Values below zero indicate no correlation. The calcu-
lation formula is as follows:

R2 = 1 (cid:0)

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, it mentions the application of deep learning methods for improved NDVI reconstruction and long-term vegetation cover studies. Therefore, we can infer that some form of optimization technique would have been utilized during the training process of these deep learning models, but the exact method remains unspecified within this context.
