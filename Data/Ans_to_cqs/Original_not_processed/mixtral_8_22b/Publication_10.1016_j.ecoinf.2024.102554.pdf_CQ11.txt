%Query
Query: "What is the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not include any specific details about the data repository link for the deep learning pipeline mentioned. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other data repository. However, it can be inferred that the data used by this pipeline might come from sources like ESA or NASA, which store their data in NetCDF format containing various parameters such as reflectance, Aerosol Optical Thickness (Kd940), Chlorophyll-a concentrations, etc. Additionally, there are mentions of using in situ data from CSIC-IEO CARM and satellite instruments like Sentinel-3A OLCI, Sentinel-3B OLCI, NOAA VIIRS, SNPP VIIRS, Aqua MODIS, and Terra MODIS. To find more detailed information on the data repository link, one should refer to the project's documentation or contact its authors directly.
