the loss function, and modifying their parameters according
to the loss function’s gradient. Thus,
the loss declines in
each training round (aka epoch), and the model’s annotation
accuracy increases (Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure 1).
As the number of parameters of a typical deep learning
model
is large, overﬁtting is a major concern. A common
(partial) remedy is the use of validation data, which are set-
aside while training, yet their annotations by the models are
the training
monitored. The validation data help to limit
duration, thereby reducing the risk of overﬁtting. In this study
we used 30 epochs per training task, based on our validation
runs (Figure 2).

predictions of the three focal species as well as missed ones. The learning consists of iterative reduction of this penalty for the training set images (blue) by a
stochastic gradient algorithm (Ruder, 2016). The validation set images (red) do not participate in the optimization and the gradual reduction in their loss indicates that
the training has not reached an overﬁtting point. The validation loss stabilizes after 30 epochs, suggesting that further training might lead to overﬁtting. Thus, the
deep learning model generated by 30 training epochs was used for tests. A different perspective on the gradually improving performance of the model is provided in
the right panel. The model’s average precision (AP) improves with the number of training epochs. The plot depicts the model’s mean AP (mAP) over the three insect
classes.

Deep Learning for Insect Ecoinformatics

INTRODUCTION

INTRODUCTION

State of the Art: Machine Learning for
Insect Ecoinformatics
Ecologists strive to document and interpret the abundance
and distribution of organisms. Field observations are a major
means to this end, and the observational data that have
accumulated over the decades form a solid basis for our
view of ecosystems. In recent years, technological advances
enabled the solidiﬁcation of observational ecology into a
new scientiﬁc branch, ecoinformatics, which applies big-data
methods to ecological questions (Rosenheim and Gratton, 2017).
Ecoinformatics focuses on curating and mining large databases,
collected over long time periods across multiple locations (see
the GBIF Home Page1). The available data vary in format and
reliability (Gueta and Carmel, 2016) as they originate from
multiple sources, such as long-term ecological monitoring (Lister
and Garcia, 2018), citizen science projects (Hallmann et al., 2017),
or museum catalogs (Short et al., 2018).

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to provide a detailed explanation about how the trained deep learning model was deployed. However, typically, once a deep learning model is trained using a dataset like COCO (Common Objects in Context) [4], it can be serialized or saved in various formats depending on the framework used. For instance, if the YOLOv5 model [3] was developed using PyTorch, then the model could be saved using torch.save() method. After saving the model, it can be loaded back for making predictions. As for platform selection, it depends on the specific requirements of the project. Some popular platforms include cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, etc., or edge devices like NVIDIA Jetson series, Raspberry Pi, etc. Again, without more details, I cannot provide a speciﬁc answer regarding the deployment process of the trained deep learning model mentioned in the paper.
