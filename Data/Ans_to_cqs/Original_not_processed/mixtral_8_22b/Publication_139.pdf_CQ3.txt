2.4.1. Training database assembly 

To assemble a training database, three randomly selected days from 
each month of the calendar year (see Table 1) were selected for anno-
tation. Select spectrogram images were manually labeled via visual in-
spection by two trained graduate students into a set of sound categories 
that evolved as the year progressed. On average, around 60 images could 
be  annotated  per  minute,  which  corresponds  to  8  min  of  audio  data. 
Therefore,  annotating  every  single  spectrogram  from  a  single  day 
(10,800 images) would take 3 h. Assembling the training database took 
less time in practice because only 10–15% of the spectrograms from each 
of the selected days were actually annotated (many spectrograms which 
contained only background noise were simply not needed). 

In total, this database consists of over 40 k images of bio-, anthro- 
and  geophonies.  The  full  contents  of  the  database  are  presented  in 
Table 2.

Further, existing labeled datasets, crowd-sourced or otherwise, can 
be used to perform initial data labeling on new recording sites in nearby 
geographic  regions.  Generating  an  initial  prediction  record  using  a 
model trained on a similar dataset is a viable starting point for manually 
annotating a new dataset efficiently –  correct labels can remain while 
false  labels  can  be  amended.  In  addition  to  such  cross-training  ap-
proaches, semi-supervised learning techniques can reduce the amount of 
time needed to annotate new or growing datasets (Zhong et al., 2020). 
Though it was not a significant issue for the dataset involved in this 
study due to the sparse nature of the soundscape (as demonstrated by the 
validation dataset performance) neural networks will inevitably fail to 
classify acoustic events that do not compose one of the training target 
species.  A  possible  solution  involves  implementing  clustering-based

Pre-training on the both ResNet50 (He et al., 2016) and Inception 
(Szegedy et al., 2014) neural networks did not meaningfully improve 
classification performance, therefore this simpler architecture, similar to 
those implemented by (Ruff et al., 2020; Sprengel et al., 2016) was used 
instead. 

2.6. Generating prediction record

Transfer learning, where a model pre-trained on one dataset is re- 
trained  to  classify  a  similar  datset,  is  one  convenient  approach  to 
effectively  utilize  the  power  of  CNNs.  Well-known  pre-trained  archi-
tectures such as Inception, MobileNet, and Resnet50 have recently been 
used with great success for the classification of birds in soundscape re-
cordings (Florentin et al., 2020; He et al., 2016; Howard et al., 2017; 
Incze et al., 2018; LeBien et al., 2020; Sevilla and Glotin, 2017; Szegedy 
et  al.,  2014).  Such  networks  are  typically  pre-trained  on  large  image 
databases such as ImageNet, which contains over one million samples 
distributed across 1000 classes (Deng et al., 2009). However, in cases 
where  targeting  foreground  species  is  the  main  task,  or  with  more 
acoustically sparse soundscapes, CNN architectures with far fewer (<10) 
convolutional layers have proven more than sufficient, and indeed, may

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about specific data annotation techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it mentions that manual labeling was performed through visual inspection by trained graduate students. This process likely involved categorizing sounds based on their appearance in spectrogram images. The annotation technique appears to involve selecting relevant spectrograms containing useful information and assigning them to appropriate sound categories. It is also mentioned that only 10-15% of the spectrograms from each selected day were annotated, suggesting that the focus was primarily on identifying meaningful sounds rather than exhaustively labeling all available data. Additionally, the use of transfer learning and pre-trained models indicates that the team leveraged existing knowledge and resources to enhance their own dataset and improve classification performance.
