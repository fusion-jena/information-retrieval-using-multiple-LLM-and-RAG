2.4.2. Data splitting 

The  WQ indicator  data  was  divided  into  training  and  testing  data 
sets. In ML, typical data splitting ratios for training and testing datasets 
are 80% and 20%, 67% and 33%, and 50% and 50%, respectively (Sajib 
et al., 2023). In this study, we adopted 80% and 20% ratios for splitting 
the training and testing datasets. A total of 20 and 10 random sample 
locations  were  selected  for  the  purposes  of  training  and  testing, 
respectively. A similar number or fewer sample locations were utilized 
in various previous research studies to train and test the data set (Bui

models were trained and tested on training and testing datasets. Later, 
performances of the model were conducted for both phases.

Fig. 9 presents the RMSE and MAE for the eight ML algorithms. The 
majority of performance indicators were found to be higher during the 
training period; however, during the testing period, model performance 
was shown to have greatly improved, which may be due to the under-
fitting problem (Table S4 - supplementary data) (Wang et al., 2022). In 

addition,  the  lowest  prediction  errors  during  the  training  and  testing 
periods belong to GPR, LR, NN, and SVM (Fig. 9).

Helpful Answer:
Answer: In the given context, the data was split into training and testing datasets with a ratio of 80% and 20%, respectively. This means that 80% of the dataset was used for training the models, while the remaining 20% was used for testing their performance. The selection of these specific percentages is based on common practices in machine learning, where typical data splitting ratios include 80% and 20%, 67% and 33%, and 50% and 50%. However, it should be noted that the optimal data splitting strategy can vary depending on factors such as the size of the dataset, the complexity of the task, and the desired balance between bias and variance. Additionally, some deep learning projects might also involve using a separate validation dataset to fine-tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.
