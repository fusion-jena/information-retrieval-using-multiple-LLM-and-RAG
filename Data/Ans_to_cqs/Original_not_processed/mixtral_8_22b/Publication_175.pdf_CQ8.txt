3. Results 

The  deep  ResNet  model  trained  on  the  large  AT0  dataset  (3458 
natural thumbnails in average per species) during the first experiment 
obtained a mean accuracy (i.e. percentage of correct classification) of 
78.00%  (standard  deviation  (SD)  of  15.16%)  on  T2  test-dataset 
(Table  2).  With  this  model,  accuracy  varied  among  species  between 
54.14% (Naso brevirostris) and 99.07% (Abudefduf vagiensis). The same

principle of training a Deep Learning algorithm on “how to learn a new classification problem with only few 
images”. In our case-study, we assess the robustness of FSL to discriminate 20 coral reef fish species with a range 
of training databases from 1 image per class to 30 images per class, and compare FSL to a classic DL approach 
with  thousands  of  images  per  class.  We  found  that  FSL  outperform  classic  DL  approach  in  situations  where 
annotated images are limited, yet still providing good classification accuracy.
