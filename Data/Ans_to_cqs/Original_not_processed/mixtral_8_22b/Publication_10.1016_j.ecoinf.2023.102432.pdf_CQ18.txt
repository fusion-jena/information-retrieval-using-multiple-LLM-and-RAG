torelli et al., 2014). Most machine learning approaches are not designed 
to handle training data that is not ‘pure’ or 100% representative of the 
target invader (Roberts et al., 1998).

were calculated on the 20% of the data not used for training the algo-
rithm  (approximately  720  pixels  with  50  having  Brazilian peppertree 
present). The confusion matrix was calculated and the overall, producer, 
and user accuracy are reported.

MTMI-SMF is formulated to work with imperfect data, which can be 
due to training locations having locational errors or not ideally matching 
with  image  pixels.  MTMI-SMF  groups  pixels  surrounding  a  training 
location  that  could  have  invader.  Most  other  machine  learning  algo-
rithms require a single pixel to represent a training location, which often 
leaves the user making an educated guess on which pixel best represents 
that training location. Here, we compare MTMI-SMF classification (i.e., 
confidence values with a threshold applied) to a commonly used ma-
chine learning classification approach, random forest.

Helpful Answer:
The study uses k-fold cross validation to evaluate the performance of the models during training. Specifically, it employs 5-fold cross validation, where the dataset is divided into five equal parts or 'folds'. Four folds are used for training the algorithm, while the remaining fold is used for testing. This process is repeated five times, each time with a different fold serving as the test set. The results of these iterations are then combined to produce a more robust estimate of the model's performance. The evaluation metrics used include overall accuracy, producer accuracy, and user accuracy, which are derived from a confusion matrix.
