= [l1 ∈ l2] for all U⋀LTA (cid:0) LU

(10)

l=1

Where U is the union of l1 and l2 classification, such that the higher-
level classification (l1) with more classes (n = 32) is represented as el-
ements (∈) of the lower-level classification (l2) with fewer classes (n =
6), the nested classification between l1 & l2 is the reclassification of the
thematic spectral classes of l1 into the information classes of l2. Based on

a simple linear regression, the l1 / l2 crosstabulation results proved
insufficient to distinguish between MI and LI LTA-LU shrub community
configurations.

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any specific details about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. It only discusses the use of a nested hierarchical classification (NHC) methodology for distinguishing between different land cover configurations based on thematic spectral classes and information classes. The references cited do not seem to directly address the optimization of hyperparameters either. Therefore, it is not possible to determine from this context how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized.
