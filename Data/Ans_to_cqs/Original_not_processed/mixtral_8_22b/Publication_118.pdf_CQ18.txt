has been highly annotated and used in previous studies. The extensive 
annotation of the dataset allowed the feature representation produced 
by the auto-encoder to be easily evaluated and to be trained on a higher

3.4. Training 

3.2. Data pre-processing

Our experimental results show that the approach is feasible, as our 
feature representation outperforms acoustic indices and has an execu-
tion time comparable to MFCC. This would make it possible to calculate 
a feature representation using our method for smaller datasets (up to a 
few  days)  on  a  medium-range  laptop,  and  larger  datasets  on  a  high- 
performance  PC.  Additionally  the  approach  is  quite  flexible,  with 
many  different  auto-encoder  architectures  being  possible.  As  such,  a 
viable useage scenario for our technique could be when:  

1.  Annotated training data is not available  
2.  MFCC is not viable for the species (The principal that is thought to 
make MFCCs work well for human speech (Davis and Mermelstein, 
1980) may not hold for all species (Eichinski, 2018)) 

3. A small, fast to calculate feature representation is needed (for ma-

chine learning with bigdata, for example)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given context, there isn't enough information to determine what specific strategy was implemented to monitor the model performance during training. It only mentions that the dataset was extensively annotated, which allowed the feature representation produced by the auto-encoder to be easily evaluated and trained on a higher proportion of non-silent audio clips. However, no details are provided about how the monitoring or evaluation process took place.
