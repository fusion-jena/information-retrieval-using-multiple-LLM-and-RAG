Figure 8. Recall of the ResNet50V2 models on the validation set as a function of the annotation size relative to image size.
The validation images were binned according to the relative size of their respective annotations with respect to the image
size (“annotation size”). Each line shows the recall (left axis) of a ResNet50V2 model with a given input image size across
the binned annotation sizes. The recall lines were “smoothed”, using kernel density estimation. The number of images in
each bin is shown as vertical bars (right axis).

When training a deep convolutional neural network, it is important to split the data
into a training set, a validation set, and a test set. The training set is used for optimizing the
parameters of the network, while the validation set is used for monitoring the performance
of the network during training and for comparing the performance of different networks
with, for example, different hyperparameters or network structures. The test set acts as a
ﬁnal evaluation of a network. To ensure a proper evaluation on both the validation set and
the test set, samples in each set must be independent and have similar class distributions.
The full data set can be split in various ways. The naïve approach is to randomly
sample images from the full data set. However, due to the images being captured in
close proximity and potentially having overlapping ﬁelds of views, information may leak
between the data sets when using the naïve approach. Another approach would be to

Table 2. Overview of training, validation, and test set. C, I, and P are the number of clusters, images,
and polygons of each species in the respective data sets. A cluster consists of multiple images
acquired from the same location — potentially across multiple dates. An image contains zero, one, or
multiple annotations.

the number of images when training the ResNet50V2 network for classifying IAPS. The
highest recall for a given IAPS and input image size was generally achieved at annotation
sizes between 25% and 65%. Generally, the two image sizes 768 × 1024 and 1536 × 2048
performed similarly on the individual species and outperformed the other three image

Helpful Answer:

Based on the provided context, there isn't any explicit mention of how the hyperparameters of the ResNet50V2 model were optimized, such as through methods like grid search or random search. However, we do know that the validation set was used for monitoring the performance of the network during training and for comparing the performance of different networks with varying hyperparameters or network structures. This suggests that some form of hyperparameter tuning was likely employed, but without further details, we cannot definitively state which specific method was used.
