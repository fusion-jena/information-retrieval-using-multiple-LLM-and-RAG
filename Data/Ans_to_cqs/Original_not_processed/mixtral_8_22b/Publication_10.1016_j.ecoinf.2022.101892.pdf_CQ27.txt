In  addition  to  calculating  MAE  values,  we  also  compared  the 
inference-time to determine the most computationally efficient model. 
We set the batch to 400 to achieve 100% GPU utilization of each model 
and to measure the maximum queries per second (QPS) achieved under 
real-world conditions (Ding et al., 2021). All models were tested under 
the same experiment setting and the same GPU to make comparisons 
between them fair. To do so, we first expand the dataset by a factor of 
five (from 8002 to 40,010 images). Then, we fed batches of 50 images 
into the model to warm up the hardware, before recording the inference- 
time of batches of 100 to quantify QPS.

We  used  Pytorch  to  build  our  deep  neural  network,  which  was 
trained on Nvidia V100 GPU. In order to accelerate the convergence of 
the model, our model was pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset (Deng 
et  al., 2009) and then independently  fine-tuned on our  PAD Full and 
PAD Lite datasets. However, some individuals cross multiple age groups. 
Thus, to eliminate the influence of individuals, we applied a five-fold 
subject-exclusive  (SE)  (Han  et  al.,  2014;  Pan  et  al.,  2018)  which 
ensured the same subject did not appear in the training set and testing 
set at the same time. We downscaled the resolution of all images to 224 
× 224 pixels before feeding them to seven models. To avoid overfitting 
and imbalanced problem, we applied aggressive data augmentation. Our 
original images were captured under different illumination and angles. 
Thus, we augmented all training sets randomly via horizontal flipping,

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide explicit information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, it mentions that PyTorch was used to build the deep neural network, which was trained on an Nvidia V100 GPU. It is common practice to serialize or save the trained model after completion of the training phase, but this step is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. Similarly, there is no mention of platform selection for deployment. Therefore, based on the available information, it cannot be determined what specific process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
