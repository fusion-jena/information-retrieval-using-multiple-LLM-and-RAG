(Kennedy-Shaffer,  2019).  Therefore,  an  acceptable  quality  threshold 
will have to be decided not only on a theoretical basis, but also after to 
repeatedly test simulated or real datasets of recordings.

To compare the performances of the software and the similarity of 
the results produced by them with a varying number of records in the 
training set, we followed the standard processes of optimization for each 
software  (see  below)  with  six  different  training  sets  named  after  the 
number  of  positively  manually  validated  recordings  they  contained 
(Table  1):  training  15  (T15),  training  25  (T25),  training  50  (T50), 
training  100  (T100),  training  150  (T150),  and  training  200  (T200). 
Therefore,  for  each  software,  we  created  12  recognizers,  six  for  each 
song (Tables S1 and S2). All presences and absences were always vali-
dated  both  visually  and  acoustically  by  the  same  researcher  (MGU) 
using Arbimon, due to its user-friendly interface. In total, we created 36 
different recognizers, 12 per software (2 songs with 6 different training 
sets each).

of the recognizer, we chose the optimal cut-off thresholds (in the case of 
identical F-scores, we used the mean of the thresholds); (4) we ran a 
random forest model using the best replicate and threshold on the test 
set and evaluated its performance; and (5) we implemented the same 
recognizer and threshold to the target set to obtain biologically relevant 
data.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, it mentions that the researchers follow the standard process of optimization for each software and create multiple recognizers based on different training sets containing various numbers of manually validated recordings. This suggests that the completion of training might depend on achieving satisfactory performance metrics, such as accuracy or F-score, rather than reaching a certain point like a validation loss plateau. Additionally, the researchers validate all presences and absences both visually and acoustically, which could indicate that human judgment plays a role in determining when training is considered complete.
