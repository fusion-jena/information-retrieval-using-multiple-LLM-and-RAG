2.6. Training and validation set 

The  study  utilized  a  training-and-test  approach  with  stratification 
splitting. For each setting, 100 different splits to the training-and-test set 
were given. Tuning of the hyperparameter on the training set was done 
for  each  set.  This  was  followed  by  model  training  using  an  optimal 
setting of the hyperparameter. 

2.7. Regression models 

Four methods were used to model forest AGB in the study: AdaBoost, 
random  decision  forest  (RF),  multilayer  neural  network  (NET),  and 
Bayesian ridge regression (Bayes).

In  recent  years,  nonparametric  machine  learning  models  have 
become  predominant  for  quantifying  forest  biomass  within  a  space 
based  on  ALS  data  (Ali  et  al.,  2015;  Zhang  et  al.,  2019).  Machine

Helpful Answer:

Based on the provided context, it is not explicitly stated what specific datasets were used in the deep learning pipeline for estimating forest Above Ground Biomass (AGB). However, there are mentions of certain data sources that could potentially be part of such a dataset. These include:

1. Lidar Data: As mentioned in the title of one of the cited works ("Lidar and machine learning estimation of hardwood forest biomass..."), Lidar data appears to play a significant role in this research field. Lidar technology uses light pulses to measure distances and can provide detailed information about vegetation structures.

2. Landsat Imagery: Another source of data mentioned is Landsat imagery. One of the cited papers specifically discusses "Comparison of machine-learning methods for above-ground biomass estimation based on Landsat imagery." Landsat satellites capture images of Earth's surface, which can then be analyzed to extract various environmental parameters.

3. Combined LiDAR and Landsat 8 Data: There is also mention of using both LiDAR and Landsat 8 data together for estimating forest AGB. This suggests that the researchers may have created their own composite dataset combining these two data sources.

However, without more explicit details regarding the exact nature of the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, it is difficult to definitively state whether they correspond to well-known benchmark datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
