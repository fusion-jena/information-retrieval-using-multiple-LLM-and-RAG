Deep Learning for Predictive Ecology

Keywords: deep neural networks, ecological prediction, machine learning, computational ecology, forest disturbance 

INTRODUCTION

Addressing  current  global  challenges  such  as  biodiversity  loss,  global  change,  and 
increasing  demands  for  ecosystem  services  requires  improved  ecological  prediction. 
Recent increases in data availability, process understanding, and computing power are 
fostering quantitative approaches in ecology. However, flexible methodological frameworks 
are needed to utilize these developments towards improved ecological prediction. Deep 
learning  is  a  rapidly  evolving  branch  of  machine  learning,  yet  has  received  only  little 
attention in ecology to date. It refers to the training of deep neural networks (DNNs), i.e. 
artificial neural networks consisting of many layers and a large number of neurons. We 
here  provide  a  reproducible  example  (including  code  and  data)  of  designing,  training, 
and  applying  DNNs  for  ecological  prediction.  Using  bark  beetle  outbreaks  in  conifer-

To  better  contextualize  the  performance  of  the  DNN, 
we  repeated  Experiments  1  and  2  using  other  widely  used 
classification algorithms, i.e., distributed random forest, gradient 
boosting  machine,  and  generalized  linear  model.  We  used  the 
H2O platform (H2O.ai, 2017), which provides a set of fast and 
scalable  learning  algorithms  and  is  integrated  within  the  R 
software and environment.

Helpful Answer: The text does not explicitly mention any specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, including the use of random seed values. However, it can be inferred from the context that the authors might have used some form of cross-validation or bootstrapping techniques to ensure robustness and reduce variability due to random initialization of weights in their deep learning models. Additionally, they compared the performance of their deep learning approach with other widely used classification algorithms like distributed random forests, gradient boosting machines, and generalized linear models implemented on the H2O platform. This comparison could also help mitigate the effects of randomness by providing alternative perspectives and benchmarks for evaluating the performance of the deep learning models.
