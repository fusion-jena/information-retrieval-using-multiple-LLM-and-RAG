To train the EfficientNet, we prepared 4000 images for each category 
using the data augmentation method proposed above. We used 80% of 
the 4000 images for training and the remaining 20% for validation. The 
EfficientNet was trained by the Adagrad in 100 epochs. The dropout rate 
for each task was set at 0.5. The batch size was set at 20. 

All evaluations were performed on the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080Ti 
GPU with 11G memory, and the software was Windows 10, Python 3.7, 
CUDA 10.2. Keras 2.4.3 were used to build all models. 

To compare model results with the test video, we used IoU as the 
threshold  for  positives  or  negatives  based  on  the  object  confidence 
scores estimated by the object detector. IoU was defined as the inter-
section  over  the  union  of  the  two  bounding  boxes,  which  were  the 
ground-truth  bounding  box  and  the  predicted  bounding  box.  In  this 
paper, we set the threshold of IoU at 0.3 to consider correct or incorrect 
detection results.

these methods. By applying random erasing to the training dataset of the 
EfficientNet, performance was also moderately improved (Table 6).

In  addition,  we  proposed  a  data  augmentation  method  to  train  the

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The performance of the deep learning models is evaluated using several metrics such as Precision, Recall, and F-measure. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of total positive predictions made by the model. Recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of actual positive instances. F-measure is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances both. For instance, Table 3 shows the evaluation of the YOLOv4 model with and without Random Erasing using these three metrics. Similarly, Table 4 compares the performance of different models like EfficientNet-B0, EfficientNet-B1, EfficientNet-B2, EfficientNet-B3, and Xception using Precision, Recall, and F-measure. Additionally, confusion matrices are used to assess the performance of the two-stage detection using the EfficientNet-B1 model with and without random erasing (Table 5).
