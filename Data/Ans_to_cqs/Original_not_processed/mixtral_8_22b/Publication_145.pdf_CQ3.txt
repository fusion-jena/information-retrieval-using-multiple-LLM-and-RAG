ability to identify features in large amounts of data, including very high-resolution imagery, achieving
accuracy similar to human-level classiﬁcation accuracy, but in a consistent and fast way, enabling
rapid application over very large areas and/or through time [14]. For example, individual tree species
mapping in tropical forests, that was in the past only possible on small scale with traditional machine
learning methods [15,16] is now feasible on a large scale (>5000 km2) with a deep learning method
called U-net [17–20].

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the study focuses on semantic segmentation using the U-Net architecture for identifying tree species in tropical forests. This implies that the data annotation technique used could be either pixel-wise or instance-based segmentation.

Pixel-wise segmentation involves assigning each pixel in an image to a particular class, while instance-based segmentation separates different instances of the same object within an image. Both these techniques can be applied to semantic segmentation tasks like the one described in the paper.

Additionally, the paper cites reference number 49, which discusses large-scale semantic classification using aerial images. This suggests that remote sensing data might have been used, possibly requiring specialized annotation techniques suitable for such data.

In summary, although the exact data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned, based on the context, we can infer that they likely involve some form of semantic segmentation, potentially utilizing pixel-wise or instance-based approaches. Furthermore, given the use of remote sensing data, specialized annotation techniques for aerial images may also have been employed.
