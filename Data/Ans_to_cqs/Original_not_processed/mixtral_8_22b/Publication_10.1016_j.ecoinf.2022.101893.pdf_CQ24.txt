In recent years, deep learning has an excellent performance and is 
also widely used in computer vision, speech recognition and other fields. 
Xie et al. used Chirplet transform, STFT and Mel cepstrum transform to 
obtain the spectrogram, and combined with the bird species recognition 
method of deep learning, classified and recognized 18 species of birds 
(Xie et al., 2018). Since 2015, many research teams have exploited deep 
learning to classify birdsong in the LifeCLEF bird recognition challenge. 
For example, Piczak used deep learning to identify South American birds 
in the BirdCLEF 2016 competition (Piczak, 2016). T´oth et al. used CNN 
for feature learning in the same competition, and achieved good results 
(T´oth  and  Czeba,  2016).  Based  on  Xception,  extracted  logmel  or  log-
linear  spectra  as  features  in  BirdCLEF  2020,  Bai  et  al.  used  data 
enhancement technology to improve the detection performance of bird

shown in the Fig. 6. 

The network is designed with four convolution kernel pooling layers 
to extract deep features. After the convolution pooling, the data enters 
the fully connected layer for connection. The network adds a dropout 
layer  to  the  fully  connected  layer  to  reduce  network  parameters.  A 
Dense_1 layer is added after flatten to reduce the dimension of the deep 
features, and sets the parameter to 500, which is the parameter of the 
deep feature dimension extracted from different views.

features  with  maximal  correlation  with  the  category  and  minimal 
redundancy  with  other  features  from  the  raw  feature  set.  The  redun-
dancy among the features and relevance between the feature and the 
category  in  the  mRMR  method  are  calculated  based  on  mutual 
information. 

The mutual information is defined as Eq. (11): 

∫∫

I(x; y) =

p(x, y)log

p(x, y)
p(x)p(y)

dxdy

(11)  

where p(x, y) is the joint probability density of random variables x and y, 
and  p(x)  and  p(y)  are  the  marginal  probability  densities  of  x  and  y, 
respectively. 

For a sample feature set S = {f1, f2, …fn} and a sample class c, the 
relevance between S and c, is the mean of all mutual information be-
tween each feature fi and class c, as shown in Eq. (12): 

D(S, c) =

1
|s|

∑

I(fi; c)#

fi∈S

(12)  

where ∣s∣ is the number of features in S, and I(fi; c) is the mutual infor-
mation between the feature fi and the class c.

As important members of the ecosystem, birds are good monitors of the ecological environment. Bird recogni-
tion, especially birdsong recognition, has attracted more and more attention in the field of artificial intelligence. 
At  present,  traditional  machine  learning  and  deep  learning  are  widely  used  in  birdsong  recognition.  Deep 
learning can not only classify and recognize the spectrums of birdsong, but also be used as a feature extractor. 
Machine learning is often used to classify and recognize the extracted birdsong handcrafted feature parameters. 
As the data samples of the classifier, the feature of birdsong directly determines the performance of the classifier. 
Multi-view features from different methods of feature extraction can obtain more perfect information of bird-
song. Therefore, aiming at enriching the representational capacity of single feature and getting a better way to

Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, we can infer some general practices used in deep learning models to manage randomness.

One common strategy is setting a fixed random seed value before training the model. This ensures reproducibility by making sure that the initial weights and biases of the neural networks remain consistent across multiple runs. It helps in debugging and comparing different architectures or hyperparameters.

Another approach is using techniques like cross-validation or bootstrap sampling to estimate the variability due to random initialization. Cross-validation involves splitting the dataset into several subsets and training/testing the model on these subsets iteratively. Bootstrap sampling creates new datasets by randomly selecting instances from the original dataset with replacement. Both methods help in understanding how sensitive the model is to changes in the input data distribution.

Additionally, employing ensemble methods can mitigate the impact of randomness. Ensemble methods combine predictions from multiple models trained independently, reducing variance and improving overall performance. By averaging out the outputs of individual models, they become less susceptible to fluctuations caused by random initialization.

Lastly, it's essential to note that while managing randomness is crucial for ensuring consistency and reliability, embracing certain aspects of randomness can sometimes lead to improved generalization. For instance, Dropout – a regularization technique mentioned in the context – introduces randomness during training by temporarily removing neurons along with their connections. This prevents overfitting and encourages the network to learn robust representations.
