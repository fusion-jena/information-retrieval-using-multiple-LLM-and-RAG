Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

centers) in the development of the system is an essential task for out-
reach, dissemination and operationalization of the system. In this
context, we will ask a selected group of experts for feedback on the
performance, usability and reliability of the system in spring 2020. A
future use of the IFDS could also be the integration into a decision
support system, similar to the approach of Kalabokidis et al. (2013).

3. Validation

3.1. Fire events and fire danger

< 78

78 < 87
5 < 10
2,5 < 8

87 < 91
10 < 20
8 < 17

91 < 93 ≥ 93
20 < 40 ≥ 50
17 < 36 ≥ 36

2.3. Human impact

The Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC), a sub-index of the FWI, shows
better prediction results for fire ignitions than the FWI, also in Austria
(Arpaci et al., 2013; Dowdy and Mills, 2012). Daily FFMC data are
available since 2019. Therefore, we could use the FFMC as a basis for
the calculations of the IFDS variants only in 2019. In 2018, fuel
moisture in our model was depicted through the FWI.

%Query
Query: "What criteria are used to determine when training is complete (e.g., validation loss plateau)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide information about the completion criteria for training or any specific details regarding validation loss plateaus. It primarily discusses the Integrated Forest Fire Danger System (IFDS), its components, and future plans such as expert feedback and potential integration with a decision support system. Additionally, it mentions the performance of the Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC) in predicting fire ignitions compared to the Fire Weather Index (FWI). However, there is no mention of the training process or completion criteria related to machine learning models or other computational methods.
