Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

For this, we obtained ﬁve models by training Inception v.3 on the ﬁve created datasets. Several
studies have shown that increasing the size of the dataset using data augmentation improves the
performance of the CNN-based models [49,50]. These techniques have been proposed to reduce the
requirement of a large dataset for model training [43–45]. We conﬁgured the model parameters by
training the last two fully connected network layers in our dataset using a learning rate of 0.001 and a
decay factor of 16 every 30 epochs. As an optimization algorithm, we used RMSProp with a momentum
of 0.9 and epsilon of 0.1.

(1) Database construction phase: ﬁve training datasets were built with examples of images with
diﬀerent levels of tree cover, continuous and discrete approximations, and inclusion of auxiliary
class “Non-Forest” (see Section 2.2 and Supplementary Material, Archive S2).

(2) Training phase: training ﬁve CNN models based on Inception v.3 using two optimization

techniques, transfer learning, and data augmentation (see Section 2.3).

(3) Classiﬁcation phase: classiﬁcation of new 396 images with diﬀerent tree cover in global drylands
(see Supplementary Material, Table S1 and Archive S3) with the built CNN-based model (see
Section 2.4).

(4) Validation phase: assessment of performance on the new images (see Section 2.5).

2.2. Datasets Design

Before building the training datasets for the CNN-based models, we compiled a global database

of very high resolution satellite and aerial RGB images from two sources:

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about which specific deep learning framework was used to build the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the study uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based models, specifically Inception v.3. Both TensorFlow and PyTorch support Inception v.3 architecture, so either could potentially be used. Without further context or information, it is impossible to determine which one was actually employed.
