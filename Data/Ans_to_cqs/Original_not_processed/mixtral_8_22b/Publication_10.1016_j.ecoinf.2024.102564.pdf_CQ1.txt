We collected 20–30 soil samples for each plot to obtain a composite 
sample, and obtained information for the depths of 0–20 cm and 20–40 
cm. Soil pH in H2O, exchangeable cations (Ca2+
), total 
acidity (H
), cation exchange capacity (CEC), base saturation (V), 
available  phosphorus  (P),  P  remaining  in  solution  (P-res)  and  soil 
organic matter (SOM) were determined using standard methods (Teix-
eira et al., 2017). The soil analyses were performed at the laboratory of 
Soil Fertility at the Universidade Federal de Viçosa (UFV), Brazil.

Next,  we  calculated  the  elevation,  slope  and  aspect  for  each  plot 
using the surface Spatial Analyst Tools in the ArcGIS 10.3.1 program to 
account for differences in topography (ESRI, 2015). We used the Shuttle 
Radar  Topography  Mission  (SRTM)  and  Digital  Elevation  Models 
(DEMs) for the analysis.

Next, three essential parameters were configured in the RF training: 
the number of random regression trees (ntree, tested 20 to 100 trees); 
the number of division variables (mtry, used to determine the number of 
variables available to each node of the tree, with the default number of 
1/3 of the independent variables); and the minimum size of nodes (node 
size, value = 5).

Helpful Answer:
The study utilizes various methods for collecting raw data in the machine learning pipeline. For instance, they collect soil samples for each plot to create a composite sample, obtaining information for different depths such as 0--20 cm and 20--40 cm. They then analyze these samples to determine factors like soil pH, exchangeable cations, total acidity, cation exchange capacity, base saturation, available phosphorus, phosphorus remaining in solution, and soil organic matter using standard methods. Additionally, they use spatial tools like the ArcGIS 10.3.1 program to calculate elevation, slope, and aspect for each plot, accounting for differences in topography by utilizing the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) for their analysis.
