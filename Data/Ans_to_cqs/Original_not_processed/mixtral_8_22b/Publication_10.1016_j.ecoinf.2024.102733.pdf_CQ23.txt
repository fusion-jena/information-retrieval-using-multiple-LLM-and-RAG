This suggests that features learned from raw trajectories (especially
through unsupervised pre-training) can be preferable to hand-crafted
features.

The MLP employed consists of four fully connected layers with the
size of 256, 128, 64, and 12, each comprising a linear layer followed by
PRelu as non-linearity. Only the third layer differs, as it is provided with
Batch Normalization (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015). During optimization,
Batch Normalization was also applied to other layers as well, but the
network performance was not as good. The network gets the input of size
512 consisting of learned features extracted from the diffusion model
and the last layer has 12 neurons. The maximum neuron value from this
layer is then used for predicting the event class, as each neuron corre-
sponds to one of the events. The values of the 12 neurons are then
compared to the real event ground truth through a loss, which serves to
update the model parameters and perform the training.

During the training of the MLP, Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba,
2015) is used, as well as the scheduler which adjusts the learning rate
when the network reaches a plateau. For the training, various parameter
values and different regularization techniques were explored, with the
option of using either Cross-Entropy or Focal Loss (Lin et al., 2017). In
detail, the learning rate was set to 0.00001 and 0.0001, batch sizes of 8,
16, 32, and 64 were tested, and weight decay was varied between
0.0001 and 0.001 with a dropout of 0.1. Additionally, Focal Loss (Lin
et al., 2017) introduce additional parameters to investigate: α and γ. The
former serves as a balancing factor, either as a fixed value for all classes
or as the inverse of each class frequency. The latter regulates the impact
of the scaling factor; specifically, when set to zero, Focal Loss is equiv-
alent to Cross-Entropy Loss. We experimented with α set as the inverse of

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of their deep learning models, several measures were implemented during the development process. Firstly, the authors utilized diverse datasets, which included raw trajectory data. This allowed them to extract meaningful features from the data, contributing to the robustness of the models. Secondly, they performed extensive hyperparameter tuning, exploring various combinations of learning rates, batch sizes, and latent dimensions. By evaluating these configurations, they aimed to find optimal settings that would improve the overall performance and applicability of their models across different scenarios. Thirdly, the researchers investigated the use of both Cross-Entropy and Focal Loss functions, along with different regularization techniques such as weight decay and dropout. These strategies helped prevent overfitting and enhanced the ability of the models to generalize better on unseen data. Lastly, although not explicitly mentioned in the given context, cross-validation or stratified splitting could potentially have been employed to further validate the models' performance and assess their generalizability. However, without specific information regarding these methods, we cannot confirm if they were indeed part of the study.
