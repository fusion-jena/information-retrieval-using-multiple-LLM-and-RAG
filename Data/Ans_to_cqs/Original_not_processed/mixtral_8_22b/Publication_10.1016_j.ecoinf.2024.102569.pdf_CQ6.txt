where species are observed outside of their suitable habitats, such as in 
cultivation or captivity contexts (Botella et al., 2018). These scenarios 
are  common  issues  in  crowdsourcing  data  analysis.  To  remove  such 
heterogeneous  observations,  the  time-consuming  manual  checking  by 
experts  is  required  (Belbin  et  al.,  2013;  Mesibov,  2013).  If  such  pro-
cedure is not fully executed, our proposed method is expected to miti-
gate  the  impact  of  heterogeneous  observations  and  achieve  better 
predictions than ordinary methods.

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps may be necessary depending on the specific dataset and problem being addressed. Some common preprocessing techniques include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing any irrelevant, redundant, or incorrect information from the dataset. It also includes handling missing values, which could involve either filling them in with imputed values or dropping those records entirely.

2. Normalization: Deep learning models often perform better when input features have similar scales. Therefore, it is common practice to normalize or standardize the feature values so they fall within a certain range, typically between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1.

3. Scaling: Similar to normalization, scaling adjusts the range of feature values but does not necessarily center them around zero. Common scaling techniques include Min-Max scaling and Robust scaling.

4. Encoding: For categorical variables, encoding transforms non-numeric categories into numerical form. Techniques like one-hot encoding, label encoding, or binary encoding can be used based on the nature of the category.

5. Feature Selection: Not all features contribute equally to predicting the target variable. Selecting relevant features helps reduce overfitting, improves accuracy, and reduces computational cost. Techniques like correlation matrix, mutual information, or recursive feature elimination can help identify important features.

6. Splitting Dataset: Before training, datasets are usually split into three parts: training, validation, and testing sets. Training data is used to train the model, while validation data is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Testing data is used to evaluate the final performance of the trained model.
