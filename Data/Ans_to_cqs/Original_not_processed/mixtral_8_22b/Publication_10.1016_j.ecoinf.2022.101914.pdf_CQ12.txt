4.2. Ensemble models

2.8. Training individual models 

To train the component models for the ultimate ensemble models, we 
used  six  modeling  approaches,  categorized  into  regression-based  and 
machine  learning models. Regression-based  models included General-
ized Linear Models (GLMs), Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), and 
Multivariate  Adaptive  Regression  Splines  (MARS).  Machine  learning 
models included Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), 
and Maximum Entropy software (MaxEnt). We built all models using the 
biomod2 package in R (Thuiller et al., 2021).

We  have  provided  further  evidence  that  individual  modeling  ap-
proaches perform better when the number of background points used to 
train each model is optimized for that particular modeling algorithm. 
Given the popularity of ensemble modeling approaches in the scientific 
literature,  we  went  further  and  demonstrated  how  the  number  of 
background  points  used  to  train  individual  models  can  influence  the 
performance of ensemble models. We tested ensemble models built with 
four combinations of background points and found that the ensemble 
performed slightly better (based on AUC) when all individual models 
used  to  train  the  ensemble  were  built  with  their  optimal  number  of 
background points (Fig. 4). Although there is only a small increase in 
performance, this potentially highlights the ability of ensemble models 
to balance the strengths and weaknesses of the component models, even

by  its  relatively  constant  performance  regardless  of  the  number  of 
background  points  used  to  train  component  models.  As  with  many 
ecological  problems, the  decisions made during  the modeling process 
demand careful consideration in the full context of the question at hand, 
since different questions often differ in their requirements from a model.

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide information about the use of any specific deep learning model such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers. However, it mentions the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) as one of the machine learning models employed in building the ensemble models. ANNs are a subset of machine learning algorithms inspired by biological neural networks and are capable of modeling complex patterns and relationships in data. They consist of interconnected layers of nodes, also known as neurons, which receive input signals, apply weights to them, and pass them through activation functions before sending them to other connected neurons. Despite being a form of artificial intelligence, ANNs do not fall under the category of deep learning models like CNNs, RNNs, or Transformers, as they typically involve fewer hidden layers and simpler architectures compared to these more advanced deep learning techniques.
