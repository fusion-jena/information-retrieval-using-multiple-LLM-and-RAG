across various fields. For instance, Kushwaha et al. (2023) used Relief 
algorithm to select ground water quality parameters. IVS algorithms can 
be  broadly  classified  into  three  main  categories:  Model-Free,  Model- 
Based, and Dimension Reduction methods. Model-Free IVS approaches 
utilize  statistical  techniques,  such  as  calculating  correlations  between 
inputs  and  outputs,  to  conduct  input  selection  (Ma  et  al.,  2022;  May 
et  al.,  2011a;  Mazarei  Behbahani  and  Mazarei,  2023).  Model-Based 
methods,  on  the  other  hand,  determine  the  best  inputs  through  the 
calibration process of the model (Dariane and Behbahani, 2022; Feng 
et al., 2017; May et al., 2011b; Snieder et al., 2019). Although Model- 
Based methods provide the advantage of simultaneously applying IVS 
and  the  model  with  acceptable  accuracy,  they  often  suffer  from 
computational inefficiency, limiting their practical application. Evolu-

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not contain any information about specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotation, or scaling. These techniques are commonly used to increase the amount of training data by creating modified versions of existing images or datasets, which helps improve the performance and generalization of machine learning models. However, without explicit mention in the provided sources, it is impossible to identify the exact data augmentation techniques employed in this case.
