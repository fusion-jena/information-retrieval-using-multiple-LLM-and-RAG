material, representative colour image, and actual and estimated SPAD 
value across five distinctive N treatments is given in Fig. 8.

As  the  third  approach  for  SPAD  value  modelling  based  on  the 
Rasp2SPAD indices, an artificial neural network was implemented. The 
same predictors as in the previously described LM and GLM were uti-
lized. All predictors were scaled prior to analysis. The ANN  was con-
structed empirically, with the first layer containing two input nodes (one 
per each of the two parameters that were found to be the most suitable 
by LM and GLM) and the last layer containing only one node (predicted 
SPAD value). As the fit of the ANN does not give the same output for 
each run  (because of a random number generator used for numerical 
optimization of the model), 100 successful runs were performed, and the 
model residuals obtained in each run were analysed for a more reliable 
evaluation of the model performance.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotation, or scaling. Data augmentation techniques are commonly used in machine learning and computer vision tasks to increase the amount of training data by applying various transformations to existing images, thereby improving the generalization ability of models. However, without explicit information about the application of these techniques in this case, it cannot be confirmed which ones have been utilized.
