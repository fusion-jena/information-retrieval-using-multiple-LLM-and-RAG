species were selected for further studies which are recognised as inva-
sive for the region (Khuroo et al., 2007). This screening process resulted 
in ~400 specimens belonging to 10 invasive species (Fig. 2). Specimens 
with anonymous localities, incomplete herbarium labels and doubtful 
records were excluded. The herbarium duplicates were removed during 
the data filtering. For example, if there were five specimens of a species 
from the same locality, only one specimen was retained in the dataset. 
For  specimens  where  geo-coordinates  were  missing,  we  obtained  the 
coordinates from Google Map, using the name of the locality mentioned 
in the herbarium label. After this process, 240 specimen records were 
retained in the herbarium dataset.

Query: "Where is the data repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on the specific data repository used for storing or sharing the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it is not possible to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available based solely on the provided context.
