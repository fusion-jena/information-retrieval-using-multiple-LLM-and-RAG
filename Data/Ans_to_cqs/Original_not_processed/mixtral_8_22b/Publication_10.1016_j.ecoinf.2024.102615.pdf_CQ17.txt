the percentage value of the dropout layers, the learning rate, and the 
batch size, the optimal model was obtained with an R value of 0.76.

The performance of a neural network is traditionally improved by 
optimizing  its  hyperparameters,  which  influence  the  overall  model 
performance.  Using  different  hyperparameter  combinations  (e.g., 
combining  different  learning  rates  and  dropout  values)  will  lead  to 
marked  differences  in  the  predictive  performance  of  a  model.  As  a 
traditional  hyperparameter  optimization  method,  the  grid  search 
approach is widely used to optimize a model by comparing the values of 
evaluation  metrics  for  different  parameters  and  selecting  the  optimal 
parameters from a large search space (Bhagat et al., 2020). This method 
can optimize the model by comparing the values of evaluation metrics 
for different parameters and selecting the optimal parameters from the 
search space. In this study, the grid search method was used to optimize 
five of the MLP model’s hyperparameters. The hyperparameter adjust-

ment ranges were determined based on a review of existing literature 
(Chien, 1994; Peng et al., 2022; Shen et al., 2022; Srivastava et al., 2014; 
Wilson and Martinez, 2001; Zhang et al., 2019). The following hyper-
parameters  were  selected  to  optimize  the  MLP  network  architecture: 
number  of  neural  network  layers,  number  of  neurons  per  layer,  per-
centage values of the dropout layers, learning rate, and batch size. The 
specific tuning ranges of these hyperparameters are shown in Table 1. 
Each  set  of  parameters  in  Table  2  was  trained  based  on  a  set  of 
training data (80%) and verified using validation data (10%). The re-
sults of each group of parameters represent the average of ten experi-
ments (Tsimpouris et al., 2021), and the data were shuffled each time. 
Because the calculations are binary, the number of neuron nodes in the 
network architecture was set to the nth  power of 2 (Peng et al., 2022). In

2.3. Model optimization 

The model performance optimization process is broadly divided into 
two stages, as shown in Fig. 3. The R value of the validation set is used as 
the performance indicator during the optimization process, whereby R is 
maximized  using  the  grid  search  method.  During  the  first  stage,  the 
neural network structure and the number of neurons in the hidden layers 
are  adjusted.  In  total,  60  sets  of  combinations,  including  one  to  five 
hidden layers and neurons with a range of 64–2048 (nth  power of 2), 
were considered. The second stage involves adjusting the percentage of 
the dropout layers, the learning rate, and the batch size, to achieve a 
total of 192 combinations (4*4*3*4).

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, the authors have mentioned the use of dropout layers as a regularization technique to prevent overfitting in their deep learning pipeline. Dropout is a commonly used regularization method in deep learning models, which randomly drops out or ignores some neurons during training to reduce co-dependencies between them. By doing so, it helps in preventing overfitting and improving the generalization capability of the model. Apart from dropout, other popular regularization techniques include L1 and L2 regularizations, early stopping, and weight decay. However, the context does not explicitly mention the use of any other regularization methods apart from dropout. Therefore, we can only confirm the use of dropout as a regularization method in the given context.
