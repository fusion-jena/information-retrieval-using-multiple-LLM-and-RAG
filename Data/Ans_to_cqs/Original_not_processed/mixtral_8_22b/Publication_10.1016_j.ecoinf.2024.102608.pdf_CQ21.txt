exploring the parameter space using randomized grid search methods 
(Bergstra and Bengio, 2012). This approach helps strike a balance be-
tween model complexity and the dataset, reducing the risk of overfitting. 
This studyâ€™s main research objectives are as follows: to demonstrate

we selected the set of hyperparameter values that resulted in the mini-
mum  MAE  and  RMSE,  as  well  as  the  highest  R2,  for  each  machine 
learning model. Table 1 presents the resulting hyperparameter values 
for the four machine learning models.

randomly selecting a subset of the parameter grid to explore (Bergstra 
and  Bengio,  2012).  Instead  of  exhaustively  searching  through  all 
possible combinations of hyperparameters, which can be computation-
ally  expensive  and  time-consuming,  randomized  grid  search  offers 
several  advantages, like,  reduces computational cost, especially when 
dealing with a large number of hyperparameters, and it has been shown 
to find equally or more optimal solutions than an exhaustive grid search, 
particularly  when  some  hyperparameters  are  more  influential  than 
others (Bergstra and Bengio, 2012; Lee et al., 2022). We then generated 
various  cases  by  combining  hyperparameter  values  extracted  from  a 
uniform distribution and evaluated their performance. Table S4 in the 
supplementary file summarizes the hyperparameters, their ranges, and 
the intervals used in the grid search. After the randomized grid search,

Helpful Answer:
After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the project. Some common postprocessing steps include:

1. Model evaluation metrics: Calculating various evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination (R^2) is essential to assess the performance of the trained models. In this study, the authors have chosen the set of hyperparameter values that result in minimum MAE and RMSE along with the highest R^2 value for each machine learning model.

2. Hyperparameter optimization: To improve the performance of the trained models further, hyperparameter optimization techniques such as Randomized Grid Search can be employed. The authors have utilized this method to randomly select a subset of the parameter grid to explore instead of exhaustively searching through all possible combinations of hyperparameters.

3. Visualization tools: Using visualization tools such as saliency maps can help understand how different input variables contribute towards the final prediction made by the model. However, there is no mention of any visualization tool being used in this study.

4. Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix is often used to evaluate the performance of classification models. Since this study focuses on regression tasks, a confusion matrix might not be applicable here.

5. Cross-validation: Performing cross-validation can provide insights into the generalizability of the trained models. Although not explicitly mentioned in the given context, cross-validation could potentially be one of the postprocessing steps carried out in this study.
