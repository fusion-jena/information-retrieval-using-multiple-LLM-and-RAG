penalization (GAM-NP) (Marra and Wood, 2011), and guided regular-
ized RF (RF-GR) (Deng and Runger, 2013). These algorithms are doing 
covariate selection at the same time as model fitting, allowing to account 
early-on  for  the  specificities  of  the  algorithms  and  the  multivariate 
context. Furthermore, they have a more reasonable computational cost 
and  limit  overfitting  compared  to  dredging  or  wrapping  techniques, 
such as backward or forward selection strategies. Moreover, the three 
target algorithms are covering a gradient of fitting techniques (tree- and 
regression-based) and flexibility levels (GLM: parametric, GAM: semi- 
parametric, and RF: machine learning). A key benefit is that their co-
variate selection results are generalizable enough to be used as input for 
other popular SDM algorithms, such as Maxent (Phillips et al., 2006) or 
Gradient  Boosting  (Elith  et  al.,  2008),  even  if  they  are  not  directly 
included in the initial procedure.

2. We introduce a two-step “embedded” covariate selection procedure aimed at optimizing the pre-
dictive ability and parsimony of species distribution models fitted in a context of high-dimensional 
candidate covariate space. The procedure combines a collinearity-filtering algorithm (Step A) with 
three  model-specific  embedded  regularization  techniques  (Step  B),  including  generalized  linear 
model with elastic net regularization, generalized additive model with null-space penalization, and 
guided regularized random forest.

By combining a collinearity-filtering algorithm with model-specific 
embedded regularization techniques, we demonstrated the abilities of 
the  two-step  “embedded”  covariate  selection  procedure  to  deliver  ac-
curate  and  parsimonious  SDMs.  Implemented  and  streamlined  in  the 
covsel R package, it offers an open and evolutive ready-to-use tool for 
automated covariate selection that was missing in the SDM field, with 
the potential to become the new standard by which to perform this step. 
Capable of dealing with covariate sets ranging from several tens to 
thousands of candidates, the covsel R package can be easily run on any 
local computer or high-performance computing cluster. Despite being 
available  for  several  decades  (Hoerl  and  Kennard,  1970;  Saeys  et  al., 
2007; Tibshirani, 1996), embedding techniques have been little used in 
SDM  studies.  One  of  their  main  benefits  compared  to  the  more

2.2. Step B: Model-specific embedding 

In Step B, covariates selected after Step A are used to fit models with 
embedded selection procedures. We use GLM with elastic-net regulari-
zation  (GLM-EN)  (Zou  and  Hastie,  2005),  GAM  with  null-space

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information about regularization methods used specifically in deep learning pipelines like dropout or L2 regularization. However, it mentions three regularization techniques used within the context of species distribution modeling:

1. Generalized Linear Model with Elastic Net Regularization (GLM-EN): This method uses a combination of L1 and L2 penalties during optimization, encouraging sparse solutions while maintaining stability. It helps avoid overfitting by reducing the complexity of the learned model.

2. Generalized Additive Model with Null-Space Penalization (GAM-NP): This technique involves applying a penalty to the null space of the model matrix, effectively shrinking coefficients towards zero without completely eliminating them. This approach allows for better control over the tradeoff between bias and variance, helping prevent overfitting.

3. Guided Regularized Random Forest (RF-GR): In this method, regularization is applied through guided feature selection and pruning of decision trees within the random forest ensemble. By controlling the growth and structure of individual trees, RF-GR aims to reduce overfitting and improve overall model performance.
