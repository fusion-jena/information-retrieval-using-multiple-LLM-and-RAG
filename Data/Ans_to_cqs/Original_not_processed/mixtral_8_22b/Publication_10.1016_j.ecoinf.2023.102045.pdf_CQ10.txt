Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Obviously,  open  source  code  is  always  in  motion.  As  an  example, 
concerning point (i), an image might also be gathered via screenshot and 
sent  to  R,  e.g.  based  on  standalone  software  like  flameshot  (htt 
ps://flameshot.org/).  Moreover,  additional  and  more  sophisticated 
methods to let a function distinguish between minima and maxima in a 
rainbow colour palette like Random Forest or neural networks can be 
implemented in the cblindplot package. 

Inspiring  R  packages  have  been  devoted  to  improve  mapping  of 
various scientifically sound response variables like biodiversity (F´eret 
and de Boissieu, 2020) or species distributions (Schuetz et al., 2020a; 
Schuetz et al., 2020b). Connecting the cblindplot package with such 
libraries  would  be  an  enormous  advantage  for  colour  blind  people. 
Hence, the authors of the present paper have contacted the developers of 
such packages to implement such function in their packages.

%Query
Query: "What is the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given text does not provide information about any specific deep learning pipeline or its corresponding code repository link. Therefore, it is impossible to determine the requested GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket link for this particular case.
