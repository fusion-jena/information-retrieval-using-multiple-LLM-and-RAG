consideration spatial dependencies within extensive datasets.

relationship between SSL descriptors (thickness, depth, density), treating them 
as observations of a real-valued spatial process.

In  this  study,  we  conducted  an  analysis  of  a  multifrequency  acoustics  dataset  acquired  from  scientific 
echosounders  in  the  West  African  water.  Our  objective  was  to  explore  the  spatial  arrangement  of  marine  or-
ganism aggregations. We investigated various attributes of these intricate biological entities, such as thickness, 
relative density, and depth, in relation to their surroundings. These environmental conditions were represented 
at a fine scale using a towed multiparameter system. This study is closely intertwined with two key domains: 
Fisheries acoustics techniques and functional data analysis. Fisheries acoustics techniques facilitate the collection 
of high-resolution spatial and temporal data concerning marine organisms at various depths and spatial scales, all 
without causing any disturbance. On the other hand, spatial-functional data analysis is a statistical approach for

To compare with the benchmark work Diogoul et al. (2020), we first 
modeled the layer descriptors by the environmental data, aggregating 
them through the mean. The aggregated variables are:

Helpful Answer:

Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no information about specific data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide general examples of common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. Data augmentation is often employed to increase the amount of training data and improve model performance. Some popular techniques include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, zooming, shearing, and brightness adjustment. These transformations help create new variations of existing data, making models more robust and reducing overfitting. Please note that the choice of appropriate data augmentation techniques depends on the nature of the problem and the type of input data being used.
