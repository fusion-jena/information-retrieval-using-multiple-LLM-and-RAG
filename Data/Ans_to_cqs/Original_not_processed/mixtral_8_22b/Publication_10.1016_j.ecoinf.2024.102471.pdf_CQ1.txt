4.3. Baseline models 

Hybrid  CNN-LSTM  is  an  architecture  that  combines  the  temporal 
modelling ability of the LSTM with the CNN ability to learn invariant 
features  (Ayadi  and  Lachiri,  2022)  (Yadav  and  Vishwakarma,  2020) 
(Ashraf  et  al.,  2023).  The  combination  of  Convolutional  Neural  Net-
works  (CNN)  and  Long  Short-Term  Memory  (LSTM)  has  the  major 
benefit of learning spatial and temporal data. CNN excels in extracting 
spatial elements like edges, textures, and forms from an input. Mean-
while,  an  LSTM  excels  in  extracting  temporal  data,  like  the  order  of 
words in a phrase or frames in a movie. By combining the two, a model

67%. R. Mohanty et al. (Mohanty et al., 2020) described identifying bird 
species  based  on  their  vocalization  or  call  by  the  spike-based  neural 
networks.  The  dataset  contains  the  vocalizations  of  14  different  bird 
species,  recorded  by  the  Central  Poultry  Development  Organization 
(CPDO)  in  Bhubaneswar,  India,  using  a  digital  recorder  and  a  unidi-
rectional microphone.

Wav2vec is one of the latest state-of-art models for Automatic Speech 
Recognition  and  other  audio-related  problems  (Boigne  et  al.,  2020) 
(Shibano et al., 2021). The architecture of the Wav2vec is based on the 
transformer's  encoder,  with  a  training  objective  like  BERT's  masked 
language modelling objective but adapted for speech instead of text. The 
self-supervised  way  of  training  allows  Wav2vec  to  pre-train  on  unla-
belled data, which is more accessible (Hendrycks et al., 2019). Later, the 
model can be fine-tuned on a particular dataset for a specific purpose. 
This  approach  shows  remarkable  improvement  in  the  model's  perfor-
mance, especially if the dataset size is very small with label.

As machine learning continues to advance, the process of identifying 
bird species can be automated by transferring the knowledge of experts 
in this field to a learning model. A recent study has shown that deep 
learning is an effective method for classifying birds based on their calls, 
such as processing large amounts of audio data, which allows it to detect 
subtle  differences  between  bird's  calls  (Michaud  et  al.,  2023).  Addi-
tionally, deep learning models can be trained on a wide variety of audio 
data,  allowing  them  to  identify  even  rare  ecological  moment  of  bird 
species (Akbal et al., 2022). Transfer learning is an important tool in 
machine learning, allowing models to leverage the knowledge learned 
from  one  domain  and  apply  it  to  another.  Transfer  learning  is  very 
helpful when there is insufficient data to fully train a model, such as 
recognizing  uncommon  bird  species  (Huang  and  Basanta,  2021).

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide explicit information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer some possible methods based on the given information. For instance, in the case of identifying bird species based on their vocalizations, the raw data could have been collected using a digital recorder and a unidirectional microphone. This suggests that recording devices or sensors might be employed for gathering audio data. Additionally, the mention of a dataset containing the vocalizations of 14 different bird species implies that publicly available datasets could also serve as sources of raw data. Nonetheless, without further details, it is challenging to definitively determine all the potential methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
