5.2. Initial coral cover data 

The  initial  coral  cover  model  was  developed  using  a  TVAE  model 
from SDV, which is based on a Variational Autoencoder model. In this 
model,  an  encoder  maps  the  original  data  to  distributions  in  a  lower 
dimensional latent space. Data is then sampled from the latent space and 
transformed back to the original space using a decoder. In the learning 
phase the decoder learns by finding a transformation with minimal loss 
between the original and final data distributions. This loss is quantified 
using the evidence lower bound (ELBO), which transforms intractable 
inference  problems  into  optimisation  problems  which  can  be  solved 
using gradient methods (Xu et al., 2019). 

The model learns the spatially dependent distribution of cover for 
each of the six species of coral modelled in ADRIA. The radially sampled 
latitudes and longitudes from the synthetic site data set are then used to

Helpful Answer:
Regularization methods are techniques used in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting, where a model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen test data due to its complexity. Two common regularization methods mentioned in the given context are dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a technique introduced by Geoffrey Hinton et al. (2012) that randomly drops out neurons during training, effectively creating a new network architecture for each iteration. By doing so, it prevents any single neuron from having too much influence on the output, reducing overfitting. Dropout rates typically range between 0.2 and 0.5, depending on the specific application.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights. This encourages smaller weights, leading to simpler models that generalize better to unseen data. The strength of the regularization is controlled by a hyperparameter lambda, which determines the tradeoff between fitting the training data and keeping the weights small.

Other regularization methods not explicitly mentioned in the given context include L1 regularization, early stopping, and batch normalization. L1 regularization adds a penalty term proportional to the absolute value of the weights, encouraging sparse solutions. Early stopping involves monitoring the performance of the model on a validation set during training and halting when the validation error starts increasing, indicating overfitting. Batch normalization standardizes the inputs to each layer, improving stability and convergence during training.

In summary, regularization methods such as dropout and L2 regularization help prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines by controlling the complexity of the learned models. Other techniques like L1 regularization, early stopping, and batch normalization further contribute to building robust and accurate models.
