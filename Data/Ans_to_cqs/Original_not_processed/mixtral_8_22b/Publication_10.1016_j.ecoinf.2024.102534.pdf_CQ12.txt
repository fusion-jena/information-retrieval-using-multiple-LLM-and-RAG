data  was  used  to  validate  model  predictions.  The  Area  Under  Curve 
(AUC)  evaluation  metric  and  True  Skill  Statistics  (TSS)  were  used  to 
assess  the  performance  of  model  predictions.  The  predictive  map  of 
current  and  future  areas  were  classified  into  unsuitable  (0–0.6)  and 
suitable  (0.6–1).  The  threshold  value  of  0.6  was  derived  from  equal 
training sensitivity and specificity. The suitable areas from the current 
prediction was compared to future predictions to estimate change over 
time. The predictive maps of four groups of orchids (lowland epiphyte, 
lowland  terrestrial,  upland  epiphyte,  upland  terrestrial)  during  three 
time periods (current, future (2100) using SSP 1–2.6, and future (2100) 
using SSP 5–8.5) were compared in order to identify the potential impact 
of  climate  change  and  land  cover  change  on  suitable  areas  for  each 
group. Predicted suitable areas and elevation ranges were used as spatial

%Query
Query: "What type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given information does not provide any details about the use of a deep learning model in the pipeline. Therefore, it is impossible to determine what type of deep learning model (such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer) has been employed in this study.
