bands had dGI values below 300. The training samples were incorpo-
rated as a GEE asset. When the algorithm is run in FIREMAP the results 
are visualized in the main screen as a categorized BA map, and the re-
sults can be exported to the user's Google Drive account in ESRI shapefile 
format for the region of interest.

Third, the training dataset was incorporated as an asset in GEE to 
perform  the  ML-based  PROSAIL-D  RTM  inversion  and  retrieve  the 
FCOVER  from  post-fire  S2  scenes.  The  RF  regression  algorithm  has 
become a highly-adopted alternative for this purpose in GEE due to its 
high computational efficiency (Campos-Taberner et al., 2018). There-
fore, we considered the implementation of RF regression in FIREMAP to 
build  the  relationships  between  the  FCOVER  and  the  corresponding 
reflectance  in  the  S2  band  configuration.  We  preserved  the  default 
values for RF hyperparameters except for the number of trees, which 
was set to 500 to improve computational efficiency in GEE. As in BA and 
fire severity algorithms implemented in FIREMAP, the FCOVER retrieval 
can be performed both for the user-defined region of interest and for the 
official fire perimeters of the EFFIS database. Similarly, the selection of

The  initial  version  of  the  BA  algorithm  implemented  in  FIREMAP 
involves  a  supervised  ML  classification  to  procure  a  BA  vector  of  the 
region of interest defined by the user. A data-mining approach using a 
large predefined training dataset (e.g. Gaveau et al., 2021; Ramo et al., 
2018)  is  adopted,  following  a  mono-temporal  perspective  relying  on 
atmospherically corrected, harmonized Sentinel-2 (S2) post-fire Level-2 
A scenes (COPERNICUS/S2_SR_HARMONIZED dataset in GEE from 2018 
onwards). First, we considered in this initial version the exclusive use of 
post-fire scenes to (i) minimize commission errors associated with land 
cover changes such as logging, harvesting or flooding in the post-fire 
period  (assuming  those  associated  with  shadows  and  water  bodies) 
(Chuvieco et al., 2019), and (ii) maximize the synergistic potential of S2 
near-infrared  (NIR),  short-wave  infrared  (SWIR),  and  red-edge  (RE)

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps may be involved depending on the specific application and requirements. These steps aim to prepare the data for optimal performance during the training process. Some common preprocessing techniques include:

1. Normalization: This involves rescaling the features so they have zero mean and unit variance. It helps ensure that all features contribute equally to the final output, regardless of their original scale. In some cases, other types of normalization like min-max scaling might also be used.

2. Scaling: Similar to normalization, scaling adjusts the range of feature values to prevent any single feature from dominating the others. For example, if one feature ranges from 0 to 100 while another ranges from 0 to 1, scaling can help balance these differences. Common methods include standard scaling and Min-Max scaling.

3. Cleaning: Data cleaning involves identifying and handling missing, invalid, or outlier data points. Techniques for dealing with missing data include imputation (filling in missing values based on existing data) or removing rows containing missing values altogether. Invalid data should be identified and either removed or replaced with valid entries. Outliers can be handled through various statistical methods, such as clustering or anomaly detection.

4. Feature engineering: This step involves creating new features from existing ones to better capture patterns within the data. Examples include polynomial expansion, binning, and encoding categorical variables.

5. Encoding: Categorical variables need to be converted into numerical form before being fed into a deep learning model. One popular method is one-hot encoding, where each category is represented as a binary vector. Another option is label encoding, which assigns unique integers to each category.

These preprocessing steps are not exhaustive but provide a general idea of what might be required before training a deep learning model. Depending on the problem domain and available resources, additional steps could be necessary.
