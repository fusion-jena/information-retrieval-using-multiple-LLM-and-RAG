we break them down into smaller patches. Specifically, in the training 
stage,  we  randomly  crop  square  patches  (experimenting  with  various 
patch sizes, namely 256, 320, 480, 640, and 800 pixels), and we apply a 
simple  augmentation  strategy,  flipping  the  patches  horizontally  and 
vertically with a 50% probability. On the other hand, during the vali-
dation phase, we divide the images of the validation split into regularly- 
spaced,  overlapping  patches,  using  the  same  size  employed  during 
training.  We  process  these  patches  individually,  reconstructing  the 
overall  output  by  combining  the  predictions  from  the  patches,  and 
subsequently, we calculate metrics over the complete image. For clarity, 
Fig.  2  provides  a  graphical  representation  of  this  procedure.  In  more 
detail,  for  the  solution  based  on  detection,  we  reconstruct  the  final 
global  output  using  non-maximum  suppression  among  the  bounding

training step  and  a test  split  with the  remaining eight images  for the 
model evaluation phase. Finally, it is worth noting that, even if we an-
notated only the pests belonging to the class “whitefly”, other insects 
were accidentally stucked in the traps, which represents an additional 
challenge  -  deep  learning  models  should  not  count  the  latter  insect 
species. Specifically, we found insects belonging to different orders, such 
as  Lepidoptera,  Hymenoptera,  and  Diptera  (about  21,  7,  and  113, 
respectively);  furthermore,  among  hemipterans  we  also  found  insects 
belonging to families of Psyllidae, Aphidae, and Miridae (about 4, 14, 
and  22,  respectively).  Besides, about  80% of  the  images contain  con-
taminants,  such  as  dust,  fluff,  or  leaves,  accidentally  glued  over  the 
sticky traps. Some samples of bycatches insects and contaminants can be 
found in Fig. 1 and Fig. 4.

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide explicit information regarding the use of specific regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, there are some indications of strategies that could potentially help mitigate overfitting. During the training stage, the authors mention applying simple data augmentation techniques, including random cropping of square patches and horizontal/vertical flipping with a 50% probability. These techniques can act as implicit forms of regularization, helping to reduce overfitting by increasing the diversity of the training dataset. Additionally, the authors discuss dividing the images of the validation split into regularly spaced, overlapping patches during the validation phase, which might contribute to better generalization performance. Nevertheless, without direct evidence of employing explicit regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization, one cannot definitively state their usage in this particular study.
