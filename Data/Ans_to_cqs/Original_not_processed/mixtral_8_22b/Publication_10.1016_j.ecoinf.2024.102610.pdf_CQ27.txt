%Query
Query: "What process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model (e.g., Model serialization, Platform selection)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not explicitly mention the process used to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a specific answer based on the given context.
