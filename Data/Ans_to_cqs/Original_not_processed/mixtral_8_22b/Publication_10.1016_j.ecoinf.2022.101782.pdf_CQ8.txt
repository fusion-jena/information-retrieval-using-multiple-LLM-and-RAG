5. Discussion 

In this study we developed a workflow which leveraged citizen sci-
ence data to extract further relevant records from social media posts in 
the  same  region.  The  workflow  functions  as  a  data  filter  enabling 
downsampling of an initially very large dataset into a human analysable 
subset - in our case containing 0.5% of the original posts. By massively 
reducing  data  volumes,  it  becomes  realistic  to  analyse  the  remaining 
data by hand to select true positives, with around one hour required for 
the  4000  or  so  candidate  posts  we  identified.  Our  workflow  thus  ad-
dresses  the  research  gap  identified  by  Burke  et  al.,  2022,  using  gen-
eralisable  methods  to  extract  target  data  from  various,  unverified 
sources to enrich data.

optimiser and a learning rate of 10
in the form of horizontal flip, 0.2 degree counter clock wise shear and a 
random zoom between 0 and 0.2 - all leading to 224 × 244 pixel RGB 
input tensors. Data was normalised to ImageNet mean values, and the 
pixels values were rescaled in the range of [0, 1]. Model training took 
roughly 4 days. The best model was selected based on minimal valida-
tion loss that occurred at epoch 448. This model showed a training loss 
of 0.256, a training accuracy of 0.899, a validation loss of 0.298 and 
validation accuracy of 0.891. We evaluated the red kite model perfor-
mance based on an independent test set of 2060 images (as described in 
3.3). 950 of these images were true positive red kites images and the
