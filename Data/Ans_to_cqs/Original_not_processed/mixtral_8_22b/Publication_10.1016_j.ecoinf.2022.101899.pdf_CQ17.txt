Halgamuge et al. (2020) focused on utilizing deep learning to esti-
mate the best optimizer selection methods for wildfire event predictions 
in Australia. They developed an algorithm to collect the data automat-
ically and analyzed six different optimizer models using deep learning 
technology. They concluded that this approach could predict a natural 
disaster, including wildfire events, by investigating historical environ-
mental  conditions  before  and  after  wildfires  occurred  using  the  deep 
learning methodology. Dowdy (2020) focused on demonstrating a sea-
sonal prediction system for wildfire event prediction in Australia. This 
measured  spatio-temporal  variations  and  seasonality  across  several 
datasets  and  utilized  this  methodology  to  predict  wildfire  events, 
focusing on the seasonal predictions using the 2019–2020 wildfire sea-
son  as  an  example  and  measuring  long-term  predictions.  Coen  et  al.

To consider the model uncertainty, the models given in Fig. 15 are 
considered  as  the  set  of  models,  Ψ  of  Section  2.2.2.  Then  the  BMA 
approach is implemented. Each model’s prior probability is set to 0.2 to 
give equal chances a priori. The resulting posterior model probabilities, 
P(m| D), and Bayes factors to compare the models are given in Fig. 15. 
Bayes factors can also be interpreted as the improvement in the proba-
bility of occurrence for a given model. This analysis provides insights 
into  which  model  is  most  impactful  in  predicting wildfire  occurrence 
probabilities  and  provides  evidence  on  if  forest  vulnerability  is  the 
dominant  predictor.  The  results  indicate  forest  vulnerability  as  the 
dominant predictor, as this model is 2.5 times more likely to occur based 
on the posterior odds. The model that includes forest vulnerability with 
mean  wind  speed  is  the  second  most  likely, with  2.3  times  improved

of the sampled forest that contains low vegetation health, hence, high 
vulnerability to wildfire, is measured.

as rivers and lakes, the sample area for our study only includes forested

Helpful Answer:
The papers by Halgamuge et al. (2020) and Dowdy (2020) do not explicitly mention any specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in their deep learning pipelines. However, some common regularization techniques used in deep learning include dropout, L1/L2 regularization, early stopping, and batch normalization. Dropout randomly sets a fraction rate of input units to 0 during training time, helping to avoid overfitting. L1/L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, encouraging smaller weights and preventing complex co-adaptations on training data. Early stopping stops training when validation performance starts degrading, while batch normalization scales inputs to have zero mean and unit variance, reducing internal covariate shift and improving generalization. These methods may or may not have been employed in these studies but are commonly used in deep learning applications.
