the  loss  function.  Moreover,  as  a  supervised  model,  it  operates  by 
modifying the weights and biases of the network’s neurons in order to 
minimize the gap between the anticipated output and the actual target 
values (Tiryaki and Aydın, 2014). The BP-ANN used here entailed an 
input layer with n co-variates, two hidden layers consisting of p hidden 
neurons, and one output layer having one output neuron. The selection 
of hidden layers and neurons was determined through a process of trial 
and error, aiming to optimize the network’s structure (Supplementary 
material 1). The ‘neuralnet’ package of R 4.1.2 software, mostly applied 
for training multi-layer perceptrons in regression analyses, was consid-
ered here for developing a BP-ANN model (Yang et al., 2018).

predicted variables, as well as assist in combining multiple data sources 
to improve overall prediction accuracy (Deb et al., 2017). In practice, 
ANN models have often outperformed other conventional methods with 
respect  to  prediction  accuracy,  processing  rapidity,  and  nonlinear 
problem-solving capacity (Tiryaki and Aydın, 2014; Yang et al., 2018). 
Conversely, the accuracy of ANN’s training process relies on the quality 
and quantity of the sample dataset (Yang et al., 2018). Moreover, the 
optimal  numbers  of  hidden  layers  of  an  ANN  model  depend  on  the 
problem itself and the over-fitting problem can occur at any instance 
(Tiryaki and Aydın, 2014). Therefore, repeated training and testing are 
necessary  to  develop  an  optimal  neural  network  and  attain  highly

regard owing to its greater accuracy in correlating and analyzing com-
plex datasets in a simulated environment (Tiryaki and Aydın, 2014). The 
backpropagation (BP) training algorithm based on the Rectified Linear 
Unit (ReLU) activation function was used here for training the devel-
oped ANN model since it was recognized as one of the most widely used 
algorithms  to  robustly  model  various  types  of  regression  applications 
(Datta et al., 2023; Tiryaki and Aydın, 2014). Structurally, any BP-ANN 
consists of 3 kinds of layers, viz. input layer, hidden layer with several 
neurons relating to intercept synapses and output layer. It is a technique 
for  quickly  computing  gradients  of  the  loss  function  with  regard  to 
network  weights  (Erzin  and  Cetin,  2013).  During  the  training  phase, 
these gradients become critical for updating the weights and minimizing

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is not explicitly stated. However, considering the information available, we can infer that the Back Propagation Artificial Neural Network (BP-ANN) model is being developed for regression analysis. This type of model is typically employed when dealing with complex datasets and aims to minimize the gap between anticipated outputs and actual target values.

The BP-ANN model consists of an input layer with 'n' covariates, two hidden layers containing 'p' hidden neurons each, and an output layer with one output neuron. The primary goal of this model is to modify the weights and biases of the network's neurons to reduce the discrepancy between predicted and actual outcomes.

Although the specific application or task for which this BP-ANN model is intended is not mentioned, it can be assumed that the model will be utilized for predictive purposes due to its use in regression analysis. Deep learning models like these are commonly employed for tasks such as forecasting, pattern recognition, and decision making within various domains, including agriculture, ecology, and environmental sciences.
