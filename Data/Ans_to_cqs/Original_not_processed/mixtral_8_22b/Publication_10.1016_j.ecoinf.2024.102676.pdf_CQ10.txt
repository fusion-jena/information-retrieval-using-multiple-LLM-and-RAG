Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

We  strongly  believe  that  the  utilization  of  professional  tracking 
combined  with  community  involvement  through  citizen  science  data 
collection  of  footprints  and  state-of-the-art  machine  learning  holds 
immense potential as an additional non-invasive method in the toolbox 
of every conservationist for monitoring endangered and elusive species. 
This integrated approach allows for the collection of valuable data from 
both experts and the general public, fostering a collaborative effort in 
wildlife conservation.

bicornis  and  Ceratotherium  simum)  Jewell  et  al.  (2001);  Alibhai  et  al. 
(2008), tigers (Panthera tigris) Sharma et al. (2005), tapirs (Tapirus ter-

et  al.  (2016).  These  methods  have  proven  effective  in  estimating  the 
minimum population sizes of targeted species, a finding corroborated by 
field studies Alibhai et al. (2022); Moreira et al. (2018); Jewell et al. 
(2020). Various classification techniques have been employed in these 
studies,  including  stepwise  discriminant  analysis  Palma  and  Gurgel-

To  further  enhance  the  Footprint  Identification  Technique  (FIT) 
method,  we  recommend  collecting  imperfect  footprints  when  high- 
quality  footprints  are  insufficient  during  field  surveys.  Instead  of  dis-
carding incomplete prints, we advocate using missing value imputation 
as  part  of  the  data  preprocessing  pipeline.  This  approach  preserves 
valuable data and improves the accuracy of FIT predictions when sub- 
quality footprints are included. Our findings are supported by a study 
using  deep  learning  models  to  classify  three  sympatric  otter  species, 
where a model trained on images of all qualities was only marginally 
outperformed  by  a  model  trained  on  high-quality  prints,  highlighting 
the  potential  of  utilizing  lower  quality  data  effectively  Kistner  et  al.
