3.2. Random forest model 

According to the parameter optimization results of the random forest 
(RF)  model,  five  training  samples  were  analyzed,  whose  importance 
scores (VI) were obtained by simulation, and the selected variables were 
sorted according to their scores. The results are shown in Fig. 3, in which 
the VI plots for the five samples are consistent; the scores of the selected 
10 variables were more than 20% VI, and showed a threshold of 30% VI, 
above which the variables assumed higher importance (Fig. 3). In the 
training  and  test  datasets,  the  intermediate  models  established  by  RF 
showed that the proportion of explained variance was between 91% and 
92%  (Table  4).  Further,  the  correlation  coefficients  between  the

2.2. Observation content and methods

and random forest model in machine learning were applied to simulate 
the  influence  of  environmental  factors  on  NAI  for  achieving  compre-
hensive analysis from both the linear and nonlinear points of view. We 
discussed the prediction ability of the models and the importance of the 
selected  variables  by  analyzing  and  comparing  the  results  of  the  two 
methods.  Further,  the  most  sensitive  factors  and  common  variables 
affecting  changes  in  NAI  concentration  in  the  two  models  were 
analyzed, and independent sample data were used to verify the relevant 
results, in order to reveal the key environmental factors affecting NAI 
and  the  contribution  potential  of  environmental  factors  on  NAI  more 
comprehensively and objectively, which provides a scientific basis for 
better understanding the NAI’s response mechanism to environmental 
factors  and  parameter  optimization  of  regional  ecosystem  process

2. Materials and methods

In order to ensure a similar process between the two methods, the 
same subset data were used to apply an RF. Before running the model, it 
was necessary to define two basic parameters in advance: the number of 
variables to try (M), and the number of trees to run (Nt), at each split. 
The parameter M was found through the internal RF function TuneRF, 
which  calculates  the  optimal  number  of  variables  starting  from  the 
default  value  and  finds  the  value  with  the  minimum  OOB  error  rate 
below and above the threshold value (i.e., one-third of the total number 
of  variables  for  regression).  The  function  looks  below  and  above  this 
threshold for the value with the minimum OOB error rate. Typically, the 
value  of  M  in  the  RF  model  is  largely  based  on  empirical  formula. 
However, in this study, the alternate method of successive screening was 
used to determine the optimal parameter M, which attempts to take all

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be taken to improve its performance. These may include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing or correcting any inconsistencies, errors, or missing values in the dataset. It also includes handling outliers, which could skew the model if not properly addressed.

2. Normalization/Standardization: This step scales numerical input features to have zero mean and unit variance. This is important because many machine learning algorithms perform better when numerical inputs are normalized.

3. Feature Scaling: Similar to normalization, feature scaling rescales the values into ranges such as [0,1] or [-1,1]. This is done to prevent attributes with larger numeric ranges from dominating those with smaller numeric ranges during the learning process.

4. Encoding Categorical Variables: Deep learning models cannot handle categorical data directly. Therefore, these types of data need to be converted into numerical form using techniques like label encoding or one-hot encoding.

5. Splitting Dataset: The dataset is usually divided into three parts - training set, validation set, and test set. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters, and the test set is used to evaluate the final model.

6. Data Augmentation: This technique is often used in image processing tasks where new images are created from existing ones by applying transformations like rotation, zooming, flipping etc. This helps increase the size of the dataset and makes the model more robust.
