4.3.3. Model evaluation 

In this section, the results of the deep learning model developed are 
presented. The model was trained to make day-ahead predictions of the 
three pollutants, but first, an appropriate evaluation metric had to be 
selected.  The  top  metrics  for  regression  problems  are  mean  squared 
error/root  mean  squared  error  (MSE/RMSE),  mean  absolute  error 

Fig. 12. A plot showing the model's training and validation losses against the 
number of epochs. It is worth noting that there was a gradual decrease in both 
losses  as  the  training  epochs  increased  which  indicates  that  the  model  was 
learning. Further training beyond 20,000 epochs would have either resulted in 
overfitting or no further drop in both losses.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not directly address the specific strategies used to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, including managing random seed values. However, it can be inferred that some common practices include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, employing techniques like cross-validation, and utilizing ensemble models to reduce variance caused by randomness. Additionally, hyperparameter tuning and regularization methods may also help manage randomness in deep learning pipelines.
