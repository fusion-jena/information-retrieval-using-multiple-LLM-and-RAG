WT-HMM using varying dataset sizes over 10 runs.

Sequel to training the two HMMs independently, HMM1 and HMM2 
are combined to form an ergodic-type HMM with 8 states and 4 mixture 
weights. One of the HMMs is represented by the first 1–4 states, and the 
other  HMM  is  represented  by  the  following  5–8  states.  Specifically, 
states 1–4 depict the waveform of blue whale vocalizations while states 
5–8  represent  the  noise  signal.  Subsequently,  the  feature  vectors 
extracted from the test datasets are updated using the trained Gaussian 
parameters to produce refined feature vectors. The V-alg employs these 
refined feature vectors, along with T  and π, to classify the test dataset as 
either blue whale vocalizations or noise. It is noteworthy that that the V- 
alg switches from states 1–4 to states 5–8 with equal transition proba-
bilities. Table 1 shows the parameters used for WT-HMM simulation.

Furthermore,  the  comparison  between  recording  months  provides 
valuable insights into the tradeoffs  associated with dataset size  selec-
tion. The superior performance of the WT-HMM in the 8 to 20-h dataset 
size  range  for  both  months  suggests  the  most  suitable  range  for 
achieving  high  accuracy.  This  finding  resonates  with  studies  empha-
sizing the importance of selecting appropriate sample sizes for effective 
model training (Kahl et al., 2021).

Fig. 7 shows the accuracy performance of the proposed WT-HMM, 
ANN, SVM, and SCD detectors for blue whale vocalization. The HMM 
detector shows an average accuracy performance of around 89.4% over 
10 epochs. This is due to the ability of the proposed feature extraction 
method to effectively capture the patterns in blue whale vocalizations 
from the data. Similarly, the HMM proves to be effective in modeling the 
underlying  hidden  states  that  represent  blue  whale  vocalizations.  For 
the  MLP  neural  network  detector,  each  epoch  involves  feeding  the 
training  data  through  the  network,  calculating  the  prediction, 
comparing it to the actual labels, and adjusting the weights and biases 
using backpropagation optimization techniques. The ANN detector fol-
lows  the  HMM  closely  with  an  average  accuracy  of  88.60%.  The 
consistent  accuracy  across  epochs  indicates  that  the  ANN  is  able  to
