training while 40% of the images were used for testing. In 
order to develop and compare the models for both datasets, 
we split the original 40% testing data into validation (20%) 
and testing (20%). So, the final distribution of the dataset 
was  60%  for  training,  20%  for  validation,  and  20%  for 
testing.

al.  [26]  ensembled  the  results  of  GoogleNet  and  VGG 
networks  to  obtain  an  accuracy  of  80.18%  on  a  validation 
dataset of the LifeCLEF 2015 dataset. A bagging ensemble of 
three ResNet152-layered CNN networks was used by Šulc and 
Matas  to  obtain  a  performance  of  78.8%  mean  average 
precision (MAP) on a Plant CLEF 2016 dataset [27].

INTRODUCTION

Bayes  (NB).  We  tried  two  different  probabilities  (all 
probabilities generated by deep learning models and the mean 
of these probabilities) as training inputs for the meta-learners 
and investigated the impact of each one of them on the testing 
performance  of  the  models.  The  performance  of  different 
ensemble  techniques  was  compared  using  the  evaluation 
metrics.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it mentions several strategies commonly used in developing and comparing deep learning models for plant species identification tasks. These include splitting datasets into training, validation, and testing sets; employing various deep learning architectures like GoogleNet, ResNet, and ResNeXT with different configurations; and utilizing ensemble methods such as stacking and bagging. While these strategies do not directly address randomness due to factors like initial weights or random seed values, they contribute to improving model robustness and generalization. To manage randomness explicitly, common practices include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, averaging multiple runs with different seeds, or applying techniques like cross-validation.
