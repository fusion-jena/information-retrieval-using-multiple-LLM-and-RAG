Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, generally speaking, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and labeling or tagging. These techniques help in creating labeled datasets required for training deep learning models. The choice of technique depends on the specific application and the nature of the data being analyzed.
