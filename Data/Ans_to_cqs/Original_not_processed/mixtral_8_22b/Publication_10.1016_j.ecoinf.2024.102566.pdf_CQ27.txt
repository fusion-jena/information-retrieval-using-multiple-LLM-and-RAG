4.2. Downscaled forest biomass density 

4.2.1. Spatial distribution

field-collected data and machine learning methods on developing AGB 
models.  Moreover,  the  quality  of  training  samples  and  the  layout  of 
sampling  points  are  crucial  for  constructing  accurate  and  reliable 
models for biomass estimation (Morais et al., 2021). In this study, owing 
to  the  insufficiency  of  high-quality  training  samples,  we  employed  a 
method with low data dependency that integrates forest inventory data 
with remote sensing imagery for biomass estimation.

%Query
Query: "What process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model (e.g., Model serialization, Platform selection)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. It discusses the use of field-collected data and machine learning methods for developing Above Ground Biomass (AGB) models, but it does not mention any specifics regarding the deployment of these models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer based on the given context.
