Technologies to remotely collect large streams of environmental data 
combined  with  artificial  intelligence  techniques  create  a  unique  op-
portunity to accelerate and transform how we monitor biodiversity and 
evaluate the efficacy of restoration and conservation actions (Cavender- 
Bares et al., 2022; Galaz García et al., 2023a; Tuia et al., 2022), opening 
the  door  to  understanding  biodiversity  and  ecosystems  at  spatial  and 
temporal scales that would not be achievable through intensive empir-
ical data collection (Beery et al., 2022; Brown et al., 2022; Murray et al., 
2020). Indeed, machine learning (ML) applied to remotely sensed im-
ages has shown great promise in detecting and mapping the occurrence

Leveraging  cloud  computing  and  machine  learning  to  analyze 
remotely sensed data has great potential to create novel tools and fill 
crucial information gaps for invasive species monitoring. Particularly, 
when coupled with high resolution data, machine learning methods can 
be a powerful way to detect invasive species occupying a small fraction 
of the landscape and impacting critical and endangered ecosystems. The 
map of 2020 iceplant locations in Santa Barbara County is an example of 
such a combination of machine learning, cloud computing, and remotely 
sensed data analysis. This is the first ever map of iceplant at this scale, 
immediately  useful  for  restoration  and  conservation  efforts  in  Santa 
Barbara  County,  in  particular  in  the  Jack  and  Laura  Dangermond

Helpful Answer:
The sources cited do not provide explicit details about specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, they suggest that remote sensing technologies are employed for gathering large volumes of environmental data. For instance, Ustin et al. (2002) discuss using hyperspectral remote sensing for invasive species detection and mapping. Similarly, Prasai et al. (2021) mention utilizing Google Earth Engine Python API and NAIP imagery for land use and land cover classification. These examples indicate that satellite or airborne images could serve as primary sources of raw data in such applications. Additionally, Vali et al. (2020) review deep learning approaches for land use and land cover classification based on hyperspectral and multispectral earth observation data, further emphasizing the role of remote sensing in providing input data for these models. While the exact methodology for acquiring raw data may vary depending on the application, it appears that remote sensing plays a significant part in supplying the necessary data for deep learning pipelines in ecological studies.
