those conditions (Gutzwiller and Serno, 2023; Muckley et al., 2023). We 
expected that creating a mask to delineate the “area of applicability” for 
the trained model (Meyer and Pebesma, 2021) would successfully filter 
out a significant portion of regions lacking training data, particularly in

prevent  potential  performance  degradation  of  the  model  and  avoids 
overfitting, which can limit the ability to make good extrapolations to 
unseen regions (Duque-Lazo et al., 2016). In this study, we employed 
two common variable elimination techniques for random forests: 1) RFE 
(Recursive  Feature  Elimination,  Khun,  2022)  and  2)VSURF  (Variable 
Selection Using Random Forests; Genuer et al., 2022). In RFE, the user 
defines a termination condition for model performance, and the algo-
rithm  iteratively  removes  one  variable  at  a  time  while  evaluating  its 
impact  on  the  model’s  performance.  This  process  continues  until  the 
algorithm reaches the best predefined level of model performance. In 
this study, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was used as the termination 
condition. As a result, RFE retained all variables whose removal led to a 
deterioration in the best RMSE value. VSURF follows a three-step pro-

valuable  tool  that  relevant  organizations  can  effectively  leverage  to 
optimize and strategically deploy their surveillance efforts.

Helpful Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, based on the information available, it appears that the model may be used for predicting infectious diseases for biopreparedness and response. This is suggested by the title of the cited paper "Predicting infectious disease for biopreparedness and response: a systematic review of machine learning and deep learning approaches" (Keshavamurthy et al., 2022). Additionally, the use of two common variable elimination techniques for random forests - Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Variable Selection Using Random Forests (VSURF) - indicates that the model likely involves some form of feature selection or dimensionality reduction. Without further context, however, it is difficult to determine the specific type of deep learning model being used (e.g., convolutional neural network, recurrent neural network, etc.) or its exact purpose within the broader framework of infectious disease prediction.
