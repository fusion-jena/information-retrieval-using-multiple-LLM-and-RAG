For  numerical  scores,  we  examined  both  training  scores  and  vali-
dation scores to diagnose signs of overfitting. The training scores were 
calculated from the models fit on all 7331 grid cells. Their outputs for 
the area shown in Fig. 1a were compared to their true labels to compute 
the values. The validation scores of the models were calculated through 
a  10-fold  CV  using  one  fold  pattern  of  spatial-CV  feature  selection, 
shown in Fig. 2. The scores are the average of the 10 validation folds.

Fig.  1. The  training  area  and  target  prediction  area  visualized  by  grid  cell 
centroids.  Because  a  high-resolution  grid  was  used,  centroids  are  visible  as 
discrete points only at high latitudes, where the map projection exaggerates the 
inter-centroid distances.

centroids of the hexagonal cells is approximately 50 km globally. The 
dataset is available via (Mechenich, 2022). 

3.2. Climate datasets

Following this, forward feature selection (FFS) was performed. FFS is 
a  common  stepwise  selection  procedure  (Hastie  et  al.,  2020),  which 
begins with an empty model, and iteratively selects the next feature from 
the initial set which most improves model performance. Candidate lo-
gistic  regression  and  random  forest  models  were  evaluated  via  (1) 
random cross-validation (CV) and (2) spatial CV (Roberts et al., 2017), 
in which the full training dataset was partitioned into spatial blocks like 
those shown in Fig. 2. 

Because model performance estimated via spatial CV is dependent on 
the spatial configuration of the CV folds, the procedure was repeated 
over 100 random blocking configurations; those features selected most

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly state the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions that the training scores were calculated from the models fit on all 7331 grid cells, and their outputs for the area shown in Fig. 1a were compared to their true labels to compute the values. Additionally, the validation scores of the models were calculated through a 10-fold CV using one fold pattern of spatial-CV feature selection, shown in Fig. 2. These scores are the average of the 10 validation folds. From these details, it can be inferred that the completion of training might have been determined based on achieving satisfactory training and validation scores or reaching a certain number of epochs during the training process. However, without explicit information about the stopping criteria, it cannot be definitively stated what exact criteria were used to determine when training was complete.
