1. Introduction

Mining extraction has severe consequences for the environment,
causing drastic disturbance to ecosystems and landscapes. These dis-
turbances may include surface deformation, acid mine drainage, and soil
removal (Pietrzykowski et al., 2017). Each mining site, and sometimes
even a part of it, requires a separate assessment of habitat conditions to
develop detailed biological reclamation measures (Gastauer et al., 2018;
Pietrzykowski and Krzaklewski, 2010). In recent decades, researchers
have been proposing various approaches to the appropriate manage-
ment of areas degraded by human activity, such as brownfields. There
are many examples of how soil contamination affects biological systems
and ecological processes, including the leaching of heavy metals, acid-
ification of soil, and disruption of essential microbial communities
(Lecerf et al., 2021).

Therefore, it seems reasonable to test in the future more advanced
methods of data analysis for estimating soil moisture at the spoil heap. It
would be worthwhile in this context to test various methods of machine
learning or deep neural networks, which would perhaps allow to in-
crease the accuracy of prediction.

5. Conclusion

The study explored development spatial modeling for estimating
VWC on reclaimed spoil heap. This model is an integration of remote
sensing data (PlanetScope satellite imagery) and topographic indices.
