search  tests  various combinations of  the hyperparameters  identified in  manual  search and  trains the selected 
models to achieve the maximum possible accuracy through multiple iterations. Experimental analysis revealed 
that the Fine-tuned EfficientNetB0 model exhibited superior performance, achieving an accuracy of 99.12%. In 
contrast, the performance of the ResNet18 model was disappointing with an accuracy of 93.24%, while other 
models outperformed it.
