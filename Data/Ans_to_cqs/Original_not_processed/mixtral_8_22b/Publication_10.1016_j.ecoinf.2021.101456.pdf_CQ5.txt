dataset  recorded  at  a  different  location  and  was  gradually  expanded 
until  reconstructions  were  sufficiently  good.  In  order  to  visualize  the 
latent  representation,  the  size  of  the  bottleneck  of  the  model  (latent 
dimension) was limited to two. Details of the network architecture are 
reported in Table 1.

Given unlabelled input data consisting of N samples with F features, 
x ∈ ℝN×F,  the  probabilistic  encoder  of  a  VAE  maps  the  input  to  the 
posterior density p(z|x) over the latent variable, z ∈ ℝN×L. In practice, 
L << N and the encoder neural network approximates the true posterior 
density, p(z|x), with a multivariate Gaussian, qθ(z|x) ∼ 𝒩 (μθ, σ2
θ ). The 
decoder of a VAE reconstructs the input data from the latent variable 
and is given by the density function pφ(x|z). The encoder and decoder 
neural networks are parameterised by θ  and φ, respectively. The opti-
mization objective of a VAE consists of two competing terms and it can 
be shown to be (Kingma and Welling, 2014)

The  dynamic  β-VAE  was  evaluated  in  unsupervised  and  semi- 
supervised  modes  to  obtain  latent  representations,  which  were  clus-
tered using K-means (Lloyd, 1982). Their clustering performance was 
compared with the baseline methods: PCA, Kernel-PCA, HCA using the 
standard  implementations  in  sklearn  (Pedregosa  et  al.,  2011)  and  a 
conventional VAE on the same data. The encoder neural network qθ(z|x) 
consists  of  9  fully  connected  layers,  with  rectified  linear  unit  (ReLU) 
activation (except for the last layer). The encoder predicts the mean and 
the  variance  of  the  approximate  posterior  distribution.  The  decoder 
neural network pφ(x|z) is implemented with 10 fully connected layers 
and ReLU activation (except the last layer, which has sigmoid activa-
tion). The VAE uses a bottleneck L = 2 to create the latent representa-
tion.  The  model  layout  was  developed  on  a  independent  unlabelled

2.2. VAEs and β-annealing 

Variational  autoencoders  (VAEs)  consist  of  a  regularized  probabi-
listic  encoder-decoder  pair  and  are  some  of  the  most  powerful  repre-
sentation learning methods (Bengio et al., 2013; Kingma and Welling, 
2014). They have seen broad applications in generative modelling and 
unsupervised learning tasks.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention any specific dataset such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, we do know that the study involves a dataset that was recorded at a different location and gradually expanded until satisfactory reconstructions were achieved. This dataset was then used to train a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model, specifically a dynamic beta-VAE, for unsupervised and semi-supervised learning tasks. The goal was to obtain latent representations, which were subsequently clustered using K-means. These results were compared against several baseline methods, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Kernel-PCA, Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA), and a conventional VAE. Therefore, while I cannot provide the exact name of the dataset used, I can confirm that it was employed in training a VAE model for representation learning purposes.
