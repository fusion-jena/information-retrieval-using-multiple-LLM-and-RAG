Input:  

I.  A directory with trap image files (jpeg format), and a CSV file with 
bounding box information, one line per box. Each box is associated 
with  a  trap  image  file,  coordinates  (in pixels)  and  a  species  label, 
which  may  be  empty.  These  files  can  be  downloaded  from  the 
STARdbi database.  

II.  An empty output directory. 

Output: 
The output directory is populated with subdirectories whose names 
correspond to the insect species that occur in the CSV files. An additional 
“Unlabeled” subdirectory is also created. Each subdirectory is populated 
by insect images of the relevant species, extracted from the trap images, 
based on the bounding box coordinates and annotation. The names of 
the images include enough information (file name and coordinates) to 
uniquely  associate  them  with  the  CSV  line  from  which  they  were 

derived.

2.  A  web-based  pipeline  for  image  deposition,  minimal  annotation, 
visualization, and retrieval. The pipeline is already operational, and 
is described in the Methods section below.  

3.  An authorization system that assigns differential view/annotation/ 
edit  permissions  to  users,  regarding  different  sets  of  images  (e.g., 
permission to modify images in a specific project vs. in the whole 
database). The first and major role of this system is preserving data 
integrity. Yet the policy that it applies has important implications for 
its  usability  as  a  public  resource.  The  details  of  the  authorization 
system are presented in the Methods section. The controversial topic 
of policy is suspended to the Discussion.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:

The deep learning pipeline primarily uses image data in jpeg format. This includes trap image files and insect images extracted from these trap images based on bounding box coordinates and annotations. Additionally, the pipeline utilizes CSV files containing bounding box information, such as coordinates and species labels. While there is no explicit mention of other data formats like audio or video, the focus appears to be on visual data for insect identification and classification.
