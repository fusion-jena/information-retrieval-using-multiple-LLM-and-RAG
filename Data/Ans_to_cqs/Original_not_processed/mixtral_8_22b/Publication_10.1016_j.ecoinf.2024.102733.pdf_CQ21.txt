During training, the diffusion model is provided with a dataset
comprising trajectories of fixed length. Determining the appropriate
length of these trajectories is a non-trivial task, as it can significantly
impact the performance of the final model. To address this, we initially
plotted the histogram of the original trajectory lengths and extracted
statistics including the minimum, maximum, average, and median
lengths. The analysis revealed that the majority of trajectories have a
length of 13. Consequently, we established a standard trajectory length
of 13 for our model. After segmenting the trajectories into fixed lengths
of 13, we discard segments shorter than 6 detections. For segments with
6 to 12 detections, we replicate their data points until they reach the
required length of 13. Finally, we scale each coordinate of the fish
detection within the range of [(cid:0) 1,1].

training fashion, where the data labels are not utilized, the generative
model is frozen and detached and exclusively employed to extract fea-
tures for both training and testing data, following the representation
learning literature (D'inc`a et al., 2023; Franceschini et al., 2022; Kor-
omilas and Giannakopoulos, 2021; Paoletti et al., 2021d; Paoletti et al.,
2022a). These features are then used to train an MLP.

For the diffusion model, the starting point of the reverse process t has
a remarkable effect on the training and the performance of the classifier
(Karras et al., 2022; Tur et al., 2023a) (see also the corresponding results
in Section 5.2.1). The ideal choice for t is the one that retains the most
relevant information for the classifier. Herein, we found out that this
value corresponds to 4 or 5. The results indicate that utilizing SMOTE
leads to improved performance, with the best results achieved on the
test set created with t equal to 4 when other parameters are set as fol-
lows: batch size equal to 16, learning rate equal to 0.00005, and weight
decay set to 0.0001.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit details about any specific postprocessing steps performed after the model training such as generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, or creating confusion matrices. However, based on the available information, there are some general observations that could be made regarding potential postprocessing tasks.

After training the diffusion model, the optimal starting point 't' for the reverse process was determined by evaluating its impact on the classifier's performance. This suggests that the trained model might be used for classification purposes, which would involve computing various evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Additionally, since the context mentions using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), it implies that the dataset may contain imbalanced classes, making it necessary to calculate class-specific metrics and possibly generate a confusion matrix to better understand the model's performance across different classes.

Furthermore, the context discusses freezing the generative model and employing it solely to extract features from both training and testing datasets. These features are subsequently fed into an MLP for further processing. While no direct mention of saliency maps is present, the use of feature extraction techniques indicates that visualizing important regions contributing to the model's predictions through methods like GradCAM or LIME could potentially be part of the postprocessing pipeline.

In summary, although the given context lacks concrete evidence of specific postprocessing steps, it hints towards possible tasks such as metric calculations, confusion matrix generation, and saliency map creation based on the nature of the problem and the approaches mentioned.
