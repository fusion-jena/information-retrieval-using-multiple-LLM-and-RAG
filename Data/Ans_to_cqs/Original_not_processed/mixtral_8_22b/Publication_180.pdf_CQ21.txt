We  calibrated  our  models  for  Mexican  and  Brazilian  spe-
cies  using  different  numbers  of  training  steps,  and  considered  two 
factors  to  find  optima  for  training TensorFlow  (Fig.  2):  1)  correct 
identification rate, which improved up to a certain point, but then 
reached  a  plateau,  beyond  which  we  saw  no  significant  improve-
ment,  and  2)  processing  time  (in  hours),  which  showed  a  positive 
linear relationship with number of training steps. For the Mexican 
dataset, with 12 species, 2,000 emerged as an optimum number of 
training steps, which resulted in an 83.0% overall identification rate 
(Fig. 2); the largest gap between the processing time trace and iden-
tification  rate  occurred  following  this  number  of  steps. Above  this 
number of training steps, subtle improvements in identification rate

TensorFlow
TensorFlow is an open-source software platform (Abadi et al. 2016) 
that supports deep learning research and applications, having been 
released  by  researchers  at  Google  (Google  Brain  Team;  https://re-
search.google.com/teams/brain/).  We  adapted  and  configured 
TensorFlow  for  application  and  use  in  our  project  via  Python. We 
adjusted  two  parameters  from  their  default  values:  validation  per-
centage and number of training steps. Although the default setting 
for validation percentage was 10%, given small numbers of images 
available for some species, we had to increase this number to 16%. 
For number of training steps, although the default value was 4000 
steps,  we  explored  different  numbers  and  compared  the  results  to 
find  the  optimum  balance  between  computing  time  and  classifica-
tion efficiency.

were possible (up to 83.1%), but processing time was significantly 
longer  (7  h  instead  of  3.5  h).  Based  on  the  same  logic,  we  chose 
12,000 training steps as an optimum number for Brazilian species, at 
which we achieved an 86.7% overall identification rate (Fig. 2). The 
Brazilian data set had a plateau that was more obvious: overall iden-
tification rate barely reached a maximum 87.0%, yet processing time 
increased  from  30  to  80  h.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  amount  of 
time discussed above is only for training TensorFlow over all images 
in the reference library with multiple replicate analyses; for identifi-
cation of a single image, it only takes a few seconds.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps used after training the TensorFlow models. However, based on common practices in machine learning projects, several general postprocessing steps can be suggested. These may include evaluating the performance of the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score. A confusion matrix could also be generated to visualize the classification errors made by the model. Additionally, techniques like saliency maps might have been employed to understand how the model makes its predictions by highlighting important features in the input images. Nevertheless, without further details, these suggestions remain speculative.
