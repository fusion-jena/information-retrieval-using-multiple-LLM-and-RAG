2.2.5. Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) 

XGBoost  is  a  popular  tree-based  ensemble  learning  technique, 
belonging  to  the  family  of  Gradient  Boosting  Machines  (GBM).  It  is 
designed  to  handle  diverse  machine-learning  tasks  like  classification, 
regression, ranking, and custom objectives. Sequentially, XGBoost cre-
ates  an  ensemble  of  weak  learners,  usually  decision  trees.  Each  new 
learner  focuses  on  correcting  the  mistakes  made  by  its  predecessors. 
XGBoost is enhanced with its innovative optimization and regularization 
techniques,  which  improve  accuracy  and  reduce  overfitting  risks  (T. 
Chen  and  Guestrin,  2016).  Key  attributes  of  XGBoost  include  the 
application of regularization (it applies L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge)) in the

capability  to  deliver  better  performance  when  provided  with  limited 
datasets, which sets it apart from other algorithms like ANN (Y. Huang 
and Zhao, 2018). Nonetheless, it is worth noting that larger datasets can 
yield even better results. Kernel functions allow SVM to transform input 
data into a space with higher dimensions, making it possible to separate 
non-linearly separable classes. The Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel is 
the default choice for SVM in scikit-learn. However, alternative kernels 
such as the Sigmoid Kernel (SIG), Linear Kernel, and Polynomial Kernel 
(PL)  are  also  available.  Selecting  the  optimal  kernel  can  significantly 
enhance the accuracy of SVM classification. For our study, we opted to 
utilize the commonly employed RBF kernel, which is frequently used for 
SVM (Youssef and Pourghasemi, 2021).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not explicitly mention any specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, there is a reference to using a more advanced optimization approach that combines first-order gradients (loss function gradient) with second-order gradients (loss function curvature). While this description could potentially refer to methods like Newton's method or conjugate gradient descent, without further information, it is difficult to definitively identify the exact optimization techniques being utilized in the deep learning pipeline.
