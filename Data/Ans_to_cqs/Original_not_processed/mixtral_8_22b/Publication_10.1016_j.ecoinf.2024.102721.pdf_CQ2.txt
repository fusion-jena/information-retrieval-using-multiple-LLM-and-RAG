2.3.3. LSTM model

The LSTM model is a type of machine learning model that is derived
from recurrent neural networks (RNN). Its special memory unit effec-
tively addresses the issue of gradient vanishing and explosion in RNN for
long-term sequences. The structure of the model is illustrated in Fig. 3.
The LSTM memory unit comprises a forget gate, input gate, output gate,
and hidden layer. Signals are transmitted between different units
through three control gates in the hidden layer, determining which in-
formation should be stored, read, and written. Because of the precise
control of information by gate structures, LSTM can effectively learn in
long time sequences and is well-suited for time series prediction.

Where Φi is the SHAP value of feature i. The larger the SHAP value,
the greater contribution of the feature to the prediction; S is the set of
features; (S ⊆ N\i)denotes the subset that excludes feature i; N is the set
of all features; f is the prediction function of the model; f(S) is the pre-
diction result of the model on the set of features S; |S| denotes the
number of elements in set S.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention what specific data format was used in their deep learning pipeline. However, considering they were forecasting ecological water demand using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), we can infer that the data format used would most likely be numerical or tabular data such as CSV files. This is because LSTMs are typically used for processing sequential data like time series data, which often comes in numerical form. Additionally, since this study focuses on predicting ecological water demand, relevant variables could include historical water usage data, climate data, and other related factors, which are usually presented in numerical or tabular format. Therefore, while there isn't explicit confirmation, it is reasonable to assume that the researchers utilized numerical or tabular data formats in their deep learning pipeline.
