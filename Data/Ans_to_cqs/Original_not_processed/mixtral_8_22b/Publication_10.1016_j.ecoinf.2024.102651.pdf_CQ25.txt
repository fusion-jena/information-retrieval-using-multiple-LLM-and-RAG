tion and Transformer, effectively extracts richer semantic features (Xie 
et al., 2024). A network based on CNN and ViT modules classified mi-
croorganisms with an accuracy of 67.62% (Dwivedi et al., 2024).

CA-Hybrid network based on CNN and ViT (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) is 
constructed as the classification network to precisely categorize Cervi-
dae  localized  by  YOLOv7.  Within  the  CA-Hybrid  network,  by  intro-
ducing the CAM (Woo et al., 2018) in the CNN, the network was able to 
focus more on critical features, which boosted the generalization ability 
of the model. Finally, when utilizing the same classification network for 
both small  objects(pixels less than 32*32) and  medium objects(pixels 
between 32*32 and 96*96) to evaluate the influence of image size on 
classification performance, the medium objects achieved higher classi-
fication  accuracy  compared  to  small  objects  under  identical  network. 
Furthermore, by comparing the performance of our monitoring pipeline 
with  object  detection  networks,  the  effectiveness  of  the  pipeline  was 
demonstrated. The pipeline effectively resolves the issue of background

Compared with ViT, CNN has stronger local information extraction 

ability.  In  particular,  the  residual  structure  of  ResNet  connects  the 
different network layers via shortcut, which not only preserves the input 
features  but  also  addresses  the  degradation  problem  of  the  deep 
network, thus mitigating issues such as vanishing or exploding gradi-
ents. The residual structure can help the network to learn the features in 
the input image better, thereby improving the classification effect of the 
network. 

Different classes of objects of the same species have high similarities. 
To better classify objects, CA-Hybrid network is constructed for Cervidae 
classification, based on ResNet and ViT, with the integration of CAM into 
the residual structure of ResNet. The structure of the CA-Hybrid network 
is shown in Fig. 4.

assign varying weights to each channel to allow the network to focus on 
important  features.  Therefore,  the  CAM  in  CBAM  is  incorporated  the 
classification network. Additionally, CAM can enhance the transmission 
and  characterization  of  more important  features in  the  network, thus 
improving  the  feature  representation  capability  of  the  network.  The 
model structure of CAM is shown in Fig. 3. While ViT primarily extracts 
features  from a  spatial  perspective,  the combination  of  CAM and  ViT 
enables the network to better learn image features.

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in this context is classification. Specifically, it aims to accurately categorize Cervidae, a family of deer, using a hybrid network called CA-Hybrid. This network combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Vision Transformers (ViT), and Class Activation Maps (CAM) to improve its overall performance.

The CA-Hybrid network leverages the strengths of both CNN and ViT architectures. CNNs are known for their strong local information extraction abilities, while ViT excels at capturing global dependencies. By integrating these two models, the CA-Hybrid network can effectively extract richer semantic features, leading to improved classification results.

Moreover, the introduction of CAM within the CNN module allows the network to focus more on critical features, enhancing its generalization ability. This is particularly useful when dealing with different classes of objects belonging to the same species, like various types of deer, where subtle differences might be crucial for accurate identification.

In summary, the primary goal of this deep learning model is to classify Cervidae using a hybrid approach that combines the advantages of CNN, ViT, and CAM. This design choice enables the network to achieve higher classification accuracy, especially for larger images, and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed monitoring pipeline.
