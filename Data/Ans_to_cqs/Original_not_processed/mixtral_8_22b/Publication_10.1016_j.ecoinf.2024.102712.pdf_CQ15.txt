A flow chart depicting the methods used is shown in the Fig. 3. In the 
GEDI L4A footprint data, AGBD is reported for each algorithm setting 
group  AGBD  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  or  10.  The  l4_quality_flag  uses  a  beam 
sensitivity  threshold  of  0.95,  which  is  an  estimate  of  the  maximum 
canopy  cover  that  can  be  penetrated  considering  the  signal-to-noise 
ratio  of  the  waveform.  For  dense  tropical  forests,  Dubayah  et  al. 
(2021) concludes that the beam sensitivity threshold should be higher to 
minimize measurement error in the RH metrics. Thus, we filtered the 
GEDI  data  of  both  forests  based  on  the  beam  sensitivity  threshold  of 
0.98, meaning that shots with a beam sensitivity below the value were 
discarded.  The  shots  having  no  data  values  ((cid:0) 9999)  of  AGBD  values 
were also discarded. We selected only the footprints located on forest-
land  for  the  study  utilising  google  satellite  imagery  with  CRS  EPSG:

a second step, compare the GEDI footprint AGBD and the gridded (1 km 
× 1 km) AGBD product with AGBD values from the model developed.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about any specific optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). Therefore, it is not possible to determine what optimization techniques are being used in this case.
