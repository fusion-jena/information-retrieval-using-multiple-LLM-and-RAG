of 0.8287. We used the trained model to automatise the classiﬁcation of 500 more images
from the unlabelled training dataset, and we manually ﬁxed any mistakes. We repeated
this process of training, classiﬁcation and checking until all of the 7362 downloaded images
were labelled.

To avoid manual labelling of all 7362 downloaded images, we took a random subsam-
ple of 400 images and labelled them into “dam” or “not dam” and we trained a classiﬁcation
model on the labelled data. We utilised transfer learning by initialising an ImageNet pre-
trained ResNet34 model [30]. We applied an 80–20% split for training and validation
datasets, respectively. To help generalise the model, we used data augmentation with the
fastai get_transforms function [30] and the following arguments: “ﬂip_vert = TRUE” to
allow for vertical ﬂipping of images, “max_lighting = 0.02” to limit overly exposing the
images, “max_zoom = 1” to disable the zooming augmentation, and “to_fp16 = TRUE” to
reduce the memory load on the graphical processing unit (GPU). We set the batch size to
300 images and trained the model with a learning rate of 10−3 for ten epochs. At epoch 5,
we achieved an error rate of 0.1538 (15.38%) a validation loss of 0.4211 and a training loss

Brieﬂy, we sourced data on 1,694,675 farm dams from (1) the Surface Water map by
Geoscience Australia (N = 934,381), (2) the Department of Environment, Land, Water &
Planning of the Victorian Government (N = 429,398), (3) the Department for Environment
and Water in South Australia (N = 105,361), (4) the Department of Primary Industries and
Regional Development in Western Australia (N = 162,785), (5) the Department of Primary
Industries, Parks, Water and Environment in Tasmania (N = 61,897) and (6) the Environment
& Planning Directorate in the Australian Capital Territory (N = 853). For large farm dams
(>105 m2 in surface area), we removed those that appeared of natural origins (i.e., complex
shapes, jiggered borders) by retaining only those with simple and regular shapes, calculated

We trained our deep learning CNN on 7362 labelled images using the same parameters
detailed above, and we achieved an error rate of 0.1195 (11.95%) with a training loss of
0.3462 and a validation loss of 0.2847. We further ﬁne-tuned the model by unfreezing the
entire model and training at a 10-fold lower learning rate (10−4). The ﬁnal model achieved
an accuracy of 94.8% (error rate of 5.2%) with a training loss of 0.1397 and a validation loss
of 0.1446 with ten epochs (see confusion matrix in Figure S1).

2.2.2. Correcting for False Positives

Locations falsely classiﬁed as containing a dam (i.e., false positives, or commission
error) act to overpredict the real number of dams in Australia. Therefore, we calculated
the probability of false positives by using our deep learning CNN to analyse and validate
ca. 2000 dams in each State and Territory sampled from our compiled database. To do so,

Helpful Answer:
The authors use a combination of metrics to determine when training is complete. They monitor the error rate, training loss, and validation loss during the training process. In one instance, they mention achieving an error rate of 0.1538 (15.38%) after five epochs, along with a validation loss of 0.4211 and a training loss of 0.4211. However, it is not explicitly stated whether these values were used as stopping criteria. Later, they fine-tune their model by unfreezing the entire model and training at a 10-fold lower learning rate (10^-4). After ten epochs, they achieve an accuracy of 94.8% (error rate of 5.2%) with a training loss of 0.1397 and a validation loss of 0.1446. Again, it is not clear if these specific values were used as stopping criteria. Based on the information provided, it appears that the authors may have used a fixed number of epochs (ten) as a stopping criterion rather than relying solely on validation loss plateaus or other performance metrics.
