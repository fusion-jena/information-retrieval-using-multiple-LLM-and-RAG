2.1. Definition of concepts

EF is a measure of the biologically productive land and water area
required to support human consumption and absorb waste (Rees, 1995).
It encompasses both terrestrial and aquatic resources necessary to meet
demands at various scales—from individuals to nations—reflecting the
environmental impact of resource use and waste generation. Specif-
ically, the EF of arable land pertains to the area needed to sustain re-
sources derived from arable ecosystems, offering insights into human
demands on these productive environments over time and across spe-
cific regions (Passeri et al., 2013). Therefore, this study calculated CEF
from both productive and ecological perspectives to more comprehen-
sively reflect the pressure on arable ecosystems.
