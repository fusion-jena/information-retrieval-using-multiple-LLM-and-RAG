accuracy  limits  that  we  encountered  training  DNN  models  with  the 
detailed-labelled NIPS4Bplus dataset (Bravo Sanchez et al., 2021). We 
drilled down on the results using another high-quality model (BirdNET) 
and  compared  it  to  our  SincNet  trained  models.  For  that,  we  experi-
mented  with  dimensionality  reduction  of  embeddings  and  an  initial 
dimensionality reduction technique (t-SNE). We generated embeddings 
using  the  BirdNET  model  on  a  randomly  selected  40%  sample  of  the

DNN  are  algorithms  consisting  of  neurons  arranged  in  successive 
layers that apply computations based on learnable parameters (weights 
and  bias)  and  activation  functions  to  inputs  from  previous  layers, 
through to an output consistent with the training data. Different types of 
layers  (convolutional,  pooling,  flatten,  etc.)  may  combine  in  large 
numbers to create complex algorithms that are difficult to interpret and 
often referred to as ‘black boxes’ (McGinn et al., 2023; Stowell, 2022). It 
is virtually impossible to follow how they use millions of parameters to 
reach a particular decision for any given input. Consequently, there is an 

array of tools and procedures to try to understand some of their inner 
workings. Here, we focus on the improved utilisation of one technique 
referred to as “analysis of embeddings”.

4.6. Input selection in active learning 

Active learning enhances and facilitates the labour-intensive process 
of data generation, important in this field given the scarcity of labelled 
data or the need to generate training data to target certain species (Allen 
et  al.,  2021).  It  progressively  increases  the  training  data  by  selecting 
those  samples  most  likely  to  improve  model  performance  from  pre-
dictions that a model generates over unlabelled data. Iteratively training 
new models with additional labelled data selected from their predictions 
reduces  the  extent  of  manual annotation  (Shuyang  et  al.,  2020). In  a 
similar process as the example of Tolkova et al. (2021) discussed above, 
our proposed method of using model embeddings and dimensionality 
reduction to display model predictions in EV can contribute to selecting 
the best sample candidates for manual annotation.

3.4. Using embeddings to assist in model selection for classifying unseen 
data 

An important DNN technique is transfer learning using embeddings 
from an existing model to train new models on previously unseen data.

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses various techniques employed when working with Deep Neural Networks (DNN), including dimensionality reduction of embeddings and analysis of embeddings. These techniques could potentially help mitigate overfitting indirectly by reducing the complexity of the learned representations. Additionally, the text mentions the use of transfer learning, which involves leveraging knowledge gained from solving one problem to solve a different but related problem. This approach might also aid in preventing overfitting since the transferred knowledge often generalizes better to new tasks. Nonetheless, without explicit information about the use of regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding these specific techniques.
