average pooling layer of four ResNet18s are fed to a
MLP made of three fully connected layers of size: 512

4. Methodology

details with corresponding accuracies.

This study sought to design and train an algorithm based on deep
CNN architectures, in order to identify a selection of coralligenous
species or their broader taxonomical group, and to assess the biodi-
versity and ecological status of coralligenous reefs. We designed a
custom methodology, drawing on state-of-the-art architectures and a
large database of annotated photographic quadrats. More specifically,
we performed the following analysis

(1) Assess human annotation error on a similar problem in order to

establish a baseline performance;

(2) Train simple CNNs on different patch sizes and build an ensemble
network in order to improve performances with multi-scale pre-
diction;

(3) Train a LR on deeply learned features from intermediate layers to

improve performances and calibrate the ensemble network;

Query: "Where is the data repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information regarding the availability of the deep learning pipeline's data repository is not explicitly mentioned within the given context. Therefore, it cannot be determined where the data repository is located (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF). Further research would be required to find out about its location.
