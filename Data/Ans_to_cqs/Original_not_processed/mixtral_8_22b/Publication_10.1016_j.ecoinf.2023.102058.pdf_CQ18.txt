may cause improved model performance (Belgiu and Dr˘agut¸, 2016). A 
grid search was used to find the best ntrees (i.e., 500 trees).

PCR  is  a  linear  regression  model  obtained  by  combining  multiple 
linear  regression  (MLR)  and  principal  component  analysis  (PCA)  to 
suppress the problem of MLR methods facing the multi-collinearity be-
tween  variables  (Liu  et  al.,  2003).  PLSR  is  another  linear  regression 
method  that  projects  independent  variables  (X)  as  predictors  and 
dependent  variables  (Y)  as  responses  into  a  set  of  orthogonal  latent 
factors while maximising the covariance between X- and Y-scores (Wold 
et al., 2001). In RF, as an ensemble learning method, decision trees are 
trained and then a voting procedure is employed to combine the result 
obtained by each tree. Unlike the noise sensitivity of every single tree’s 
prediction outcome, uncorrelated trees combination will not yield that 
much noisy results. Furthermore, training data will be created by the 
bagging  approach,  drawing  sample  subsets  with  replacement,  which

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information on the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions that a grid search was used to find the best number of trees (ntrees) for the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, which suggests that cross-validation or similar techniques might have been employed to evaluate the model performance during this process. Additionally, the paper discusses other machine learning algorithms like Principal Component Regression (PCR), Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR), and deep learning algorithms, but it does not specify any particular strategies for monitoring their performance during training.
