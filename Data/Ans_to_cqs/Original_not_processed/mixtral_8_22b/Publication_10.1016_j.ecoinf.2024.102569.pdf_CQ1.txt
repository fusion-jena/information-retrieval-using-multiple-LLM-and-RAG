where species are observed outside of their suitable habitats, such as in 
cultivation or captivity contexts (Botella et al., 2018). These scenarios 
are  common  issues  in  crowdsourcing  data  analysis.  To  remove  such 
heterogeneous  observations,  the  time-consuming  manual  checking  by 
experts  is  required  (Belbin  et  al.,  2013;  Mesibov,  2013).  If  such  pro-
cedure is not fully executed, our proposed method is expected to miti-
gate  the  impact  of  heterogeneous  observations  and  achieve  better 
predictions than ordinary methods.

such as eBird, Pl@ntNet, iNaturalist, and Observation.org, available on 
the  Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), are accessible  for 
use. However, the analysis of PO data from such sources requires special 
attention, compared to PA data obtained through designed surveys, due 
to the potential for issues such as species identification errors and local 
over-aggregation of records.

Helpful Answer:
The authors do not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, they discuss two types of data - presence-absence (PA) data and presence-only (PO) data. PA data is typically collected through designed surveys, while PO data can be accessed from various online platforms like eBird, Pl@ntNet, iNaturalist, and Observation.org, which are available on the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). The paper also mentions that analyzing PO data from these sources requires special attention due to potential issues such as species identification errors and local over-aggregation of records. Therefore, it can be inferred that both survey-based collection methods and publicly available datasets are employed for gathering raw data in this study.
