Due to the lack of existing quality data, we set out to create our own data set for the purpose of
the project. The data set created is, in a deep learning context, still at a relatively small size. However,
testing the model under very diﬃcult circumstances and complex backgrounds still yielded good
detection capabilities, paving the way for future work.

3. Results

3.1. Training Evaluation

The model was trained for 350 epochs and evaluated using the scores precision, recall, F1, GIoU,
and mAP, as seen in Table 2. The scores are calculated from model validation data, consisting of
321 image tiles. The F1 score and mAP score are seen to follow each other closely, given indications on
the training at diﬀerent stages, the model quickly reached F1 and mAP scores of ~0.4, whereafter they
continue to increase but at a slower rate. At the end of the training, the model achieved the accuracy
scores of F1 = 0.530 and mAP = 0.557. The GIoU is steadily decreasing, indicating that the model is
becoming better at correctly locating targets.

Model training was carried out on a NVIDIA Quadro M4000 GPU with 8 GB of memory,
with a training time of 4.9 min per epoch. With the adaptive learning rate algorithms usually yielding
higher model accuracies than static ones [16], the Adam learning rate optimizer was chosen over the
static stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Both the basic SGD and its further adaptive developments are
popular in neural network applications [17], but given the ﬁndings of [18,19], which proved Adam’s
usefulness on relatively small datasets (less than 1000 images), the Adam optimizer is chosen for
the model of this study. Hyperparameter setting was completed based on studies who successfully
implemented Yolo in remote sensing cases. The author of the Yolo-based “Yolt” model [14] suggests
implementing the same hyperparameters as the Yolo model. The default parameters of YoloV3 are
0.001, 0.9 and 0.0005 for the learning rate momentum and weight decay, respectively, and we decided

Helpful Answer:
Based on the provided information, it appears that several measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. Firstly, despite the lack of existing quality data, a new dataset was created specifically for the project. This custom dataset, while relatively small compared to those used in many deep learning projects, was designed to test the model under difficult circumstances and complex backgrounds. This approach aimed to improve the robustness and applicability of the model across various scenarios.

Secondly, the model was evaluated using multiple metrics such as precision, recall, F1, GIoU, and mAP. These evaluation methods provide comprehensive insights into the model's performance, helping to identify potential areas of improvement and ensuring that the model can accurately detect objects within the dataset.

Thirdly, the choice of the Adam learning rate optimizer over the static stochastic gradient descent (SGD) was made due to findings suggesting that Adam yields higher model accuracies than static learning rates, especially on smaller datasets. This decision aligns with the goal of achieving high performance even with limited data availability.

Lastly, hyperparameter settings were determined based on successful implementations of YOLO in remote sensing cases. By adopting these proven configurations, the researchers aimed to maximize the effectiveness of their model and enhance its ability to generalize well to unseen data.

However, there is no explicit mention of specific techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting being employed in this case. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into subsets and iteratively testing the model on different combinations of them, while stratified splitting ensures that class distributions remain consistent across splits. These methods could have been utilized to further validate the model's performance and strengthen its generalization capabilities.
