This research utilizes six organoleptic parameters and applies them 
to seven fish species, serving as the standard for automatically classi-
fying fish freshness. The dataset, generated over 11 days, is employed in 
machine learning experiments. In the clustering process, we exclusively 
consider Euclidean distance as a metric, given the uniform data range. 
However, alternative distance metrics have not been explored, poten-
tially  influencing  the  quality  of  freshness  class  determination.  Future 
research possibilities may involve investigating the impact of different 
distance metrics on class groups. Each distance possesses distinct char-
acteristics,  leading  to  varied  cluster  patterns.  Additionally,  extending 
this work to include other fish species could provide a more compre-
hensive understanding.

where ai is the average distance from the i-th point to the other points in 
the closest cluster as i, and bi  is the minimum average distance from the 
i-th point to points in other cluster, minimized  over the clusters. The 
silhouette value Si  is set to 1 when the i-th point is the only point in its 
cluster.  The  values  of  the  silhouettes  are  between  (cid:0) 1  and  1.  A  high 
silhouette  value  denotes  a  point's  strong  affinity  for  its  cluster  and  a 
weak affinity for other clusters. The clustering approach is suitable if 
most points have a high silhouette value compared to points in other 
clusters within the same cluster. The Calinski-Harabasz criterion may 
also be referred to as the variance ratio criterion (VRC) (Cali˜nski and 
Harabasz, 1974). The Calinski-Harabasz index is calculated as:

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The paper by Jayasundara, J.M.V.D.B., et al., Dec. 2023 titled "Deep learning for automated fish grading" discusses the application of deep learning in fish grading but does not explicitly mention any specific optimization techniques used in their deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), or others. Therefore, based on the information available, it cannot be determined which optimization techniques were applied in this particular study. However, these are common optimization techniques often used in deep learning pipelines.

Unhelpful Answer:
I am unable to determine which optimization techniques were applied in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the paper by Jayasundara, J.M.V.D.B., et al., Dec. 2023 titled "Deep learning for automated fish grading."
