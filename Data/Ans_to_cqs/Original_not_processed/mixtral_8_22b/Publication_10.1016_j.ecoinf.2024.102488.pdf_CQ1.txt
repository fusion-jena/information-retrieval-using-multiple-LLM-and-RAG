2.2. Remote sensing data 

The  remote  sensing  data  utilized  in  this  study  encompassed  GF-1 

optical imagery, GF-3 SAR imagery, and MODIS NDVI imagery. 

The  GF-1  images  used  in  this  study  were  multispectral  images 
captured with a wide-format WFV camera. The GF-1 multispectral im-
ages have four bands of blue, green, red, and near-infrared with a spatial 
resolution of 16 m. The China Centre for Resources Satellite Data and 
Application (https://data.cresda.cn) was accessed to retrieve a total of 
21  GF-1  multispectral  images  (cloud  percentage  less  than  5%)  of  the 
study area in 2020 (Fig. 3). Due to the dense cloud cover, there was no 
applicable imagery for  the  months of June,  July, or August.  All  GF-1 
multispectral images were radiometrically calibrated, corrected for the 
atmosphere, and registered.

3.3. Feature selection 

This study used Recursive Feature Elimination and Cross-Validation 
(RFECV) to select the optimal features that could reduce the redundancy 
caused  by  multi-source  feature  datasets  and  improve  model  perfor-
mance. RFECV is a wraparound approach to feature selection based on

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, the method utilized for collecting raw data is remote sensing. Specifically, the study uses three types of remote sensing data: GF-1 optical imagery, GF-3 SAR imagery, and MODIS NDVI imagery. The GF-1 images are multispectral images captured with a wide-format WFV camera, having four bands of blue, green, red, and near-infrared with a spatial resolution of 16 meters. These images were retrieved from the China Centre for Resources Satellite Data and Application. The GF-3 SAR imagery and MODIS NDVI imagery are not explicitly described in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that these are also remotely sensed data, likely collected using satellite or airborne sensors. Therefore, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in this deep learning pipeline are remote sensing techniques, specifically satellite or airborne sensors capturing optical and SAR imagery, and vegetation indices like NDVI.
