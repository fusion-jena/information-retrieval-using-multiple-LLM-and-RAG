2.3. Field survey design

adequately represent the spatial heterogeneity of forest morphological 
characteristics  and  biomass.  However,  the  field  survey  is  time- 
consuming and resource-intensive (Viana et al., 2012).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
After a machine learning model has been trained, there are several postprocessing steps that can be taken to evaluate its performance and understand how it makes predictions. Some common postprocessing steps include:

* Saliency maps: These visualizations highlight which parts of the input data were most important for the model's decision-making process. They can help identify any biases or errors in the model's reasoning.
* Metrics calculation: Various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score can be calculated to quantify the model's performance on a given dataset. This helps determine whether the model is suitable for deployment in real-world applications.
* Confusion matrix: This table summarizes the number of correct and incorrect predictions made by the model across different classes. It provides insights into where the model might be struggling and what types of mistakes it tends to make.

These postprocessing techniques can provide valuable feedback for improving the model and ensuring that it meets the desired requirements.
