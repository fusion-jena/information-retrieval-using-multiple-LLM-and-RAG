Taking into account Congalton (1991) and Hay (1979), who suggest
at least 50 pixels per thematic class, we decided to implement an
alternative strategy. Instead of strictly distributing 196 training areas
among the 6 thematic classes, we chose to include pure training areas.
These well-identified areas should contain at least 50 pixels in total and
prominently represent the class of interest. This distribution was carried
out through simplified random sampling (Chuvieco, 2020), allowing us
to effectively capture variability within each class and improve the

%Query
Query: "How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no information provided about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. The given context does not mention any specific methods such as grid search or random search used for hyperparameter optimization. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this query based on the given context.
