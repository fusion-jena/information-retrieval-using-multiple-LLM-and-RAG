different modules of I3Net.  Unlike training the YOLO models without 
domain adaptation, a different learning rate scheme was implemented to 
train the I3Net modules. Considering the embedded noise in unpaired 
target  domain  images  may  adversely  affect  early-stage  training,  the 
initial  learning  rate  was  set  to  0.001  for  training  the  I3Net  modules, 
which  aimed  to  ensure  the  effective  learning  of  source-domain  infor-
mation, being less disturbed by the target domain images, and thereafter 
the learning rate was reinitialized to 0.01 to enhance feature adaptation 
to  the  target  domain.  Other  hyperparameter  settings  remained  as 
described in Table 2.

%Query
Query: "Which hardware resources are used for training the deep learning model (e.g., GPUs, TPUs)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which hardware resources were utilized based solely on this context.
