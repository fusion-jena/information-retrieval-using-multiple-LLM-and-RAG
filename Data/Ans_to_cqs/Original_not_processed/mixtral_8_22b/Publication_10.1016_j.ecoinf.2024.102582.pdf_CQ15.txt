5.4. Limitations and future studies 

Due to the limitations of data sources and classification methods (Jia 
et al., 2023), this may largely affect the in-deep understanding of various 
mangrove species status in China and globally. In addition, although this 
study  discussed  the  effects  of  governmental  policies  on  long-term 
mangrove  evolution,  it  was  still  difficult  to  quantify  the  contribution 
rate of policies on mangrove conservation and restoration. Future dis-
cussion  and  in-deep  study  of  quantifiable  policy  factors  as  well  as 
improved  image  resolution  and  machine  learning  approaches  toward 
accurate identification of mangrove species will be great significance for 
dynamic monitoring and evaluation of mangrove interspecies evolution. 

6. Conclusions

(2)  Training samples were created and landscape types were rapidly 
extracted. Google Earth Pro was used to randomly generate 1800 
sample points in the image of the study area for each year (300 
sample  points  for  each  land  cover  type).  These  sample  points 
were imported into the GEE application programming interface 
(API)  for  further  analysis.  The  samples  were  then  randomly 
divided into training and validation datasets at a 7:3 ratio. The 
random forest algorithm was applied to rapidly classify the land 
use types in the study area.  

(3)  Post-classification  processing  was  applied  to  the  images.  A 
manual  visual  interpretation  approach  was  used  to  correct  the 
image classification results for mangroves within a 10-km buffer 
zone extending inland from the coastline. This procedure effec-
tively corrected misclassifications between forest and mangroves 
resulting from “spectral confusion”.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The papers cited do not provide specific information about the optimization techniques used in their deep learning pipelines. However, common optimization techniques used in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). SGD is a simple yet effective method for optimizing neural networks by updating model parameters based on the gradient of the loss function with respect to those parameters. On the other hand, Adam combines the advantages of both momentum-based methods and adaptive learning rate methods, resulting in faster convergence and better performance. Other popular optimization techniques include RMSprop, AdaGrad, and Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG). Without explicit mention of the optimization technique used in these papers, we cannot definitively state which one was employed.

Based on the given context, there is no direct reference to any specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I am unable to provide a precise answer to the query.
