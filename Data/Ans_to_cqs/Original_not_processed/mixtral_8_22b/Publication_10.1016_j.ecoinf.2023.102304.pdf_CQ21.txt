recovers to the pre-fire stage. These data are used to verify the response 
of different indices to post-fire recovery.

Model Proportion for best fitting. Runge et al. (2022) optimized the LTR

MS defines the maximum number of segments used for fitting. RT 
(cid:0) 1 in this study) defines the threshold of the fast recovery event. 
(unit: yr
A  simple  disturbance-recovery  pattern  usually  consists  of  four  phases 
(stable-decrease-recovery-stable).  In  that  case,  an  MS  value  of  4  is 
appropriate to describe the temporal pattern and reduce the impact of 
noise in the time series. In a complex recovery situation, more segments 
may be required. RT has a value between 0 and 1. A higher value makes 
the model less likely to miss a fast recovery while more likely to cause a 
false positive error.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, based on general machine learning practices, some common postprocessing steps include calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., creating confusion matrices to visualize the performance of the classifier, generating saliency maps or heatmaps to understand which parts of the input data were most important for the model's predictions, and performing cross-validation to ensure the robustness of the model. Please note that these are general steps and may vary depending on the specific requirements and nature of the problem being solved.
