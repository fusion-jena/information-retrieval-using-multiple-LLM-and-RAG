need for a holistic approach to baseline and monitoring surveys to better 
understand  distribution  and  habitat  utilisation.  Further,  the  disparity 
between acoustic and visual localisations within a day demonstrates that 
reliance on acoustic methods alone for the detection of baleen whales 
may limit the voracity of results, particularly if the focus of detection is 
song.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the given information that one method used for data collection is acoustic tracking or localization, which involves detecting and recording vocalizations of baleen whales. This method is mentioned in relation to Table 1, where different song variants or patterns are listed along with their respective number of tracks and percentage of detections. Additionally, the text mentions the use of both acoustic and visual localization methods, suggesting that visual observations may also play a role in data collection. It is important to note that the context emphasizes the need for a holistic approach to baseline and monitoring surveys, implying that multiple methods might be employed for gathering comprehensive data. Unfortunately, there is no explicit reference to using public datasets or other types of sensors in this particular study.
