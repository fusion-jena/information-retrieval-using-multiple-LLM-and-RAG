Korea for model training and testing. TensorFlow (https://tensorflow.org (accessed on 24 June 2021)), which is an end-to-end open source platform for DL, was used to develop our species richness estimation model. In developing DL models, there are several hyperparameters that need to be tuned prior to training the model, but there are common sets of rules or heuristics governing parameter tuning. After iterative grid search parameter tuning, using a small subset of our data, 5 hidden layers (ùêáùëó,ùëó=1,2,‚ãØ,5) were used, and the number of neurons (n) in Remote Sens. 2021, 13, 2490

Abstract: The spatial patterns of species richness can be used as indicators for conservation and
restoration, but data problems, including the lack of species surveys and geographical data gaps,
are obstacles to mapping species richness across large areas. Lack of species data can be overcome
with remote sensing because it covers extended geographic areas and generates recurring data. We
developed a Deep Learning (DL) framework using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
(MODIS) products and modeled potential species richness by stacking species distribution models
(S-SDMs) to ask, ‚ÄúWhat are the spatial patterns of potential plant species richness across the Korean
Peninsula, including inaccessible North Korea, where survey data are limited?‚Äù First, we estimated
plant species richness in South Korea by combining the probability-based SDM results of 1574 species
and used independent plant surveys to validate our potential species richness maps. Next, DL-based

%Query
Query: "Where is the data repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information regarding the availability of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline mentioned in this context is not explicitly stated. Therefore, it cannot be determined from the given context where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It could potentially be found in one of the repositories mentioned in the query such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF, but without further information, it is impossible to provide a definitive answer.
