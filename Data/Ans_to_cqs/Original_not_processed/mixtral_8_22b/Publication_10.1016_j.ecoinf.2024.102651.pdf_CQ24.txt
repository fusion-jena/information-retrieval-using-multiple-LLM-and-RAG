tion and Transformer, effectively extracts richer semantic features (Xie 
et al., 2024). A network based on CNN and ViT modules classified mi-
croorganisms with an accuracy of 67.62% (Dwivedi et al., 2024).

Compared with ViT, CNN has stronger local information extraction 

ability.  In  particular,  the  residual  structure  of  ResNet  connects  the 
different network layers via shortcut, which not only preserves the input 
features  but  also  addresses  the  degradation  problem  of  the  deep 
network, thus mitigating issues such as vanishing or exploding gradi-
ents. The residual structure can help the network to learn the features in 
the input image better, thereby improving the classification effect of the 
network. 

Different classes of objects of the same species have high similarities. 
To better classify objects, CA-Hybrid network is constructed for Cervidae 
classification, based on ResNet and ViT, with the integration of CAM into 
the residual structure of ResNet. The structure of the CA-Hybrid network 
is shown in Fig. 4.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, including managing random seed values. However, it discusses a hybrid network called CA-Hybrid, which combines ResNet and Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures for improved feature extraction and object classification. This network incorporates Class Activation Mapping (CAM) within its residual structure to enhance performance further. While this approach doesn't directly address randomness management, it demonstrates how integrating different techniques can improve model efficiency and effectiveness.
