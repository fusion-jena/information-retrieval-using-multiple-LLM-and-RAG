6.3 Transferability

In this section, we show how to use our freshly trained model to label images that were taken in
another study site in the Ain county, and not used to train our model. First, we get the path to the
images.

fls <- list.files(path = "pix/pixAin",

full.names = TRUE,
recursive = TRUE)

Then we carry out prediction, and compare to the truth.

predicted <- character(3)
categories <- interp$vocab %>% as.character() %>%

str_replace_all("[[:punct:]]", " ") %>%
str_trim() %>%
str_split("
unlist()

") %>%

%Query
Query: "How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The code snippets provided do not contain information on how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether a method such as grid search or random search was used for optimization based solely on the given context. Further details would be required to provide a definitive answer.

Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The code snippets only demonstrate deletion of certain files from the 'valid/' directory and displaying the sample sizes of the training and validation datasets. There is no mention of any hyperparameter tuning methods like grid search or random search.
