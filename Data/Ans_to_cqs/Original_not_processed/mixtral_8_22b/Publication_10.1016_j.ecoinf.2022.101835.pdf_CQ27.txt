et al., 2016), and LightGBM 3.2.1 (Ke et al., 2017) libraries. In building a 
machine  learning  model,  the  structure  and  hyperparameters  of  the 
model must be determined, such as the number of decision trees and the 
depth of trees for RF models and the number of intermediate layers and 
nodes for ANN models. We optimized the structure and hyperparameters 
of the RF and ANN models using Optuna 2.10.0 (Akiba et al., 2019) with 
the  parameters  and  ranges  shown  in  Table  1  as  candidates.  For  the 
LightGBM models, we used Optuna's LightGBM Tuner (optuna.integra-
tion.lightgbm)  for hyperparameter  fitting.  The  performance of  the  al-
gorithms was evaluated by comparing the loss function (mean squared 
error (MSE)) of the optimized models. In addition, the mean absolute 
error (MAE) and the coefficient of determination (R2) were calculated 
for reference.

differences  were  not  significant.  The  optimized  ANN  models  did  not 
have any intermediate layers, and the model with the input layer fol-
lowed by the output layer was determined to be the best.

Next, the first flowering and full blossom dates for each station and 
year were calculated using the optimized models. Finally, the root mean 
square error (RMSE) was calculated for all observation sites to evaluate 
the overall performance of the optimized models, and the RMSE for each 
observation  site  was  calculated  to  evaluate  the  performance  of  the 
models for each site.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide details regarding the method of model serialization or platform selection.

Based on the given context, it appears that the authors focused on developing and optimizing their machine learning models (RF, ANN, and LightGBM) using various libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, and Optuna. They also mentioned evaluating the performance of these algorithms by comparing the loss functions (mean squared error) of the optimized models. However, there are no specific details about how they deployed the trained models after optimization.
