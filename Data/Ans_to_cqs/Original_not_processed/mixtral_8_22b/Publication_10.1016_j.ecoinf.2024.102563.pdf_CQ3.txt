Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it can be inferred that various data sources have been utilized for research purposes, including satellite imagery, geospatial data, and other forms of remote sensing data. These datasets may require different annotation methods depending on their nature and intended use. For example, object detection tasks might involve using bounding boxes to identify and locate objects within images, while semantic segmentation could employ pixel-wise labeling to classify each image component. The choice of annotation technique would depend on factors like the complexity of the dataset, available resources, and desired outcomes. Unfortunately, without more detailed information regarding the specific studies mentioned in the context, it is impossible to determine which annotation techniques were employed.
