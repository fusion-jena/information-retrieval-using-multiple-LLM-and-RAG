Training data were generated as batches of size (m, 256, 256, 3), where m is the batch size (m =
20 in our experiments). The batches consisted of sub-images of size 256 × 256 that were randomly
cropped out from the original satellite images presented in Table 1. We had a stream (internally, a
Python generator) of almost never repeated sub-images; these sub-images were combined into batches
and used for the neural network training. Satellite images for sites #1, #3, #5, #7–10 were used for
training and #2, #4, #6 for validation. Corresponding batches of mask data had shape (20, 256, 256, 1).
The network training assessment was performed on sub-images generated from image #2 (Table 1).
Images #4 and #6 were used for visualization and demonstration of the algorithm eﬃcacy.

Therefore, having a batch size of 20 and performing typically up to 1500 epochs for training the

network, we used almost 30,000 diﬀerent augmented images of size 256 × 256.

2.4. Artiﬁcial Neural Network Architecture

The problem of forest damage identiﬁcation is a semantic segmentation problem. Eﬀorts to solve
such problems have recently made signiﬁcant progress due to artiﬁcial neural networks of complex
architecture, which are closely related to a general term referred to as deep learning [55–57].

Semantic segmentation is a pixel-wise classiﬁcation problem aimed at determining the class of
the particular pixel of the image it belongs to. It is usually handled by means of convolutional neural
networks (CNNs). As was noted in the introduction, one of such CNNs is U-Net, which is of an
encoder-decoder architecture [58].

Helpful Answer:

The text does not provide explicit information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that satellite images were used for training and validation purposes. These images were divided into sub-images of size 256 x 256 and used to generate batches of size (m, 256, 256, 3), where m is the batch size. The corresponding batches of mask data had shape (20, 256, 256, 1). Additionally, the text refers to the use of ImageNet-2012 dataset for evaluating the performance of CNN design choices. Therefore, while the exact datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that satellite images and potentially ImageNet-2012 were utilized.
