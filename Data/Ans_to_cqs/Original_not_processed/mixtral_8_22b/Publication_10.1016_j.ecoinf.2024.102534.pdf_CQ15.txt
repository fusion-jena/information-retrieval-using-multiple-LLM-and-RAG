Variable importance analysis can be used to better understand the 
contributing factors that determine predicted suitable areas of each class 
of orchids in the future. In SSP 1–2.6 scenario, annual mean temperature 
and annual precipitation are two highest contributing factors affecting 
lowland  epiphytes;  annual  mean  temperature  and  precipitation  of 
wettest month are the principal predictors for upland epiphytes; annual 
precipitation  and  elevation  for  lowland  terrestrial;  and  annual  mean
