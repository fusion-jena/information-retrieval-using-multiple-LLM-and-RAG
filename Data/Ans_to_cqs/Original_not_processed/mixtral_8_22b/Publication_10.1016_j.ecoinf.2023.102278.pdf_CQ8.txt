(cid:0) 4 was finally 
chosen after comparing with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with the 
(cid:0) 4  and learning rate of 
(cid:0) 4, weight decay of 1.0⋅10
momentum of 1.0⋅10
(cid:0) 3. SGD was tested with the parameters as recommended by L.

Smith  (Smith,  2018),  but  achieved  a  1%–2%  decrease  in  accuracy 
compared to using the Adam optimizer. 

The  ResNet50  architecture  (He  et  al.,  2016)  was  modified  and 
trained with transfer learning using pre-trained weights from ImageNet 
(Smith,  2018).  Models  trained  with  transfer  learning  outperformed 
models trained with random weights with an increase of 4% in the F1-

bounding boxes, in the training dataset, are within this size. Examples of 
full resolution TL images and cropped images of insects may be found in 
A.

Here  Wl1  and  Wl2  represent  the  weights,  and  bl1, bl2  represent  the 
biases for the independent FC layer representation. We apply dropout

Query: "Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given information, there is no explicit mention or reference to the specific location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in this research. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct link or name of the repository where it might be hosted (such as GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket). It would be best to contact the authors directly or refer to their published work for more details regarding the availability of the source code.
