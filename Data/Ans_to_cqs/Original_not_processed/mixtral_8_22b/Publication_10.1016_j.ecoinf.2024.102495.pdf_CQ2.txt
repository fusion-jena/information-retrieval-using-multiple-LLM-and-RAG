The standard deviation values for each performance indicator were 
compared  to  determine  the  optimal  configuration  (Table  4).  Configu-
ration 8 was determined as the ideal parameter (number of bands: 60, 
number of frames: 40, hop length: 256, and length of the FFT window: 
1024)  owing  to  its  reduced  standard  deviation  value.  The  feature 
extraction parameters that yielded the best performance were employed 
during the feature extraction phase in the optimization process of the 
CNN  deep  learning  model.  The  model  optimization  outcomes  were 
derived  using  performance  criteria  identical  to  those  employed  to 
optimize  feature  extraction  parameters.  Fig.  9  illustrates  the  perfor-
mance evaluation of each model. Additionally, Model 1 exhibited the 
most favorable average performance outcome, with an 89.43% accuracy 
rate, 91.38% precision, 95.52% recall, and 0.816 F1-Score. The obtained

2.2.4. Convolutional network 

CNN  represents  an  algorithm  type  or  neural  network  model 
commonly used to process two or more dimensions of data with high 
complexity, such as images or sound data (Fernandes et al., 2021). A 
CNN consists of several parts, one of which is the feature extraction layer 
and the other is the fully connected layer (Albawi et al., 2017; Kim et al., 
2018; Navamani, 2019). In the feature extraction section, several com-
binations  of  convolution  layers,  activation  functions,  and  pooling  are 
used to extract features from the given input data. In the fully connected 
layer,  several matrix-merging  processes  and  output  mapping occur  in 
the  SoftMax  activation  function  layer.  Furthermore,  the  classification 
process occurs from the data processed in the feature extraction section.

2.2.3. Deep learning 

Once transformed into a matrix or vector, the results of voice feature 
extraction serve as the input for a deep learning algorithm. This algo-
rithm discerns patterns within the data, enabling it to make predictions 
based on these learned patterns, all without the need for explicit pro-
gramming (Fran√ßa et al., 2021; Navamani, 2019). A critical distinction 
between deep learning and traditional machine learning is the feature- 
extraction  process  during  classification.  Feature  extraction  from  data 
typically requires manual or human intervention in traditional machine 
learning.  Contrastingly,  deep  learning  models  are  designed  to  auto-
matically perform feature extraction.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:

The text mentions that CNN, a type of deep learning model, is commonly used to process two or more dimensions of data with high complexity, such as images or sound data. Therefore, we can infer that the deep learning pipeline discussed in this context uses both image and audio data formats. However, there is no mention of video or CSV data being used in this specific case.
