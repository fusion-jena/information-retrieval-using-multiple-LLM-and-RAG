Put Fig. 2 app here: a) 50 survey location data (black dots) for Short- 
billed Gulls (Larus canus) during May and June 2014 and 2015. b) 50 
survey location data (presence = purple dots, absence = green dots) for 
Short-billed Gulls (Larus canus) during May and June 2014 and 2015. 
These surveys are the model training data. 

Put Fig. 3: app here:a) U.S. Census blocks (in red) as well as 80 survey 
location  data  (black  dots;  presence/absence  surveys)  for  Short-billed 
Gulls (Larus canus) during May 2013. b) Presence (pink dots)/absence 
(green dots) for 80 survey location for Short-billed Gulls (Larus canus) 
during May 2013. These point data serve as the external model assess-
ment data.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The article utilizes multi-year fieldwork for collecting raw data in its deep learning pipeline. Specifically, it mentions 50 survey locations for Short-billed Gulls (Larus canus) during May and June 2014 and 2015, which served as the model training data. Additionally, there were 80 survey locations for Short-billed Gulls during May 2013, used as external model assessment data. The article also references using Geographic Information System (GIS) data from various sources such as Fairbanks Borough GIS, ARCGIS, Forest Layer Tanana Valley State Forest, Alaska Clearinghouse, and Alaska US Census portal. However, it does not explicitly mention the use of sensors or public datasets.
