reduction reaching as low as (cid:0) 0.632 compared to the baseline. The most 
prominent disparity is observed in the boundary region, particularly in 
proximity  to  nearby  buildings.  The  Iteration  II  (Fig.  7c)  focuses  on 
increasing the density of trees to improve the restorative potential. Since 
the western and southern parts of the park already have sufficient tree 
cover, our primary focus is to intensify tree plantation in the northern, 
eastern,  and central  areas while aligning  with the  size  and  species of 
existing trees. The change resulted in slight improvements (Fig. 7h) in 
the restorative potential, particularly in the central areas. Iteration III 
(Fig. 7d) replaces some vegetation with water in the central area due to 
the park’s lack of water landscape. The results (Fig. 7i) also indicate a 
negligible impact, with the maximum difference from the baseline being 
just 0.05.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotating, scaling, etc. However, it discusses various studies related to landscape analysis and visualization using different methodologies including convolutional neural networks, computational simulations, and 3D modeling. These studies aim to assess and track landscape visual quality, extract and represent spatial attributes, and evaluate multi-spatial environmental performance. Unfortunately, there is no mention of any data augmentation techniques used in these studies.
