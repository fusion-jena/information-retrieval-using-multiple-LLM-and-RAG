Deep Learning. The architecture of our network follows the GoogLeNet’s
with 27 layers, 9 inception layers, and a soft-max classiﬁer. Once we have a list
of cropped thumbnails and their labels, we send them to our network. We use
inception layers (Fig. 4) based on GoogLeNet architecture [22]. The inceptions
here allows us to reduce the dimension of the picture to one pixel, and therefore
not to be dependent of the dimensional impact. We adapted some parameters
such as the size of the strides and the ﬁrst convolutions adapted to the size of our
thumbnails, which allowed us to achieve better results than a classic architecture
(e.g. [18]).

3.3 Post-processing and Bounding Box Fusion

For each sliding window, we deﬁne a motion score by computing the average
absolute diﬀerence with the window at the same position in the previous frame.
Based on the hypothesis that most of the ﬁshes are moving, we use this score
for the ﬁnal detection decision.

Finally, in order to improve the localization accuracy, we decided to create
another class called part of ﬁsh, to ensure that the network does not focus on
a distinctive part of a ﬁsh as a stripe, a ﬁn, the head, but processes the ﬁsh
as a whole. We also created a class ﬁsh which contains some unknown ﬁshes to
make the method able to recognize any ﬁsh even though it is not in the learning
database. However, this class must contain less samples in order to be sure that
a ﬁsh will most likely be labeled by its speciﬁc class rather than the generic class
ﬁsh. Finally, we added 3 classes to our initial thumbnail database as listed in
Table 2.

3.2 Detection/Recognition Pipeline

2.2 Deep Learning

Since the 2012 ImageNet competition, and new computational power accessible
through latest GPU, Neural Network came back as a strong possibility for clas-
siﬁcation tasks [18]. Moreover, by integrating convolutional layers, Deep Neural
Networks (DNN) are able to both create features vectors and classify them.

Neural network is a mathematical model which tries to mimic human brains
[19]. Like SVM, neural networks may classify feature vectors after a training
phase. A neural network is composed of interconnected nodes called neurons
and each neuron of each layer receives a signal from the neurons of the previous
layer. This signal is modiﬁed according to an activation function and transferred
to the neurons of the next layer.

We can deﬁne for the neuron n, the ﬁrst operation α(n) as:

α(n)(x(n)) =

c(cid:2)

i=1

i x(n)
w(n)

i

(1)

where x is the input vector, a given neuron, c the number of connections of this
neuron, w(n)
the input of rank i of
i
a neuron n.
