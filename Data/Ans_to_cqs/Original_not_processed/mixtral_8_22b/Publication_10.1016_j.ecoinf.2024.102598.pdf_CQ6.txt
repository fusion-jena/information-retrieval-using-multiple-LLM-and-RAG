Ensemble modeling capitalizes on the strengths of multiple models to 
enhance predictive accuracy, increase stability, improve generalization, 
provide  robustness  against  overfitting,  and  increase  model  interpret-
ability  (Ganaie  et  al.,  2022).  Combining  the  predictions  of  diverse 
models, ensemble modeling achieves more accurate and reliable results 
by  mitigating  the  risks  of  errors  and  biases,  resulting  in  stable  pre-
dictions that generalize well to unseen data (Ganaie et al., 2022). All the 
fitted models obtained from the five ML algorithms exhibited favorable 
performance measures. The AUC for all models surpassed 0.75, while 
the TSS exceeded 0.45. We used these results to build the final ensemble 
model,  employing  the  AUC-weighted  ensemble  method  (Achu  et  al., 
2021;  Tehrany  et  al.,  2019).  This  technique  utilizes  the  performance 
metrics to effectively combine the predictions from all models, ensuring

By default, we utilized the recommended parameters for all MLMs, 
except for Random Forest (RF), where we expressly set the number of 
trees to 500 as an additional parameter. A higher number of trees helps 
reduce  the  resulting  model’s  bias.  We  calibrated  and  validated  each 
model after fitting each MLM with optimized parameters using a 10-fold 
cross-validation (CV) design. For each run of the cross-validation pro-
cedure, we reserved 30% of the forest fire occurrence data as a valida-
tion  set,  with  the  remaining  70%  of  the  data  being  used  to  train  the 
model. This rigorous validation methodology was adopted following the 
method explained by Eskandari et al. (2021). The approach generated 
50 resulting models, consisting of 10 models for each machine learning 
algorithm.

over different periods (Huesca et al., 2009). Data mining techniques are 
another empirical model employed to extract valuable information from 
large  datasets,  enabling  the  identification  of  hidden  patterns  and  re-
lationships  between  variables  related  to  forest  fires  (Pourtaghi  et  al., 
2016). Simulation models are used to recreate fire behavior and spread 
under various artificially set conditions. They help researchers and fire 
managers  understand  how  different  factors  influence  fire  dynamics 
(Kanga  and  Singh,  2017).  Recent  advancements  in  machine  learning 
models (MLM) make them capable of handling complex datasets and can 
offer valuable insights into forest fire dynamics. Some of the works, like 
Gaudreau et al. (2016) have taken one step forward by modeling the 
wildfire in future climatic scenarios. They are proven to be reliable and 
efficient  means  of  determining  the  relative  critical  attributes  from

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved to ensure the quality and suitability of the input data. These steps may include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing or correcting any inconsistencies, missing values, or outliers in the dataset. It also includes handling categorical variables if present.

2. Feature Scaling: Deep learning models often perform better when numerical input features are scaled to a similar range. Techniques such as Min-Max Normalization, which scales the values between 0 and 1, or Standardization, which scales the values to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1, can be applied.

3. Encoding Categorical Variables: If the dataset contains categorical variables, they need to be converted into numerical form. One common encoding technique is One-Hot Encoding, which creates binary columns for each category.

4. Data Augmentation: In some cases, especially with image data, increasing the amount of available training data through augmentation techniques like rotation, zooming, flipping, etc., can improve the model's ability to generalize.

5. Splitting Dataset: Before training the model, it is essential to split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets. Typically, around 70-80% of the data is used for training, 10-20% for validation, and the rest for testing.

These preprocessing steps aim to prepare the data for optimal use in training a deep learning model, improving its overall performance and accuracy.
