Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

racy assessment requires these parameters to calculate the total number of 
training samples required for the image classified using Eq. 1.

Images were then classified out via Random Forest (RF). This is a 
specific  machine  learning  technique  based  on  the  iterative,  random 
creation  of  decision  trees.  First,  the  input  features  and  classes  were 
defined. RF calculates several random decision trees based on (1) the 
number of training samples and (2) the number of trees. The more trees 
there are, the more accurate the model is, but the longer the calculation 
time is. RF creates several decision trees randomly using the Gini coef-
ficient to split them. A model based on the decision trees is thus created 
and used to classify all the pixels. A pixel is classified according to the 
majority vote of the decision trees. The number of training samples was 
5000 and the number of trees was 500.

tion, the 20 m bands of the imagery were resampled to 10 m in order to 
harmonize all band data and ensure that the classification of images was 
adjusted to this resolution.

In satellite image analysis, the number of images used differs widely, 
from two  images per season (Carrasco et al.,  2019) or  two images per 
month (Malinowski et al., 2020) to 150 images per season (Nguyen et al., 
2020) or two images per land cover classification (Mohamed and El-Raey, 
2019). The literature reviewed concludes that with 2–5 images per year the 
success rate exceeds 70%. In addition, large-scale image processing re-
quires long computation times and high storage capacity. In this study, two 
images per year were selected, including the seasons in which the greatest 
variations take place in the vegetation, and specifically cloud-free (<2%). 
Finally, the type of land ownership in the study area must be high-
lighted:  it  is  characterised  by  smallholdings.  According  to  the  land 
register  (Ministerio  de  Hacienda  y  Funci´on  Publica,  2022),  the

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not explicitly state the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the context that the primary data format used is likely image data. This is because the text discusses the use of satellite images for analysis and mentions techniques such as image classification and resampling of image bands. Additionally, the use of Random Forest, a popular machine learning algorithm often applied to image data, further supports this assumption. Therefore, while not directly stated, it can be reasonably assumed that the main data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data.
