scale  served  as  a  supplementary  source  for  establishing  a  soil  sample 
database. Additionally, a 10-m spatial resolution digital elevation model 
(DEM)  was  used  as  auxiliary  data,  while  field  investigation  was  con-
ducted to obtain more precise soil information. 

2.3. Training sample set

We used Landsat 8 remote sensing images with a 30-m spatial res-
olution,  captured on  April  19,  2018, as  the  primary  data source.  The 
image data were sourced from the Geospatial Data Cloud (http://www. 
gscloud.cn). Two separate Landsat 8 images covering the entire study 
area were acquired. These images correspond to Path 120-Row 34 and 
Path 120-Row 35 of the Landsat Worldwide Reference System. Cloud 
coverage in the two images is 1.31% and 1.02%, respectively. The ac-
quired images comprised multispectral data that were geometrically and 
radiometrically  corrected. The two images were mosaicked using his-
togram matching. Finally, the images were processed focusing on the 
study area using clipping and projection transformation in ArcGIS 10.5. 
Legacy soil data provide a large amount of essential information for 
DSM  and  can  improve  soil  classification  speed  and  efficiency  while 
reducing costs. Consequently, a conventional soil map at a 1:4,000,000

Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not mention which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot determine if it was deployed on platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform.
