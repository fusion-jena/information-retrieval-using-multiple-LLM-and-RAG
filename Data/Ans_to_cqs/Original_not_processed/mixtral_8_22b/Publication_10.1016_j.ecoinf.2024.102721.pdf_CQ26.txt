Where Φi is the SHAP value of feature i. The larger the SHAP value,
the greater contribution of the feature to the prediction; S is the set of
features; (S ⊆ N\i)denotes the subset that excludes feature i; N is the set
of all features; f is the prediction function of the model; f(S) is the pre-
diction result of the model on the set of features S; |S| denotes the
number of elements in set S.

attention to the influence of extreme drought on oasis restoration within
the context of climate change. The complex structures and large
computational resources required for PBMs make it difficult to integrate
EWDP, meteorological drought, and oasis responses, hindering overall
modeling of oasis restoration under different water diversion and
climate change scenarios. Data-driven machine learning (ML) models
offer a potential solution as they do not consider complex interactions
between eco-hydrological processes but are capable of capturing highly
non-linear relationships between predictor and target variables (Chen
et al., 2022; Effrosynidis and Arampatzis, 2021). Generally, ML models
require less expertise and time to construct and often demonstrate strong
simulation performance that is challenging to achieve using PBMs
(Humphrey et al., 2016; Kratzert et al., 2018). In recent years, the long
short-term memory models
(LSTM) have exhibited unparalleled

where ρGreen and ρRed denote the surface reflectance of green and red

mid-infrared and near-infrared bands, respectively.

2.3.2. SG denoising filter

The SG filter fitting method is a commonly used weighted average
algorithm for smoothing time series data in data flow smoothing and
denoising. Its key characteristic is its ability to preserve the shape and
width of the time series curve while effectively filtering noise. This
method accurately captures the changing trend of vegetation index time
series, retaining local mutation information in the vegetation growth
process. Importantly, it is not constrained by the time and spatial scale of
the dataset and exhibits excellent denoising performance across various
sensor datasets (Savitsky and Golay, 1964).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. One such technique is stratified splitting, which involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same proportion of classes or labels in each set. This ensures that the distribution of classes remains consistent throughout the entire dataset. Another approach is oversampling, where additional instances of minority class samples are created to balance the dataset. Conversely, undersampling involves removing instances from the majority class to reduce imbalance. Additionally, diverse data collection can also help mitigate data bias by ensuring that the dataset includes examples from various sources, reducing overrepresentation of certain groups or categories. These techniques aim to improve the generalizability and fairness of the deep learning model by minimizing biases introduced through imbalanced or non-representative datasets.
