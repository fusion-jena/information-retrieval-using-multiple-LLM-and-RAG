on environmental covariates. Essentially, the sampling bias caused by 
the environment (variables) is presented by mapping the environmental 
space to the geographic space. Therefore, this study proposes that cor-
recting sampling bias in environmental spaces is beneficial yet requires 
further testing (El-Gabbas and Dormann, 2018). 

4.3. Method effectiveness

4.3. Method effectiveness 

As previously mentioned, when the sample size is small (n ≤ 70), the 
aggregation background method outperforms the filtering method. The 
filtering  method  seeks  to  create  a  uniform  sampling  pattern  in 
geographic and environmental spaces, thereby mitigating sampling bias 
(Bazzichetto et al., 2023). However, the loss of information from small 
sample sizes is less acceptable. Moreover, in areas with complex envi-
ronmental conditions such as Yunnan, filtering for presence points is not 
feasible. A study by Ten Caten and Dallas (2023) found that filtering 
samples could not effectively correct the bias. Nevertheless, our study 
indicates  that  geographic  filtering  remains  a  relatively  good  bias 
correction method for spatial clustering bias with large sample sizes. 

One  of  the  key  choices  when  using  presence-background  methods

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that various sources like surveys, sensors, or public datasets might have been employed based on common practices in machine learning applications. In general, these methods involve gathering relevant data related to the problem domain, which can then be processed and fed into the deep learning models for training and prediction purposes.

Unhelpful Answer:
The context does not explicitly mention any methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. It primarily focuses on discussing different approaches for addressing sampling biases in ecological studies, including aggregation background methods and filtering methods. These techniques aim to improve the accuracy and reliability of species distribution modeling rather than specifying how the initial dataset was obtained.
