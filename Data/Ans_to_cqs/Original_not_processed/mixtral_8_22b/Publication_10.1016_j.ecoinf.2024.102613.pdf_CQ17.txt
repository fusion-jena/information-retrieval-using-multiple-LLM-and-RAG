Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

24.  Which features will you need for data preprocessing?  

• Data deduplication (Eliminating excessive copies of data)  
• Data  cleansing  (Removing  incorrect,  corrupted,  incomplete 

data)  

• Data transformation (Changing the structure or format of data)  
• Data compression (Modifying or converting the bits structure 

of data)  

• I do not know  
• Not applicable  
• Other  

25.  In data processing, which one do you choose?  

• Using well-labeled training data (Supervised)  
• Combining  labeled  with  unlabeled  training  data  (Semi- 

supervised)  

• Using unlabeled training data (Unsupervised)  
• I do not know  
• Not applicable  

26.  What kind of data analytics do you need?  

• To know what happen (Descriptive analytics)  
• To know how something happen (Diagnostic analytics)  
• To know what will happen (Predictive analytics) 
• To  know  what  should  be  done  if  something  happens  (Pre-

scriptive analytics)

3.2.2.5. Data processing. In data processing features (see Fig. 18), data 
preprocessing aims to prepare and facilitate data processing operations 
(Salma et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2021). The data is cleaned, transformed, 
or  compressed  to  be  ready  for  the  analysis  stage.  Data  cleansing  is  a 
mandatory  feature  in  data  preprocessing,  while  other  features  are 
optional  and  depend  on  the  needs  or  purposes  of  data  analytics. 
Furthermore, in an agricultural system, it is common to see various types 
of  analyzing  the  data,  such  as  descriptive,  diagnostic,  predictive,  or 
prescriptive analytics. Hence, the system uses advanced analytics tech-
niques,  namely  geospatial  analysis,  mathematical  model,  statistical 
analysis, deep learning, and machine learning, depending on analytics 
types or purposes and users’ needs. The machine learning method has its 
own types to analyze the data and specific tasks to generate the analytics

2019; Zamora-Izquierdo et al., 2019) and then machine learning and, 
more  recently,  deep  learning  techniques  are  applied  to  analyze  the 
generated data (Perakis et al., 2020; Swain et al., 2020). However, the 
traditional  data  management  systems  are  inadequate  to  handle  the 
volume, velocity, and variety of the generated data by the sensors and 
IoT devices (Wolfert et al., 2017). Hence the advanced data management

analysis techniques such as geospatial analysis, statistical-based models, 
mathematical  models,  deep  learning,  and  machine  learning  when 
designing the smart farming system.

Helpful Answer:
The query asks about regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function during training. Two commonly used regularization methods in deep learning pipelines are Dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a regularization technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training. This helps to reduce overfitting by preventing complex co-adaptations between neurons. During each iteration of training, some percentage of nodes are dropped out, forcing the network to learn redundant representations of the input data.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of all trainable parameters. This encourages smaller weights, reducing the complexity of the learned model and helping to prevent overfitting.

Other regularization methods include L1 regularization, which adds a penalty term proportional to the absolute value of the weights, and early stopping, which stops training before convergence based on validation set performance. These methods can be combined to achieve better results.

In summary, regularization methods such as Dropout and L2 regularization are used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. Dropout ignores randomly selected neurons during training, while L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of all trainable parameters. Other regularization methods include L1 regularization and early stopping.

Based on the given context, there is no direct information regarding the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, this answer provides general knowledge about regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines.
