options, contribute to the stability of the search. Additionally, its effi-
cient standard marking system can remove low-quality pixels, thereby 
improving  search  quality  (Li  et  al.,  2023a,  2023b,  2023c,  2023d). 
However, L2gen requires an accurate understanding of aerosol types to 
obtain high-quality Rrs  retrieval, and the complex aerosols of PL make 
this practice less efficient.

artificial neural networks (ANN) (Men et al., 2022). The efficacy of these 
algorithms exhibits considerable variation across diverse aquatic envi-
ronments. For instance, the Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of 
Spectral  Hypercubes  (FLAASH)  model,  originally  developed  for  land 
pixels,  has  proven  effective  in  AC  for  aquatic  environments  utilizing 
Sentinel-2  and  SPOT-6  imagery  (Rotta  et  al.,  2016;  Li  et  al.,  2023a, 
2023b, 2023c, 2023d). Additionally, the FLAASH algorithm mitigates 
the  spatial  proximity  effect  by  employing  an  internal  pixel  averaging 
technique, which is essential for attaining high-quality AC (Wang et al., 
2021).  In  investigations  of  lacustrine  environments  using  Advanced 
Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) AVNIR-2 data, the efficacy of AC al-
gorithms  predicated  on  the  single  scattering  approximation  has  been 
significantly enhanced (Matsui and Kageyama, 2022). The Atmospheric

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions two potential sources of raw data: satellite images and in-situ measured data.

Satellite images are collected using various sensors with different central wavelengths and resolutions. The mentioned sensors include MSI and OLCI, which capture spectral channels such as blue, green, red, vegetation red edge, and near-infrared. These sensors have varying central wavelengths ranging from 490 nm to 783 nm and resolutions between 10 m and 300 m.

In-situ measured data refers to data collected directly from the environment or specific locations. Although the context does not specify how this data is gathered, common methods for collecting in-situ data include field surveys, sensor deployments, and manual measurements.

Based on the given context, we can infer that both remote sensing techniques (satellite images) and direct measurement methods (in-situ data) are employed for gathering raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
