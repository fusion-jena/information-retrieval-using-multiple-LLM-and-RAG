Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

3.1 Data Preprocessing

The choice of learning data is a crucial point. We worked with biology experts
of the MARBEC laboratory to label many videos. We cropped some frames of
the videos and created a training database composed of 13000 ﬁsh thumbnails.
The thumbnail size varies from a minimum of 20 × 40 pixels to a maximum of
150 × 200 pixels. Each thumbnail contains only one labeled-ﬁsh as shown on
Fig. 2.

We decided to keep only the species with more than 450 thumbnails. We also
widen the database by applying rotations and symmetries in order to capture
all the possible position of the ﬁshes. Table 1 lists the retained species.

Due to the highly textured natural background, we also added a class for the
background. This class is constituted with random thumbnails of the background
which were randomly selected in frames and speciﬁc background thumbnails
which were taken around the ﬁsh thumbnails.

Deep Learning. The architecture of our network follows the GoogLeNet’s
with 27 layers, 9 inception layers, and a soft-max classiﬁer. Once we have a list
of cropped thumbnails and their labels, we send them to our network. We use
inception layers (Fig. 4) based on GoogLeNet architecture [22]. The inceptions
here allows us to reduce the dimension of the picture to one pixel, and therefore
not to be dependent of the dimensional impact. We adapted some parameters
such as the size of the strides and the ﬁrst convolutions adapted to the size of our
thumbnails, which allowed us to achieve better results than a classic architecture
(e.g. [18]).

3.3 Post-processing and Bounding Box Fusion

For each sliding window, we deﬁne a motion score by computing the average
absolute diﬀerence with the window at the same position in the previous frame.
Based on the hypothesis that most of the ﬁshes are moving, we use this score
for the ﬁnal detection decision.

Finally, in order to improve the localization accuracy, we decided to create
another class called part of ﬁsh, to ensure that the network does not focus on
a distinctive part of a ﬁsh as a stripe, a ﬁn, the head, but processes the ﬁsh
as a whole. We also created a class ﬁsh which contains some unknown ﬁshes to
make the method able to recognize any ﬁsh even though it is not in the learning
database. However, this class must contain less samples in order to be sure that
a ﬁsh will most likely be labeled by its speciﬁc class rather than the generic class
ﬁsh. Finally, we added 3 classes to our initial thumbnail database as listed in
Table 2.

2.2 Deep Learning

Since the 2012 ImageNet competition, and new computational power accessible
through latest GPU, Neural Network came back as a strong possibility for clas-
siﬁcation tasks [18]. Moreover, by integrating convolutional layers, Deep Neural
Networks (DNN) are able to both create features vectors and classify them.

Neural network is a mathematical model which tries to mimic human brains
[19]. Like SVM, neural networks may classify feature vectors after a training
phase. A neural network is composed of interconnected nodes called neurons
and each neuron of each layer receives a signal from the neurons of the previous
layer. This signal is modiﬁed according to an activation function and transferred
to the neurons of the next layer.

We can deﬁne for the neuron n, the ﬁrst operation α(n) as:

α(n)(x(n)) =

c(cid:2)

i=1

i x(n)
w(n)

where x is the input vector, a given neuron, c the number of connections of this
neuron, w(n)
the input of rank i of
i
a neuron n.

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved. These steps aim to prepare the raw data into a suitable format for the model to learn effectively. While the specific preprocessing techniques depend on the nature of the dataset and the problem being solved, common methods include:

1. Normalization: This involves rescaling the values of the input features so they fall within a certain range, often between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. Normalizing the data helps prevent large-scale features from dominating the learning process and improves convergence during optimization.

2. Scaling: Similar to normalization, scaling adjusts the range of input features, usually by standardizing them to have zero mean and unit variance. Scaling ensures that all features contribute equally to the learning process and prevents those with larger scales from having undue influence.

3. Cleaning: This step involves identifying and handling missing, invalid, or outlier data points. Cleaning might involve removing such instances, imputing missing values using statistical methods, or transforming extreme values to bring them closer to the rest of the distribution.

In the case of the provided context, the authors mention working with biology experts to label many videos and creating a training database composed of fish thumbnails. They also discuss keeping only the species with more than 450 thumbnails and widening the database by applying rotations and symmetries. Although these actions do not directly correspond to traditional preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning, they still represent essential data preparation activities aimed at improving the quality and diversity of the training set.
