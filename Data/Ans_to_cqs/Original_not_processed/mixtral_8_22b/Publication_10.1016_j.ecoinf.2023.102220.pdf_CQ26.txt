in most comparisons while providing interpretability rather than being a black-box method. It is an improvement 
over current state-of-the-art machine learning tools, especially by non-specialists, such as ecologists aiming to use 
a quantitative approach for pest monitoring. We provide the implemented PBP method in Python through the 
pypbp package.

Table 2 shows that the PBP method is competitive with state-of-the- 
art  machine  learning  methods,  such  as  the  commonly  used  Random 
Forest (RF) algorithm. The criterion of a false positive rate of at most 0.2 
provides an accuracy of 91.0%, a false positive rate of 8% and a true

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention any specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, based on common practices in machine learning and deep learning pipelines, some possible techniques include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes or labels in both sets. This helps prevent overfitting and ensures that the model generalizes well to unseen data.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to balance datasets with imbalanced classes. Oversampling involves duplicating samples from the minority class, while undersampling involves removing samples from the majority class. These techniques can help improve the performance of models trained on imbalanced datasets.

Diverse data collection involves collecting data from various sources and perspectives to ensure that the dataset is representative of the population being studied. This can help reduce bias and improve the generalizability of the model.

Again, these techniques are not mentioned specifically in the given context, but they are commonly used in machine learning and deep learning pipelines to address data bias during preprocessing.
