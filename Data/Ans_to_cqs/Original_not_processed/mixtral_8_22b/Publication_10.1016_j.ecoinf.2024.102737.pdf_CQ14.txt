For the P6 measure, which takes the six best matches, the comparison
to a random process should consider a binomial distributed variable
with six independent Bernoulli trials (which are the six chosen best
matches), where the success probability for each Bernoulli trial is the
success probability for a random class choice. We then want to compute
the probability that this binomial distributed variable has value at least

their evaluation and the deduced follow-up experiments are described in
Section 4.

Still there are issues that should be considered before a specific
detailed framework can be designed. In order to decide on a feature
extraction and recognition detailed steps framework,12 initial experi-
ments were performed on the individuals labeled database. Since we
study a task that has not been studied before, we explore different as-
pects and several directions to tackle them, which naturally, most of
them are abandoned after evaluating the results. Nevertheless, these
initial experiments are important as a base case to study the conditions
that improve the performance, which is the focus of this paper. Based on
the literature survey our initial experiments referred to the following
issues to be decided for the chosen framework: architecture, data
augmentation usage, feature extraction enhancement and handling
different poses. The evaluation of the initial experiments results then
guided our design of the follow-up experiments. The initial experiments,
