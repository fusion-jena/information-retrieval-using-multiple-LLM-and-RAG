on environmental covariates. Essentially, the sampling bias caused by 
the environment (variables) is presented by mapping the environmental 
space to the geographic space. Therefore, this study proposes that cor-
recting sampling bias in environmental spaces is beneficial yet requires 
further testing (El-Gabbas and Dormann, 2018).

Query: "What are the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet)? "

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The paper does not provide information on the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the authors use a balanced, open-access, global dataset of vegetation plots from Global Ecology and Biogeography. Additionally, they reference other studies that have used various datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet, but these are not explicitly mentioned as being used in their own work.
