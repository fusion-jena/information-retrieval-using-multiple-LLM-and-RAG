5. Conclusions

The ongoing need for advances in Deep Learning techniques applied
to agriculture is driving research towards the development of cost-
effective models, robust to noise and variability, facilitating real-time
decision-making (Attri et al., 2023). Current frameworks are hindered
by their reliance on large datasets, limited interpretability, and chal-
lenges in generalization; they are deployed on personal computers,
which are inefficient and energy-intensive for practical applications.
Therefore, it is essential for emerging smart farming–oT initiatives in
agriculture to be supported by a new perspective in artificial intelligence
research (Abdar et al., 2021; Attri et al., 2023; Gupta et al., 2022).

An overview of the created neural networks architecture is shown in

Fig. 4.

In the MCD network we have two fully-connected hidden layers with
32 nodes each, ‘ReLU’ (Rectified Linear Unit) as activation function,
dropout rate equal to 0.1 (determined with a 10-fold Cross Validation
using both the training and validation subsets) and parameters initial-
ized using the GlorotNormal initializer of Keras.2 The optimizer is Adam
and the starting learning rate is set to 0.001. These implementation
details are summarized in Algorithm 1.

The Neural Networks were built from scratch, implemented using
TensorFlow (tf) (Abadi et al., 2015) and Keras (Chollet et al., 2015).
Coupled with TensorFlow, an open-source framework developed by
Google, Keras serves as a high-level Neural Networks API, offering a
seamless and user-friendly approach to building, training, and deploying
deep learning models. The MCD layers consist of a modification of the
Keras Dropout class, while the layers based on the VBI method derive
from the TensorFlow Probability (tfp) module (in particular, we used the
DenseVariational type of layers). These two architectures have the same
input and output layers, they differ for the structure of the hidden layers.
The size of the input layer depends on the problem we are facing: it has
two nodes, one for DOY and the other for GDD. As our focus will be on
dealing with regression problems, the output layer is actually a combi-
nation of a fully-connected layer (or Dense layer) with two nodes and a

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't any information available regarding the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context. However, some common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, shifting, brightness adjustment, contrast adjustment, and color space transformations. These techniques help increase the amount of training data and improve model performance by introducing variations into the dataset.
