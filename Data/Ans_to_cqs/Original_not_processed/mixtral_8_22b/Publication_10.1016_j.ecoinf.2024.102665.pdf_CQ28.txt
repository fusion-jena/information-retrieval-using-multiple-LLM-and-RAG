Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not specify which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model mentioned in the paper by Do, A.N.T., & Tran, H.D., titled "Combining a deep learning model with an optimization algorithm to detect the dispersal of the early stages of spotted butterfish in northern Vietnam under global warming." Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer based on the given context.
