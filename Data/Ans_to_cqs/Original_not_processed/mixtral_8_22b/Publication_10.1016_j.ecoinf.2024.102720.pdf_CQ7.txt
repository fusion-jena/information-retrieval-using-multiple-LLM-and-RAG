With the rapid development of multi-scale data and multi-method
coupling research, scholars have started to base their research on
qualitative (Chen, 2020), quantitative (Liao et al., 2021; Mu et al.,
2019), frequency (Lu et al., 2021), probabilistic (Zhao and Xu, 2020),
temporal (Shen et al., 2019), spatial (Zhao et al., 2022) and other multi-
scale data. Improvements in random forest (Jiang et al., 2021; Lian et al.,
2022), support vector machines (Hong et al., 2018), deep learning (Ren
et al., 2021; Wu, 2022), Bayesian networks (Che et al., 2019), and mixed
effects (Yu et al., 2021a) models for improved fusion, e.g., Gu et al. (Gu
et al., 2024) fused optimal parametric geoprobes with partial least
squares structural equations to analyze the effects of topography,
climate, and human activities on the spatial pattern of kNDVI. Research
in natural areas such as agro-land ecology has been performed in the
exploration of influencing factors of land use and agricultural systems

After the reliability and validity analysis, the fitness of the model fit
was tested using the data. To test the fitness of the model, we chose the
most commonly used model fit metrics where χ2/df represents the chi-
square value after considering the model complexity of 2.975, GFI
represents the goodness-of-fit index of 0.944, RMSEA represents the
approximate root-mean-square error of 0.089, the RMR indicates root
mean square deviation from 0.002, CFI indicates comparative goodness-
of-fit index of 0.913, NFI represents a normal goodness-of-fit index of
0.915, TLI indicates a standardized fit coefficient of 0.912, and IFI
represents a growth fit index of 0.929. All statistics exceeded the critical
value of 0.9 (Steiger and Vancouver, 1990) and met the criteria for
model fit with a high degree of goodness of fit, thus indicating an overall
fit of the SEM to the data.

We observed (Table 6) that the model provided in this study matches

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, common practices include splitting the dataset into three parts: training set, validation set, and testing set. The training set is used to train the model, while the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters during the training process. Finally, the testing set is used to evaluate the performance of the trained model. The proportion of each split can vary depending on the size of the dataset and the problem being solved. Common splits include 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing or 80% for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing.
