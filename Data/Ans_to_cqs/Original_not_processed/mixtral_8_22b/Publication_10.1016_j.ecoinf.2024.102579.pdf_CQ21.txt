1. Introduction

3.2. Forest inventory analysis 

The analysis of the large-scale forest inventory in the Kammer forest 
area partly confirmed the results of the sampling simulation (see Section 
3.1) and partly offered new insights. Given an average sample size of 7.8 
trees per sample point (as a result of the application of basal area factor 4 
(cid:0) 1)  the  rRMSE  values  are  lower  than  those  in  the  Hirschlacke 
m2  ha
forest area but slightly larger or approximately the same compared to 
those obtained from the Rosalia simulations (Figs. 3, 4 and 5A).

Similar to the simulation results we can clearly see that in terms of 
rRMSE the NN1 and NN2 estimators are the best choice for r and for R, 
the inventory, NN3 or NN4 estimators result 
whilst for M
in the lowest rRMSE values (Fig. 5A). The good performance of the in-
ventory  estimator  for  M
confirms  the  simulation  results,  whilst  the 
poor performance of NN3 and NN4 for U
is surprising and difficult to 
explain.

In 2006, a large-scale forest inventory based on relascope sampling 
(cid:0) 1  was performed in the Kammer forest 
with basal area factor 4 m2  ha
area (47.93 N, 13.60 E), a 750-ha forest district which is owned by the 
same  Pr¨amonstratenser  Chorherrenstift  Schl¨agl  in  Upper  Austria  that 
also owns the Hirschlacke forest area. A detailed description of the sites 
and the  location of the  forest area are given in Sterba  (2008). Trans-
formation to CCF had started here 40 years ago, i.e. the forest already 
has  a  considerable  degree  of  complexity.  Similar  to  the  Hirschlacke 
forest area, Kammer is dominated by Norway spruce but also involves 
silver fir and beech. The inventory included a total of 245 sample points, 
but only 169 were used in this study, as they included more than three 
sample trees as required by the diversity-index estimators NN1-NN4. In 
the spirit of plus-sampling, the first neighbour of each sample tree was

Helpful Answer:
After model training, several postprocessing steps may be involved depending on the specific requirements of the project. Here are some common postprocessing steps:

1. Model Evaluation: This step involves evaluating the trained model using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, etc. These metrics help assess the performance of the model and identify areas for improvement.

2. Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the predictions made by the model against actual outcomes. It provides insight into the types of errors made by the model and helps identify any class imbalance issues.

3. Saliency Maps: Saliency maps highlight the regions of input data that contribute most significantly to the output prediction. They provide visual explanations of how the model arrived at its decision and can aid in debugging and improving the model.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning: After initial evaluation, hyperparameters of the model may need to be adjusted to improve performance further. Techniques such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization can be employed to find optimal hyperparameters.

5. Ensemble Methods: Multiple models may be combined through ensemble methods like bagging, boosting, or stacking to improve overall performance.

6. Deployment: Once satisfied with the model's performance, it can be deployed to production environments where it will process real-world data.
