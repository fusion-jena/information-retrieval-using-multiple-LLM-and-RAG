The EF network architecture consisted of three convolutional layers (Conv) including the
Rectiﬁed Linear Unit (ReLU), two Max-pooling layers (MaxPool), and two Fully Connected layers
(FC), with a softmax layer at the end with two outputs, corresponding to “deforestation” and
“no-deforestation” classes. The ﬁlter and output size of each layer are summarized in Table 3.

For training the EF and SN models, we selected the following setup empirically: batch size equal
to 32 with 100 number of epochs, early stopping after 10 epochs with no improvement (over the
validation set) and a dropout rate of 0.2 in the ﬁnal FC layer. Additionally, Adam optimizer was
selected empirically with weight decay equal to 0.9 and learning rate equal to 10−3. As loss function,
we used the binary cross-entropy.

For the CSVM approach, the architecture comprised three convolutional layers, including ReLU,
each one followed by a Max-pooling layer. The output size of each layer is shown in Table 5.
In this method and for the baseline, the validation samples were added to the training set. For the
computation of the weights of the SVM ﬁlters, the multicore Liblinear software package [50] was
used. The parameter setup of the CSVM was: stride equal to one for the Conv and MaxPool layers,
12 SVMs used in each Conv layer. The training set was split in such a way that each SVM had the
same number of samples for both classes. The size of the mini-patches used for learning the SVMs
was equal to 3 × 3 × 16 for the ﬁrst convolutional layer and 3 × 3 × 12 for the second and third
layers. The estimation of the regularization parameter C for each SVM was performed using three-fold
cross-validation restrained in the range [10−1, 103].

Layer

Regarding the SN architecture, each subnetwork was also composed of three convolutional and
two Max-pooling layers. The output of each subnetwork was fed to a FC layer and later concatenated
in a single vector. In the end, a softmax layer generates the posterior probabilities for the classes

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The pipeline uses a deep learning model called Efficient Feature Network (EF). This model is based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. It consists of three convolutional layers, Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs), two max-pooling layers, and two fully connected layers. At the end, there is a softmax layer with two outputs, corresponding to the "deforestation" and "no-deforestation" classes. The filter and output sizes of each layer are detailed in Table 3.
