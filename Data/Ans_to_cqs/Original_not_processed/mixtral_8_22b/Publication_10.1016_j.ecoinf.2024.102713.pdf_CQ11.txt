Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

In the following, we disclose all the details of the main data platform 
components, starting with the presentation of all data sources (Section 
3.2.1)  and  continuing  with  the  integration  and  enrichment  processes 
(Section 3.2.2), the validation and loading processes (Section 3.2.3), and 
concluding with the analytical fruition (Section 3.2.4).

The validated data is then loaded to the Access tier through an in-
cremental  ETL (extract, transform, and load) procedure acquiring the 
validated data from the Harbor tier. 

3.2.4. Analytical fruition

perspective  (Bandh,  2021).  In  addition,  recent  research  on  the  social 
context of data linkage has focused specifically on the use of data re-
sources  and  technologies  to  challenge  harmful  models  of  intensive 
agriculture,  including  a  reflection  on  how  the  incentive  to  use  land 
intensively,  which  is  the assumption  of most  digital  technologies  and 
data collection systems, needs to be linked to a more critical perspective 
that  takes  into  account  the  ecological  damage  caused  by  agriculture 
(Leonelli and Williamson, 2023a; Leonelli and Williamson, 2023b).

The results of these integration and enrichment activities are mate-
rialized in the Harbor tier of the data platform, which provides an in-
tegrated and comprehensive view of the available data at the finest level 
of detail. The relational schema of the integrated data is discussed in 
Appendix A.2.
