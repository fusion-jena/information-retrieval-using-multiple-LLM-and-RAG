The pooling operator is connected after this layer for extracting the main features of a certain area, 
reducing the number of parameters, and preventing the model from over fitting. The maximum pooling 
with a 2 × 2 window and 2 strides is used in this layer. The pooling result is the data with the size of 56 
× 56 × 64.  

After pooling, the LRN (Local Response Normalization) is used to normalize the local response. 
The LRN enhances the larger response value and reduce the smaller response value. Thus, the LRN 
also can improve the generalization of the model. The output result of the LRN is the data with the size 
of 56 × 56 × 64.

AUC is Area under the Curve of ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics). The min-batch size 
is  the  number  of  samples  in  one  batch.  The  time  is  the  identifying  time  of  samples.  The  number  of 
layers is the number of convolutional and full connected layers, which can denote the complexity of the 
model. For obtaining valid results, the k-fold cross-validation (CV) is used to evaluate the algorithms 
and k is 10 in our experiments.

Figure 7 shows the relation between Min-batch size and Accuracy, Epoches. As we see in Figure 
7(a), when the Min-batch size is 128, the accuracy is the highest. This indicates the Min-batch size is 
relation to the accuracy of algorithm. In Figure 7(b), the larger is the Min-batch size, the larger is the 
number of epochs. When the Min-batch size is more than 256, the number of epochs is sharp large. The 
larger is the number of the epochs, the more is the consumed time when the algorithm converges. We 
also  can  see,  when  the  Min-batch  size  is  128,  the  accuracy  of  algorithm  is  high,  and  the  number  of 
epochs is relatedly small.

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it appears that the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Additionally, the use of k-fold cross-validation (CV) with k set to 10 is mentioned as a means of evaluating the algorithms and obtaining valid results. Furthermore, there is also mention of tracking the relationship between mini-batch size and both accuracy and the number of epochs required for convergence. However, without further context or specific details regarding the implementation of these strategies, it cannot be definitively stated what exact methods were employed to monitor the model performance during training.
