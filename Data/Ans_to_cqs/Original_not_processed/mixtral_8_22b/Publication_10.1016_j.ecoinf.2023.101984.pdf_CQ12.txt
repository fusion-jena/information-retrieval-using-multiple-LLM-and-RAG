%Query
Query: "What type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not explicitly mention the use of any specific deep learning model such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers in the pipeline. However, it mentions the use of the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) model for species distribution analysis. It should be noted that while MaxEnt is a machine learning algorithm, it is not considered a deep learning model like CNN, RNN, or Transformers. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot determine which type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline.
