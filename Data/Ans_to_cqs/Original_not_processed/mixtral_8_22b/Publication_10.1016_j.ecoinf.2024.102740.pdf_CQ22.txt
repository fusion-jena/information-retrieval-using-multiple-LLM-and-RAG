System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses (SAGA) software (version 9.4.0) (Conrad,

Gren Blue (RGB) images acquired in March, April, and May.In this study, the maximum 

shaft number value was tested from 1 to 100 and the minimum sample number from 1 

to 50. Finally, the most accurate results for RF were obtained when the maximum tree

1. Introduction  

Grasslands  are  among  the  leading  terrestrial  ecosystems  (Zhang  et  al.,  2022), 

occupying more than 40% of the world’s terrestrial area, a third of the agricultural area 

in  Europe,  and  storing  about  a  third  of  the  world’s  terrestrial  biomass  stock  (O‘Mara, 

2012; Stumpf et al., 2020 Bar-On et al., 2018; Erb et al., 2017).  

Moreover, grassland agroecosystems are of significant importance in the production of

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not directly mention any specific evaluation metrics used for evaluating the performance of a deep learning model. However, common evaluation metrics used for such models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, and confusion matrix. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of all predictions made. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made. Recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positives. The F1 score combines both precision and recall into one metric. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve plots the True Positive Rate against the False Positive Rate, while the Confusion Matrix provides a visual representation of the predicted vs actual values.
