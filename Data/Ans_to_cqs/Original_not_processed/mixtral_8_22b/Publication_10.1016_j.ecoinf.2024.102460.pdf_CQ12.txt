4.3.3. LSTM model 

The  long  short-term  memory  (LSTM)  model  is  a  common  deep 
learning model used to solve the prediction problem of time series data 
(Tang  et  al.,  2023).  Compared  with  traditional  machine  learning 
models, the LSTM model has better performance and ability to manage 
the  prediction  problem  of  time  series  data,  especially  the  long-term 
dependency  problem  and  multivariate  time  series  data,  and  has 
obvious  advantages  (Liu  et  al.,  2021;  Tang  et  al.,  2023;  Zhou  et  al., 
2023). Fig. 3 shows the prediction process of the LSTM model and the BP 
model.  This  study  compares  these  two  models  and  the  Markov  chain 
model.

Spatial reconstruction and scenario simulation of historical processes and future trends of land use/cover change 
(LUCC) can help to reveal the historical background of land conversion and the spatial distribution of future land. 
Moreover, there is a close relationship between the spatiotemporal dynamics of land use/cover and changes in 
different ecosystem services (ESs). Using this relationship to simulate future land use scenarios is important. In 
this study, an LUCC dynamic analysis framework (LSTM-PLUS-FMOP) was constructed based on a deep learning 
time  series  forecasting  model  (LSTM),  a  parallelized  urban  land  use  simulation  (PLUS)  model  and  a  fuzzy 
multiobjective programming (FMOP) model. The PLUS model was used to analyze the driving mechanism of land 
expansion and explore the land conversion pattern. In addition, three land conversion scenarios were established:

has the disadvantage of oversimplification and limited predictive ability 
with long-term and complex time series data. To solve this problem, we 
adopted  the  long  short-term  memory  (LSTM)  model  to  replace  the 
Markov chain prediction model and achieved significant advantages in 
prediction.  By  using  memory  cells  and  gate  mechanisms,  the  LSTM 
model  can  better  capture  the  nonlinearity  and  long-term  dependency 
relationships in time series data and improve the prediction accuracy of 
land conversion (Liu et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2023).

Helpful Answer:

The pipeline described in the given context uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, which is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The LSTM model is employed to address the prediction problem of time series data, specifically for land use change simulations in Lanzhou, China. It offers improved performance compared to traditional machine learning models, particularly when dealing with long-term dependency problems and multivariate time series data. The LSTM model replaces the Markov chain prediction model due to its superior ability to capture nonlinearity and long-term dependency relationships in time series data, thereby enhancing the prediction accuracy of land conversion.
