With regards to the difference between the results of the original, 
reduced,  and  augmented  datasets  applied  to  the  deep  learning 
model, we found that the original and augmented datasets are only 
under  a  few  specific  numbers  of  bands  and  data  formats  (e.g., 
VGG19 + 8band_256_8bit, VGG19 + 72band_256_8bit, ResNet50 +
8band_256_8bit, and ResNet50 + 36band_ 256_8bit). The classifica-
tion accuracy rate reached more than 50%, and there was no regu-
larity in the classification accuracy. However, the sampling action of 
reducing the data had a very obvious and consistent impact on the 
classification  accuracy,  especially  in  the  VGG19  model,  which  is 
more  similar  to  the  traditional  CNN  model.  This  representative 
sampling  action  resulted  in  incomplete  and  complete  feature 
extraction,  and  some  key  features  were  ignored.  Given  the  above 
reasons, it is recommended that sampling actions be avoided in the

after the above training data preparation is as follows (Fig. 6). One of the 
optimal  simulation  results  (72band_256_16bit_split)  was  achieved 
through the utilization of data augmentation and flattened convolution 
kernels, as illustrated in Fig. 7.

In terms of training data, as the area of each forest type classification 
was  found  to  be  very  different  through  the  interpretation  of  aerial 
photos  and  on-site  investigations,  an  imbalance  in  the  training  data 
occurred, which also had a large impact on the CNN calculation results. 
Therefore, the research team took the following actions for the dataset of 
the  input  samples:  (a)  input  according  to  the  original  data  (i.e.,  the 
number  of  samples  of  each  type  varied,  and  the  size  of  the  sample 
depended on the area of each forest type); (b) data reduction (i.e., the 
sampling method was used to force the number of samples of various 
forest  types  to  be  limited  to  the  same,  but  there  was  a  problem  of 
different  sampling  ratios)  (Fig.  5a);  (c)  data  augmentation  (using 
image rotation or overlapping plots, the number of samples of the forest 
type was standardized to the same) (Fig. 5b). The appearance of the data

VGG19 network architecture and adds a residual unit involving a short- 
circuit  mechanism,  which  can  overcome  the  issue  of  gradient  disap-
pearance and accuracy reduction in deep networks.

Helpful Answer:
To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques have been employed by researchers. In this particular case, the authors utilized three main approaches to handle the imbalanced nature of their training data due to varying areas of each forest type classification. These methods include:

1. Inputting the original data: Here, the authors did not alter the number of samples for each forest type, allowing them to vary based on the area of each forest type. This approach maintains the natural distribution of the data but may lead to biased results if certain classes dominate the dataset.

2. Data reduction: To mitigate the effects of uneven sample sizes, the authors implemented a sampling method to limit the number of samples for all forest types to the same value. However, this technique introduced another challenge â€“ differing sampling ratios among classes. Despite this limitation, data reduction helps balance the dataset and prevent any single class from dominating the learning process.

3. Data augmentation: By employing image rotation or overlapping plots, the authors standardized the number of samples for each forest type. This technique effectively increases the representation of underrepresented classes without creating artificial instances, thus reducing potential overfitting issues.

These strategies aim to minimize the impact of data bias during preprocessing and improve the overall performance of the deep learning models. It should be noted that these techniques do not guarantee perfect balance or eliminate bias entirely; rather, they serve as practical solutions to manage inherent challenges associated with real-world datasets.
