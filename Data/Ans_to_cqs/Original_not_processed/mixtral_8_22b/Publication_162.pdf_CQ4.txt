results in an unchanged expected activation in the fol-
lowing  convolutional  layers.  Furthermore,  we  nor-
malize all input channels (red, green, blue, and depth)
by subtracting the respective mean and dividing by the
respective standard deviation over the whole dataset.
We also introduce a feature fusion module to combine
the extracted features from both backbones using one
3 × 3 convolution per FPN scale and reduce the num-
ber of channels from 2 × 256 to 256. This allows us to
use weights pre-trained on the Microsoft COCO data-
set [24] for the region proposal network (RPN) classi-
fier and mask head. Fig. 4 illustrates the general archi-
tecture of the resulting D-Mask R-CNN architecture.
We  restrict  our  evaluation  of  D-Mask  R-CNN  to
instances of deers as it is the most common species in our
RGB-D dataset. We quantify the results of D-Mask R-
CNN using the average precision (AP), AP50, and AP75
metrics as defined by the Microsoft COCO dataset [24].

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, or scaling used in their deep learning pipeline. However, they do mention normalizing all input channels (red, green, blue, and depth) by subtracting the respective mean and dividing by the respective standard deviation over the whole dataset. They also use weights pre-trained on the Microsoft COCO dataset for the region proposal network (RPN) classifier and mask head. The paper focuses on evaluating D-Mask R-CNN for instances of deer in their RGB-D dataset, using metrics like average precision (AP), AP50, and AP75 as defined by the Microsoft COCO dataset.
