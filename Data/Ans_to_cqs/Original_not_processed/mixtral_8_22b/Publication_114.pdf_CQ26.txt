kernels. GoogLeNet adopted the Inception module, which is easy to use for network modification. It also removed the fully connected layers to reduce the number of parameters. Moreover, it used two auxiliary classifiers to accelerate network convergence. As a consequence of the auxiliary classifiers, GoogLeNet is not as scalable as VGG. On the other hand, the depth of networks is a crucial factor that influences CNN performance [39]. Richer features of different levels can be extracted from deep CNN layers, whereas deep models are not easy to optimize. In many studies, batch normalization (BN) is employed to hamper vanishing/exploding gradients in deep CNNs. However, the accuracy often becomes saturated and then degrades (degradation problem) in the training phase, even though BN layers are used. ResNet [41] addressed the degradation problem by using shallow layers and identity mapping for network construction. Two shortcuts (i.e., identity and projection shortcuts) have been

the number of bands of the feature maps, while the numbers on the bottom are the size (height and width) of the feature map. To avoid the distinction of identical textures only differing from each other by orientation changes and to increase the amount of tree species samples for training of the deep learning network, we performed data augmentation on the tree samples. The tree samples in the form of patches were rotated, mirrored, and flipped randomly. Finally, a total of 5664 tree samples were used for CNN training. Scattered samples (627) and tree samples (304) in12 plots surveyed in the field measurements were used for test and tree species classification accuracy assessment (931 test tree samples in total). The 12 plots were alsoused for diversity mapping assessment.3.4.

Helpful Answer:
To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets such that each subset maintains the same proportion of classes as the original dataset. This ensures that the model does not become biased towards any particular class due to imbalanced representation in the training set.

Oversampling is a technique where additional copies of minority class examples are added to the training set to balance out the distribution between majority and minority classes. This helps prevent the model from becoming overly influenced by the majority class.

Undersampling, on the other hand, involves removing some instances of the majority class from the training set to achieve a more balanced distribution. While this may result in loss of information, it can help improve the overall performance of the model.

Diverse data collection refers to collecting data from various sources and environments to ensure that the model generalizes well across different scenarios. This can involve gathering data from multiple sensors, locations, or time periods. By incorporating diverse data, the model can learn to recognize patterns and variations that might otherwise go unnoticed.

These techniques can be applied individually or in combination depending on the specific requirements of the task and the characteristics of the dataset. Proper application of these methods can significantly enhance the robustness and fairness of deep learning models.
