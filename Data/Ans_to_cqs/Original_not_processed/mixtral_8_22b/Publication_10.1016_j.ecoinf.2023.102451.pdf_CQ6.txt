b)  Some preprocessing steps like data augmentation and normalization 
are  performed  to  address  the  diversity  of  training  data  and  data 
imbalance problems in classification tasks.  

c)  The preprocessed images are fed to the transformer-based network 
EMViT-Net for extracting the both local and global features of mi-
crobes from EM images.  

d)  The integration of the SCPSA block in the CNN module of the EMViT- 
Net makes the model more efficient in extracting depth-wise features 
from the images.  

e)  The  extracted  features  are  then  given  to  a  multilayer  perceptron 

module for final feature fusion and classification.  

f)  Finally, the performance of the proposed EMViT-Net is evaluated on 
unseen test sets of the datasets by calculating performance metrics 
accuracy, precision, recall and f1-Score.

configuration of optimizer and learning rate which has been considered 
for the training of the framework. The EMViT-Net framework achieves 
prominent results as compared to other deep learning models and per-
forms better with an augmented set of EMDS-6 datasets.

To further validate the performance of the proposed model EMViT- 
Net,  the  acquired  findings  were  compared  with  other  state-of-the-art 
models. The performance measures used to compare the performance 
of  EMViT-Net  with  other  deep  learning  models  are  evaluated  on  the 
validation set and test set of the considered dataset EMDS-6. The com-
parison of the classification results achieved by other pre-trained deep 
learning models is given in Table 4 and Table 5 which illustrates the 
finding on each set validation set and test set respectively by calculating 
the  average  value  of  precision,  recall  and  f1-score  for  all  categories 
which are named as Avg_Precision, Avg_Recall and Avg_F1-score. The 
detailed analysis of the proposed network EMViT-Net and other deep 
learning models with specific configurations on unseen test sets is out-
lined  here  which  shows  that  the  EMViT-Net  outperforms  precision,

Environmental  microbes  are  certainly present  in  our surroundings  since  they  are  essential  to  the growth  and 
survival of human advancement. The detailed analysis of environmental microorganisms (EMs) is very important 
to recognize, understand and make use of microbes as well and prevent damage. Extracting the discriminatory 
features from a limited-size dataset is very challenging for a deep learning model and a pure transformer-based 
network cannot achieve good classification results on a limited-size dataset due to the lack of muti-scale features. 
In this study, a novel vision transformer-based deep neural network is proposed by integrating the transformer 
with CNN for the classification of EM using microscopic images. The proposed network EMViT-Net has three 
main  modules:  a  transformer  module,  a  CNN  module  and  a  multilayer  perceptron  module.  The  transformer

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model such as EMViT-Net, some preprocessing steps are performed to improve the quality and consistency of the input data. These steps include data augmentation and normalization. Data augmentation involves creating new samples by applying various transformations to existing ones, such as rotation, flipping, zooming, or cropping. This helps increase the size and diversity of the training dataset, making it more robust against overfitting. Normalization scales the pixel values of the images to a common range, typically between 0 and 1, to ensure consistent intensity levels across different images. Other possible preprocessing steps may include noise reduction, contrast enhancement, or color space conversion depending on the nature of the task and the characteristics of the dataset. However, these additional steps are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
