3.1.1. Relabelling performance measure 

Fig.  1  shows  the  performance  in  classification  as  measured  by 
meanRSS for Test 1 for the best-performing methods across the combi-
nations  of  lasso  penalty  and  bias  correction  use.  The  relative  perfor-
mances of the methods in relabelling are similar regardless of the use of 
a  lasso  penalty or  bias  correction  for  a  low  percentage  of  hidden  ob-
servations.  Indeed,  we  note  that  methods  like  LoopT  and  knn  are 
competitive with the individual method. However, we can emphasize 
that adding the lasso regularization results in better performances—i.e. 
lower meanRSS—especially at 80% of hidden observations for the badly 
performing  methods  (kmeans,  random,  CoinF,  LoopA  and  LoopE) 
(Fig. 1). Adding bias correction does not change the performance of the

3.1.3. Predicted intensity maps 

Figs.  3  to  6  show  the  predicted  intensity  maps  with  80%  hidden 
observations for the different combinations of lasso regularization and 
bias correction. The results for 20% and 50% hidden observations are 
shown in Appendix A.1.2. The following intensity prediction maps do 
not  display  all  methods  tested  previously.  We  focus  on  the  best  per-
forming methods across the performance measures (knn, LoopT) as well

when lasso is not implemented. With a lasso penalty used, adding bias

Helpful Answer:
The performance of the deep learning models was evaluated using several metrics such as Mean Residual Sum of Squares (MeanRSS), Normalized Integrated Mean Square Error (NIMSLE), and median performance of the individual method. These metrics were used to compare the performance of various methods including kNN, LoopT, kmeans, random, CoFi, LoopA, LoopE, and Mixture methods under different conditions such as varying percentages of hidden observations and the implementation of lasso penalty and bias correction. The results showed that some methods performed better than others depending on these factors. For instance, LoopT and kNN were found to be competitive with the individual method even without the use of lasso penalty or bias correction for a low percentage of hidden observations. However, implementing lasso regularization resulted in improved performance, especially for poorly performing methods like kmeans, random, CoFi, LoopA, and LoopE. On the other hand, adding bias correction did not significantly affect the performance of the Mixture methods when lasso was applied.
