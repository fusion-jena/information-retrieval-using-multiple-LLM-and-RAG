Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge, some common methods for collecting raw data include:

1. Surveys: Data can be collected through online or offline surveys, which involve asking people questions related to their opinions, behaviors, or experiences.

2. Sensors: Various types of sensors such as cameras, microphones, GPS devices, and wearable technology can collect data from the environment or individuals. For example, sensors can capture images, sounds, location data, or physiological responses like heart rate or body temperature.

3. Public Datasets: Researchers often use publicly available datasets to train and test their models. These datasets may contain various types of data such as text, images, audio files, videos, or structured data. Examples of popular public datasets include ImageNet, COCO, and Wikipedia.

4. Web Scraping: This involves extracting data from websites by using automated tools or scripts. The extracted data can then be cleaned, processed, and analyzed.

5. Social Media APIs: Many social media platforms offer application programming interfaces (APIs), which allow developers to access user-generated content such as tweets, posts, comments, likes, shares, etc.

6. IoT Devices: Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as smart home appliances, industrial machines, vehicles, and medical equipment can generate large amounts of real-time data that can be used for training deep learning models.
