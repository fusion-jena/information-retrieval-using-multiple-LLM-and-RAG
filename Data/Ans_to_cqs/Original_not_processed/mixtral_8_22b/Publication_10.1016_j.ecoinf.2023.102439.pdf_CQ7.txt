Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

The model’s training was conducted using data from 2005 to 2015, 
encompassing 264 data points. Subsequently, data from 2016 to 2018, 
comprising  72  data  points,  were  reserved  for  testing  and  validation 
purposes.  This  data  partitioning  resulted  in  a  distribution  of  60%  for 
training and 40% for validation and testing. 

To evaluate the performance of the model, several statistical metrics 
were  employed,  including  the  Mean  Absolute  Percent  Error  (MAPE), 
Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and cor-
relation coefficient (R). These metrics provide insights into the accuracy 
and predictive capability of the model by measuring the deviation be-
tween the predicted EVI values and the actual observed values.

By employing the W-ANN model, the training values reached 96% 
for Iznik and 91% for Alanya, while the estimated percentages for all 
data increased to 95% for Iznik and 88% for Alanya, respectively. The 
developed hybrid model improved learning success, with an increase of 
18.7%  in  Iznik  and  7.3%  in  Alanya,  as  determined  by  the  network’s 
performance.  These  findings  highlight  the  hybrid  model’s  enhanced 
predictive capabilities and effectiveness in both study areas.

3. Results 

As indicated before, the ANN model utilised in this study comprises 
an  input,  hidden,  and  output  layer.  The  input  layer  comprises  three 
processing elements (neurons) corresponding to the LST, temperature, 
and precipitation parameters. The EVI data was used as the output layer. 
The number of neurons in the hidden layer is a crucial factor influencing 
the learning capability of the network. Insufficient neurons may hinder 
successful learning, while excessive neurons may lead to over fitting and 
compromise the network’s performance (Çakır, 2018). In this study, the 
number of neurons in the hidden layer was incrementally to determine 
the optimal configuration that yields the best results.

The test value R in artificial neural networks evaluates the model’s 
overall performance. A high R-value indicates that the model can make 
predictions close to the actual data and exhibits good performance. The 
model performance, dependent on the number of selected hidden layer 
neurons,  is  presented in  Table  3.  In this  context, an  R-value between 
70% and 80% signifies that the model can make predictions close to the 
actual  data  and  demonstrates  a  successful  performance  (Sa˘gık  et  al., 
2021). When 6 hidden layer neurons were selected for both stations, the 
NARX model yielded the best results. The table also includes the rela-
tionship between the target values of training, validation, and test re-
sults. The training values were 82% for Iznik and 84% for Alanya. The 
estimated percentages of all the datasets were obtained through training 
with the ANN as 80% for Iznik and 82% for Alanya. It has been deter-

Helpful Answer:
In this case, the data was divided into two sets: one for training and another for testing and validation purposes. The training set consisted of data from 2005 to 2015, comprising 264 data points, which accounted for 60% of the total dataset. On the other hand, the remaining 40% of the data, consisting of 72 data points collected from 2016 to 2018, was allocated for testing and validation. This division allowed the researchers to assess the model's ability to generalize its learned patterns to unseen data accurately.
