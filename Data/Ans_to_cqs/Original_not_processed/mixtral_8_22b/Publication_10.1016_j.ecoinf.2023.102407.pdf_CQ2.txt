%Query
Query: "What data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., image, audio, video, CSV)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions several BIOCLIM variables such as Mean Temperature of the Wettest Quarter, Annual Precipitation, Precipitation Seasonality, etc. These variables suggest that the data might be related to climate or environmental studies. Typically, such data is presented in tabular form, often as CSV files. Additionally, the mention of 'Pseudo-label: The simple and efficient semi-supervised learning method for deep neural networks' suggests that this could be part of a deep learning pipeline. But without more specific details, we cannot definitively state what data format is being used.
