easy to train with reduced complexity, even though they have deeper 
layers than CNN models, because of the presence of skip connections 
between the input and output of each block (He et al., 2016). ResNet has 
different variants with a variety of convolution layers. We trialled three 
depths, ResNet-18, (cid:0) 50 and (cid:0) 101, and compared their training times 
and validation accuracies. They behaved similarly but ResNet-50 had a 
marginally  higher  validation  accuracy  (Section  3.1.1)  leading  us  to 
choose it for feature extraction.

ResNet-50 is made up of five convolutional blocks stacked on top of 
one  another  (Fig.  5).  The  image  features  are  extracted  from  the  fully 
connected layers pre-trained with the ImageNet database (https://imag 
e-net.org/index.php). The input to the network is an image of 224x224

The  next step  was  to  gather  standard  visual  information  and  low- 
level  image  features  from  the  datasets  that  include  traits  such  as 
colour, texture, shape, etc. (Shih et al., 2001). These features can be used 
by classifiers or deep learning models for image segmentation, image 
classification  and  object  detection.  There  are  various  techniques  for 
conducting  image  feature  extraction.  With  advancements  in  machine 
learning,  specifically  deep  learning  and  convolution  neural  networks 
(CNNs), feature extraction from images can be performed automatically 
to obtain high levels of classification accuracy (Acharya and Khoshel-
ham, 2020). Therefore, we used a deep-learning model to extract fea-
tures  of  our  image  backgrounds  for  training  a  classifier  model.  We 
adopted  a  ResNet-50  model  (He  et  al.,  2016)  for  extracting  image 
background features for classification. ResNets (Residual Networks) are

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific dataset used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the ResNet-50 model was pre-trained with the ImageNet database. Additionally, the study involves gathering standard visual information and low-level image features from datasets containing color, texture, shape, etc. But no specific names of datasets are mentioned apart from ImageNet.

Based on the given context, one cannot definitively state which other datasets were used in the deep learning pipeline besides ImageNet.
