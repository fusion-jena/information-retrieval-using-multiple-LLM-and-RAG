The challenge for applying deep learning to natural systems is the need for large training datasets.
A lack of training data is a pervasive problem in remote sensing due to the cost of data collection
and annotation [13]. In addition, the spatial extent of training data often prohibits the ﬁeld-based
veriﬁcation of annotated objects. For tree detection, the high variation in tree crown appearance, due
to taxonomy, health status, and human management, increases the risk of overﬁtting when using small
amounts of training data [10]. One approach to addressing the data limitation in deep learning is
“self-supervised learning” (sensus [14]), which uses unsupervised methods to generate training data
that is used to train supervised models [15]. This approach has recently been applied to remote sensing
for hyperspectral image classiﬁcation [9]. Self-supervision, which only relies on unlabeled data, can be

combined with labeled data in a semi-supervised framework (sensu [14]), which may improve deep
learning on limited training data by providing neural networks the opportunity to learn generalized
features on a wider array of training examples, followed by retraining on a smaller number of high
quality annotations [16]. It is unknown whether moderate to low quality annotations can be used
to generate trees for initial model training, given the imperfect nature of existing unsupervised tree
delimitation approaches.

samples will be needed to customize the model to a local geographic area. In addition, the availability
of hyperspectral data could assist in dividing the ‘tree’ class into multiple species labels. This would
yield additional insights into the economic value, ecological habitat, and carbon storage capacity for
large geographic areas [39]. While further work is needed to understand the best way to combine data
among scales and sensors, we show that deep learning-based approaches hold the potential for large
scale actionable information on natural systems to be derived from remote sensing data.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The data repository link of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it does mention that all the data are publicly available on the NEON Data Portal (<http://data.neonscience.org/>). Additionally, it states that all code for this project is available on GitHub (<https://github.com/weecology/DeepLidar>) and archived on Zenodo. Therefore, while there isn't a direct link to the specific dataset or repository, one can access the data through the NEON Data Portal and the code through GitHub and Zenodo.
