2.5.1. Model selection and parametrization 

For  the  classification  task,  before  the  implementation  of  deep 
learning models, all images were resized to the same resolution (227×
197  pixels)  by  considering  the  mean  dimensions  of  the  set,  and  then 
normalized to the [0,1] range (Na and Fox, 2020). Then, six open source 
CNNs  were  selected:  VGG16  (Simonyan  and  Zisserman,  2015), 
ResNet50,  ResNet101  (He  et  al.,  2016),  Inception-v3  (Szegedy  et  al., 
2016), DenseNet201 (Huang et al., 2017) and EfficientNetB0 (Tan and 
Le,  2019).  These  algorithms  were  selected  because  of  their  ease  for 
transfer  learning and  high  performance  on  similar classification  tasks 
(Arun  and  Viknesh,  2022;  Vallabhajosyula  et  al.,  2022).  For  model 
optimization, we used the Adam optimizer algorithm (Kingma and Ba, 
2015), a batch size of 10 and 100 epochs. The learning rates were chosen

from empirical trials over 100 epochs, with and 10

A.1b),  with  high  performances  (e.g.,  f1-score  values  above  93.09%; 
Table  4).  Unlike  the  training  task,  the  best  results  were  obtained  by 
(cid:0) 4,  in  terms  of  accuracy 
EfficientNetB0  with  a  learning  rate  of  10
(97.50%),  sensitivity  (96.00%)  and  f1-score  (97.46%),  followed  by 
(cid:0) 4),  which  also  showed 
Inception-v3  with  the  same  learning  rate  (10
high accuracy (96.88%), sensitivity (94.00%), specificity (99.75%) and 
f1-score (96.78%). In the case of the EfficientNetB0 model, only 4% of 
the  images  displaying  the  Cortaderia  selloana  were  confused  by  the 
model as showing no C. selloana (false negatives; Fig. A.1c). Likewise, 
from  the  images  showing  no  C.  selloana,  in  1%  of  the  cases  Effi-
cientNetB0  incorrectly  predicted  the  class  “With  Cortaderia  selloana” 
(false  positives;  Fig.  A.1d).  A  similar  pattern  was  verified  for  the 
remaining CNNs (see confusion matrices in Tables A.6 and A.7).

with other plant species. Moreover, there are no other plant species in 
Portugal (our study area) with the same features as C. selloana. Both of 
these particularities may be the source of the high results observed in 
this study. 

4.4. Monitoring the invasive alien Cortaderia selloana from online digital 
images

Still, from the different models considered, EfficientNetB0 and Faster 
R-CNN Inception-v2 performed best on social media images. These re-
sults  agree  with  previous  applications  on  biodiversity  using  Effi-
cientNetB0  (Hassan  et  al.,  2021),  and  Faster  R-CNN  Inception-v2 
(Moniruzzaman et al., 2019). Regarding the performance of each pre- 
(cid:0) 4  and Faster 
trained model, EfficientNetB0 with a learning rate of 10
R-CNN  Inception-v2  pre-trained  on  the  MS  COCO  dataset  performed 
better compared to the remaining architectures. These results also sug-
gest  that classification  models present  a  higher  efficiency  and  perfor-
mance  when  applied  to  images  containing  different  proprieties  and 
sources, which makes them robust tools to support the identification of 
C. selloana. Identifying this species in pictures is very straightforward 
and simple, as C. selloana contains several specific features (such as the

Helpful Answer:
The paper uses the Adam optimizer algorithm for model optimization. This choice was made due to its effectiveness in handling sparse gradients and large datasets, making it suitable for deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The authors employed a batch size of 10 and trained the models for 100 epochs. The learning rates were determined through empirical trials over 100 epochs.
