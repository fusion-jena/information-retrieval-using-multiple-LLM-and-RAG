4.1. Study design and investigations

While  the  ensemble  size  for  bagging  is  not  particularly  critical, 
provided it is sufficiently large (500 is a widely used default value), it 
does  matter  for boosting.  In  XGBoost, large  ensemble  sizes  can  cause 
over-fitting because the gradient technique focuses on the most difficult 
cases,  which  can  be  due  to  noise.  To  avoid  the  over-fitting  issue  in 
XGBoost, we use a nested k-fold cross-validation scheme. We split each 
dataset into 3 subsets: the tuning set (k-2 folds), validation set (1-fold), 
and test set (1-fold). For each choice of number of iterations and each 
fold, we train the model on the tuning set and monitor the performance 
on the validation set by calculating the out-of-sample prediction accu-
racy and taking the median of k-1 folds. This gives us k medians for each 
number of iterations, as explained in Algorithm 1 and shown in Fig. S2 in 
Supplement A.3.

ture (Sollich and Krogh, 1996). The combination of the proposed RBF- 
GFR  model  with  random  forests  (RBF-GFR-RF)  produced  the  best 
model  overall,  consistently  achieving  a  place  in  the  top  three  perfor-
mance rankings. An important additional finding was that almost all the 
methods proposed in this study outperform the original GFR model from 
Matthiopoulos et al. (2011), which was the initial aim motivating the 
present work. As shown in Fig. 2, the GFR model never achieves a rank 
better than 6. R2
DEV  in Eq. (18) is generally a better behaved measure-
ment than R2  in Eq. (17) for count data as described in Section 4.2. We 
used R2
DEV to calculate the out-of-sample predictive performance in these 
datasets  as  shown  in  Fig. S9  in  Supplement A.9.  However,  the  overall 
ranks using R2
DEV  are not different from the overall ranks using R2  in Eq.

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps may be involved depending on the nature of the data and the specific requirements of the model. Some common preprocessing techniques include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing or correcting any inconsistencies, errors, or missing values in the dataset. It also includes handling outliers and dealing with categorical variables if necessary.

2. Normalization/Standardization: These techniques help bring all features to the same scale, preventing any feature from dominating the others during training. Normalization scales the data between 0 and 1, while standardization transforms the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

3. Feature Scaling: Similar to normalization and standardization, feature scaling rescales the range of features to improve the efficiency of the learning algorithm. Common methods include Min-Max scaling and Robust scaling.

4. Encoding Categorical Variables: Deep learning models typically require input data to be numerical. Therefore, categorical variables need to be converted into numerical form using encoding techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding.

5. Dimensionality Reduction: Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, making it easier to process and visualize.

6. Data Augmentation: This technique generates new samples by applying transformations to existing ones, helping prevent overfitting and improving generalization.
