2.2. Feature extraction 

To  solve  problems  using  the  machine  learning  method,  extracting 
features from the raw data to be used as inputs for the machine learning 
model is necessary. Although the importance of feature extraction has 
decreased with the introduction of deep learning, there are still aspects 
where features play a key role, such as considering the computing power 
of devices, reducing training time, and ensuring real-time performance 
in decision-making. 

In  this paper,  we used  the BLS  entropy profile to  characterize the 
swimming behavior of C. elegans, as in the work by Jeong et al. (2019). 
The BLS profile has also been used to calculate the Levenshtein distance, 
an indicator of how similar two sequences are, in order to illuminate the 
similarities  and  differences  in  swimming  patterns  of  C.  elegans  in  a 
controlled and chemical-contaminated water environment (Kang et al.,

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, none of the provided references directly address the specific issue of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, particularly regarding random seed values. However, it can be generally stated that several strategies are commonly employed to manage randomness in deep learning models. These include:

1. Seed Fixation: One popular strategy is fixing the random seed value before running any code involving random processes. This ensures reproducibility across different runs or machines. Python’s numpy library provides a function called `np.random.seed()` which sets the seed for generating random numbers. Similarly, TensorFlow uses `tf.random.set_seed()`.

2. Data Shuffling: Random shuffling of input data is often done during model training to prevent overfitting and improve generalization. The order of data points can significantly impact the learning process, especially when dealing with sequential data like time series.

3. Dropout Regularization: To avoid overfitting due to coadaptations between neurons, dropout regularization randomly drops out nodes during training. This introduces some level of randomness into the model architecture itself.

4. Weight Initialization: The initial weights of a neural network can greatly affect its convergence speed and final accuracy. Common initialization methods involve assigning small random values to these weights.

5. Ensemble Methods: Combining multiple models trained independently with different random seeds can help reduce variance and increase robustness against noise in the dataset.

Again, please note that these strategies were not explicitly mentioned in the given sources but represent common practices within the field of deep learning.
