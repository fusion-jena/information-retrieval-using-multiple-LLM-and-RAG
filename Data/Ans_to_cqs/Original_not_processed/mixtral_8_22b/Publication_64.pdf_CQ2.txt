Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Finally for the ResNet50 evaluation we use random ten
crop testing with smaller data augmentation parameters than
those used during training.

4.1 The datasets

4.1.1 Google Search Image. For this dataset we select the
3680 labels (around 60% of all labels) with more than 12
images in our training dataset. For each one of these labels

we automatically retrieve the 10 ﬁrst images returned by the
Google Image Search engine. As this is done in an automated
fashion some minor mislabeled or corrupt examples might
appear in the dataset. By choosing only the most popular
labels and retrieving the top results, we expect to minimize
the presence of mislabeled images.

4.1.2 Portuguese Flora. The Portuguese ﬂora dataset [16]
consists in 23K images belonging to 2K species. To compose
our test dataset we select the 15K images belonging to one
of the 1300 species which are also present in our training
dataset.

2 THE DATASET
As training dataset we use the great collection of images
which are available in PlantNet under a Creative-Common
Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 license. It consists of around 250K
images belonging to more than 6K plant species of Western
Europe. These species are distributed in 1500 genera and
200 families. Each image has been labeled by experts and
comes with a tag which speciﬁes the focus of the image,
like ’habit’, ’ﬂower’, ’leaf’, ’bark’, etc. Most images have
resolutions ranging from 200K to 600K pixels and aspect
ratios ranging from 0.5 to 2. The dataset is highly unbalanced
because most labels contain very few images.

We train on the whole dataset (without making validation
or test splits) as we intend to build a classiﬁer trained on the
same dataset as the PlantNet tool so that their performances
can be fairly compared. At test time we will use three external
datasets to conﬁdently measure the performance of our net.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not explicitly state the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the primary data format used is images since the paper discusses the use of images for training and evaluating the ResNet50 model. Additionally, the datasets mentioned - Google Search Image, Portuguese Flora, and iNaturalist - are all related to plants and nature, suggesting that they primarily consist of images. Therefore, it can be concluded that the main data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images.
