predictions. In contrast, machine learning, particularly neural networks, 
and deep learning provides powerful tools for pattern recognition, albeit 
with  challenges  in  data  requirements  and  interpretability  (see  (Barak 
and  Tsodyks,  2023;  Kliegr  et  al.,  2020;  Kuru  et  al.,  2023;  Tron  and 
Margaliot, 2004; Vos et al., 2006)). By adopting an integrative approach, 
we not only maintain the interpretability of traditional models but also 
benefit from the predictive capabilities of machine learning, advancing 
our ability to predict behavioral outcomes in a wide range of scenarios. 
This methodology propels our investigation forward, opening new av-
enues  for  anticipating  animal  behavior  in  various  conditions  and 
emphasizing the controlled settings of T-maze experiments.

• The  selection  of  the  distance  metric,  typically  Euclidean,  was 
predicated on the data’s characteristics and the specific analytical 
prerequisites.  

was dictated by the explained variance ratio, to ensure the distilled

In animal behavior studies, the integration of Machine Learning (ML) 
and  Deep  Learning  (DL)  methodologies  represents  a  significant  para-
digm  shift.  Traditionally,  these  advanced  computational  techniques, 
renowned for their predictive accuracy in fields such as artificial intel-
ligence  (Marar,  2024),  image  processing  (Zhang  et  al.,  2015),  neuro-
science (Dixon and Polson, 2020), and genomics (Xiao and Segal, 2009), 
have not been extensively harnessed for modeling or predicting animal 
movement. Such approaches extend the application of these technolo-
gies beyond their conventional domains and aim to transcend the mere 
prediction  of  behavior.  The  objective  is  to  craft  a  methodology  that 
utilizes machine learning to forecast behavioral patterns and intricately 
map animals’ actual movement trajectories.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly state the purpose of the deep learning model used in the study. However, it mentions that the integration of machine learning and deep learning methodologies aims to forecast behavioral patterns and map animals' actual movement trajectories. This suggests that the deep learning model could be used for prediction tasks related to animal behavior, possibly involving classification or regression to identify patterns or trends in the data. It may also involve some form of sequence analysis or time series prediction given the focus on mapping movement trajectories over time. Without more specific information about the model architecture or training process, it would be difficult to determine the exact purpose of the deep learning model.
