Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

The integration of peat depth information within GMEPBHmod in
Step-2 raised the accuracies further (see Table 6) for heathland & scrub
(both UA, PA, 74%), wetland (PA 77%, UA 55%), and bog (PA 87%, UA
92%). However, there was no change in the accuracy when Step-3 was
implemented.

3.4. Comparison of LWHab map with the EarthTrack habitat survey data

The distribution of pixels from LWHab across the different habitat
classes surveyed habitat is shown in Fig. 8. The correspondence between
the mapped and field-recorded habitat classes was >70% for cultivated/
managed, acid grassland, saltmarsh and Juncus rushes. For bracken,
raised bog and dune grassland, around 60% pixels showed a one-to-one

a) Step-1: Comparing LWHabmod and GMEPmod (actual accuracies)
b) Step-2: Applying decision rules based on the peat depth, particularly
those affecting wetland/bog classes, to modify GMEPmod data labels.
c) Step-3: Applying decision rules (in addition to Step-2) based on the
Phase-1 Habitat map, and particularly those impacting on the clas-
sification of grassland, heathland, and scrub classes, to modify the
GMEPmod data labels.

These exercises were repeated for the broad habitat classes by

modifying the GMEPBHmod labels through Step-2 and Step-3.

2.6.2. Accuracy assessment for Pembrokeshire County

We undertook a dedicated survey of vegetated semi-natural habitats,
in Pembrokeshire in 2022 (Fig. 2) using the EarthTrack mobile appli-
cation developed through Living Wales (https://earthtrack.aber.ac.uk/)

%Query
Query: "Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, the given context does not provide any information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only discusses various steps involved in improving the accuracy of land cover classification models and their results but does not mention anything related to the code repository or its availability on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, it is impossible to determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available based solely on this context.
