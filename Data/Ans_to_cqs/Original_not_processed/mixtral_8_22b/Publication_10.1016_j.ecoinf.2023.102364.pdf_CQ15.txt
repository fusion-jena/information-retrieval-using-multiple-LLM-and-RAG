2.3.4. RandomForest (bagging) 

We performed a RandomForest analysis using 200 trees and balanced 
weights. Similar to CART Ensembles and Bagger, RandomForest belongs 
to the tree algorithm family, but then is enhanced via ‘bagging’ (Brei-
man, 2001). Prior studies have shown RandomForest to be a superior 
choice  for  predictive  accuracy  in  classification  problems  (Mi  et  al., 
2017) and inference (Breiman, 2001).

2.3.2. CART ensembles and bagger 

We performed a CART Ensembles and Bagger analysis using all 68 
predictors.  These  analyses  belong  to  the  tree  algorithm  family,  but 
combine trees using a simple “bagging” concept (Breiman, 2001). The 
same settings were used as for the CART Decision Trees analysis. 

2.3.3. TreeNet (stochastic gradient boosting) 

We performed a TreeNet analysis using default settings, 600 trees, 
and balanced weights. TreeNet algorithms employ stochastic gradient 
boosting, a proven approach in data mining with high predictive accu-
racy. TreeNet algorithms are also tree-based, with enhanced robustness 
via  a  ‘boosting’  concept  (Friedman,  2002).  As  such,  TreeNett  is  an 

algorithm of choice for similar data mining analyses (Booms et al., 2010, 
2011, Ohse et al., 2009, Baltensperger et al., 2013).

%Query
Query: "What optimization techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., SGD, Adam)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any direct information about the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, or others. However, it mentions several machine learning methods used for prediction and inference, including Random Forest, CART Ensembles, Bagger, TreeNet (stochastic gradient boosting), and MARS regression splines. While these methods do involve some form of optimization, they are not explicitly mentioned as part of a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot determine which optimization techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline.
