Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Experimental set up 

We  perform  a  complete  experiment  to 
demonstrate the performance of the proposed 
approach.  The  CNN-LSTM  Model  was 
implemented  with  the  python  library,  using 
Theano and Keras. The model parameters are 
optimized  using  gradient  descent  Adam 
algorithm  with  all  parameters  set  to  default 
values.  The system specification details are 
presented in  table 1,  while the detail  of the

Generally, the proposed network system has 
20  layers:  12  convolutional  layers,  five 
pooling  layers,  one  Fully  Connected  layer, 
one LSTM layer, and one output layer with 
the  softmax  function  for  classification.  The 
convolutional  layer  with  a  size  of  3  ×  3 
kernels is used for extracting feature and it is 
activated  by  the  ReLU  function.  The  max-
pooling layer with a size of 2 × 2 kernels is 
applied to reduce the dimensions of an input 
image. In the last part of the architecture, the 
function map is shifted to the LSTM layer to 
for 
information 
extract 
classification  purpose.  Using  the  reshape 
method,  the  input  size  of  the  LSTM  layer 
becomes (196,512). After analyzing the time 
features,  the  model  sorts  the  plant  species 
images  through  a  fully  connected  layer  to

time 

predict whether they belong under any of the 
100 categories of the plant species.

RESULTS 

The training process took around 10 hours on 
the  CPU.  The  accuracy  obtained  reaches 
95%  on  140  epochs.  We  first  measure  the 
performance  of  the  proposed  model  fig  6. 
and then compared it with the state-of-the-art 
approaches to justify its performance.

Experiment  show  that  the  proposed  CNN-
LSTM  performs  better  in  classifying  plant 
species  than  the  convectional  CNN  as  it 
attains  the  accuracy  of  95.06%  while  the 
literatures (Zhang et al. 2019) have reported 
only 91% accuracy.

%Query
Query: "What are the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model (e.g., learning rate, optimizer)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The experimental setup mentions that the model parameters were optimized using the gradient descent Adam algorithm with all parameters set to their default values. However, the specific hyperparameters such as the learning rate or other settings for the Adam optimizer are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, without additional information, we cannot provide the exact hyperparameters used in this deep learning model.
