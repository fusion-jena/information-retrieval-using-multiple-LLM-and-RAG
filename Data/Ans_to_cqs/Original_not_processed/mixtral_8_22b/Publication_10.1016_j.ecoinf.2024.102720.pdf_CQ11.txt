With the rapid development of multi-scale data and multi-method
coupling research, scholars have started to base their research on
qualitative (Chen, 2020), quantitative (Liao et al., 2021; Mu et al.,
2019), frequency (Lu et al., 2021), probabilistic (Zhao and Xu, 2020),
temporal (Shen et al., 2019), spatial (Zhao et al., 2022) and other multi-
scale data. Improvements in random forest (Jiang et al., 2021; Lian et al.,
2022), support vector machines (Hong et al., 2018), deep learning (Ren
et al., 2021; Wu, 2022), Bayesian networks (Che et al., 2019), and mixed
effects (Yu et al., 2021a) models for improved fusion, e.g., Gu et al. (Gu
et al., 2024) fused optimal parametric geoprobes with partial least
squares structural equations to analyze the effects of topography,
climate, and human activities on the spatial pattern of kNDVI. Research
in natural areas such as agro-land ecology has been performed in the
exploration of influencing factors of land use and agricultural systems

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide a direct link to the data repository of the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context. However, it can be noted that the paper by Ren, D.-F., Cao, A.-H., Du, W.-J., published in 2023, titled "Ecosystem service value and changes in food supply and demand in Liaoning Province" in Chinese Journal of Soil Science, uses a deep learning algorithm in its strategic planning. This suggests that this paper might contain more details about the specific deep learning pipeline used. To find out if the authors made the code or dataset publicly accessible, one could search for the article online using databases like Google Scholar or Web of Science, then check the full text or supplementary materials for any links to repositories such as GitHub, Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
