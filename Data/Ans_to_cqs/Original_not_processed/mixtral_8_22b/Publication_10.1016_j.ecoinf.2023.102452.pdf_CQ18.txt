efficiency compared to other platforms such as MATLAB. Additionally, 
previous  studies  have  demonstrated  the  effectiveness  of  FIPSO  as  a 
trainer for ANN models (Ang et al., 2022; Bas et al., 2022). In this study, 
a standard data split was employed, where 70% of the available data was 
used for model training, and the remaining 30% was dedicated to testing 
and evaluating the results. Fig. 7 provides a visual representation of the 
comprehensive  process  employed  for  streamflow  forecasting  in  this 
study. 

5. Results and discussion 

The results of the GP and ANN forecasting models for all scenarios,

specified number of iterations. For this study, the Eureka Pro software is 
utilized for GP modeling. This software was developed by Cornell Uni-
versity’s Data Science Order and was released in 2009 (Eureqa, 2009). It 
is crucial to emphasize that GP serves multiple roles in this paper. Once 
GP is employed as the forecasting model, we extract the inputs utilized 
in  the  optimal  GP  tree  and  utilize  them  as  the  optimal  inputs  for 
modeling  with  ANN.  The  primary  reason  for  selecting  GP  as  our  IVS 
technique is its ability to simultaneously select appropriate features and 
perform modeling tasks (Althoey et al., 2023; Hu, 2023).

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it appears that the strategy used to monitor the model performance during training involved splitting the available data into two parts - 70% for training and 30% for testing and evaluation. However, there is no specific mention of how the model performance was monitored during the training phase itself. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the exact strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training.
