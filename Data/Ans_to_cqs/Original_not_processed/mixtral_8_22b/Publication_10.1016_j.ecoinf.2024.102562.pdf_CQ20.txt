were  proven  to  succumb  to  complexity,  low  precision  and  reliability, 
whereas image analysis-based methods have now been widely adopted 
due to their efficiency and accuracy (Gupta et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 
2021).  The  deep  learning  model  successfully  segments  and  classifies 
various objects at satisfying accuracy. AI-aided soil chip analysis does 
not only allow to study abundance and biodiversity measures following 
local treatments or large biogeographic variations, but even to investi-
gate direct interactions of microbes with each other, or with additives to 
the ecosystem, such as biochar or toxins that can be added into the chips. 
The  approach  can  be  extended  to  other  microbial  groups  including

include  flip, rotations  and  affine  transformation. We  then  trained the 
same dataset with ResNet-101 network with heavier augmentation for 
500 epochs. It is worth noting that the selection of image augmentations 
is  of  crucial  importance  to  improve  training  performance.  Multiply, 
linear  contrast,  sharpen,  emboss,  flip  in  horizontal  and  vertical  di-
rections,  rotations  and  affine  transformation  were  used  for  heavy 
augmentation.

potential of deep learning algorithms in bacterial image recognition of 
environmental samples using these datasets and provide guidelines for 
dataset preparation and training. With the increasing user-friendliness 
of  deep  learning  for  biology  groups  without  much  AI  experience,  we 
found that image annotation equivalent to a few weeksâ€™ work can pro-
vide satisfactory information on bacterial populations within the chips. 
This method is expected to be useful for environmental microbiological 
research  and  analysis  using  imaging  methods,  particularly  on  micro-
fluidic  platforms,  where  the  combination  of  controlled  experimental 
manipulations  and  monitoring  of  processes  with  high  environmental 
realism,  including  chemo-physical  conditions  and  biotic  interactions, 
presents significant potential. 

2. Experimental methods 

2.1. Soil sample acquisition

The three sampling locations exhibit noticeable differences in bac-
terial abundance and morphology, which can be attributed to various 
experimental conditions and strong differences in image quality. These 
data were utilized as a validation set to assess the efficacy of our deep 
learning recognition model in accurately capturing and quantifying such 
differences, thereby demonstrating its proof of concept. The sampling 
sites  were  thus  chosen  to  provide  large  differences  in  environmental 
conditions to demonstrate the versatility of the approach; it should be 
noted that our objective did not encompass a comparison of the effects of 
different experimental conditions on bacterial morphology.
