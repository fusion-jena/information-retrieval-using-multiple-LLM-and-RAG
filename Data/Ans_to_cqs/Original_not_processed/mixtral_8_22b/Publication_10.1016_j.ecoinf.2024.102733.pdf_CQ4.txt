parameters. The parameter values explored alongside the aforemen-
tioned autoencoder include the following: learning rates of 0.00005,
0.0005, 0.0001, 0.005, 0.001, and 0.01; batch sizes of 8, 16, 32, 64, and
128; weight decay values of 0, 0.00001, 0.0001, and 0.001, with
dropout set to 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.25. For the focal loss parameters, α
was defined as the inverse of class frequency, 0.25, or 0.5, while γ was
set to 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, and 2.

During the training of the MLP, Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba,
2015) is used, as well as the scheduler which adjusts the learning rate
when the network reaches a plateau. For the training, various parameter
values and different regularization techniques were explored, with the
option of using either Cross-Entropy or Focal Loss (Lin et al., 2017). In
detail, the learning rate was set to 0.00001 and 0.0001, batch sizes of 8,
16, 32, and 64 were tested, and weight decay was varied between
0.0001 and 0.001 with a dropout of 0.1. Additionally, Focal Loss (Lin
et al., 2017) introduce additional parameters to investigate: α and γ. The
former serves as a balancing factor, either as a fixed value for all classes
or as the inverse of each class frequency. The latter regulates the impact
of the scaling factor; specifically, when set to zero, Focal Loss is equiv-
alent to Cross-Entropy Loss. We experimented with α set as the inverse of
