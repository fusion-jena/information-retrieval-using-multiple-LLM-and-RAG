%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not mention which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or any other platform was used for deployment.
