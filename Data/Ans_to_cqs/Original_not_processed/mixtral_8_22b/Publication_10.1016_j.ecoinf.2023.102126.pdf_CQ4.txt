Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

To evaluate the datasets using F-UJI, the datasets were divided into 
the  top  eight  repositories  based  on  the  number  of  datasets  deposited 
(Fig.  2).  The number  of  datasets deposited in  these  eight  repositories 
accounted  for  94.9%  of  the  total  number  of  datasets,  which  was 
considered sufficiently representative. Of these eight repositories, four 
were general repositories, i.e., Figshare (https://figshare.com/), Zenodo 
(https://zenodo.org/), Dryad (https://datadryad.org/stash), and CSIRO 
(https://data.csiro.au/),  and  four  were  thematic  repositories,  i.e.,  Ag 
Data Commons (https://data.nal.usda.gov/), KNB Data Repository (htt 
ps://knb.ecoinformatics.org/),  ZALF  Open  Research  Data  (https:// 
open-research-data.zalf.de/default.aspx),  and  Agricultural  and  Envi-
ronmental  Data Archive (AEDA) (http://www.environmentdata.org/). 
The content distributions of the top eight repositories by content type 
are presented in Table 3.

6. Conclusions 

addressing  data  quality.  For  this  reason,  it  is  necessary  to  continue 
developing metrics such as the one proposed by F-UJI and methodolo-
gies  such  as  the  one  proposed  in  this  study  that  favour  not  only  the 
availability of data but also that they are really useful to use, share, and 
reuse. 

Regarding F-UJI, as mentioned by its creators, it is a continuously 
developing tool. Automatic testing of research data objects is based on 
the FAIR ecosystem, and its success depends on automatic testing with 
clear criteria that can be evaluated using machines.

2.  However,  the  methodologies  of  some  studies  mention  the  use  of 
tools,  such  as  the  F-UJI  to  analyse  datasets  drawn  from  a  specific 
scientific area. These studies employed this approach only for small 
datasets.

Question: %INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the provided pieces of context to answer the query in less than 400 words. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

%Query
Query: "What are the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Fliping, Roating, Scaling)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any information about data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to your query.

However, common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, zooming, shearing, and brightness adjustments. These techniques help increase the size of training datasets and improve model performance by introducing variations in input data.
