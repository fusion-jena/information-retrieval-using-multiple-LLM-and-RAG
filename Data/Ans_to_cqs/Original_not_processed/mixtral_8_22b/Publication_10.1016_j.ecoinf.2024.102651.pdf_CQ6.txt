tion and Transformer, effectively extracts richer semantic features (Xie 
et al., 2024). A network based on CNN and ViT modules classified mi-
croorganisms with an accuracy of 67.62% (Dwivedi et al., 2024).

The proposed classification network in this paper demonstrates su-
perior performance on the dataset, as indicated by the results presented 
in Table 3. In each classification network, the accuracy for the “medium” 
is consistently higher than that for the “small”. Besides, the experimental 
data in Table 3 also indicates that the classification network proposed 
achieves the highest classification accuracy among the “medium”  and 
“small”.  In  our  proposed  model,  the  classification  accuracy  for  both 
“medium”  and “small”  is improved by 3.56% and 2.93% respectively, 
compared to the ResNet50 and ViT. Additionally, the classification ac-
curacy for the “medium” is 5.6% higher compare with the “small” in the 
CA-Hybrid network.

Compared with ViT, CNN has stronger local information extraction 

ability.  In  particular,  the  residual  structure  of  ResNet  connects  the 
different network layers via shortcut, which not only preserves the input 
features  but  also  addresses  the  degradation  problem  of  the  deep 
network, thus mitigating issues such as vanishing or exploding gradi-
ents. The residual structure can help the network to learn the features in 
the input image better, thereby improving the classification effect of the 
network. 

Different classes of objects of the same species have high similarities. 
To better classify objects, CA-Hybrid network is constructed for Cervidae 
classification, based on ResNet and ViT, with the integration of CAM into 
the residual structure of ResNet. The structure of the CA-Hybrid network 
is shown in Fig. 4.

CA-Hybrid network based on CNN and ViT (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) is 
constructed as the classification network to precisely categorize Cervi-
dae  localized  by  YOLOv7.  Within  the  CA-Hybrid  network,  by  intro-
ducing the CAM (Woo et al., 2018) in the CNN, the network was able to 
focus more on critical features, which boosted the generalization ability 
of the model. Finally, when utilizing the same classification network for 
both small  objects(pixels less than 32*32) and  medium objects(pixels 
between 32*32 and 96*96) to evaluate the influence of image size on 
classification performance, the medium objects achieved higher classi-
fication  accuracy  compared  to  small  objects  under  identical  network. 
Furthermore, by comparing the performance of our monitoring pipeline 
with  object  detection  networks,  the  effectiveness  of  the  pipeline  was 
demonstrated. The pipeline effectively resolves the issue of background

Helpful Answer: Unfortunately, there isn't any specific mention of preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning models discussed in the given text. However, generally speaking, common preprocessing steps include data normalization, scaling, cleaning, augmentation, and splitting datasets into training and testing sets. Data normalization involves transforming the data so it fits within a specific range, often between 0 and 1. Scaling adjusts the values measured on different scales to a standard scale. Cleaning removes noise from the data, while augmentation increases the amount of training data through techniques like rotation, zooming, flipping, etc. Lastly, splitting datasets ensures that the model doesn't overfit or underfit during training.
