Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

grass rush pasture in GMEP. However, if contextual datasets were pro-
vided, these classes could be absorbed in appropriate wetland classes in
the mapping, thus reducing discrepancies with GMEP data.

using EO-data in Wales (Lucas et al., 2011) also show lower accuracies
for detailed classes such as neutral grasslands and scrub.

datasets.

2) Discriminate dominant Vegetation Types (VT), again using mainly
EO-datasets, within the areas mapped as a natural/semi-natural
vegetated land cover.

3) Translate VTs to habitat classes to generate detailed habitat maps

using knowledge-based rules and contextual information.
4) Merge these detailed classes into broader habitat categories.

Each module can be used or adapted depending on user requirements
and available datasets, noting that specific layers (e.g., VTs) can be
generated using data and methods suitable and appropriate for the focal
area (e.g., nation or region).

2.2. Wales as a case study

minimizing inconsistencies in contextual datasets as well as taxonomical systems. The flexible structure of the
FAO LCCS hierarchical framework is also highlighted, emphasizing its adaptability for future improvements in
habitat mapping by incorporating contextual datasets and more advanced algorithms that can improve EO-
derived land cover descriptions.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of Earth Observation (EO) datasets multiple times. This suggests that remote sensing techniques, which involve the use of satellite or airborne sensors, might be employed to gather data. Additionally, the mention of 'contextual datasets' implies that supplementary data sources, possibly including publicly available datasets, may also contribute to the data collection process. Nonetheless, without further clarification, it cannot be definitively stated what specific methods or tools are used for data collection.
