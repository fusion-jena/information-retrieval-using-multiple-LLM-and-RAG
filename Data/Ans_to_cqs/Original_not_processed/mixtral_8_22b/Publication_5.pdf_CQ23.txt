Korea for model training and testing. TensorFlow (https://tensorflow.org (accessed on 24 June 2021)), which is an end-to-end open source platform for DL, was used to develop our species richness estimation model. In developing DL models, there are several hyperparameters that need to be tuned prior to training the model, but there are common sets of rules or heuristics governing parameter tuning. After iterative grid search parameter tuning, using a small subset of our data, 5 hidden layers (ùêáùëó,ùëó=1,2,‚ãØ,5) were used, and the number of neurons (n) in Remote Sens. 2021, 13, 2490

Due to the unique characteristics of neural networks, which solve problems by ex-
ploiting the hidden relationships inherent in multiple input variables, it was difÔ¨Åcult to
physically quantify the importance of the input variables. As an alternative, we performed
a statistical feature importance test (SFIT) to explain which feature had the greatest sig-
niÔ¨Åcance in the species richness retrievals and to determine the optimized features in
an operational retrieval system. For the SFIT, a single feature was randomly shufÔ¨Çed,
while all the other features were kept constant. We iterated this process by changing the
test variable. The feature importance shows the extent to which the model performance
decreased with random shufÔ¨Çing. In this study, we used the root mean square error (RMSE)
as the performance metric.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, some clues can be found regarding the use of diverse datasets and parameter tuning techniques.

Firstly, the authors mention using a dataset from Korea for model training and testing, suggesting they employed a geographically diverse dataset. This could help improve the model's ability to generalize across different regions.

Secondly, the authors discuss using TensorFlow for developing their species richness estimation model. They also mention performing iterative grid search parameter tuning using a small subset of their data. These steps indicate that the researchers took care in selecting appropriate parameters for their model, which may contribute to its overall robustness and generalizability.

Lastly, while not explicitly mentioned, the authors might have utilized cross-validation or stratified splitting during the development of their deep learning model. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into subsets and repeatedly fitting the model to different combinations of these subsets. Stratified splitting ensures that each subset maintains the same class distribution as the original dataset. Both techniques can help assess the model's performance and generalizability more accurately.

In conclusion, although the text does not directly state the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, it suggests the use of diverse datasets and careful parameter tuning. Additionally, the possibility exists that the authors implemented cross-validation or stratified splitting techniques during model development.
