However,  using  large  kernel  convolutions  usually  leads  to  over-
whelming computational complexity, resulting in a sharp increase in the 
number  of  network  parameters  and  network  computational  load.  To 
overcome this issue, we used dilated convolution (Yu and Koltun, 2016) 
and depthwise separable convolution to reduce computations. Dilated 
convolution can increase the receptive field of the convolution kernel by 
inserting “holes”  without adding parameters or increasing the compu-
tational load. The equation for calculating the receptive field of dilated 
convolution  is  shown  in  Eq.  (4),  where  n  represents  the  size  of  the 
receptive field and d represents the dilation rate.

et  al.,  2023)  and  amplitude-modulated  stochastic  perturbation- 
underwater object detection (AMSP-UOD) (Zhou et al., 2024)), as well 
as  the  transformer-related  algorithm  (RT-DETR).  Due  to  the  varying 
structures of different object detection algorithms, some algorithms may 
not  achieve  optimal  results  when  using  a  uniform  set  of  hyper-
parameters.  Therefore,  we  trained  the  various  networks  using  the 
default parameters preset in the MMDetection framework until the al-
gorithms fully converged, which means that the detection accuracy did 
not  improve  further.  The  hyperparameter  settings  of  different  object 
detection algorithms (e.g., the optimizer and learning rate) are detailed 
in Table 2, where SGD represents the stochastic gradient descent and 
AdamW  represents  the  adaptive  moment  estimation  weight  decay

Owing to the insufficient clarity of underwater optical images, gen-
eral deep learning networks have difficulty capturing accurate feature 
information and cannot detect objects correctly. The original YOLOv8 
network  uses  the  C2f  module  for  feature  extraction.  However,  this 
module employs an split  operation on features after convolution. This 
operation divides the input data into two non-overlapping parts, making 
it  difficult  to  obtain  comprehensive  and  rich  feature  information 
through half of the channel’s features. Specifically, the shape of features 
F obtained after convolution is ℝN×H×W×C, where N represents the batch 
size, C represents the channel number, and H and W denote the height 
and width, respectively. The split  operation evenly divides F  into two 
parts on the channel dimension with shapes of ℝN×H×W×0.5C, and these 
two parts do not overlap. The original YOLOv8 convolves only half of

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The hyperparameters used in the deep learning models vary depending on the specific algorithm employed. For instance, the original YOLOv8 network uses the C2f module for feature extraction, but it has limitations in obtaining comprehensive and rich feature information due to its use of a split operation on features after convolution. Different object detection algorithms, such as ResNet50, Two-stage detector, Single-stage detector, Transformer detector, and others, were trained using default parameters preset in the MMDetection framework until they fully converged. These hyperparameters include the optimizer and learning rate. Detailed hyperparameter settings for different object detection algorithms are presented in Table 2. Some examples of optimizers mentioned are Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adaptive Moment Estimation Weight Decay (AdamW).
