C.  Results 

  As  Table  III  show  all  models  performed  reasonably  well 
with macro-F1 averages above 91%. Because the models are to 
be deployed on IoT edge devices, the size of each model is an 
important  consideration.  As  Table  III  shows 
the  best 
performing model was Inception-V3 with a macro Average F1 
score of 0.93, and the smallest size of 175 MB.

The  purpose  of  research  reported  here  is  to  automatically 
classify  images  retrieved  from  camera  traps  and  to  send  the 
species information instantly to the concerned authorities using 
deep learning and edge analytics. This research is aligned with 
UN  sustainable  goal  15,  “Life  on  Land”  that  focuses  on 
promoting and restoring sustainability on land. This approach 
will  help  accelerate  research  to  address  biodiversity  loss 
because  scientists  will  be  able  to  acquire  this  data  faster  and 
cheaper.

Inception-V3,  MobileNet-V2,  ResNet-18,  and  DenseNet-
121, were all trained on this data. All architectures were pre-
initialized  to  ImageNet  weights.  Initially,  the  models  were 
trained by freezing the feature extraction layers and training the 
classification layers only. However, better results where the F1-
score  improved  by  about  20-30%,  were  obtained  when  both 
feature extraction and classifier layers of each architecture were 
configured to be trainable. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) 
was  used  as  the  optimizer  for  all  four  models.  Other  hyper-
parameters like batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs 
were  obtained  using  the  grid  search.    The  models  were 
implemented  using  Keras  (https://keras.io/).  The  resulting 
hyperparameters for each model are shown in Table II.

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model is to automatically classify images retrieved from camera traps and send species information instantly to the concerned authorities using edge analytics. This aligns with UN Sustainable Goal 15, which aims to promote and restore sustainability on land. By enabling faster and cheaper acquisition of data, this approach can help accelerate research into addressing biodiversity loss. Specifically, the deep learning models used include Inception-V3, MobileNet-V2, ResNet-18, and DenseNet-121, all of which were trained on the same dataset and initialized with ImageNet weights. These models were implemented using Keras and configured to have both feature extraction and classifier layers as trainable.
