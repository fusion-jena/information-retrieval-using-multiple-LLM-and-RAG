reduction reaching as low as (cid:0) 0.632 compared to the baseline. The most 
prominent disparity is observed in the boundary region, particularly in 
proximity  to  nearby  buildings.  The  Iteration  II  (Fig.  7c)  focuses  on 
increasing the density of trees to improve the restorative potential. Since 
the western and southern parts of the park already have sufficient tree 
cover, our primary focus is to intensify tree plantation in the northern, 
eastern,  and central  areas while aligning  with the  size  and  species of 
existing trees. The change resulted in slight improvements (Fig. 7h) in 
the restorative potential, particularly in the central areas. Iteration III 
(Fig. 7d) replaces some vegetation with water in the central area due to 
the park’s lack of water landscape. The results (Fig. 7i) also indicate a 
negligible impact, with the maximum difference from the baseline being 
just 0.05.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding the specific steps taken for model serialization or platform selection.
