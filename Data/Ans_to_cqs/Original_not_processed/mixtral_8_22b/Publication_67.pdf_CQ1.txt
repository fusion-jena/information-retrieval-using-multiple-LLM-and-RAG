(1) Database construction phase: ﬁve training datasets were built with examples of images with
diﬀerent levels of tree cover, continuous and discrete approximations, and inclusion of auxiliary
class “Non-Forest” (see Section 2.2 and Supplementary Material, Archive S2).

(2) Training phase: training ﬁve CNN models based on Inception v.3 using two optimization

techniques, transfer learning, and data augmentation (see Section 2.3).

(3) Classiﬁcation phase: classiﬁcation of new 396 images with diﬀerent tree cover in global drylands
(see Supplementary Material, Table S1 and Archive S3) with the built CNN-based model (see
Section 2.4).

(4) Validation phase: assessment of performance on the new images (see Section 2.5).

2.2. Datasets Design

Before building the training datasets for the CNN-based models, we compiled a global database

of very high resolution satellite and aerial RGB images from two sources:

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The study utilizes two main sources for collecting raw data: Google Earth and the Northwestern Polytechnic University (NWPU)-Remote Sensing Image Scene Classification (RESISC45) dataset. Google Earth is used to gather very high-resolution satellite and aerial RGB images, while the RESISC45 dataset provides additional image samples for training purposes. These sources contribute to the creation of five distinct training datasets, which include examples of images with different levels of tree cover, both continuous and discrete approximations, and an auxiliary class labeled as 'Non-Forest.' This approach ensures a diverse range of input data for the deep learning pipeline.
