2.4. Model validation 

The model's performance was  evaluated using the Area Under the 
receiver-operator  Curve  (AUC).  The  AUC  values  range  from  0  to  1, 
where values closer to 1 indicate a higher accuracy of model prediction 
(Fielding and Bell, 1997). In addition to the AUC, the True Skill Statistics 
(TSS) was calculated. TSS values range between (cid:0) 1 and + 1. A TSS value 
of +1 means complete agreement between observed and predicted dis-
tributions, whereas values of ≤0 denote no better than random perfor-
mance  (Allouche  et  al.,  2006).  AUC  and  TSS  are  the  methods  most 
commonly used to assess the model performance in species distribution 
model studies (e.g., Gaier and Resasco, 2023; Mondanaro et al., 2023; 
Song and Estes, 2023).

(0–0.335),  medium

(0.336–0.665), and good (0.666–1).

et  al., 2014). Further details on how to  get our  presence data can be 
found in the Data Availability section. The questionnaire included also 
details  on  sightingh  sites  such  as  habitat  features  and  number  of 
encountered  specimens,  and  percentages  on  the  total  number  of  re-
sponses were computed for each of these values.

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, it appears that the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves evaluating the model using two metrics: the Area Under the receiver-operator Curve (AUC) and the True Skill Statistics (TSS).

The AUC values range from 0 to 1, where values closer to 1 indicate a higher accuracy of model prediction. This metric helps in understanding the overall performance of the model.

On the other hand, the TSS values range between -1 and +1. A TSS value of +1 means complete agreement between observed and predicted distributions, whereas values of ≤0 denote no better than random performance. This metric provides insights into how well the model predictions align with the actual observations.

Moreover, the context mentions that the AUC and TSS are the methods most commonly used to assess the model performance in species distribution model studies. However, it does not explicitly state when or how frequently these metrics are used during the training process. Therefore, while we know that these metrics are used to evaluate the model, the exact strategy for monitoring the model performance during training remains unclear based solely on the provided context.
