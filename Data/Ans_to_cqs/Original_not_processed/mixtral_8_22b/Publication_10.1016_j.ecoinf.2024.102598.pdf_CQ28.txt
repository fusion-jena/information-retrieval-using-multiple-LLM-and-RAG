To  address  spatial  sampling  biases  and  spatial  autocorrelation  chal-
lenges in the analysis, we employed a bootstrapping approach using the 
spThin package in R (Aiello-Lammens et al., 2019). To achieve a 1 km 
spatial resolution for the modeling exercise, we conducted 50 iterations 
of  bootstrapping  using  a  minimum  thinning  distance  of  1  km.  This 
process  resulted  in  obtaining  12,577  unique  locations.  This  approach 
effectively minimized  the removal of records while significantly miti-
gating sampling bias (Aiello-Lammens et al., 2015; Radosavljevic and 
Anderson,  2014).  Spatially-constrained  and  combined  methods  for 
generating  background  points  show  greater  efficacy  in  modeling  out-
comes  despite  ongoing  debates  regarding  the  optimal  method  for 
generating them (Shipley et al., 2022). For this modeling exercise, we 
used Arc Map 10.3 (ESRI, Redlands, CA), employing a combined method
