Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

The original implementation of PConv network required a two-phase 
training process (Liu et al., 2018). This is because the generated holes 
presented  a  problem  for  batch  normalization  layer  when  computing 
mean  and  variance  of  the  hole  pixels.  In  this  study,  all  models  were 
trained in a single process while freezing the batch normalization layer 
in the encoder part as the network used pre-trained weights with a small 
batch size of 1. The models were optimized using Adam optimizer with a 
learning rate of 0.0002 while using relu activation for encoder part and 
leakyRelu  activation  for  the  decoder  part  of  the  network.  All  models 
were  trained  for  50  epochs.  For  each  training  epoch,  a  model  was 
evaluated using the validation set and was saved as the best model based 
on a validation loss.

image with ImageNet values and then rescaled between 0 and 1. Since 
our dataset was balanced, both networks were trained with a learning 
rate of 0.03, cross-entropy loss as a loss function optimized by Adam

3.3.3. Classification 

Pretrained classification models such as VGG16 have demonstrated 
to perform well on various plant species identification tasks (Pang and 
Lim,  2019).  To  train  our  classification  model,  we  adapted  the  vgg16 
network  pre-trained  on  ImageNet  dataset  (Simonyan  and  Zisserman, 
2014). The fully connected layers of the networks were replaced with a 
global max-pooling layer, a dropout layer with a dropout ratio of 0.5 as a 
network regularizer and single hidden layer with a total of 256 units for 
a larger image sized model(512 × 512) and 128 units for a smaller image 
size model (256 × 256). Both networks were trained for 20 epochs with 
a  batch  size  of 32  and  various data augmentation  techniques such as 
height and width shift, flipping, zooming and brightness changes were

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be applied to improve its performance. These include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization involves transforming the data into a standard format, often by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. Scaling refers to adjusting the range of features to ensure they contribute equally during training. Cleaning involves removing or correcting any inconsistencies or errors in the data.

In the given context, it is mentioned that the input images were preprocessed by mean centering the image with ImageNet values and then rescaling them between 0 and 1. Mean centering is a form of normalization where the average value of the pixel intensities is subtracted from each pixel intensity. Rescaling is a type of scaling where the pixel intensities are adjusted to fall within a specific range, typically between 0 and 1. Additionally, various data augmentation techniques such as height and width shifts, flips, zooms, and brightness changes were also applied. Data augmentation is not strictly a preprocessing step but rather a technique used to increase the amount of available training data and reduce overfitting.
