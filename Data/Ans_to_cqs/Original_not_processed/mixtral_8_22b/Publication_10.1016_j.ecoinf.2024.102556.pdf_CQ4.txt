to learn features of various sizes, leading to potential matching errors 
when the scale of the target changes. To address these shortcomings, it is 
imperative  to  introduce  a  multiscale  feature-extraction  network 
(MSNet).

Inspired  by  Res2Net,  a  novel  residual  network  structured  with 
Res2Net modules and group convolution was introduced to replace the 
FEN in the Deep SORT algorithm. This enhancement refines the multi-
scale representation in the Deep SORT FEN, achieving a more intricate 
and detailed level of feature-extraction.

The conventional residual structure is shown in Fig. 7(a) involves an 
initial dimension reduction through a 1 × 1 convolutional kernel, fol-
lowed by feature-extraction using a 3 × 3 convolutional kernel. Subse-
quently,  the  dimensionality  was  increased  by  another  1  × 1 
convolutional  kernel,  and  the  results  were  combined  with  shortcut 
branches.  Although this traditional residual structure effectively miti-
gates  the  degradation  associated  with  an  increase  in  the  number  of 
network  layers,  it  falls  short  in  terms  of  deep  exploration  and  MSF 
integration.  By  contrast,  the  residual  structure  within  the  Res2Net 
framework  was  combined  with  group  convolution,  as  illustrated  in 
Figure  Fig.  7(b)  follows  a  different  approach.  It  begins  with  initial 
downscaling  through  a  1  × 1  convolution  kernel.  The  downsampled 
feature  maps  were  then  organized  into  different  channel  dimensions,

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't any information about specific data augmentation techniques used in the given context. However, some common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, translation, and color space transformations. These techniques help improve model performance and prevent overfitting by increasing the diversity of training data without collecting new images or videos.
