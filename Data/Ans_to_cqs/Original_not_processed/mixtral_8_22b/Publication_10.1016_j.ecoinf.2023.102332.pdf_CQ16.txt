A total of 978 hiking trails were associated with textual data, cor-
responding  to  86.7%  of  the  collected  data,  with  an  average  text 
description  length  of  14  words  (SD  = 28.6).  Half  of  the  trails  were 
recorded in the summer months from June to August (481 trails), and 
34% of the trails fell on weekends (Supplementary Materials, Fig. S3). 
The maximum number of trails uploaded by a single user was 30, while 
207  users  uploaded  only  one  trail  over  the  four-year  study  period. 
Moreover, 183 unique words occurred at least three times in total and in 
a  positive  context,  with  a  cumulative  frequency  of  3553.  The  words 
“view”,  “trail”  and  “walk”  were  the  most  frequent  unigrams  and  no 
negative words such as “sad” or “boring” were found in the final dataset 
(Supplementary Materials, Fig. S4). There was a significant difference in 
the  contents  between  the  two  corpora  Wikiloc  and  ukWaC  (x2  =

Wikiloc  trails  available  in  Auvergne  were  selected  for  the  years 
2017–2020  resulting  in  1128  trails  uploaded  by  446  users.  We  pre- 
filtered  the  data  by  1)  keeping  only  the  trails  that  were  assigned  by 
users as hiking trails, 2) removing those without associated text data, 
and 3) applying the “Trail-User-Days” (TUD) measure (i.e., a single trail 
per  user per  day),  introduced  by  Chai-allah  et  al.  (2023)  to  filter the 
social media data to represent a day trip. After pre-filtering 978 hiking 
trails from 388 users remained for further use (see three examples pre-
sented in Table S1 in the Supplementary Materials). Finally, the data sets 
were anonymized and any unnecessary metadata was removed.

1,520,366,  df  = 17,317,  p  < 0.001),  with  words  such  as  “hike”  and 
“trail”  appearing  more  frequently  in  the  Wikiloc  corpus  compared  to 
ukWaC corpora, reflecting the recreation-oriented use of Wikiloc (Sup-
plementary Materials, Fig. S5).

2.1. Data collection 

Wikiloc  offers  over  14  million  hiking  trails  and  has  increasing 
popularity with the number of users increasing from 3.5 million in 2019 
to over 11.3 million in 2023 (https://www.wikiloc.com). The Wikiloc 
platform  allows  users  to  record  and  share  outdoor  trails,  providing 
associated textual descriptions, photographs, and their spatial location 
(latitude and longitude) on the trail. The type of outdoor activity is also 
recorded (hiking, cycling, or running), as well as the date the trail was 
made. Wikiloc has a broad user base and potential as a data source for 
diverse CES (Callau et al., 2019; Chai-allah et al., 2023; Norman and 
Pickering, 2019). While the trails and photographs from this platform 
have  been  used  in  CES  studies  (Callau  et  al.,  2019;  Chai-allah  et  al., 
2023;  Norman  and  Pickering,  2019),  the  textual  data  remained 
unexplored.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, common practices in machine learning include monitoring metrics like validation loss, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc. A popular criterion is reaching a validation loss plateau, where the model stops improving significantly on the validation set after several epochs. Other criteria might be based on time constraints, computational resources, or achieving a satisfactory performance level on the validation set. In summary, the context does not provide explicit details regarding the completion criteria for training, but general practices involve observing various performance metrics and setting thresholds accordingly.
