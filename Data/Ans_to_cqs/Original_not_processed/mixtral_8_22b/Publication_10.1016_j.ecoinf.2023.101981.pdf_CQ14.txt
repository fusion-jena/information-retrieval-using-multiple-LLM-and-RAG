is the FFT window size. We opted for a larger FFT window size, which 
should  improve  the  resolution  at  lower  frequencies  on  which  cows 
vocalize. Finally, while Karmiris et al. (2021) used the same settings for 
detecting  the  three  ungulate  species  (e.g.,  their  minimum  frequency 
introduced  for  detecting  cow  vocalization  was  much  higher,  500  Hz, 
than the mean minimum frequency measured in our dataset, approxi-
mately 250 Hz), we fitted cow-specific parameters in the model, which 
could also partly explain why our model detected a much larger number 
of cow vocalizations.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, such as using methods like grid search or random search. However, it mentions that they opted for a larger FFT window size and fitted cow-specific parameters in the model. This suggests that some form of optimization or tuning was performed, but the specific method is not mentioned. Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot definitively state how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized.
