3. Results and discussion

of fire risk maps that exhibit enhanced efficacy in fire-sensitive forest 
ecosystems  can  be  achieved  by  utilizing  diverse  remote  sensing  data 
characterized by high spatial resolution, particularly Unmanned Aerial 
Vehicle (UAV) images incorporating multispectral bands. Additionally, 
employing  various  modeling  techniques  such  as  artificial  neural  net-
works, deep learning, and logistic regression can further contribute to 
refining these maps.

in satellite images (Al-hasn and Almuhammad, 2022; Atun et al., 2020; 
Kalkan and Maktav, 2018). For this reason, the first action taken was to 
perform atmospheric correction on the images in QGIS.

%Query
Query: "What process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model (e.g., Model serialization, Platform selection)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide information about the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate response regarding the specific steps or methods used for deploying the trained deep learning model.

Based on general practices, after training a deep learning model, it is typically serialized into a format suitable for deployment, such as ONNX, TensorFlow Lite, or PyTorch. Once serialized, the model can then be deployed onto a platform like AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, or even edge devices depending on the use case. However, without more specific details from the given context, I am unable to provide a precise answer to the query.
