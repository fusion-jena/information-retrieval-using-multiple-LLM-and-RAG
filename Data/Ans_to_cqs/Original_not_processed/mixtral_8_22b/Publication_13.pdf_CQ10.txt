of 0.6. The neural network was trained with the stochastic gradient

descent algorithm with the softmax cross-entropy loss for 300 epochs.

We used a batch size of 10 and a fixed learning rate of 0.01, and the

convergence of loss was visually assessed. The numbers of units in the

A subset of single specimens (taken from the bulk samples) were indi-

two FC layers (512 and 256 for the first and second FC layers, respec-

vidually photographed using a conventional stereoscope NIKON

tively) and the dropout rate were determined by five-fold cross-

SMZ1270i equipped with a NIKON DS-Fi3 Microscope Camera (5.9

megapixels) controlled by the NIKON DS-L4 v.1.5.0.3 control unit.

These images were denoted Local Low Quality (LL) dataset. These pho-
tographs were intended to represent a more realistic scenario of local

imaging procedure. An algorithm for domain adaptation, domain adversarial training of neural

networks (DANN), significantly improved the prediction performance of models trained by

non-standardized, low-quality images. Our findings demonstrate that existing databases can

be used to train models and successfully classify images from unexplored biota, but the imag-

ing conditions and classification algorithms need careful consideration.
