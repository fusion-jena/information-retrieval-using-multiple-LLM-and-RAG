analysis. However, while regression-based models remain prevalent (n
= 23), there was an increased use of machine learning techniques (n =
22), particularly Maxent, and, although limited, deep learning strategies
(e.g., neural networks, Cazau et al., 2023), likely suggesting a shift to-
wards machine learning methodologies (Maglietta et al., 2023). Another
notable trend was the increased incorporation of anthropogenic vari-
ables in modelling to assess the influence of human activity on species
habitat use, especially related to fishing and boating activities (n = 7
studies; e.g., Díaz L´opez and Methion, 2024).

3.6. Model results

The majority of model results consisted of species spatial predictions
(n = 241, 82%), as opposed to species spatial projections (predictions
outside the study area or time used to train the model, n = 35, 12%). In
the remaining cases, no spatial predictions or projections were made,
and modelling was conducted solely for descriptive purposes (n = 35,
12%).

4.4. The “best” modelling approach

Science and SCOPUS), curating specific search terms and synonyms and
used Boolean operators and wildcards (asterisks) to account for word
variants and plural forms. Additional information on search strategy are
provided in the Appendix A along with Table S1 showing all the terms
included in the final search. The literature search was conducted in
January 2023 and considered all studies currently available in the two
databases until 31 December 2022. We did not add any language filters/
restrictions to the search strategy developed so that scientific literature
with an abstract in English but a full text in other languages was
potentially included in the search. Except for conference proceedings,
we did not include grey literature (technical reports, dissertations)
because we wanted to limit our search to the most relevant and
advanced scientific applications on the topic, given the extensive liter-
ature already available.

Query: "What process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model (e.g., Model serialization, Platform selection)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine what process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. There is no mention of model deployment, serialization, platform selection, or any other details regarding how the trained deep learning model was deployed. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide an accurate response to this query.
