Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that several data augmentation techniques have been tested and used for improving results quickly in a deep learning pipeline. Specifically, small changes in brightness and zoom were found to significantly improve performance when dealing with images collected by UAV flights at a constant height above ground. However, medium or large changes in zoom range caused degradation of results. It is also mentioned that changing the range in height and width can turn all vegetation too close visually and create confusion for CNN. Unfortunately, the specific details regarding other data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, scaling, etc., are not explicitly stated in the provided context. Therefore, based solely on this information, I cannot provide a comprehensive list of all the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
