1.  INTRODUCTION

In [17]  we also showed that the performance of the CNN model 
can  be  improved  by  increasing  the  size  of the  training  set  using 
data  augmentation,  that  is,  the  application  of audio  deformations 
that  modify  the  audio  signal  while  maintaining  the  semantic  valid 
ity  of the  recording's  label.  Following  this,  we  apply  the  follow 
ing augmentations:  adding background  noise (from 4 different  field 

recordings  captured  at  night  containing geophony),  dynamic  range 
compression (using 4 parameterizations: music, film,  speech, radio), 
pitch shifting (by 4 conservative values of -0.5, -0.25, 0.25, 0.5 semi 
tones,  and 41ess conservative  values  of -2, -1,  1, 2 semitones),  and 
time stretching (by  4 ratios:  0.81 , 0.93,  1.07,  1.23).  The augmenta 
tions are applied using the MUDA library  [30],  to  which  the  reader 
is referred for further details about the implementation of each audio 
deformation.

Helpful Answer:

The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline for classifying migrating birds' flight calls include adding background noise, dynamic range compression, pitch shifting, and time stretching. These techniques aim to increase the size of the training set and improve the performance of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.

Adding background noise involves incorporating four different field recordings captured at night containing geophony. This helps the model generalize better when dealing with real-world scenarios where various types of background noise may be present.

Dynamic range compression is applied using four parameterizations: music, film, speech, and radio. This technique reduces the volume difference between quiet and loud sounds, making it easier for the model to identify relevant features across varying volumes.

Pitch shifting modifies the frequency content of the audio signals by applying conservative (-0.5, -0.25, 0.25, 0.5 semitones) and less conservative (-2, -1, 1, 2 semitones) shifts. This allows the model to learn more robust features that can handle variations in pitch caused by factors such as individual differences or environmental conditions.

Time stretching alters the duration of the audio signals by applying four ratios: 0.81, 0.93, 1.07, and 1.23. By changing the speed of the audio signals, the model becomes more adept at recognizing patterns regardless of their temporal characteristics.

These augmentations are implemented using the MUDA library, which provides further details regarding the specifics of each audio deformation. Overall, these data augmentation techniques help enhance the performance of the CNN model in accurately classifying migrating birds' flight calls.
