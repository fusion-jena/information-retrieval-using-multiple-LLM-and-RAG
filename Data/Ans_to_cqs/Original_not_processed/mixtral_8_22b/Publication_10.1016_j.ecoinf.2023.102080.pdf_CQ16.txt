within thematic covariate categories), and (iii) using all remainders.

Table 2 
Percentage of species (n = 50) for which a given covariate selection procedure (Em: “embedded”, Fi: “filter”, and Rd: “random”) led to the top Score value (average 
value of Somers’ D, maximum True Skill Statistic, and continuous Boyce index) for each modelling algorithm (GLM: Generalized Linear Model, GAM: Generalized 
Additive Model, and RF: Random Forest). Results are shown for all species, species with the highest number of records (3rd tercile: “More records”), species with the 
lowest number of records (1st tercile: “Less records”), species with the widest spatial coverage in Switzerland (3rd tercile: “High coverage”), and species with the lowest 
spatial coverage (1st tercile: “Low coverage”). See Supplementary material 1: Table S1 for details on species data.

Fig. 4. Average computation time (seconds) for the 50 species needed for (A) running the overall covariate selection procedure and model fitting steps under each of 
the three main covariate selection procedures (“embedded”, “filter”, and “random”), and (B) model fitting only under each of the three main covariate selection 
procedures and by modelling algorithm (GLM: Generalized Linear Model, GAM: Generalized Additive Model, and RF: Random Forest). Wilcoxon tests were used to 
assess statistical significance in differences between methods with ****: p < .0001; ***: p < .001; **: p < .01; *: p < .05; ns: non-significant.

to ceiling(log2(number of occurrences)), which, for example, results in 7 
and  14  covariates  for  species  with  100  and  14
000  occurrences, 
respectively. For species with less occurrences, rules such as one predictor 
for ten occurrences might be more parsimonious (Harrell et al., 1984). 
The default value of ncovmax  is set to 12 to limit the complexity of the 
models (Brun et al., 2020).

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the provided context, there isn't enough information to directly address the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as reaching a validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on aspects like covariate selection procedures, model algorithms, and computation times rather than the specifics of the training process itself. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based solely on the given context.
