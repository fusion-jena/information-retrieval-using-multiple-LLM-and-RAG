epochs increases, the accuracy curve shows that the model’s classifica-
tion performance improves. Fig. 6 shows two-line graphs, one for ac-
curacy and one for loss, that compare the training and validation results 
over  epochs.  The  data  points  on  the  graphs  are  based  on  the  mathe-
matical calculations that the proposed model performs on the data. The 
data points are connected by lines to show the trend and pattern of the 
model’s  performance.  The  data  points  and  lines  are  color-coded  to 
indicate whether they belong to the training or validation results. The 
blue color represents the training results, while the orange color rep-
resents the validation results. The graphs also have labels and axes to 
indicate  what  they  are  measuring  and  how  they  are  scaled.  The  left 
graph  is  labeled  “Accuracy”  and  measures  the  percentage  of  correct 
predictions made by the model. The right graph is labeled “Loss”  and

means that the model remembered the training data too well and was 
not able to adapt well to the validation data. Dropout is used to help the 
model reduce the gap between the training and validation results and 
improve its generalizability.

measures the amount of error made by the model. The X-axis represents 
the number of epochs, which are the iterations of the training process. 
The  Y-axis  represents  the  values  of  accuracy  or  loss,  which  are  the 
metrics of the model’s performance.

The  accuracy  and  loss  curves  depicted  in  Fig.  6  provide  valuable 
insights into the performance and training progress of our plant image 
classification model. These curves show the relationships between the 
number of epochs (training iterations) and the corresponding accuracy 
and loss values. The accuracy graph shows how well the model predicts 
the correct labels, while the loss graph shows how much error the model 
makes.  The accuracy  curve  illustrates  the  model’s  ability to  correctly 
classify  plant  leaf  images  over  successive  epochs.  As  the  number  of

Helpful Answer:

Answer: Based on the given context, there isn't a specific criterion mentioned for determining when training is complete. However, we can infer from the information about the accuracy and loss curves that these metrics play a crucial role in evaluating the model's performance during training. Typically, training continues until the model reaches optimal performance, often indicated by a stable or plateauing validation loss. In this case, the accuracy curve shows improvement with increasing epochs, suggesting that the model's classification performance improves over time. Similarly, the loss curve would ideally decrease and eventually stabilize, indicating reduced errors in predictions. Therefore, monitoring both accuracy and loss trends can be useful in deciding when to stop training. Additionally, techniques like dropout can be employed to improve the model's generalization and prevent overfitting, ensuring it adapts well to unseen data.
