the  shortcut  connections  within  the  network  that  makes  the  training 
faster; bottleneck architecture which consists of a 1 × 1 convolutional 
layer  for  dimension  reduction,  3  × 3  convolution  layer  for  feature 
extraction, and another 1 × 1 convolutional layer for dimension resto-
ration;  shortcut  connections  which  allows  gradients  to  flow  directly 
through  the  network  due  to  the  input  added  directly  to  the  output; 
global  average  pooling  (GAP)  which  computes  spatial  average  of  the 
feature  maps  at  the  end  section  of  the  convolutional  layer;  and  skip 
connections which bypass multiple residual blocks. On the other hand, 
InceptionV3 is a 48-layer 24 CNN containing 24 × 106 parameters with 
enhancement using label smoothing and factorized convolutional layers

Approach  2  utilized  the  raw  bivalve  images  as  inputs  to  the  opti-
mized pre-trained networks of EfficientNet-B0, ResNet101, MobilNetV2, 
and InceptionV3. Unlike Approaches 1 and 3, Approach 2 has no PCA- 
NCA  integration  as  the  extraction  of  features  was  not  manually  per-
formed, rather the built-in architecture of these four pre-trained deep 
networks  (Fig.  3)  extracted  millions  of  possible  features  that  are  not 
visible to human eyes for visual discrimination. Despite this supposedly 
advantageous  aspect  of  the  image-based  pre-trained  network,  only 
EfficientNet-B0 and InceptionV3 resulted in a 1.135 and 1.009 increase 
factor in accuracy as compared to its equivalent model to Approach 1 
(Table  1).  This  resulted  in  InceptionV3  being  the  most  accurate  and 
sensitive  model  in  Approach  2  with  scores  of  90.13%  and  87.45% 
respectively (Table 1, Fig. 9). The 9.87% Hamming loss of InceptionV3 is

Helpful Answer:
The given context primarily discusses various aspects of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), specifically focusing on their application in Approach 2 of a certain study involving bivalve images. From the context, it can be inferred that the data format used in this deep learning pipeline is image data.

The text mentions several pre-trained networks such as EfficientNet-B0, ResNet101, MobileNetV2, and InceptionV3, which are known to work well with image data. These networks use raw bivalve images as inputs and extract millions of possible features that might not be visible to the human eye. This process is facilitated by the built-in architectures of these deep networks.

Furthermore, the context refers to global average pooling (GAP), which is typically applied to the outputs of convolutional layers in a CNN. GAP computes the spatial average of the feature maps at the end section of the convolutional layer. This operation is commonly used when dealing with image data.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we can conclude that the data format used in this deep learning pipeline is image data. Other data formats like audio, video, or CSV files are not mentioned or implied in the given context.
