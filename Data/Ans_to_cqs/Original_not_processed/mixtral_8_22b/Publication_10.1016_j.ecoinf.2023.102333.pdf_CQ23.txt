A search space of the primary hyperparameters was defined. Opti-
mization  algorithms  were executed to  find  the  highest  accuracy from 
1,788,160  hyperparameter  combinations.  Our  model  was  trained  for 
200 epochs for each trial to find three DNN architectures that were used 
to  build  three  models  and  train  them  for  the  entire  dataset  for  1000 
epochs (Table 2).

adjustable parameters that control network architecture, optimization 
procedure,  and  regularization.  Common  hyperparameters  include 
number of layers and nodes, learning rate, dropout rate, etc. However, 
optimizing  model hyperparameters  remains imperative  for leveraging

3.1. DNN Architecture optimization 

The  optimization  process  considers  three  main  factors.  The  main 
factor is the model’s accuracy when tested using the validation dataset. 
Computation time and costs is the second deciding factor, as both can 
add up over time with the increasing complexity of models and datasets. 
Efficient  methods  for  hyperparameter  optimization  are  necessary  to 
obtain high-performing models while leading to more efficient utiliza-
tion of computational resources. Lastly, commonalities and differences 
between  hyperparameters  can  better  highlight  the  impact  of  each 
hyperparameter on the model’s performance.

2.7. Accuracy assessment 

The  model  with  the  best  accuracy  was  retained  after  training  the 
three main DNN models for 200 epochs. An overall accuracy measure 
was conducted to evaluate the accuracy level of our final DNN model 
using  our  validation  dataset.  A  confusion  matrix  was  produced  to 
highlight the accuracy of each class. Three quality metrics were added: 
Overall  Accuracy  (OA),  Producer  Accuracy  (PA),  and  User  Accuracy 
(UA). 

Overall accuracy is the ratio of the sum of correctly classified pixels 
to  the  total  number  of  pixels  in  the  test  dataset.  While  the  producer 
accuracy refers to the accuracy from the point of view of the mapmaker, 
the user’s accuracy represents the probability that a pixel classified in 
each  category  corresponds to  the  actual  category  on  the  ground.  The 
performance  of  our  final  DNN  model  was  evaluated  using  the  kappa 
coefficient of agreement (Landis and Koch, 1977):

Helpful Answer:

From the given context, it appears that several measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. These measures include:

1. Hyperparameter Optimization: The authors performed a comprehensive search through a large space of hyperparameters (1,788,160 combinations) to find the optimal configuration for their model. This process helps to prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.

2. Validation Dataset: The authors used a separate validation dataset to assess the performance of their model during the training phase. By evaluating the model's accuracy on this independent set of data, they could gauge its ability to generalize to unseen examples.

3. Confusion Matrix and Quality Metrics: To further evaluate the model's performance, the authors employed a confusion matrix and additional quality metrics such as Overall Accuracy (OA), Producer Accuracy (PA), and User Accuracy (UA). These tools provide insights into the model's strengths and weaknesses across different classes, which can help identify potential areas for improvement and guide efforts to enhance generalizability.

However, based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of specific techniques like diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting being employed to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. It is possible that these methods were utilized but not explicitly mentioned in the excerpts provided.
