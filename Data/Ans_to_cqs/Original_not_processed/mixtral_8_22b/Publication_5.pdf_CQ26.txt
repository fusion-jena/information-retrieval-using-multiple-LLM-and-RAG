The training process was performed for a number of iterations in which all the training
data were exposed to the network until the loss function reached its minimum value. The
model score reached its maximum after approximately 5000 iterations with a NVIDIA
Titan X GPU (3584 CUDA cores). The number of trainable parameters was 85,569 and the
computational run-time was approximately 4 h with a training batch size of 1024.

Deep learning approaches have shown promising results in many scientiﬁc applica-
tions [67,68] but do not always guarantee better outcomes [69,70]. Therefore, we compared
the performance of the proposed DL model with a RF regression model as a baseline, since
RF showed reasonable results and is popular in various machine learning applications [71].
To determine the best values of the hyperparameters (number of trees, maximum tree
depths, and the maximum number of features) in the RF model, a grid search was used.

history, culture, geography, and scientiﬁc interests [14]. Our novel data fusion approach
shows potential for overcoming these data limitations.

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention or discussion about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it can be inferred from the text that some form of data preprocessing has been done before feeding the data into the deep learning model. For instance, the use of a grid search to find the optimal hyperparameters for the Random Forest model suggests that the dataset might have undergone some sort of partitioning or sampling. Nevertheless, without further information, it cannot be confirmed if this was specifically aimed at addressing data bias. It would be advisable to refer to other sources or consult domain experts for more accurate information regarding the application of these techniques in the context of deep learning pipelines.
