2.2. Data and platforms 

The initial LULC classification was done using Google Earth Engine 
(GEE),  a  cloud  processing  platform  which  provides  a  public  catalog 
containing  petabytes  of  satellite  imagery  and  geospatial  datasets, 
allowing for high performance and rapid planetary scale processing and 
analysis  of  images.  The  platform  allows  for  access,  selection,  and

%Query
Query: "What is the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no information available regarding the specific data repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in this research. It appears that the authors have not shared any links to repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF containing their deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a direct link to the requested resource.
