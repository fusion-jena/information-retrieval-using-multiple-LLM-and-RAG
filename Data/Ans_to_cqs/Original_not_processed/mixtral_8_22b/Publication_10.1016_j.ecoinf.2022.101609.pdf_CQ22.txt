4.3.3. Model evaluation 

In this section, the results of the deep learning model developed are 
presented. The model was trained to make day-ahead predictions of the 
three pollutants, but first, an appropriate evaluation metric had to be 
selected.  The  top  metrics  for  regression  problems  are  mean  squared 
error/root  mean  squared  error  (MSE/RMSE),  mean  absolute  error

number of epochs. It is worth noting that there was a gradual decrease in both 
losses  as  the  training  epochs  increased  which  indicates  that  the  model  was 
learning. Further training beyond 20,000 epochs would have either resulted in 
overfitting or no further drop in both losses.

the  database  performance,  the  test  was  run  between  November  2020 
and  Jan  2021  on  the  GPU  instance  and  evaluated  for  utilisation, 
execution count, number of running statements and number of sessions 
metrics as shown in Fig. 15. The maximum GPU utilisation was under 
20% even with over 1.5 million execution queries.

an evaluation using the validation dataset. It should be pointed out that the model's predictions are not too far off the actual readings. (For interpretation of the

Helpful Answer:

The deep learning model developed in this paper was designed to make day-ahead predictions of three pollutants. To evaluate the performance of this model, appropriate evaluation metrics needed to be selected. According to the text, the top metrics for regression problems are Mean Squared Error (MSE)/Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). However, it does not explicitly state whether these metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. Nevertheless, based on the information available, we can infer that MSE/RMSE and MAE could potentially be used to assess the performance of the deep learning model.
