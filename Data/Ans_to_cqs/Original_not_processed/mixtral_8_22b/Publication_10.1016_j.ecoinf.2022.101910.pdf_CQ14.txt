mainly three settings can be adjusted in BirdNET: the detection sensi-
tivity,  overlap  of  prediction  segments,  and  the  minimum  confidence 
threshold (Kahl et al., 2021). We set these values to 1.5 (highest allowed 
value),  1.5  s  of  overlap,  and  0.4,  respectively.  The  low  confidence 
threshold may result in increased recall and false positive rates, but the 
value employed was similar to the one used by Kahl et al. when evalu-
ating BirdNET accuracy on 984 bird species (value of 0.5, Kahl et al., 
2021).

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, it mentions that the main adjustable parameters in BirdNET are the detection sensitivity, overlap of prediction segments, and the minimum confidence threshold. These parameters were set to specific values (1.5, 1.5 seconds, and 0.4, respectively). This suggests that the optimization process might have involved manual tuning or a simple parameter sweep rather than more sophisticated techniques like grid search or random search. Nevertheless, without further details, we cannot definitively determine the exact method used for hyperparameter optimization.
