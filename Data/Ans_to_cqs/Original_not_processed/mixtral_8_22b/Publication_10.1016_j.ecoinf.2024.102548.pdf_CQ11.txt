Transfer learning is an efficient technique in deep learning that le-
verages  pre-trained  models  to  address  data  scarcity  and  accelerate 
model  training.  Our  study  employed  several  well-known  pre-trained 
models,  namely  MobileNet,  VGG-19,  EfficientNet,  ResNet-50,  Incep-
tionV3, and InceptionResNetV2, to harness their learned representations 
and adapt them to our specific classification task. These models have 
been extensively trained on large-scale datasets, allowing them to cap-
ture general features that are useful across various domains (Weiss et al., 
2016).  Transfer  learning  involves  two  main  phases:  fine-tuning  and 
feature extraction. In the feature extraction phase, the pre-trained model 
is used as a fixed feature extractor. The input image is passed through 
the model’s convolutional layers, and the output features are obtained. 
These features capture meaningful information from the image, forming

4.2. Data augmentation 

Data augmentation is a pivotal technique used to enhance the per-
formance  and  generalization  capability  of  deep  learning  models  by 
augmenting  the  training  dataset  with  artificially  generated  variations 
(Wu et al., 2017). Therefore, there are many augmentation techniques in 
the  literature  applied  especially  for  the  diagnosis  of  several  diseases

3. Deep learning techniques 

In the Deep Learning section, we delve into the technical aspects of 
our  model.  We  utilize  RNNs  to  effectively  capture  sequential  de-
pendencies in the data. RNNs, such as LSTM and GRUs, allow our model 
to retain and propagate information from previous steps, enhancing its 
understanding of sequential patterns. Additionally, we employ transfer 
learning  techniques,  initializing  our  model  with  pre-trained  weights 
from  large-scale  datasets  like  ImageNet.  This  transfer  of  knowledge 
enhances  the  model’s  performance  by  leveraging  learned  representa-
tions  from  related  tasks.  Detailed  explanations  and  implementation 
specifics of RNNs and transfer learning are provided in the subsequent 
subsections.

InceptionResNetV2 

InceptionResNetV2  is  a  fusion  of  the  Inception  and  ResNet  archi-
tectures,  combining  the  benefits  of  both  networks.  It  incorporates  re-
sidual  connections  and  parallel  convolutions  to  capture  fine-grained 
details and high-level features simultaneously. InceptionResNetV2 has 
been  pre-trained  on  extensive  datasets,  enabling  it  to  learn  compre-
hensive feature representations and achieve high performance.
