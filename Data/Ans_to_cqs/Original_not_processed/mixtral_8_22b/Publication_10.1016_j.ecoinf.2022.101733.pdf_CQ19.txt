%Query
Query: "Which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about which specific framework was used to build the deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other framework was utilized.
