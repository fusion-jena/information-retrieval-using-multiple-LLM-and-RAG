Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

3.1.3. Fire severity, combustion efficiency

Mi = Ai × BAGB × Ci × λi

(4)  

where Mi refers to the combustible material load of the i-th forest type 
(t), Ai denotes the area engulfed by fire of the i-th forest category (hm2), 
BAGB reflects the above-ground biomass per unit area (tC/hm2), Ci is the 
proportion of biomass specific to the i-th forest type, λi  stands for the 
combustion efficiency associated with the i-th type of forest resource.

within the published data ranges (min: 0.928; max: 41.2145 tons per 
hectare), confirming the dataset’s validity for the regions under study.

%Query
Query: "How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide information on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether a method such as grid search or random search was used for optimization based solely on this context.
