3.1. Dataset 

A  publicly  available  dataset  in  Roboflow  (Roboflow  Dataset,  n.d) 
named Animal2–v1 comprising 9952 images belonging to classes Bear 
(1530  images),  Deer  (966  images),  Elephant  (1684  images),  Leopard 
(1888 images), Monkey (1214 images), Tiger (1388 images) and Wild-
boar (1282 images) is used. All the images are annotated in YOLOv5 
PyTorch  format.  The  preprocessing  applied  for  the  dataset  is  auto- 
orientation  of  pixel  data  with  EXIF-format  stripping,  and  the  images 
are resized to 416 × 416 (stretch). Here, 70% of images are used for 
training,  20%  images  for  validation,  and  10%  images  are  used  for 
testing. No image augmentation techniques are applied.

The work is based on the popular YOLOv5 architecture integrated 

with a SENet attention mechanism (Zhu et al., 2021). 

The  YOLO  (You  Only  Look  Once)  is  a  simple  and  extremely  fast 
object detection algorithm that avoids a complex pipeline and considers 

• Backbone: A CNN, which acts as the main body of the network, is 
designed using the New CSP-Darknet53 (Cao et al., 2023) structure. 
It extracts key features from the input image.

%Query
Query: "What is the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of the data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that the dataset used is publicly available in Roboflow named Animal2-v1. Therefore, one can assume that the data repository link might be related to this dataset. Unfortunately, without more specific details or direct links, I cannot provide the exact data repository link for the deep learning pipeline.
