utilized for GP modeling. This software was developed by Cornell Uni-
versity’s Data Science Order and was released in 2009 (Eureqa, 2009). It 
is crucial to emphasize that GP serves multiple roles in this paper. Once 
GP is employed as the forecasting model, we extract the inputs utilized 
in  the  optimal  GP  tree  and  utilize  them  as  the  optimal  inputs  for 
modeling  with  ANN.  The  primary  reason  for  selecting  GP  as  our  IVS 
technique is its ability to simultaneously select appropriate features and 
perform modeling tasks (Althoey et al., 2023; Hu, 2023).

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the given context is not explicitly stated. However, based on the title of the research article "Comparative evaluation of LSTM, CNN, and ConvLSTM for hourly short-term streamflow forecasting using deep learning approaches," it can be inferred that the deep learning models are used for time series forecasting, specifically for predicting hourly short-term streamflow.

Time series forecasting involves analyzing historical data points to identify patterns or trends and then using those insights to predict future values. In this case, the researchers are applying various deep learning techniques such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) to analyze past streamflow data and generate accurate predictions for future hours. These methods have been widely adopted in hydrological studies due to their ability to capture complex temporal dependencies and nonlinear relationships within the data.

In summary, while the specific task (classification, segmentation, detection) is not directly addressed in the provided context, it can be deduced that the deep learning models are being used for time series forecasting to predict hourly short-term streamflows.
