required amount of training data.

1.  Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) offers many advantages comparing with other survey methods 
and gains an increasing use in terrestrial ecology, but the massive effort needed to extract species 
information  from  a  large  number  of  recordings  limits  its  application.  The  convolutional  neural 
network (CNN) has been demonstrated with its high performance and effectiveness in identifying 
sound sources automatically. However, requiring a large amount of training data still constitutes a 
challenge.

The mixed audio clips are then converted into spectrograms as input 
images for model training. The clips are transformed by applying the 
short-time Fourier transform (STFT) with a window size of 1600 sam-
ples,  hop  size  of  400  samples  (75%  overlap),  and  240  mel-scale  fre-
quency bins.  Each spectrogram thus  has a height  of 438 pixels  and a 
width of 436 pixels (Appendix S1: Fig. S4a).

Helpful Answer:
In this study, passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. PAM involves using recording devices such as microphones or hydrophones to capture sounds produced by animals or their environment. This method is advantageous compared to other survey methods due to its non-invasiveness and ability to collect data over extended periods. However, one challenge associated with PAM is the need for extensive manual labor to extract species information from large numbers of recordings. To address this issue, the authors propose using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to automate sound source identification. Despite the CNN's high performance and effectiveness, it requires a significant amount of training data. Therefore, the researchers employ a technique called data augmentation, which generates new training examples by applying various transformations to existing ones. In particular, they create mixed audio clips containing multiple target species calls and background noise, which are then converted into spectrograms for model training. These spectrograms serve as input images for the CNN, enabling it to learn features relevant to distinguishing between different sound sources. Overall, this research demonstrates how combining PAM with advanced machine learning techniques can improve our understanding of wildlife populations and ecosystem dynamics.
