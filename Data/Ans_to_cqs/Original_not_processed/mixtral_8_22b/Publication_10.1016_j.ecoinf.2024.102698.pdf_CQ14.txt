is generally developed based on a selection of input data points and the 
complex model’s response to those data points. Surrogate models can be 
highly effective, but the data points used to build the model on must be 
sampled  carefully  and  the  surrogate  model’s  parameters  need  to  be 
optimized  to  balance  variance  and  bias.  Surrogate  models  can  be 
developed  using  reduced  order  approximations,  such  as  using  radial 
basis  functions,  through  multi-fidelity  models  such  as  Kriging,  which 
combine  data  sources  of  differing  fidelity,  or  via  machine  learning 
methods (Alizadeh et al., 2020).

Description

the final synthetic site data before the latitudes and longitudes from the 
synthetic  site  data  are  used  to  find  nearest  neighbours  in  this  larger 
synthetic  sample.  The  large sample  size  means  the  sample  effectively 
covers the sample space and assures the synthetic data is estimated from 
values at very nearby sites.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide specific information about how the hyperparameters of the surrogate model are optimized. However, it mentions that the surrogate model's parameters need to be optimized to balance variance and bias. This suggests that some form of optimization technique is employed to tune these parameters. Common methods for hyperparameter tuning include grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and gradient-based optimization. Grid search involves specifying a set of values for each parameter and evaluating all possible combinations. Random search randomly samples a specified number of hyperparameter settings from predefined ranges. Bayesian optimization uses a probabilistic approach to iteratively update a posterior distribution over the objective function and select new hyperparameters based on this distribution. Gradient-based optimization techniques use gradients of the loss function with respect to the hyperparameters to guide the search process. Without more specific information, it cannot be determined which method is used for optimizing the hyperparameters of the surrogate model.
