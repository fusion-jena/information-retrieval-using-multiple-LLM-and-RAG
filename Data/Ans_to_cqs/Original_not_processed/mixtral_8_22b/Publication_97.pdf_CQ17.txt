To tune the architecture of the neural network, we tested the following combinations of parameters
(Algorithm A1, line #24), which correspond to diﬀerent U-Net architectures: num_layers = {64, 32, 16},
depth = {2, 3, 4}, layer_rate = {2, 1.5, 1.2}, batch_norm = {True, False}, residual = {True, False}, dropout
= {0, 0.5}. Thus, we performed a grid search over 216 diﬀerent U-Net-like architectures and found
several of the best ones which are suitable for forest damage segmentation.

All of the best results corresponded to the conﬁguration when the number of layers was equal to
64, and dropout was applied. The best one, whereby an additional batch normalization is applied,
corresponds to the following parameters: num_layers = 64, depth = 4, layer_rate = 2, batch_norm =
True, residual = False, dropout = 0.5.

study states that good results for image classiﬁcation problems using CNN take place when the
batch normalization is applied after a 2D-convolutional layer. Since there are no reasons to put batch
normalizations right after the dropout layer (it doesn’t transform inputs and introduce a bias), we
placed it after each convolutional layer. There are still various possible extensions to the convolutional
block. The provided architecture (Algorithm A1, CONV_BLOCK) is the closest to the original U-Net
solution that incorporates both the batch normalization and residual connection. Another important
parameter in our CNN is layer rate. This parameter deﬁnes how the number of layers will change
depending on the depth of the neural network. Its default value is 2. This means that the number of
layers is multiplied by two each time we dive one level deeper through the U-Net architecture (for
classic U-Net, we have 64, 128, 256, etc., as the number of layers). Therefore, we can not only tune the

Augmentation is an important part of the neural network learning process that resolves the
problem of overﬁtting [53,54]. Original satellite images were obtained in diﬀerent atmospheric
conditions and had slightly diﬀerent values of saturation, so we decided to use a speciﬁc augmentation
technique to expand the number of training images, and thereby improve the network performance.
As an augmentation transformation, we chose random changes of RGB channels of the original images
and random vertical and horizontal ﬂips. Random changes for each RGB channel did not exceed
0.1 by absolute value and were applied simultaneously to all channels, as it is implemented in the
utility function “apply_channel_shift” from the Keras package [54]. Random ﬂips provided additional
variability of images used for training and reduced overﬁtting. We also considered using small random
rotations in the augmentation pipeline. However, adding rotations did not improve the network

Helpful Answer:
The study uses several regularization techniques to prevent overfitting in their deep learning pipeline. One such technique is dropout, which is applied with a probability of 0.5. Dropout is a regularization method that randomly sets a fraction of input units to 0 during training, which helps prevent complex co-adaptations between neurons. Additionally, the study employs batch normalization, which accelerates deep network training by reducing internal covariate shift. Batch normalization is applied after each convolutional layer, but not after dropout layers since they do not transform inputs or introduce biases. Furthermore, the study mentions the use of data augmentation techniques, including random changes of RGB channels and random flips, to increase the variability of training images and reduce overfitting. Although the study considers using small random rotations in the augmentation pipeline, this does not improve the network's performance.
