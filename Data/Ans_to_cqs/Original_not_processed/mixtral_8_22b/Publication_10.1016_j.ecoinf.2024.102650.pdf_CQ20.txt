2.2.1. Latent Dirichlet allocation 

LDA—  proposed  by  Blei  et  al.  (2003)—is  a  topic  model  for  text 
generation based on natural language processing. The basic idea is that 
any text (in this study, microblog tweets) is composed of multiple topics 
with a polynomial distribution and each topic is composed of multiple 
words  with  a  polynomial  distribution.  By  analyzing  the  polynomial 
distribution of words for each topic, similar topics are aggregated into a 
topic category, and topic classification of the text is achieved (Tautorat 
et al., 2023). The advantage of LDA is its unsupervised nature, which 
means that the input corpus does not require labeled data, making it an 
ideal technique for topic modeling when labeled topics are not available 
and the quantity of input texts is large (Palanichamy et al., 2021; Sun 
and Yin, 2017).

%Query
Query: "Which hardware resources are used for training the deep learning model (e.g., GPUs, TPUs)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. Therefore, I cannot determine which hardware resources were utilized for training the deep learning model.
