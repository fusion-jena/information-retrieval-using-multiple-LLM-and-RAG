The network takes images with dimensions of 256 × 256 pixels and 
three  color  channels  as  input.  It  follows  a  fully  convolutional  design, 
with  each  layer  applying  2D  convolutions  using  4  × 4  filters.  Batch 
Normalization and Leaky-ReLU activation functions are used after each 
convolution  layer  to  facilitate  network  training  and  stability.  The 
encoder consists of 5 blocks, which progressively reduce the spatial di-
mensions and learn features. It starts with a convolutional layer with 32 
output channels and strides of 2, followed by a residual block. The re-
sidual block comprises a Conv-ReLU-Conv structure, where a convolu-
tional layer is followed by a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation and 
another convolutional layer. This configuration is designed to effectively 
capture  and  enhance  image  features,  serving  as  a  critical  component 
within the network's architecture. The residual block output is then fed

datasets, including the UIEB test dataset, UIEB challenge dataset, U45, 
and UCCS dataset, demonstrated the superior performance of our model 
both  qualitatively  and  quantitatively.  Notably,  the  proposed  model 
exhibited a significant performance boost, surpassing Water-Net by 5% 
in PSNR value and achieving more than a 1% improvement in SSIM for 
the  reference  image  test  dataset.  Furthermore,  the  validation  of  our 
trained model on a private underwater imaging dataset acquired from 
an open sea environment under various conditions showcased impres-
sive  performance.  This  underscores  the  substantial  potential  of  our 
model for real-time deployment on underwater vehicles. In conclusion, 
our work contributes to the field of underwater image enhancement by 
introducing  a  novel  GAN-based  model  with  integrated  spatial  and 
channel attention mechanisms. The demonstrated improvements across

structures with an increasing number of output channels, encouraging 
the network to learn complex representations. To enhance the network's 
capacity  for  capturing  fine-grained  features  and  context,  Spatial  and 
Channel Attention (SCA) modules are integrated into the architecture. 
These modules act as mechanisms for focusing on relevant spatial re-
gions  and  channel-wise  information,  respectively.  These  attention 
mechanisms are integrated at multiple stages in the network to enrich 
the feature representations. The decoder upscales the feature maps and 
fuses  information  from  the  encoder  using  skip  connections.  Each 
decoder block consists of a transposed convolutional layer to increase 
spatial  resolution,  followed  by  batch  normalization  and  ReLU  activa-
tion.  The  final  stage  of  the  network  involves  upsampling  the  feature 
maps, followed by a convolutional layer with 4 × 4 filters to produce the

score within the C-60 dataset, it falls short compared to the scores ob-
tained in the other two datasets. This discrepancy can be attributed to 
the challenging nature of the dataset, precisely due to the inclusion of 
deep water scenes with low-light visibility. Also, our method exhibited 
lower UIQM scores compared to Funie-GAN, specifically in scenes with 
greenish  color  distortions.  Our  model  encounters  limitations  in  effec-
tively enhancing images within these particular scenes, contributing to 
the observed disparity in performance across datasets. Also, our image 
enhancement  model  is  designed  to  generate  images  of  a  fixed  size 
(256×256). While this resolution is suitable for certain applications, it 
poses  a  potential  limitation  in  scenarios  requiring  larger  or  more 
detailed images. On the other hand, increasing the output image size 
would increase the model size would result in higher time and compu-
tation complexities.

Helpful Answer:
The deep learning pipeline uses several datasets for training and testing purposes. Among them are the UIEB test dataset, UIEB challenge dataset, U45, and UCCS dataset. These datasets were utilized to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model both qualitatively and quantitatively. Additionally, the trained model was validated on a private underwater imaging dataset acquired from an open sea environment under various conditions. However, it should be noted that while the model performed well on most datasets, its performance fell short on the C-60 dataset, primarily due to the challenging nature of the dataset, which includes deep water scenes with low-light visibility.
