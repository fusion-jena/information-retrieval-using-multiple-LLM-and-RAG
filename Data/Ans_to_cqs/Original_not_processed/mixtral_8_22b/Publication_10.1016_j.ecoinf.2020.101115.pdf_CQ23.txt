teroperable and Reusable) open-data principles (Wilkinson et al.,
2016), were created through a bottom-up, community based initiative.
A component of the FAIR principals requires the usage of existing
standards (e.g. INSPIRE, O&M, Darwin Core). Consequently, scientists
have implemented FAIR data repositories specifically intended for
sample and data management (Adam et al., 2019; Conze et al., 2017;
Dassi√© et al., 2017; Lehnert et al., 2006; McNutt et al., 2016). However,

critical information for digital storage: fish sampling location, date,
species, and life stage. The CM database design is centred on each
physical sample, Fig. 2. The metadata, such as fish length, weight, and
day collected, is typically written on the sample envelopes. Some en-
velopes and glass slides contained no metadata, or were labelled with
only a lab number and species. Furthermore, older labels were often
either illegible or damaged. Therefore, samples that contained the ne-
cessary critical information were prioritized to be catalogued first in the
database and repository. The internal vocabulary (and shorthand) used
during sample labelling within the MI field station changed through
time, and between researchers. Furthermore, the local vocabularies
used were often not in accordance with best practice (Hedden, 2010).
The usage of controlled vocabularies, which is a pre-defined list of
terms, enables consistent and accurate information labelling (Mao

4.6. FAIR data principles

The criteria of how the IFBA database addresses the requirements of
the FAIR (Findable, Accessible Interoperable, and Reusable) data
management principles (Wilkinson et al., 2016) can be found in
Table 2. The FAIR principals were created by a group of stakeholders
from academia, industry and funding agencies to enhance data reusa-
bility and findability by machines. In utilizing the FAIR principles, re-
searchers can allow for interoperability between their datasets.

4.7. Observations and measurements mapping

A representation of the IFBA database in the Observations and
Measurements (O&M) model has been created to comply with both the
ISO 19156 standard and the INSPIRE regulations, Fig. 4. Within O&M
model, an Observation is action whose result is an estimate of the value

Helpful Answer:

Unfortunately, there isn't enough context provided to directly address the specifics of any deep learning models being used or what measures have been taken to ensure its generalizability. However, I can provide some general insights into common practices used to improve the generalizability of deep learning models.

To ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, it is essential to use diverse datasets during training. This means including various examples representing different aspects of the problem space. For instance, if we are building a computer vision model to classify images of fish, we should include images of fish from different angles, lighting conditions, backgrounds, etc.

Cross-validation is another technique commonly employed to assess the performance of machine learning models, including deep learning ones. It involves dividing the available data into multiple subsets called folds. Each fold serves as a validation set once while the remaining folds form the training set. By repeating this process multiple times, using different folds as the validation set, we get a more robust estimation of our model's performance.

Stratified splitting is a method used when creating these folds to maintain the original distribution of classes in each subset. This ensures that each fold contains roughly the same proportion of instances from each class, preventing imbalanced datasets from affecting the model's performance evaluation.

Again, without further context regarding the specific deep learning model mentioned in the prompt, I cannot provide a detailed response about the exact methods applied to ensure its generalizability.
