and STP as a function of distance between sample sites according to Eq. 
(1).

MAE represents the total of the residuals, as described in Eq. (4): 

MAE =

1
N

∑N

[b(Yi) (cid:0) ̂b(Yi) ]

i=1

(4)  

̂
b(Yi) represents the expected value at position i. Although a low 
where 
MAE value indicates a low error, the MAE criterion does not divulge the 
amplitude of the error that might occur in any occasion. Thus, the MSE 
was estimated according to Eq. (5): 

MSE =

1
N

∑N

i=1

[b(Yi) (cid:0) ̂b(Yi) ]2

As  squaring  the  variance  at  any  point  reveals  the  magnitude,  low 

MSE values provide a more precise point-by-point estimate. 

Finally, the G parameter (Eq. (6)) provides an indication of how well 
a forecast could perform in comparison to a prediction that could have 
been made using just the sample mean: 
i=1[b(Yi) (cid:0) ̂b(Yi) ]2
∑N
[b(Yi) (cid:0) ̂b ]2

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model in the given context. The context mainly discusses image acquisition and processing, including equations for calculating Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Square Error (MSE), and the G parameter. It also includes Table 6 with R2 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values for different land uses and variables. However, it does not mention anything about the specifics of a deep learning model or its hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer.
