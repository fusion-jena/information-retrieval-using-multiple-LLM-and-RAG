Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

The performance of machine learning models was evaluated by four 
criteria:  coefficient  of  determination  (R2),  NSE  (Nash  and  Sutcliffe, 
1970), Kling–Gupta efficiency (KGE) (Gupta et al., 2009), and correla-
tion coefficient (COR) (Sardoei et al., 2024).

revised.  According  to  Table  6,  NDSI,  DFM,  and  LU  variables  are

%Query
Query: "How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, such as using methods like grid search or random search. Therefore, it cannot be determined from this context alone how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized.
