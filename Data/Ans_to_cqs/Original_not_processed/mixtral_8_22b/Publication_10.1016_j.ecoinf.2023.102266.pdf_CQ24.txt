Thus, we can conclude that for a sufficiently large n, the probability 
of obtaining the Von Neumann model is sure. Therefore, some random 
seed  exists  for  which  our  model  and  the  Von  Neumann  model  are 
equivalent. □ 

Property 4.3. Let N be an odd integer such that N = 2n + 1, and let 
the tuple of model parameters be 

Γ = (P , C, p0) = ({0, 1, 1, 1, 1}, c, p0), c⩾1, ΔID = 1 and p0 ∈ [0, 1].

Then, the probability pvn  of obtaining the Von Neumann dynamics 

depends on n and p0, and its expression is given by

Property 4.2. Let N, K ∈ N and model parameters 

P = {0, 1, 1, 1, 1}, c⩾1, ΔID = 1 and p0 = 0.5  

then some random seed value exists for which our spread model is equal 
to the Von Neumann model.

Remark  4.2. Let’s  see  what  the  probability  is,  i.e.  how  many  (ex-
pected) trials should be performed to find a seed for which we obtain the 
Von Neumann dynamics, on a small grid. Let us suppose N = 5 (i.e. n =
2) and we want to get Von Neumann’s dynamic, then we know that the 
optimal value for p0  is 

p0 =

Moreover, the probability of getting this dynamic is

= 164 (0.6)24 (1 (cid:0) 0.6)16 ≈ 1.3337 × 10(cid:0) 7  

Therefore, we should carry out 107  tests approximately to find at least 
one random seed which provides us with the same dynamic. 

Example 1. As the proof of Property 4.3 may be quite complicated, we 
will carry out an example using the same reasoning, which boils down to 
forcing the elements to be infected for each generation. Let’s assume that 
N = 5 (or n = 2), then the initial state is

Fig.  7  represents  in  Log  scale  the  probability  of  getting  the  Von 
Neumann dynamics according to n, with p0 = 0.5. We observe that the 
probability  decreases  when  n  increases,  so  even  though  such  a  seed 
exists,  it  is  computationally  expensive  to  find  it. Moreover,  thanks to 
Property 4.3 we can deduce that the optimal value for getting this dy-
namic also depends on the grid size and is

Helpful Answer:
Handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline is crucial to ensure reproducibility and consistency in results. One common strategy is fixing the random seed value, which controls the initialization of weights and biases in neural networks, as well as the shuffling of training data. By setting a fixed seed, researchers can reproduce their experiments exactly, making it easier to compare different models or hyperparameters. Another approach is to use deterministic algorithms instead of stochastic ones whenever possible. For instance, using a deterministic optimizer like SGD without momentum instead of Adam can reduce variability in results. Additionally, averaging over multiple runs with different seeds can provide more robust estimates of performance metrics. Finally, documenting all sources of randomness and reporting them alongside experimental results is essential for transparency and replicability.

Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, from general knowledge, one can infer that fixing the random seed value is a commonly used strategy to control randomness in deep learning pipelines. This ensures reproducibility and consistency in results. Other approaches include using deterministic algorithms instead of stochastic ones and averaging over multiple runs with different seeds. Documenting all sources of randomness and reporting them alongside experimental results is also important for transparency and replicability.
