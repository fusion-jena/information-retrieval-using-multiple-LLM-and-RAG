2.3.3. Experimental setting 

In our experiment, a deep learning environment based on Python and 
Tensorflow – GPU as well as CUDA was constructed under the Windows 
operating system. The deep feature loss bird noise reduction network 
model was trained for 50 epochs on an RTX 2080 Ti GPU using the Adam 
(cid:0) 4. In each 
optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014) with a learning rate of 10
epoch, the entire training set was presented in a random order, with one 
noisy bird sound signal per iteration. 

2.4. Comparative algorithms 

Using the same test  set, we compared the  denoising results of the 
deep feature loss-based bird sound noise reduction network with several 
other  bioacoustics  noise  reduction  algorithms,  namely  SEGAN, 
WebRTC, wavelet transform (Priyadarshani et al., 2016), Wiener filter 
(Loizou, 2017), and MMSE STSA (Brown et al., 2017) algorithms.

shown in Fig. 2. The dataset contained 1568 clean bird sound segments, 
with  the  duration  of  each  ranging  from  4  to  20  s.  Among  these,  we 
randomly selected 68 segments as the clean bird sound test set and used

2.3.2. Training of the bird sound noise reduction network based on deep 
feature loss

From  each  type  of  noise  in  the  noise  training  set,  we  randomly 
selected  a  noise  segment,  whose  length  was  pre-processed  for  consis-
tency with that of the clean bird sound segment randomly selected from 
the clean bird sound training set. These two segments were then mixed 
using Python to generate noisy bird sounds with different SNRs of (cid:0) 5, 0, 
5, 10, and 15 dB and a total duration of 10,088 s, the spectrograms of 
which are shown in Fig. 3. Using the same process, we generated four 
noisy bird sound test sets with SNRs of (cid:0) 5, 0, 5, 10, and 15 dB, each of 
which contained 50 different noisy bird sounds with a total duration of 
3010 s. These datasets were used to compare the denoising effects of the 
assessed  noise  reduction  algorithms,  namely,  the  deep  feature  loss 
network,  adversarial  neural  network,  Web  real-time  communications 
(WebRTC)  denoising,  MMSE  STSA,  wavelet  transform,  and  Wiener 
filtering.

Helpful Answer:
The paper does not explicitly discuss strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it mentions that during the training phase, the entire training set was presented in a random order, with one noisy bird sound signal per iteration. This suggests that some level of randomness was introduced into the model training process. Additionally, the use of the Adam optimizer, which incorporates momentum and adaptive learning rates, could also contribute to handling randomness indirectly by adjusting the learning rate dynamically based on previous iterations. Nevertheless, specific strategies for controlling or managing randomness in the deep learning pipeline are not discussed in this study.
