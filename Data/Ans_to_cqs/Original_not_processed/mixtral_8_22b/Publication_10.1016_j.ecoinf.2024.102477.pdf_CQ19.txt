5.1. Comparison of SLSTM and SGRU models 

Deep learning methods have accelerated the development of artifi-
cial intelligence and demonstrated potential in various domains (Chen 
et al., 2021). Deep learning architectures simulate neurons in the brain, 
and their ability to learn from complex data renders them the preferred 
choice for time-series prediction (Choi et al., 2021). RNNs are neural 
networks that use backpropagation techniques and short-term memory 
to  enhance  their  time-series  prediction  performance  (Kavitha  et  al., 
2023).
