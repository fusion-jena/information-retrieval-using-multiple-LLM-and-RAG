speed is increased by 11 times, and the number of parameters is reduced 
by  1/6.8  (Tan  and  Le,  2021).  Based  on  this  network,  we  designed  a 
backbone  to  improve  the  training  speed  of  the  model  while  ensuring 
detection accuracy and speed.

EfficientnetV2 is an efficient, lightweight feature extraction network. 
The  EfficientNet  series  comprises  a  set  of  lightweight  convolutional 
neural networks. In the EfficientNetV1 series, Google’s focus was pre-
dominantly on optimizing the accuracy, parameter count, and compu-
tational  requirements  of  the  model  (Tan  and  Le,  2019).  The 
EfficientNetV2  series  further  reduces  the  number  of  parameters  and 
computations  while  preserving  the  accuracy  of  the  model,  leading  to 
significant  decreases  in  model  training  and  inference  duration. 
Furthermore, the EfficientNetV2 network uses an improved progressive 
learning approach that dynamically adjusts the regularization method 
based on the training image size. This method can improve the training 
speed  and  accuracy  of  the  network.  Compared  with  some  previous 
networks, the experimental results of this method show that the training

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of any particular deep learning model. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning research to employ various techniques such as using diverse datasets, cross-validation, stratified splitting, or other methods to enhance the robustness and generalizability of models.

In the case of the mentioned papers, they primarily discuss different architectures for deep learning models like Xception, EfficientNetV1, and EfficientNetV2. These architectures are focused on improving aspects such as computational efficiency, reducing model complexity, increasing detection accuracy, and enhancing training speeds. While these improvements may indirectly contribute to better generalizability, the context does not provide direct evidence of specific measures employed to ensure the generalizability of these models.
