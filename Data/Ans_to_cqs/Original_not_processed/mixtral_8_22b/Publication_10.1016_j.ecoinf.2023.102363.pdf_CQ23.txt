The model is constructed using the EfficientNet B0 network (Tan and 
Le, 2019) which had been trained for generic image classification. The 
EfficientNet feature extraction layers are frozen (transfer learning) with 
only the weights of the final dense classification layers updated during 
training.  Training  was  conducted  within  the  Google  Collaboratory 
‘Colab’  platform  (Bisong,  2019),  using  the  Tesla  K80  GPU,  accessed 
through  cloud  computing.  An  Adam  optimizer  was  used  to  control 
gradient descent during training (Kingma and Ba, 2014), with parame-
ters set to: learning rate of 0.001, decay factor of 0.75 and a step size of

2.2. Model fine-tuning 

To  fine-tune  the  base  model  with  Gulf  of  Mexico  data  the  feature 
extractor remains frozen. Models are trained with the same parameters 
as the base model but we use a cyclical learning rate of 0.0004 and is set 
to run for 50 epochs, with early stopping set to deploy if the validation 
loss does not improve within 10 epochs. A dropout rate of 0.2 is used 
during  fine-tuning,  and  DropConnect  is  employed.  Drop  out  layers 
randomly  discard  the  output  of  the  hidden  nodes  during  training, 
DropConnect randomly discards the input of the hidden layer (Sun et al., 
2022).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:

To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the model was constructed using the EfficientNet B0 network, which had been pretrained for generic image classification. This allowed the model to leverage the knowledge gained from this prior training, improving its ability to classify images accurately. Secondly, transfer learning was applied by freezing the EfficientNet feature extraction layers while only updating the weights of the final dense classification layers during training. This approach enabled the model to learn more specific features relevant to the task at hand without losing the valuable information obtained from the initial training. Thirdly, the model was fine-tuned using Gulf of Mexico data, with the feature extractor remaining frozen. During this process, a cyclical learning rate was used, and early stopping was deployed if the validation loss did not improve within 10 epochs. Additionally, a dropout rate of 0.2 was implemented along with DropConnect, further enhancing the model's robustness and preventing overfitting. Lastly, the model was trained within the Google Collaboratory 'Colab' platform using the Tesla K80 GPU, providing access to powerful computational resources through cloud computing. These combined strategies helped ensure the model's adaptability and applicability across various datasets and scenarios.
