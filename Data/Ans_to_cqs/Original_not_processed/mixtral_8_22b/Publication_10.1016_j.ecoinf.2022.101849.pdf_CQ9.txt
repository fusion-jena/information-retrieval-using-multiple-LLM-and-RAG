1. Introduction 

Target variables are usually fully labeled in the classical supervised 
machine learning setting. In real-world predictive tasks, however, labels 
are often scarce and/or noisy. Various definitions and terms are used in 
the  literature  to  describe  variants  of  noise  and  scarceness  of  labels 
(Allison, 2001; Xie and Huang, 2018; Nikoloski et al., 2021; Sun et al., 
2010; Gao et al., 2017; Alarc´on and Destercke, 2021; Van Engelen and 
Hoos, 2020), and each setting requires tailored approaches for exploit-
ing such target labels. In this study, we formulate a new computational 
setting for regression, where target labels are structurally incomplete. We 
computationally study this task via a case study in predictive modeling 
of global vegetation cover.
