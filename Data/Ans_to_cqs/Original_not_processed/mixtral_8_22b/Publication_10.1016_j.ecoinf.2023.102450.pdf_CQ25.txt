The Siamese relation network(Cheng et al., 2021) used a deep re-
sidual neural network (ResNet-50) as its backbone to extract multi-scale 
features from images of animals. The cascade structure of a region-based 
convolutional neural network was used to classify the proposed location 
boxes. The Siamese relation network introduced two primary modules 
into  the network structure, namely, a relation detector module and a 
refinement  module.  The  relation  detector  module  was  equipped  with 
three different nonlinear detectors, including the global, local, and patch 
detectors. These detectors were used to compare the relationships be-
tween the features generated by the target and multi-scale regression 
features,  including  pixel-wise,  patch-wise,  and  global  features.  The 
refinement module converted the output of the relation detector into a 
matching  score  followed  by  an  element-wise  replication  between  the

In this study, we used machine vision and deep learning networks to 
automatically monitor the stereotypical behaviors of captive wild ani-
mals.  We  used  a  Siamese  relation  network  to  automatically  track the 
animals in the videos and extract their location boxes. Based on this, we 
obtained the motion trajectories of the animals using the coordinates of 
the centroid points of the location boxes. The motion trajectory was then 
segmented  into  a  series  of  periodic  curves.  Finally,  we  classified  the 
motion  trajectory  patterns  by  calculating  cross-correlation  functions. 
Animal  management  personnel  can  easily  initiate  the  model  to  auto-
matically record, store, and display the motion trajectories. Addition-
ally, the model can provide real-time warning prompts for stereotypical 
behaviors through a human–computer interaction interface. 

The  primary  contributions  of  the  study  can  be  summarized  as

Helpful Answer:

The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is to automatically monitor the stereotypical behaviors of captive wild animals. Specifically, it uses a Siamese relation network to track the animals in videos and extract their location boxes. This information is then used to obtain the motion trajectories of the animals, which are further segmented into periodic curves. The final step involves classifying these motion trajectory patterns using cross-correlation functions. Additionally, the model provides real-time warning prompts for stereotypical behaviors through a human-computer interaction interface. Therefore, the main goal of this deep learning model is to aid in the automatic recording, storage, and display of motion trajectories, ultimately assisting animal management personnel in monitoring and managing captive wild animals more effectively.
