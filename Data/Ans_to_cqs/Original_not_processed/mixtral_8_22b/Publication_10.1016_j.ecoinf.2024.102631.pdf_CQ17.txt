Image enhancement plays a crucial role in improving visual quality 
and  extracting  meaningful  information  from  images.  Over  the  years, 
researchers  have  explored  various  methodologies  to  enhance  images, 
with  two  prominent  streams  of  investigation  emerging.  One  branch 
primarily focuses on leveraging traditional image processing techniques, 
while the other harnesses the power of deep learning algorithms. In this 
section,  we  review  some  of  the  currently  available  solutions  using 
classical and deep learning-based approaches.

In this work, we used a linear combination of the adversarial loss 

function Ladv, L1  loss function, and the perceptual loss function Lper.

where λ1  and λ2  are scaling factors set to 7 and 3, respectively. 

Adversarial Loss: We used adversarial loss to facilitate the training 
of the generator network and the discriminator network in a competitive 
manner. This loss function encourages the generator to minimize the log 
probability  that  the  discriminator  assigns  to  the  generated  samples,

Deep learning techniques have been successfully applied to under-
water  image  enhancement  tasks,  helping  to  improve  the  quality  and 
visibility of images captured in underwater environments. In this sec-
tion, we briefly discuss a few examples. For instance, Li et al. (Li et al., 
2018) developed WaterGAN deep learning-based generative adversarial 
network model that performs network training for reducing the color 
deviation  in  underwater  images.  Fabbri  et  al.  (Fabbri  et  al.,  2018) 
developed UGAN by taking the idea of CycleGAN (Zhu et al., 2017) that 
performs domain transformation to reconstruct degraded images. Guo 
et al. (Guo et al., 2019) developed a novel multi-scale dense GAN by 
adding a residual multi-scale dense block to the generator, improving 
enhancement performance. Islam et al. (Islam et al., 2020a) presented 
FUnIE-GAN  by  introducing  a  multi-model  objective  function  in  the

The network takes images with dimensions of 256 × 256 pixels and 
three  color  channels  as  input.  It  follows  a  fully  convolutional  design, 
with  each  layer  applying  2D  convolutions  using  4  × 4  filters.  Batch 
Normalization and Leaky-ReLU activation functions are used after each 
convolution  layer  to  facilitate  network  training  and  stability.  The 
encoder consists of 5 blocks, which progressively reduce the spatial di-
mensions and learn features. It starts with a convolutional layer with 32 
output channels and strides of 2, followed by a residual block. The re-
sidual block comprises a Conv-ReLU-Conv structure, where a convolu-
tional layer is followed by a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation and 
another convolutional layer. This configuration is designed to effectively 
capture  and  enhance  image  features,  serving  as  a  critical  component 
within the network's architecture. The residual block output is then fed

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization being employed within the described deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the use of multiple loss functions might serve as a form of regularization.

In the context, it is mentioned that the total loss function is a linear combination of three different losses: adversarial loss (Ladv), perceptual loss (Lper), and L1 loss. These combined losses help guide the optimization process during training, potentially preventing overfitting.

While not explicitly stated, one could speculate that the inclusion of these additional loss terms may act similarly to regularization methods like L2 regularization, which adds a penalty term to the loss function based on the magnitude of weights. By incorporating multiple loss components, the overall loss function becomes more complex, encouraging the model to find a balance between minimizing individual losses rather than focusing solely on fitting the data perfectly.

However, without further details regarding the implementation of the deep learning pipeline, it cannot be definitively confirmed if these loss functions indeed serve as regularizers or if other standard regularization methods were also utilized.
