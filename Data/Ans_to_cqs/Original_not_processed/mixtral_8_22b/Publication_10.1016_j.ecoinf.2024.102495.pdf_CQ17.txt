results  demonstrated  an  improved  optimality  level  compared  to  the 
alternative models. Consequently, Model 1 that lacked dropout, used the 
RMSprop optimizer, and had a 0.001 learning rate is the most optimal 
deep learning model.

2.2.3. Deep learning 

Once transformed into a matrix or vector, the results of voice feature 
extraction serve as the input for a deep learning algorithm. This algo-
rithm discerns patterns within the data, enabling it to make predictions 
based on these learned patterns, all without the need for explicit pro-
gramming (França et al., 2021; Navamani, 2019). A critical distinction 
between deep learning and traditional machine learning is the feature- 
extraction  process  during  classification.  Feature  extraction  from  data 
typically requires manual or human intervention in traditional machine 
learning.  Contrastingly,  deep  learning  models  are  designed  to  auto-
matically perform feature extraction.

The  findings  indicate  that  Model  9  exhibits  the  highest  average 
performance,  with  an  89.30%  accuracy  rate,  87.22%  precision  rate, 
84.62% recall rate, and 0.8587 F1-Score. The obtained result surpasses 
that of the other models, indicating that Model 9, which incorporates 
dropout,  Adam’s  optimizer,  and  a  0.001  learning  rate,  is  the  most 
optimal deep-learning model. The ovitrap test employed Model 9, which 
had the highest running fold and demonstrated the most optimal per-
formance value. Figs. 14 and 15 indicate Model 9’s performance at each 
iteration of the training process.

Helpful Answer:
Regularization methods are techniques used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines by adding constraints to the learning process. Two common regularization methods mentioned in the given context are dropout and using different optimizers like RMSProp, Adam, and SGD.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent overfitting by making the model more robust and less sensitive to specific weights in the network. In the given context, we see that some models use dropout while others do not. For example, Model 1 does not use dropout, whereas Model 9 uses dropout.

Using different optimizers can also help prevent overfitting. Optimizers such as RMSProp, Adam, and SGD adjust the learning rates of individual parameters dynamically based on their historical behavior. By doing so, they help improve convergence speed and reduce overfitting. In the given context, we observe that various combinations of optimizers and learning rates have been tested across multiple models.

Although not explicitly mentioned in the given context, another popular regularization method is L2 regularization, also known as weight decay. It adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights, encouraging smaller weights and thus reducing overfitting.
