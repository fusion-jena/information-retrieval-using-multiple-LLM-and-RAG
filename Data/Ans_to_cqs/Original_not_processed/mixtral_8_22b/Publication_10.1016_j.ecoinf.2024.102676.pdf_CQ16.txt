Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

These parameters are the number of selected variables in the model, 
the size of the confidence ellipsoid (counter probability), and the cut-off 
threshold value of the distances between the geometrical mean of the 
trails  (Wards-cut-off  distance).  No  hyperparameter  tuning  has  been 
conducted  and  in  order  to  assure  uniformity,  all  models  of  the  same 
species  were  executed  with  the  default  FIT  parameters  on  the  full 
dataset. 

For  the  second experiment, we applied  the same  approach to real 

missing data points. 

In summary, we analyzed 37 FIT runs per species and compared 185 
model outputs in the first experiment and a total of 13 FIT runs for the 
second experiment.

FIT  uses  a  customized  model  that  classifies  animal  trails  by 
employing a robust cross-validated discriminant analysis. In an iterative 
approach, each pair combination of trails is once held back as the test 
set, with the rest of the remaining trails used as the training set model. 
Using  stepwise  forward  regression,  the  top  explanatory  variables  are 
selected based on their F-ratio Alibhai et al. (2008). Trails are mapped in 
two-dimensional  space  using  the  first  two  canonical  variates.  Multi-
variate least-square means, from now on referred to as centroid values, 
and their respective 95% confidence ellipses are then plotted for each 
trail. The distance between the centroids is relative, depending on the 
(relative) position vector of the centroids and the matrix of the within- 
group variation. Therefore, adding or removing animals from the test 
set alters the position of the centroid values and its confidence ellipses Li 
et al. (2018).

In this paper, the methods used were both intuitive (omitting missing 
values;  mean  imputation)  and  machine-learning-based.  These  proced-
ures and the FIT method are briefly presented below.  

• Control Group 

In the first experiment, the control group consisted of the unmodified 
datasets  of  each  species.  In  the  second  experiment,  we  defined  the 
control  group  as  the  geometric  profile  extracted  by  our  experienced 
operator.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions that the FIT method employs a robust cross-validated discriminant analysis in an iterative approach where each pair combination of trails is held back as the test set, with the rest of the remaining trails used as the training set model. This suggests that some form of cross-validation might be used to evaluate the performance of the model during training. Additionally, the use of stepwise forward regression implies that variable selection is performed during the training process. Nevertheless, without more detailed information, it cannot be definitively stated what exact criteria are used to determine when training is complete.
