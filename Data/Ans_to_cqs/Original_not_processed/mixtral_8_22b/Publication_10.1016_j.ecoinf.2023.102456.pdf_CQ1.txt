Despite the positive outcomes yielded by our model, we contend that 
substantial improvements could be achieved by implementing a more 
flexible and complete neighbourhood relation Rk  in terms of variables. 
For  this  reason,  in  Section  5,  we  explore  an  architecture  capable  of 
learning  such  neighbourhood  relationships  through  experience  and 
accumulated data. 

5. Intelligent cellular scheme 

In this section, we aim to present an innovative architecture that uses 
existing  data  and  historical  databases  to  generalize  the  concept  of 
neighbourhood relations. To achieve it, machine learning is a powerful 
tool, with a backpropagation algorithm (Rumelhart et al., 1986) at the 
heart of it.

However, for machine learning algorithms like backpropagation to 
be successful, a critical condition must be met: all functions involved 
must be differentiable to compute gradients accurately. As said above, 
to make the update criterion differentiable, we use the Gumbel softmax 

function.  So,  by  changing  our  update  criterion  to 

̃
Uk,  we  manage  to 

compute the gradients. 

This new data-driven architecture aims to learn the neighbourhood 
relationship Rk to improve the results of our model. In addition, learning 
the  neighbourhood  relationship  has  value  in  itself,  as  it  allows  us  to 
know and learn how the different elements of the system interact. For 
this purpose, as we can see in Fig. 13 a neural network ANN (or other 
objects) might be defined as Rk, which may take two kinds of inputs:

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, there are several common ways to collect raw data for deep learning models, including:

1. Surveys or questionnaires: These involve gathering information directly from individuals through structured questions. This method is often used when human input is required, such as sentiment analysis or emotion recognition tasks.

2. Sensors: Various types of sensors can be employed to gather real-time data, such as temperature sensors, accelerometers, gyroscopes, cameras, microphones, etc. These sensors can provide continuous streams of data for applications like object detection, speech recognition, or autonomous vehicles.

3. Public datasets: There are numerous publicly available datasets containing preprocessed data suitable for various deep learning tasks. Examples include ImageNet for image classification, COCO for object detection, and IMDB movie reviews dataset for text classification.

4. Web scraping: Extracting data from websites can also serve as a source of raw data. This technique involves writing scripts or using tools to automatically extract relevant information from web pages.

5. APIs: Application Programming Interfaces allow developers to access data from third-party services, such as social media platforms, weather forecasts, financial markets, etc.

The choice of data collection method depends on the specific requirements of the deep learning task at hand.
