5.3.6. Classification accuracy assessments

Due to processing limitations in GEE, it is impossible to utilize many 
samples and automate hyperparameter tuning. To fill this gap and avoid 
overfitting,  the  validation  data  were  employed  for  tuning  the  key 
hyperparameters for each model. Table 3 presents the hyperparameters 
set for each model during training and validation. 

5.3.2. Pixel-based approach 

The  pixel-based  classification  approach  relies  on  the  spectral

5.3.1. Classification algorithms in GEE 

In this study, 33,209 samples were collected using a stratified sam-
pling  approach.  Of  these,  70%  were  allocated  for  training,  and  the 
remaining 30% were employed for testing. Hyperparameter tuning for 
ML models was performed using validation data (10% of training data). 
This  research  utilized  CART,  RF,  GTB,  and  SVM  models  as  classifiers 
within GEE.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be taken to evaluate the performance of the machine learning models used in this study. These include calculating metrics such as overall accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and kappa coefficient. Additionally, confusion matrices can be generated to visualize the performance of the models by comparing predicted labels with actual labels. Another useful tool for evaluating model performance is saliency maps, which highlight important features contributing to the final prediction. However, due to the lack of information regarding specific postprocessing steps mentioned in the given context, I cannot provide detailed instructions on how to perform these tasks. Nonetheless, these general guidelines should help guide further analysis of the results obtained from the machine learning models used in this study.
