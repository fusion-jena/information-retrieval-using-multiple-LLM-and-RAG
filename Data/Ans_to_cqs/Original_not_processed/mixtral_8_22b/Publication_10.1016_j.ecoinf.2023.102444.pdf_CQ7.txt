3.4. Assessment of UMAP as a binary classifier

The  volume  of  multivariate  data  increases  as  more  information  is 
generated in fields such as genomics, image analysis, population ecol-
ogy, and text processing. Dealing with multivariate data is a complex 
task that may lead to the curse of dimensionality; i.e., redundant or non- 
significant variables, degradation of model performance, and difficulty 
in visualizing the relationships between features (Anowar et al., 2021). 
To  address  these  problems,  dimensionality  reduction  methods  (DRM) 
provide tools to explore linear and non-linear featured relationships and 
help select and extract these from a multivariate space. Some examples 
of  linear  DRM  are  Principal  Components  Analysis,  Single  Value 
Decomposition,  and  Singular  Value  Decomposition  (Ayesha  et  al., 
2020).  However,  linear  DRM  cannot  address  more  complex  relation-
ships,  and  non-linear  DRM  have  thus  gained  importance  in  research.

To our knowledge, this is the first application of UMAP to directly 
estimate species distribution based on an analysis of bioclimatic vari-
ables.  Other  studies  have  used  DRM  to  visualize  results  from  deep 
learning models; e.g., Deneu et al. (2022) used tSNE (another DRM) to 
visualize input data and the results of applying a convolutional neural 
network to model the distribution of species at a fine resolution. On the 
other hand, we applied clustering to identify groups containing species 
and near background points to highlight how bioclimatic heterogeneity 
between clusters in the reduced dimension translates to geographic re-
gions, i.e., to show that groups in the reduced dimension have similar 
bioclimatic  properties  within  a  group,  but  differ  among  groups  (see 
Figs. 6, 7). This behavior underlines the nature of UMAP in that back-
ground points near species samples share similar bioclimatic properties

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The context does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it can be inferred that the study uses some form of splitting methodology due to its use of deep learning models. Common practices include random sampling, stratified sampling, or time-based splits depending on the specific requirements and characteristics of the dataset. Without further details, it would be speculative to determine the exact criteria used in this particular case.
