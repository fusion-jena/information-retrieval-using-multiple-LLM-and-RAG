dimensional  problems  (Bakay  and  A˘gbulut,  2021;  Uzlu,  2021),  we 
developed a three-layer feedforward back-propagation neural network 
with a 30–20-10 architecture, and the activation functions were tansig, 
tansig, and purelin, respectively. The input factors were population size 
and GDP, and the predicted output was GHGdwts. 70% of the data were 
used for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for model testing. The 
GHGdwts  predictions  showed  the  ANN  model  was  accurate  with  R2  =

Query: "What are the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it is mentioned that the data was divided into three sets: training, validation, and testing. Typically, these splits are made based on percentages or fixed numbers of samples. In this case, 70% of the data was used for training, while 15% each was allocated for validation and testing. This distribution is common practice in machine learning and helps ensure that the model can generalize well to unseen data.
