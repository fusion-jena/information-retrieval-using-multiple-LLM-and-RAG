Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

surveys of PAs covering thousands of square kilometers and generating 
thousands of images can be delayed by several months using the OCC 
approach due to the slow but necessary manual processing of images. 
Recent  advances  in  machine  learning  have  propelled  the  perspec-
tives of remotely sensed imagery for wildlife conservation (Tuia et al., 
2022),  and  announced  good  prospects  for  the  automation  of  image 
processing from SRF-OCC surveys (Delplanque et al., 2023b; Eikelboom 
et al., 2019). Deep learning (DL) is a subgroup of machine learning and 
artificial intelligence (AI) where artificial neural networks are trained to 
achieve challenging tasks (e.g. detect animals in aerial imagery) through 
a complex multi-level representation of information learned from a large 
amounts of data (LeCun et al., 2015). In the last decade, DL has been 
widely  employed  to  (semi-)automate  the  detection  and  counting  of

2.5. Image processing 

Images have been processed through the use of the DL model coupled 
with  human  manual  interpretation  steps.  This  ‘human-assisted’  DL- 
based  image  processing  pipeline  has  been  designed  to  minimize 
human effort while maximizing the quality of counting results. In the 
following sections, this approach is referred to as the Semi-Automated 
Deep Learning (SADL) model, and SADL-OCC refers to the integration 
of  the  SADL  model  with  the  OCC  technique.  This  section  therefore 
presents the main components and steps of this developed approach.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit details about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the process involves both the use of a deep learning model and human manual interpretation steps. This suggests that some form of data annotation was likely performed during the development or training phase of the deep learning model. Common data annotation techniques used in deep learning include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. Without more specific information, it cannot be definitively stated which of these techniques were utilized in this particular case.
