1. Introduction

Machine learning—a method where a computer discovers rules to execute a data processing
task, given training examples—can generally be divided into two categories: Shallow learning and
deep learning methods [1]. Deep learning uses many successive layered representations of data
(i.e., hundreds of convolutions/ﬁlters), while shallow learning typically uses one or two layered
representations of the data [1]. Deep learning has shown great promise for tackling many tasks such as
image recognition, natural language processing, speech recognition, superhuman Go playing, and
autonomous driving [1–3].

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about which specific framework was used to build the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the authors applied deep learning techniques using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Both TensorFlow and PyTorch support building CNN architectures, but without further details, we cannot determine which framework was utilized.

Based on the citation "[79] Atienza, R. Advanced Deep Learning with Keras: Apply Deep Learning Techniques, Autoencoders, GANs, Variational Autoencoders, Deep Reinforcement Learning, Policy Gradients, and More; Packt Publishing Ltd.: Birmingham, UK, 2018." from the references section, there is a possibility that they might have used Keras, a high-level API built on top of TensorFlow, to develop their deep learning model. Nevertheless, this remains speculative without direct confirmation from the paper.
