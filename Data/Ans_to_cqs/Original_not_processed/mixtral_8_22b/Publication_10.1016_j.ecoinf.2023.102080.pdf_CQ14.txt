3.3. Model fitting and assessment 

Selected covariate sets from the main (one embedded, one filter, and 
ten  random)  and  complementary  (ten  random  after  Step  B  and  ten 
random after Step A) procedures were used for fitting GLM, GAM and RF 
models. Details on the hyperparameters used for model fitting are pro-

Fig. 4. Average computation time (seconds) for the 50 species needed for (A) running the overall covariate selection procedure and model fitting steps under each of 
the three main covariate selection procedures (“embedded”, “filter”, and “random”), and (B) model fitting only under each of the three main covariate selection 
procedures and by modelling algorithm (GLM: Generalized Linear Model, GAM: Generalized Additive Model, and RF: Random Forest). Wilcoxon tests were used to 
assess statistical significance in differences between methods with ****: p < .0001; ***: p < .001; **: p < .01; *: p < .05; ns: non-significant.

3.4.2. Model accuracy

2. We introduce a two-step “embedded” covariate selection procedure aimed at optimizing the pre-
dictive ability and parsimony of species distribution models fitted in a context of high-dimensional 
candidate covariate space. The procedure combines a collinearity-filtering algorithm (Step A) with 
three  model-specific  embedded  regularization  techniques  (Step  B),  including  generalized  linear 
model with elastic net regularization, generalized additive model with null-space penalization, and 
guided regularized random forest.

Details on the R packages and hyperparameter values used for fitting 
these three algorithms are provided in Supplementary material 1: Text 
S1. The three algorithms can be used all together (default), in combi-
nations  of  two,  or  individually.  For  each  algorithm,  the  n  covariates 
retained after regularization are ranked from 1 (“best”) to n (“worst”). 
The algorithm-specific ranking is done based on the maximum absolute 
values of the regularized regression coefficients for GLM, the chi-square 
statistic for GAM, and the Mean Decrease Gini index for RF. The final 
ranking of covariates is obtained by ordering the sum of the ranks for 
each  covariate,  starting  with  the  covariates  that  were  commonly 
selected by all algorithms, and then adding the remaining ones. The top 
ncov covariates  are  selected as  the  final  modelling set, with  ncov and 
ncovmax being user-specifiable numbers. The default value for ncov is set

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, it appears that details regarding the optimization of hyperparameters for model fitting are provided in Supplementary Material 1: Text S2. However, the exact methodology used for hyperparameter tuning, whether it involves grid search, random search, or another technique, is not explicitly mentioned in the provided information. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this specific query without access to the supplementary materials referenced.
