butes (Lehner and Grill, 2013). The protected areas layers were down-
loaded  from  the  GeoData  application  of  the  General  Directorate  of 
Nature Conservation and National Parks of Türkiye (MOAF, 2019). The 
following categories of protected areas were extracted and used in our 
modeling  approach:  national  parks;  nature  conservation  areas;  special 
environment  protection  areas;  wildlife  enhancement  areas  (equivalent  to 
wildlife  refuges  or  reserves);  locally  important  wetlands;  nationally 
important wetlands; Ramsar wetlands; and preservation (protected) forests. 
Finally,  we  generated  distance  layers  for  all  our  variables  using  the 
Euclidean Distance tool in ArcGIS (ESRI Inc., USA).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information on the specific purpose of the deep learning model being used. However, it mentions several machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and others, which are commonly used for tasks like classification, regression, clustering, etc. Without more context, it cannot be definitively stated what the exact purpose of the deep learning model is.

Based on the context provided, it can be inferred that the study might involve some form of spatial analysis or prediction related to environmental factors and protected areas. This could suggest that the deep learning model might be used for tasks like image segmentation (to identify different types of land cover), object detection (to locate specific features within images), or even classification (to categorize different regions based on their characteristics). But without further details, this remains speculative.
