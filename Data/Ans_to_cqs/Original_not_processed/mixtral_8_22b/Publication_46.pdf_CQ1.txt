A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep learning-based model for
processing multidimensional data that follows a grid pattern [60]. The model is developed
in such a way that the algorithm learns and adapts to the spatial hierarchies of features by
itself from the lower to the higher levels of the pattern. Mathematically, it is composed of
three layers or building blocks: convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers. Feature
extraction is conducted using the ﬁrst two layers and mapping the extracted features to the
output is conducted by the third layer.

This study is a novel approach towards establishing a CNN architecture and testing
the performance of CNN in SDM and its comparison with other well established SDMs
namely, BIOCLIM. This study was conducted on the foothills of the Himalayas, where the
altitudinal variation is very drastic and varies from 416 to 7801 m above mean sea level.
This high-altitude Himalayan ranges constitutes a heterogeneous ecosystem and is home to
many rare/endangered, medicinally, and economically important plant species. One of the
major economically and medicinally important plant species, Rhododendron arboreum,
was tracked and mapped in this study using different SDMs. Based on its occurrence and
several ecological and bioclimatic satellite-based observations, the probability distribution
of the Rhododendron arboreum was established. The CNN based probability distribution
model outperformed the presence only based BIOCLIM model with an AUC score of

Convolution is used for feature extraction, in which a kernel is applied to an input
tensor. A feature map is thus obtained through the product of kernel elements and tensor
input. The procedure is then repeated on multiple kernels to obtain random feature maps
that represent different feature extractors. The hyperparameters involved in convolution
operations are the size and number of kernels. The size could be anything from 3 × 3 to
5 × 5 to 7 × 7, and the kernel could be chosen randomly.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer some possible methods based on the nature of the study and the mentioned tools.

Since the study focuses on tracking and mapping the plant species Rhododendron arboreum using different Species Distribution Models (SDMs), it is likely that the raw data collection involves field surveys or remote sensing techniques. Field surveys may include gathering geographical coordinates, altitudes, and environmental conditions related to the plant's habitat. Remote sensing techniques might involve utilizing satellite imagery or LiDAR data to capture relevant landscape characteristics.

Moreover, since the authors mention using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for their research, they probably use image datasets containing labeled examples of Rhododendron arboreum habitats. These images could come from publicly available datasets or custom datasets created specifically for this project.

However, without more specific details regarding the data collection process, these assumptions remain speculative. To get a definitive answer, one would need access to additional resources or contact the original authors for clarification.
