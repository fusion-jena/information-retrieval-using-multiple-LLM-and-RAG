2.5.1. MLPnn-MC modelling 

MLPnn-MC  modelling  integrates  the  multi-layer  perceptron  (MLP) 
algorithm  and  Markov  chain,  which  unravels  robust  future  LULC 
simulation (Gebresellase et al., 2023; Nasiri et al., 2019). The novelty of 
this model lies in the fact that it utilises deep machine learning to learn 
the model in automated mode in less calibration time through complex, 
multivariate, and non-linear relationships to create several transitions 
and predict unseen data within the model at a single time by compre-
hending the hidden relationships (Kumar and Agrawal, 2023). MLP is 
the  most  prevalent  machine  learning  algorithm  in  ANN  (Artificial 
Neural Network) modelling (Alla et al., 2021; Band et al., 2020), which 
uses  back  propagation  (BP)  or  the  reverse  method  of  automatic

each layer is a neuron that operates on non-linear activation function, 
such as  sigmoid. These  neurons are  organised in such a way that the 
networks are directed only from lower to upper layers, and the neurons 
within  the  same  layer  are  independent.  Input  data  is  provided  to  the 
input node, processed through the hidden layers in an iterative manner, 
and  the  output  layer  provides  the  pattern  classification.  The  Markov

%Query
Query: "Which hardware resources are used for training the deep learning model (e.g., GPUs, TPUs)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot determine whether GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware resources were utilized during the training process.
