The parameter setting method of SVM in this study was done ac-
cording to the sensitivity analysis method in (Heydari and Mountrakis,
2018). The “kernelType” was set to “RBF” (Gaussian function). For the
“gamma” parameter in the RBF kernel, we tested values of 0.01, 0.1,
0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, and 300. For the “cost” parameter in SVM,
we tested values of 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, and 50. We randomly se-
lected 50% reference data for parameter optimization. By selecting the
highest overall accuracy achieved from diﬀerent parameter combina-
tions, this study set “gamma” and “cost” to 2 and 10 respectively.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it appears that the study uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a Stacked Autoencoder (SAE) classifier for its analysis. However, there is no explicit mention of a specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training.

For the SVM, the paper mentions a parameter setting method using a sensitivity analysis approach, where different combinations of parameters are tested to achieve the highest overall accuracy. This could be considered as a form of monitoring the model performance during training, but it does not provide details about how the performance was monitored or evaluated throughout the training process.

As for the SAE, the paper discusses the use of mean error and the number of misclassified points to determine the optimal number of iterations (see Fig. 6). Again, while this can be seen as a way to evaluate the model performance during training, it does not offer insights into any continuous monitoring strategies employed during the training phase.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it cannot be definitively stated what specific strategy was implemented to monitor the model performance during training.
