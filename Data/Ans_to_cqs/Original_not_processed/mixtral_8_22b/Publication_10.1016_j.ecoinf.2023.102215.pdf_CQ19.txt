networks often fail in extracting global information from shallow layers 
because of the small receptive fields (Liu et al., 2019b; Liu et al., 2021). 
For  creating  feature  maps  with  much  global  information,  multiple 
dilated convolutions are used for shallow layers (Zhao et al., 2020)— 
which, however, entail more computation resources. U2-Net defines a 
two-level  nested  model  (i.e.,  a  stack  of  nested  encoder-decoder)  to 
capture the contextual information in different scales at a moderate level 
of computation cost.

TrunkNet is trained with PyTorch 1.13.0.1  All training and test im-
ages are uniformly resized to 288 × 288. TrunkNet is trained with the 
Adam  optimizer  with  default  hyper-parameters:  (1)  betas=(0.9, 
(cid:0) 3, and 
0.999), (2) eps=1.0 × 10
(4) weight_decay = 0. The evaluation experiments of TrunkNet are all 
conducted on a computer that has a 14-core Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6330 
CPU (80 GB RAM) and an NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU (24 GB memory). The 
model is trained from scratch with a batch size of 12. After 65 K itera-
tions,  the  training  loss  converges,  and  the  training  process  takes 
approximately 11.5 h. 

3.2. Performance evaluation metrics 

To evaluate the performance of salient tree trunk detection on ST-D, 

we follow seven metrics given below. 

Mean Absolute Error (M) assesses the pixel-level similarity between 
the  final  saliency  map  Spre  and  the  ground-truth  mask  G.  It  can  be 
formulated as 

M =

We  also  conduct  a  comparative  analysis  of  total  training  time, 
average  inference  time,  model parameters,  and  FLOPs  between  Trun-
kNet and the other 10 SOTAs, aiming to evaluate the time and compu-
tational performance. The experimental results are presented in Table 5. 
Noticeably, TrunkNet is built entirely on the proposed MIF block that 

needs to be trained from scratch, so necessitates a longer training time in 
comparison to models built on pre-trained backbones. Since TrunkNet 
prioritizes competitive performance, there may be a limitation in terms 
of  time  efficiency.  However,  TrunkNet  achieves  an  average  inference 
time of only 58.41 ms per image, that is 17.12 frames per second (FPS), 
which  is  still  above  average.  Furthermore,  TrunkNet  showcases

2.3. Model training 

Our study can be categorized as a binary classification. We supervise 
TrunkNet’s training with the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss function, 
which  is  a  commonly  employed  loss  function  in  supervised  deep 
learning (Zhao et al., 2019b). The BCE loss function measures the dif-
ference between the predicted probability and the actual value. Mini-
mizing this difference indicates a better training effect. Specifically, the 
BCE loss function in use is expressed with 

L BCE = (cid:0)

∑W

x=1

y=1

G(x, y)logSpre(x, y) + (1 (cid:0) G(x, y))log(1 (cid:0) Spre(x, y)),

(3)  

where (x,y) is the pixel coordinate, H and W are the height and width of 
the image, respectively, G is the ground-truth, and Spre  is the final pre-
dicted saliency map.
