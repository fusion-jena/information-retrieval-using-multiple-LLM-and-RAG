2.2. Data sources and processing 

2.2.1. NDVI dataset 

For  our  study,  we  utilized  the  MOD13A2  dataset  from  the  GEE 
platform (Data Catalog: ‘MODIS/006/MOD13A2’) to acquire NDVI data. 
This remote sensing product offers a spatial resolution of 1 km and a 
temporal resolution of 16 days. We collected original images of theMRB 
spanning from January 2001 to December 2020, totaling 460 images (23 
images per year). The preprocessing steps included proportional scaling 
(dividing each pixel’s original value by a scale factor of 10,000), pro-
jection transformations (utilizing the WGS1984-Albers projected coor-
dinate  system),  and  mask  extraction  based  on  watershed  boundaries 
(watershed boundaries extracted from the ArcGIS Pro 3.0.2 hydrological 
analysis toolbox), among other procedures. 

2.2.2. Drivers 

We selected 12 drivers related to climate, terrain and human activity 

(Fig. S1; Table 1).

Helpful Answer:
The authors utilize various methods for collecting raw data in their deep learning pipeline. For acquiring NDVI data, they use the MOD13A2 dataset from the Google Earth Engine platform with a spatial resolution of 1 km and temporal resolution of 16 days. They collect original images of the MRB spanning from January 2001 to December 2020, which totals 460 images (23 images per year). Preprocessing steps include proportional scaling, projection transformations, and mask extraction based on watershed boundaries. Additionally, the authors select 12 drivers related to climate, terrain, and human activity, including evaporation, sunshine duration, relative humidity, precipitation, temperature, elevation, slope, aspect, geomorphological type, nighttime light, population density, and road distance. However, the specific method used for collecting these driver variables is not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
