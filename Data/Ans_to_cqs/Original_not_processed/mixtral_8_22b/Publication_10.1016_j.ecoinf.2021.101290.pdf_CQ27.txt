The tools and methods available for event-stream processing are not 
the focus of this paper but they are increasingly many. Most have been 
developed  for  e-commerce,  monitoring  of  financial  markets  and  IT 
system monitoring but could as well be applied in biology. AWS kinesis 
(Amazon, 2011) and Apache Kibana (Elastic, 2016) give access to state 
of the art machine learning methods for event-stream processing at a 
click  and  mature  querying  languages,  such  as  elasticsearch  (Elastic, 
2012) make advanced data mining available to a much broader group of 
users.

A topic that we did not discuss in this paper is edge computing (Davis 
et al., 2004; Shi et al., 2016), essentially meaning to process data before 
sending it  on the network and  thus improve  response times  and  save 
bandwidth. This requires processing power close to the sensor, which we 
have, but we used it to stream data to the network and not to reduce the 
amount of data to transmit. However, a reduction does happen at the 
edge of the cluster where data streams are transformed to event streams 
and  could  thus  also  happen  at  the  sensor,  given  sufficient  processing 
power for the task. An important advantage of reducing the amount of 
data  is  that  data  can  be  transferred  from  remote  locations  via  low 
bandwidth solutions, such as LoRa (a long range, low-power, wide area 
network modulation technique) or Starlink (satellite based internet ac-
cess). Although the architecture and online computational ethology in

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the provided context to determine the exact process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. Typically, after training a deep learning model, the next steps involve saving or serializing the model using a specific format like.h5,.pkl, or.pb, depending on the framework used. Then, the serialized model is deployed onto a suitable platform, which could include cloud services like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Microsoft Azure, or local servers. However, without more specific details about the deep learning model mentioned in the context, I cannot provide a precise answer regarding its deployment process.
