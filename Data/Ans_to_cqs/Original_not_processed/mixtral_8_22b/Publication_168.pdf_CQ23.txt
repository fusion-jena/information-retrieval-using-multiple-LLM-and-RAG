On the other hand, since the powerful feature extraction 
capabilities, the deep learning methods have succeed in many 
fields,  such  as  computer  vision  and  natural  language 
processing. In recently, the deep learning based methods have 
also  been  used  to  solve  the  HSI  classification  task  and 
achieved remarkable achievements. Among the deep learning 
methods,  the  Convolutional  Neural  Networks  (CNNs)  are 
most widely explored to solve the HSI classification task. Hu 
et  al.  [4]  designed  a  one-dimensional  convolutional  neural 
network(1-D-CNN) for classification according to the spectral 
feature  of  HSI.  Due  to  the  insufficient  training  data,  the 
designed  1-D-CNN  just  includes  a  convolution  operation,  a 
pooling operation and a fully connected operation. Although 
the structure of  designed 1-D-CNN is simple, it achieved a 
satisfactory  classification  performance.  The  classification

the multiscale CNN and LSTM into a unified network. In this 
architecture,  the  multiscale  CNN  is  utilized  to  extract 
multiscale spatial features, and the LSTM is used to extract 
spectral 
residual  network 
including residual blocks  of spectral and spatial based on the 
3-D convolutional kernel have also been proposed to solve the
HSI classification task and achieved the highest classification
accuracy on three data sets [8]. Roy et al. [9] designed a novel
CNN architecture for HSI classification, which firstly use the
3-D convolutional to extract the joint spatial–spectral features
and  then  use  the  2-D  convolutional  to  learn  more  abstract-
level spatial representation.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning models mentioned. However, some common practices in machine learning can be inferred from the context. For instance, the use of diverse datasets is implied by the application of these models across various fields like computer vision, natural language processing, and Hyperspectral Image (HSI) classification. This suggests that the models were trained and tested on different types of data, contributing to their generalizability.

Moreover, the mention of'remarkable achievements' and'satisfactory classification performance' indicates that the models were evaluated using appropriate metrics, possibly through techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting. These methods help prevent overfitting and ensure that the models perform well on unseen data, thereby enhancing their generalizability.

However, without explicit details about the validation strategies employed, it cannot be definitively stated what specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of these deep learning models.
