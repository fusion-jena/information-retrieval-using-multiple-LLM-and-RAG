The values show averages of 10 replicate runs, estimating the relative contributions of the environmental and territorial variables to the MaxEnt model. The percentage 
contribution determines the jackknife; in each iteration of the training algorithm, the increase in regularized gain is added to the contribution of the corresponding 
variable. Permutation importance shows the values of that variable on training presence, and background data are randomly permuted. The model is reevaluated on 
the permuted data, and the resulting drop in training AUC is shown, normalized to percentages.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be taken to evaluate and interpret the results. These may include:

1. **Metrics Calculation**: This involves calculating various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, etc., to assess the model's effectiveness. In this case, the Average Training AUC (Area Under Curve) is mentioned, which indicates how well the model distinguishes between positive and negative classes.

2. **Confusion Matrix**: This is a table layout used to visualize the performance of an algorithm. It has two dimensions - 'Actual' and 'Predicted', and it provides insights into the false positives, true negatives, false negatives, and true positives. However, there's no explicit mention of confusion matrices in the given context.

3. **Saliency Maps**: These are visualizations that highlight important regions in the input image for making predictions. They help understand what parts of the input contribute most to the prediction. Unfortunately, saliency maps aren't directly relevant or applicable here since we're dealing with non-image data.

4. **Jackknifing**: This technique is used to estimate the bias and standard error in small samples. Here, it's used to determine the percentage contribution of each variable to the MaxEnt model. Each iteration of the training algorithm adds the increase in regularized gain to the contribution of the corresponding variable.

5. **Permutation Importance**: This method measures the change in model performance when a single feature value is randomly shuffled. It helps identify features that have a significant impact on the model’s predictive power. In this case, it shows the values of that variable on training presence, and background data are randomly permuted. The model is then reevaluated on the permuted data, and the resulting drop in training AUC is displayed, normalized to percentages.
