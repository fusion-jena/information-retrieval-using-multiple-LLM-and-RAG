Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that two main frameworks were used to build the deep learning models. These include Theano and Python.

Theano is a Python framework designed for fast computation of mathematical expressions. It was developed by the Theano Development Team and released in 2016. According to the context, Theano can be accessed via the link <https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02688>.

Python is another popular programming language used for building deep learning models. It is mentioned in the context as a retrievable resource from <http://www.python.org>. However, there is no specific mention of any particular Python libraries or frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Therefore, while we can confirm that Python was used, we cannot specify which exact libraries or frameworks within Python were utilized.
