This strategy is widely used to enhance the generalization of a machine learning model and prevent overfitting. A balanced sampling was carried out for the test set. For it, one audio sample (with its corresponding data augmentation samples) out of five was selected for each type of anuran call. Thus, 7623 samples were used for training and 1892 for testing. As mentioned in the data augmentation section above, a CNN was first trained for the four sound classes covered in the classification model developed in previous work [18–21]. Later, a second CNN was trained to expand the classification system to the total of the five classes detailed in Table 1. For the first network, the best results were obtained with training in only eight epochs (number of passes of the entire training dataset) and a batch size

on each convolution layer. The fully connected layer (FC) consists of 512 neurons and
the softmax layer with the number of units for classiﬁcation (one for each type of sound).

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide explicit information about the method used for collecting raw data in this specific case. However, generally speaking, in deep learning pipelines, raw data can be collected through various means such as surveys, sensors, or using publicly available datasets. In this particular study, since they are working with anuran calls, it could be assumed that they might have used sensors like microphones to collect audio data from different types of anurans. Additionally, they may also use existing public datasets containing similar audio recordings if available. But without more specific details, these assumptions remain speculative.
