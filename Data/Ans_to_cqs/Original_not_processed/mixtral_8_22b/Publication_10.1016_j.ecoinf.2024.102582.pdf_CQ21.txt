(2)  Training samples were created and landscape types were rapidly 
extracted. Google Earth Pro was used to randomly generate 1800 
sample points in the image of the study area for each year (300 
sample  points  for  each  land  cover  type).  These  sample  points 
were imported into the GEE application programming interface 
(API)  for  further  analysis.  The  samples  were  then  randomly 
divided into training and validation datasets at a 7:3 ratio. The 
random forest algorithm was applied to rapidly classify the land 
use types in the study area.  

(3)  Post-classification  processing  was  applied  to  the  images.  A 
manual  visual  interpretation  approach  was  used  to  correct  the 
image classification results for mangroves within a 10-km buffer 
zone extending inland from the coastline. This procedure effec-
tively corrected misclassifications between forest and mangroves 
resulting from “spectral confusion”.

plan  led  to  the  upgrading  and  expansion  of  economic  development, 
construction of a coastal economic belt, and promotion of new growth.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
After the model training, several postprocessing steps can be taken depending on the specific requirements of the project or research. Some common postprocessing steps include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, etc., creating confusion matrices, and performing cross-validation.

In this case, the postprocessing step mentioned is manual visual interpretation approach which was used to correct the image classification results for mangroves within a 10-km buffer zone extending inland from the coastline. This procedure effectively corrected misclassifications between forest and mangroves resulting from'spectral confusion'. Additionally, user's accuracy, total accuracy, and Kappa coefficient were calculated for different years to evaluate the performance of the model.
