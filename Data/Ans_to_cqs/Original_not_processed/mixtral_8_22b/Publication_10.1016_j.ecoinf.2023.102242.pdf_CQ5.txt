4.3. Data processing

The  processing  of  high-resolution  remote  sensing  data,  which  en-
compasses  a  plethora  of  feature  information  (Girshick  et  al.,  2014), 
demands  significant  time  and  costs.  This  presents  considerable  chal-
lenges for many researchers (Modzelewska et al., 2020). Prior to clas-
sification, samples require training. The representativeness and quantity 
of  these  training  samples  significantly  influence  the  accuracy  of  the 
classification  models.  Platinum  (Ting,  2016)  demonstrated  that  when 
the training samples are not sufficiently typical, other categories can be 
easily misclassified into the sampleâ€™s category. If the number of training 
samples is insufficient, network training may not meet the requirements. 
Conversely, an excessive number of training samples can lead to data 
redundancy, reducing the efficiency of model training (Shi, 2018). To 
address  this  issue,  this  study  employed  feature  optimization  tools  to

and an 8-m multi-spectral image. They encapsulated red, green, blue, 
and  near-infrared bands. The GF-1 remote  sensing  image data  under-
went several processing steps in the study area, including radiometric 
calibration,  atmospheric  correction,  orthophoto  correction,  image 
registration, image fusion, and mosaic cropping (Fig. 4). 

2.4. Multi-scale segmentation

this study to filter classification features, securing the optimal feature 
combination for the classification process. This approach is projected to 
considerably reduce data redundancy, thereby enhancing classification 
accuracy and efficiency.

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention any specific dataset used in the deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it discusses the use of high-resolution remote sensing data, specifically from the Gaofen-1 (GF-1) satellite. These data include both 2-m panchromatic images and 8-m multispectral images, covering red, green, blue, and near-infrared bands.

Before using these datasets in the deep learning pipeline, they undergo various preprocessing steps like radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction, orthophoto correction, image registration, image fusion, and mosaic cropping. Additionally, the context mentions the importance of having representative and sufficient training samples for accurate classification models, while avoiding data redundancy by optimizing features.

In summary, although the context doesn't provide explicit details about popular deep learning datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, it highlights the utilization of high-resolution remote sensing data from the GF-1 satellite and emphasizes the significance of proper preprocessing and feature optimization for efficient and accurate deep learning applications.
