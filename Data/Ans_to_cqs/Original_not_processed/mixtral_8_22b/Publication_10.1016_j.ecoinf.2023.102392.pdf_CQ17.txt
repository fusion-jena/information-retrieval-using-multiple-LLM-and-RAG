inference system with ABC optimization technique to enhance the pre-
diction model’s performance. In a prior study conducted by Pham et al. 
(2023), the ACO-NFS model was utilized to estimate the extent of forest 
fire in the Bo Trach district, Quang Binh province. However, the authors 
of that study solely focused on one specific type of forest cover without 
addressing  the  susceptibility  of  different  forest  types  to  wildfires. 
Considering these limitations, our experiment aims to integrate a hybrid 
model  for  predicting  forest  fires  vulnerability  with  a  deep  learning 
model-based approach for forests classification.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, there is no explicit mention of the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on common practices in deep learning, some popular regularization techniques include Dropout and L2 Regularization.

Dropout is a regularization method where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent overfitting. It can be thought of as a way to combine many different neural network architectures efficiently.

On the other hand, L2 Regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the sum of squares of all the weights in the network. This encourages smaller weights, leading to simpler models and reduced chances of overfitting.

These regularization methods can be applied independently or together depending on the requirements of the deep learning model. Other regularization techniques not mentioned here may also exist but are beyond the scope of this response.
