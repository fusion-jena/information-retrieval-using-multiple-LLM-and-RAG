from the input image (see Fig. 2). It can be a pre-trained
CNN architecture such as Inception [32], Residual Neural Net-
work (Resnet) [33], and Dense Convolutional Network (Den-
senet)
the RPN module proposes object
locations of the feature maps. Third, a regressor and classiﬁer
are trained using the loss function L in (1) for the CNN detec-
tion network to adjust these proposed locations and to predict
single or multi-object classes with the corresponding bounding
box area in the resulted image, as shown in Fig. 2.

3.2. Faster R-CNN approach

The Faster R-CNN presents recent advancement of both Fast
R-CNN and R-CNN by Ren et al. [16]. It merges a Region
Proposal Network (RPN) as object bounds predictor and Fast
R-CNN for target detection in processed images. The role of
RPN module is to serve as the ‘‘attention” mechanism of this
uniﬁed Faster R-CNN, as depicted in Fig. 2. Three basic com-
ponents of the Faster R-CNN can be described as follow.
First, the feature extractor network to generate feature maps

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:

The pipeline uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as its primary deep learning model. This is evident from several references made throughout the text. For instance, it mentions that the feature extractor network could be a pre-trained CNN architecture like Inception [32], Residual Neural Network (Resnet) [33], or Dense Convolutional Network (Densenet) [34]. These are all types of CNN architectures. Furthermore, the equation (1) mentioned in the text is also associated with CNN models, specifically with the loss function used during training. Therefore, based on the given information, we can confidently conclude that the pipeline employs a CNN as its main deep learning model.
