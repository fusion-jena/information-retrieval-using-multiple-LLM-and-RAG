Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The paper does not provide information on where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It would be best to contact the authors directly or check their personal websites for any links to a public repository containing the relevant code.

Based on the given context, there is no mention of the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used by E. Prasetyo et al. Therefore, it is not possible to determine where the code repository is located based solely on this information. To obtain this information, one could reach out to the authors directly or search for any publicly accessible repositories associated with them.
