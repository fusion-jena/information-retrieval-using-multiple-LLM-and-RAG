where t and h represent temperature and humidity resp. 
b.Modification  of  the  update  criterion  and  application  of  ma-
chine learning: We will seek to improve our model by modifying the 
update  criterion,  maintaining  stochasticity  but  making  it  differen-
tiable. This will allow us to take advantage of machine-learning tools 
and turn our model into an intelligent cellular automaton. 
c.Optimising  the  scope:  We  will  make  changes  in  the  partitions 
used to increase the number of cells exposed in each iteration. This 
will become another adjustable parameter to improve the accuracy 
and efficiency of the model. 
d.Strategies of variance-reduction: As previously mentioned, the 
estimator  given  by  Eq.  6  may  not  have  the  minimum  variance. 
Therefore, it opens the possibility to investigate and develop new and 
more sophisticated estimators by using variance reduction strategies 
such as the importance sampling, stratified sampling, Quasi-Monte

5.1. Limitations of the model as a classification model 

Our classification model is built upon the Monte Carlo method. While 
Monte Carlo codes have achieved significant sophistication, simulations 

suffer  from  the  drawback  of  demanding  extensive  computational  re-
sources  to  attain  an  adequate  level  of  result  confidence.  Hence,  it  is 
crucial to acknowledge the associated limitations. 

Specifically, a substantial number of tests may be required. Insuffi-
cient  testing  could  lead  to  a  heightened  sampling  error,  resulting  in 
overly broad confidence intervals. Ensuring an ample number of trials is 
crucial to obtain more precise and reliable estimates.

Another  important  aspect  to  address  is  the  range  of  values  these 
parameters  can  take.  Regarding  the  partitions,  the  values  should  be 
determined  based  on  the  wind  intensity  which  depends  on  the  envi-
ronmental phenomenon and its location. Sometimes, there is not enough 
knowledge of this influence, so we consider it an adjustable parameter. 
For C and p0, we can use the specific information of the phenomenon. As 
an example, it is well-known that high temperatures and low humidity 
favour a quick expansion of forest fires (Ganteaume et al., 2013; Pitts, 
1991; Viegas, 2004). This could lead to determine a low loss value C and 
a high p0  value  in such cases. Therefore, these values may  vary even 
within  the  same  phenomenon  if  the  environmental  conditions  are 
significantly different. This is a potential aspect for improvement in our

makes our model a powerful tool for predicting real-world phenomena 
such as wildfire spreads or pest plants propagation, since we take into 
account the most important variables in the representation.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, considering the nature of the problem being addressed - modeling the spread of wildfires or pests - it can be inferred that the input data might include geospatial data, weather data, and possibly satellite imagery. These types of data can come in various formats such as raster images (for satellite imagery), CSV files (for weather data), and shapefiles (for geospatial data). It is also possible that the data might need preprocessing before being fed into the deep learning model, depending on the specific requirements of the model architecture.
