3.2. Results of the FAIR assessment of the datasets selected by the F-UJI 
tool 

The  results  obtained  using  the  F-UJI  tool  were  based  on  the  16 
metrics described previously, which were established in the FAIRsFAIR 
project and distributed among four principles. 

Following the analysis of each group of repositories using this tool, 
we  passed  the  results  through  a  computational  notebook  report, 

ultimately  obtaining  visualisations  of  the  summaries  of  each  FAIR 
principle for all eight repositories. 

The report itself contained two sections:  

1.  “Read jsons responses” creates a data frame that includes all scores 

obtained for each of the 16 metrics,  

2.  “Visualize different FAIR metrics”  creates a histogram plot of the 
results that includes visualisations of each principle and the overall 
FAIR score, as shown below (Figs. 4(cid:0) 11).

that it has been made available to the scientific community as an open- 
source  tool  that  can  be  used  to  evaluate  a  large  number  of  datasets

Thus, we used the second approach to perform a massive evaluation 

featuring many datasets (5967 PIDs).

After  compilation,  the  tool  produces  JSON  files  for  each  PID  that 
contain the assessment results. These files include scores, practical tests, 
inputs/outputs, and assessment contexts for each of the 16 metrics (see 
the demo of the tool in FAIRsFAIR, 2020).

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no information about the use or purpose of any deep learning models. The text discusses the results of a FAIR assessment of datasets selected by the F-UJI tool, which was performed using 16 metrics established in the FAIRsFAIR project. The results were then analyzed using a computational notebook report, resulting in visualizations of the summaries of each FAIR principle for all eight repositories. The report also included a section that created a histogram plot of the results, including visualizations of each principle and the overall FAIR score. Additionally, the text mentions that the F-UJI tool is an open-source tool that can be used to evaluate a large number of datasets, but there is no mention of any deep learning models being used in this process. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query regarding the purpose of a deep learning model.
