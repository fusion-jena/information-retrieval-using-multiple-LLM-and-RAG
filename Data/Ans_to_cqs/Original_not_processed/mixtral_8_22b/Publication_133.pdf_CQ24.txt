Preliminary Application to Forest Ecology Research
To test the utility of our approach in a real-world scenario
we compared the ability of insect identiﬁcations, by either an
expert or the deep learning algorithm, to address two simple yet
biologically relevant questions. First, do the per-site abundances
of our study species show any latitudinal pattern, say due to a
climate gradient; and second, are the populations of the three
species correlated in abundance, i.e., are any sites particularly
attractive for all the species in our study. Figure 5 summarizes
the per-site abundances of the three focal species. Sites are
ordered from north to south. Expert counts of individual trapped
insects (ﬁlled bars) are shown next to the deep-learning based
predictions (striped bares), using a conﬁdence threshold of 0.7.
Evidently, by both counting techniques none of the populations

After evaluating our method’s general performance, we also
tested it in the context of our case study, which deals with insect
population dynamics in Eucalyptus forests. Over the spring and
summer of 2020, we conducted six insect sampling sessions in
each of 15 Eucalyptus forests, located along a climatic gradient
in coastal Israel. We placed 30 sticky traps in diﬀerent parts of
each forest in each sampling session and recovered them a week
later. In the present work, we analyzed a small subset of these
traps (58 traps from six sites and a single sampling month) to test
how well the deep learning model detects between-site diﬀerences
in insect abundances. We found that the per-site abundances,
estimated by both an expert and our deep learning algorithm,
show no clear pattern with respect to the north-south axis. Both
counting methods indicated considerable correlation between
the abundances of “Psyllaephagus” and “Glycaspis,” while class

and to label them correctly. For the training and testing of the
method we used labeled images, which were divided to three
subsets: “training,” “validation,” and “test.” In the training phase
the algorithm uses the “training” and “validation” sets to create
a statistical model. In the test phase we apply the model to
the “test” set images, ignoring their labels. Each predicted label
is associated with a conﬁdence score that considers both the
probability that the label is correct, and the expected overlap
between the ground truth bounding box and the predicted one.
This overlap is expressed as the Intersection over union (IoU),
indicating the agreement between a predicted bounding box and
a ground truth box (Eq. 1).

the loss function, and modifying their parameters according
to the loss function’s gradient. Thus,
the loss declines in
each training round (aka epoch), and the model’s annotation
accuracy increases (Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure 1).
As the number of parameters of a typical deep learning
model
is large, overﬁtting is a major concern. A common
(partial) remedy is the use of validation data, which are set-
aside while training, yet their annotations by the models are
the training
monitored. The validation data help to limit
duration, thereby reducing the risk of overﬁtting. In this study
we used 30 epochs per training task, based on our validation
runs (Figure 2).

Helpful Answer:
In order to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, several strategies can be employed. One such strategy is the use of a fixed random seed value. This ensures that the results obtained from different runs of the same experiment are reproducible. Another strategy is to perform multiple runs of the experiment with different random seeds and then average the results. This helps to reduce the variability caused by randomness. Additionally, cross-validation can be used to evaluate the performance of the model across different subsets of the data. This helps to ensure that the model is not biased towards any particular subset of the data. Finally, regularization techniques such as dropout and weight decay can be used to prevent overfitting and improve the generalizability of the model. These techniques introduce randomness into the training process, which can help to improve the robustness of the model.
