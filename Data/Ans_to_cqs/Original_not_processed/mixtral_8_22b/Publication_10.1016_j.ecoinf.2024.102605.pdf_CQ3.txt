Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it can be assumed that various types of data annotations might have been employed depending upon the nature of the problem being solved by the deep learning models. For example, if the task is object recognition, then bounding boxes could be used to mark the location of objects within images. Similarly, semantic segmentation involves labeling each pixel in an image according to the class of object present at that location. Instance segmentation goes one step further by identifying individual instances of objects belonging to the same class. Other forms of data annotation include polygon annotation, key point annotation, and text annotation. The choice of technique depends on factors like the complexity of the dataset, computational resources available, and desired accuracy levels.
