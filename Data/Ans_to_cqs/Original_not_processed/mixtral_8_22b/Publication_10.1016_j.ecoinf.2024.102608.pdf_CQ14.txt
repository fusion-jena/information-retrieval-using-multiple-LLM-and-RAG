various  cases  by  combining  hyperparameter  values  extracted  from  a

This studyâ€™s main research objectives are as follows: to demonstrate

we selected the set of hyperparameter values that resulted in the mini-

3.3. Hyperparameter tuning and performance evaluation of machine 
learning models 

We developed machine learning models to predict CHL-a, SD, and 
TSS using surface reflectance values from Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat-8 
OLI  imagery.  To  optimize  the  performance  of  these  models,  we  con-
ducted hyperparameter tuning. The optimal hyperparameter values for 
each machine learning model were determined using a randomized grid 
search  (Bergstra and  Bengio, 2012; Lee et  al., 2022). It is  a  powerful 
optimization  technique  that  differs  from  traditional  grid  search  by

Helpful Answer:
The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a randomized grid search method (Bergstra & Bengio, 2012; Lee et al., 2022). Unlike traditional grid search, this optimization technique randomly selects subsets of the parameter grid to explore instead of exhaustively searching through all possible combinations of hyperparameters. Randomized grid search offers several advantages such as reduced computational cost, especially when dealing with a large number of hyperparameters, and finding equally or more optimal solutions than an exhaustive grid search, particularly when some hyperparameters are more influential than others. In this study, various cases were generated by combining hyperparameter values extracted from a uniform distribution, and their performance was evaluated. The optimal hyperparameter values for each machine learning model were determined using this method.
