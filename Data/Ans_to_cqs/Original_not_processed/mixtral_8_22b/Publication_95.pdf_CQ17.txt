When training a deep convolutional neural network, it is important to split the data
into a training set, a validation set, and a test set. The training set is used for optimizing the
parameters of the network, while the validation set is used for monitoring the performance
of the network during training and for comparing the performance of different networks
with, for example, different hyperparameters or network structures. The test set acts as a
ﬁnal evaluation of a network. To ensure a proper evaluation on both the validation set and
the test set, samples in each set must be independent and have similar class distributions.
The full data set can be split in various ways. The naïve approach is to randomly
sample images from the full data set. However, due to the images being captured in
close proximity and potentially having overlapping ﬁelds of views, information may leak
between the data sets when using the naïve approach. Another approach would be to

All networks were trained on the training set for 100 epochs, using the Adam opti-
mizer [27] with a learning rate of 0.001 and cross-entropy loss. The image batch size varied
from 1 to 32 images, depending on the input image resolution with larger batch sizes
for smaller image sizes. After each epoch, the network was evaluated on the validation
set. The epoch model with the highest accuracy on the validation set during training was
saved for further analysis. Before training the networks, the training set was balanced by
upsampling the images from the underrepresented classes through repetition to match the
number of images of the most represented class, “No species”.

Figure 8. Recall of the ResNet50V2 models on the validation set as a function of the annotation size relative to image size.
The validation images were binned according to the relative size of their respective annotations with respect to the image
size (“annotation size”). Each line shows the recall (left axis) of a ResNet50V2 model with a given input image size across
the binned annotation sizes. The recall lines were “smoothed”, using kernel density estimation. The number of images in
each bin is shown as vertical bars (right axis).

The following three-step data augmentation procedure was applied to the images dur-
ing training before being processed by the network: (1) randomly ﬂip image horizontally,
(2) scale the contrast of each image channel by a random factor between 0.8 and 1.2, and (3)
randomly crop the image to a square with side lengths equal to the image height.

Helpful Answer:
In the provided context, there is no explicit mention of specific regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, several strategies are employed to improve generalization and avoid overfitting. These include:

1. Data Augmentation: This technique involves applying transformations like horizontal flipping, scaling contrast, and cropping to increase the diversity of the dataset. By creating new variations of existing examples, this method helps reduce overfitting and improves the model's ability to generalize.

2. Balancing Training Set: Upsampling the images from underrepresented classes ensures that all classes contribute equally to the learning process. This prevents the model from becoming biased towards the majority class, which could lead to poor performance on minority classes.

3. Validation Set Monitoring: During training, the network is evaluated on the validation set after every epoch. The best performing model based on validation set accuracy is saved for further analysis. This strategy helps identify the optimal point where the model has learned enough but hasn't started to overfit yet.

While these approaches do not directly correspond to traditional regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization, they serve a similar purpose – preventing overfitting and improving the model's capacity to generalize well to unseen data.
