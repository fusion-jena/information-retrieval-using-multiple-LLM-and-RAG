Scenario 5 was selected as the optimal solution as it had the best values for IoU and accuracy
while training on fewer epochs. The resulting architecture is shown in Figure 4 and described in
the following.

2.5.1. Encoding Path

In general, the limitations of deep learning in comparison to other machine learning methods
are the requirement of large and high-quality training data, as well as hardware limitations related to
GPU computing power. The most notable advantage of deep learning is the grade of automatization
and a high potential to generalize when using large amounts of representative training data, which
might, however, not always be available; especially with respect to ground-truth labels that might be
scarce or not exist at all.. Furthermore, the black-box nature makes these algorithms a good choice for
classiﬁcation as suggested in this study, but a challenge for modeling physical properties, as is often
the case in forestry. This case study relied on high-resolution orthophotos with 20-cm spatial resolution
obtained from an aerial survey. The great advantage of these data is that many details can be detected.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some common strategies used to manage randomness include:

1. Fixed Random Seeds: One way to ensure reproducibility in experiments involving random processes like shuffling datasets or initializing weights is by fixing the random seed. By doing so, the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers will be generated each time the code runs, ensuring consistent results across multiple executions.

2. Multiple Runs: To account for variability due to random initialization or stochastic optimization techniques, researchers may conduct several runs of their models with different seeds and report average performance metrics along with standard deviation or confidence intervals.

3. Cross-Validation: Another strategy to mitigate the impact of randomness is employing cross-validation techniques. These involve splitting the dataset into multiple folds and iteratively training and evaluating the model on different subsets of the data. This helps reduce bias and variance introduced by specific train/test splits.

4. Deterministic Algorithms: Some operations within deep learning pipelines can also introduce non-determinism, such as parallel processing or GPU computations. Using deterministic versions of these algorithms or libraries can help maintain consistency between runs.
