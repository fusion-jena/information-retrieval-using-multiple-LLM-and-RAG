2.6. Machine learning models

Learning models applied. In Section 3 results from CA, TSA and Machine
Learning modelsâ€™ prediction are displayed and these results are dis-
cussed in Section 4.

but using a similar number of inputs, resulting in similar model effi-
ciency. Intelligent models based on extreme learning machine were
proposed to predict WQI at the Kinta River basin using seven WQPs as
inputs, obtaining a RMSE = 3.606 for training and RMSE = 3.816 for
testing (Abba et al., 2020). The efficiency of the machine learning
models developed in this research can be attributed to the precise data
selection for model training using clusters and time series analysis.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It only mentions that machine learning models were applied and that intelligent models based on extreme learning machines were proposed for water quality index predictions. However, it does not specify whether any deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN), or transformers were utilized. Therefore, I cannot determine which type of deep learning model was used in the pipeline based on the provided context.
