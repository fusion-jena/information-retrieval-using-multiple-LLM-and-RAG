Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Control() function helped to evaluate these tuning parameters for model 
performance. Table S3 shows the parameterization settings (i.e. model 
type,  number  of  tuning  parameters/iterations,  tuning  methods  and 
description) for each of the four ML algorithms.

solving  (Kubat,  1999;  Yang,  2009).  In  LULC  classification,  the  Multi- 
Layer Perceptron (MLP) type of ANN has been used most often (Silva 
et al., 2020). MLP carries out backpropagation of training samples to 
accurately classify LULC. The RF was developed as an ensemble of ML 
models that use bootstrap techniques to build many single decision tree 
models (Breiman, 2001; Mellor et al., 2013; Rodriguez-Galiano et al., 
2012). The RF model uses subsets of predictor variables (e.g. Landsat 
bands) to split observation datasets into subsets of homogenous samples 
to build each decision tree (Mellor et al., 2013).

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit details about how the hyperparameters were optimized. However, it mentions a Control() function which is likely used to help evaluate the tuning parameters for model performance. Additionally, there is mention of a table (Table S3) that contains parameterization settings including the number of tuning parameters or iterations and tuning methods. This suggests that some form of hyperparameter optimization was performed, but without further specifics, we cannot definitively state whether this was done through methods such as grid search or random search.
