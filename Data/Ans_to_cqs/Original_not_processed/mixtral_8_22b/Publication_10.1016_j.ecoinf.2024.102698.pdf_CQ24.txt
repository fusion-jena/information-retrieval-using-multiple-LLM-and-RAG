convolutional  neural  networks  (CNN),  auto  encoders  and  generative

1. Why synthetic data for reef modelling? 

Here  we  use  the  definition  of  synthetic  data  as  data  generated  to 
mimic the statistical properties of real-world datasets while removing 
reference  to  sensitive  or  confidential  information  contained  in  the 
original dataset (Quintana, 2020). Synthetic data allows full exploration 
of  policy-relevant  datasets while  allaying privacy and  sensitivity con-
cerns. This is desirable in the context of decision support for research

Classical and deep learning methods are increasingly being used to 
generate synthetic data as they can perform better at emulating complex 
patterns and relationships in the original datasets, and do not require 
knowledge  of  prior  or  posterior  distributions  for  dataset  variables. 
Classical  machine  learning  methods  include  regression,  K-nearest 
neighbours,  and  support  vector  machines,  and  can  perform  better  on 
smaller data sets and take less time to train than deep learning methods. 
Deep  learning  methods  are  based  on  neural  networks,  including

5.2. Initial coral cover data 

The  initial  coral  cover  model  was  developed  using  a  TVAE  model 
from SDV, which is based on a Variational Autoencoder model. In this 
model,  an  encoder  maps  the  original  data  to  distributions  in  a  lower 
dimensional latent space. Data is then sampled from the latent space and 
transformed back to the original space using a decoder. In the learning 
phase the decoder learns by finding a transformation with minimal loss 
between the original and final data distributions. This loss is quantified 
using the evidence lower bound (ELBO), which transforms intractable 
inference  problems  into  optimisation  problems  which  can  be  solved 
using gradient methods (Xu et al., 2019). 

The model learns the spatially dependent distribution of cover for 
each of the six species of coral modelled in ADRIA. The radially sampled 
latitudes and longitudes from the synthetic site data set are then used to

Helpful Answer:

While the provided context does not directly address the handling of randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does provide some insights into the application of deep learning models in generating synthetic data for reef modeling. However, I will still attempt to provide a helpful response to your query.

Randomness in the deep learning pipeline often arises due to factors such as initialization of weights, shuffling of training data, dropout regularization, and stochastic optimization algorithms like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). To handle these sources of randomness, several strategies are commonly employed:

1. Fixed Random Seeds: One common approach is to fix the random seed value before running any code involving random processes. By setting a fixed seed, one ensures that the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers is generated each time the program runs, thereby making results reproducible.

2. Multiple Runs and Ensemble Methods: Another strategy involves performing multiple runs of the same experiment with different random seeds and aggregating the results. For example, ensemble methods combine predictions from multiple models trained with different random seeds to improve overall performance and robustness.

3. Deterministic Algorithms: Some components of the deep learning pipeline can be made deterministic to reduce variability. For instance, certain implementations of convolution operations in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) may introduce non-determinism due to parallel processing. Using deterministic versions of these algorithms can help mitigate this issue.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning: Proper tuning of hyperparameters related to randomness, such as learning rate schedules, batch sizes, and momentum parameters, can also help manage the impact of randomness on model performance.
