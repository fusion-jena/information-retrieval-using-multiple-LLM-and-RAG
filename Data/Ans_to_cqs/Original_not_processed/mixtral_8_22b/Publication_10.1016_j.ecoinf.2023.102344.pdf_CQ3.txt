the  shortcut  connections  within  the  network  that  makes  the  training 
faster; bottleneck architecture which consists of a 1 × 1 convolutional 
layer  for  dimension  reduction,  3  × 3  convolution  layer  for  feature 
extraction, and another 1 × 1 convolutional layer for dimension resto-
ration;  shortcut  connections  which  allows  gradients  to  flow  directly 
through  the  network  due  to  the  input  added  directly  to  the  output; 
global  average  pooling  (GAP)  which  computes  spatial  average  of  the 
feature  maps  at  the  end  section  of  the  convolutional  layer;  and  skip 
connections which bypass multiple residual blocks. On the other hand, 
InceptionV3 is a 48-layer 24 CNN containing 24 × 106 parameters with 
enhancement using label smoothing and factorized convolutional layers 
in order to easily propagate the information from the input to the output 
section. For all image-based pre-trained networks, the purpose of CNN

Approach 1 during training were the exact images used in training in

Approach  2  utilized  the  raw  bivalve  images  as  inputs  to  the  opti-
mized pre-trained networks of EfficientNet-B0, ResNet101, MobilNetV2, 
and InceptionV3. Unlike Approaches 1 and 3, Approach 2 has no PCA- 
NCA  integration  as  the  extraction  of  features  was  not  manually  per-
formed, rather the built-in architecture of these four pre-trained deep 
networks  (Fig.  3)  extracted  millions  of  possible  features  that  are  not 
visible to human eyes for visual discrimination. Despite this supposedly 
advantageous  aspect  of  the  image-based  pre-trained  network,  only 
EfficientNet-B0 and InceptionV3 resulted in a 1.135 and 1.009 increase 
factor in accuracy as compared to its equivalent model to Approach 1 
(Table  1).  This  resulted  in  InceptionV3  being  the  most  accurate  and 
sensitive  model  in  Approach  2  with  scores  of  90.13%  and  87.45% 
respectively (Table 1, Fig. 9). The 9.87% Hamming loss of InceptionV3 is

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses various aspects of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), such as shortcut connections, bottleneck architecture, global average pooling (GAP), and skip connections. It also mentions different pre-trained networks like EfficientNet-B0, ResNet101, MobileNetV2, and InceptionV3.

Regarding data annotation techniques, they are crucial steps in developing machine learning models, especially those involving computer vision tasks. Common data annotation techniques include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and landmark annotation. These techniques help train models to identify objects or regions of interest within images accurately.

Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangles around objects of interest in an image. Semantic segmentation entails assigning each pixel in an image to a class or category. Instance segmentation combines object detection and semantic segmentation, identifying individual instances of objects while also providing their boundaries. Polygon annotation uses irregular shapes to outline complex objects or structures. Key point annotation marks specific points on an object, often used for facial recognition or pose estimation. Landmark annotation identifies significant features or reference points in an image.

Without explicit mention of the data annotation techniques employed in the described deep learning pipeline, we cannot definitively state which methods were used. Nonetheless, understanding common data annotation techniques can aid in interpreting how the mentioned pre-trained networks might have been trained and applied in the given context.
