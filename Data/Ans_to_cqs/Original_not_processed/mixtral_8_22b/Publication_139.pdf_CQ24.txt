Pre-training on the both ResNet50 (He et al., 2016) and Inception 
(Szegedy et al., 2014) neural networks did not meaningfully improve 
classification performance, therefore this simpler architecture, similar to 
those implemented by (Ruff et al., 2020; Sprengel et al., 2016) was used 
instead. 

2.6. Generating prediction record

The  prediction  record  generated  using  this  approach  for  two 
different  sampling  conditions  was  applied  to  quickly  assess  the  most 
active times of the day and year for certain species, to explore the daily 
and yearly rhythms of the acoustic environment, to conceptualize spe-
cies richness and abundance through a new modality, and, in conjunc-
tion  with  various  metadata  (i.e.  temperature  and  weather  data), 
examine which abiotic factors most influence the acoustic environment. 
Deep learning allowed for the creation of a temporal acoustic activity 
record  specific  to  each  target  species,  which  goes  beyond  the  scope  of 
approaches that rely upon algorithmically-calculated acoustic indices. 
These acoustics indices may reveal general soundscape trends, like the 
relationship between anthrophony and biophony, but only after suffi-
cient proof that they serve as meaningful and robust proxies for relevant

2.6. Generating prediction record 

After  neural  network  training  and  validation,  predictions  for  the 
entire  unvalidated  recording  period  were  generated.  Specifically,  for 
each of the five training folds, a single prediction for every 8 s-interval 
was made for the duration of the year. The five prediction records that 
resulted were then averaged together to create a single prediction re-
cord.  To  summarize  this  data  more  succinctly,  these  8  s-interval  pre-
dictions were then aggregated into hourly prediction records, containing 
the number of instances that each particular sound stimuli was predicted 
per  hour.  This  record  was  normalized  by  the  number  of  8-s  intervals 
actually recorded during that hour, to account for the possibility that 
missing audio data would render a given prediction record artificially 
low. 

2.7. Collecting weather data

artificially minimized or magnified across all five prediction records.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it can be inferred from the text that the authors use a cross-validation technique called "five training folds" to generate multiple prediction records. These records are then averaged together to create a single prediction record. This method could potentially mitigate some effects of randomness introduced by different initializations of weights in the neural network model. Additionally, when generating the final prediction record, the authors normalize the data by accounting for missing audio data, ensuring that any potential gaps do not skew the results. While these techniques help address issues related to variability in the dataset, they do not directly tackle the problem of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline due to factors like random seed values.
