2.5. Description of hyperparameters and training aspects 

The  five  detection  models  were  trained  using  a  manually  labeled 
image dataset for alate detection. After conducted initial computational 
experiments with different combinations of epochs of 300, 400 and 500 
with batch sizes of 8, 16, and 32, it was determined that the optimal 
hyperparameters for our training were 400 epochs with a batch size of 8 
and were constant when comparing the five detection models using 640 
× 640, and 1280 × 1280 pixels input resolutions on each model type. 
The batch defines the number of samples to be worked through before 
moving on to update the internal model parameters (Radiuk, 2017). The 
epoch  number  used  in  training  determines  the  number  of  times  the 
detection model processes the dataset dedicated to training the model 
(Brownlee,  2018).  The  computer  infrastructure  used  for  training

2.7. Web application development 

In order to allow researchers and stakeholder users to interact and 
use  our  best  trained  model  to  detect  alates  on  sorghum  leaves,  we 
created and deployed a web application (Fig. 3). This application allows 
a user to upload images of sorghum leaves, then the model will process 
the  images  within  the  backend  of  the  application.  Once  images  are

2.3. Imagery splitting ratio 

We split the dataset in a ratio of 80:10:10 for training, validation, and 
testing sets, respectively. This ratio was used due to prior evidence of 
exceed performances in detecting small insects and diseases using deep 
learning models (Kiratiratanapruk et al., 2022; Krishnadas and Sampa-
thila, 2021; Mulchandani et al., 2019). The training dataset consisted of 
1543 images, 243 images for the validation set, and 247 images for the 
testing set and all were at input resolution of 640 × 640 pixels. The 1280 
× 1280 pixels input resolution consisted of 1637 images for the training 
set, 255 images for the validation set, and 262 images for the testing set. 
Independently,  we  trained  5  different  versions  of  the  YOLOv5  model 
family  including:  YOLOv5n,  YOLOv5s,  YOLOv5m,  YOLOv5l,  and 
YOLOv5x models to detect alates on sorghum leaves.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, one can infer from the mention of epoch numbers that they play a role in determining the completion of training. Epoch refers to one forward and one backward pass of all the training examples. In other words, an epoch is one iteration over the entire dataset. The number of epochs used in training determines how many times the detection model processes the dataset dedicated to training the model. Therefore, it could be assumed that the training is considered complete once the specified number of epochs has been reached. In this case, the optimal hyperparameters for their training were found to be 400 epochs. Additionally, while not explicitly mentioned, validation loss plateaus or early stopping methods might also have been employed to prevent overfitting during the training process. These methods involve monitoring the performance of the model on a separate validation dataset after each epoch and halting the training if the validation loss stops improving significantly.
