training  (i.e.,  bagging),  then  to  obtain  unbiased  estimates  of  model 
performance  without  omitting  portions  of  the  feature  space  during 
validation. An important note is that the latter procedure also enables 
leveraging of spatial autocorrelation information for model prediction. 
Bagging normally proceeds by drawing many bootstrap samples of 
the data and training models on each, which are aggregated to form an 
ensemble predictor (Breiman, 1996). Individual data points each have 
probability P(si) = 1
n  of being selected during a single draw of a single 
bootstrap sample, where si  is one of n data points distributed over the 
study  area.  Non-independent  data  observations  can  be  considered  as 
partial replication of some information in the modelling dataset. In an 
extreme example, consider two data points at the same location with 
exactly the same environmental measurements. We could conceptualize

Recognizing the potential confluence of these factors, we believe it 
may be efficient to address issues of biased model training and valida-
tion simultaneously in some cases. Here we focus specifically on boot-
strap aggregation applications (i.e., “bagging”; Breiman, 1996), which 
are now widely applied for predictive geospatial modelling, for example, 
as implemented via Random Forest (Breiman, 2001). The bagging pro-
cess itself provides a useful probability-based mechanism for addressing 
both sources of bias using bootstrapping. Spatially correlated map errors 
may result from modelling of clustered sample data, and we propose to 
correct for the effects of clustering sampling on bagging models using 
residual spatial autocorrelation information in the bagging procedure. 
This  is  achieved  by  determining  weights  according  to  empirical  esti-
mates of spatially autocorrelated errors to first reduce bias during model

Ways  in  which  to  minimize  biased  training  of  machine  learning 
models  with  clustered  data  is  an  outstanding  challenge  (e.g.,  Meyer 
et al., 2018, 2019). We hypothesize that the improvements to predictive 
performance observed here using covariance-weighted bagging may be 
a  result  of  reduced  bias  during  model  training  from  down-weighting 
over-sampled  information,  but  this  was  not  tested  explicitly.  A  suit-
able experiment to explore this topic could simulate a surface from a pre- 
defined combination of response functions to environmental variables, 
and  test  for  the  capacity  to  recover  the  responses  using  covariance 
weighted bagging under various clustering scenarios. Simultaneously, it 
would be informative to observe the automatic variable selection and 
regularization behaviour of the bagging model. 

5. Conclusions

Spatially clustered sampling may result in non-independent data that pose challenges for environmental mapping 
applications. Two outstanding challenges resulting from the use of spatially clustered data for predictive geo-
spatial modelling with machine learning approaches are biased model training and validation. These issues can 
be severe for popular bagging models such as Random Forest, yet one or both are often ignored or are handled 
using  sub-optimal  approaches.  We  propose  to  address  these  challenges  using  information  on  both  the  spatial 
autocorrelation of map errors and the spatial sampling intensity. This is achieved by applying the residual spatial 
covariance  as  a  weighting  function  for  the  bagging  procedure  and  for  the  calculation  of  weighted  validation 
statistics. Using this approach, the full feature space of the sample data is retained during model training and

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, including the use of random seed values. However, it does touch upon related concepts in the context of machine learning models, particularly bagging models like Random Forest.

In the context of bagging models, randomness is inherently introduced through the process of bootstrapping, where multiple subsets of the original dataset are created by randomly selecting instances with replacement. Each subset is used to train a different model, and the final output is obtained by combining the outputs of all individual models. This introduces variability into the modeling process, helping to avoid overfitting and improving overall performance.

While the context does not provide specific strategies for managing randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it suggests that leveraging randomness through techniques like bootstrapping can improve model performance and generalizability. To manage randomness in the deep learning pipeline, similar strategies might include setting random seeds for initialization, shuffling datasets before splitting them into training and testing sets, and employing techniques like dropout regularization to introduce controlled randomness during training.
