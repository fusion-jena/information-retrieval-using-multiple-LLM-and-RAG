Sustainable natural resources management relies on effective and timely assessment of conservation and land 
management practices. Using satellite imagery for Earth observation has become essential for monitoring land 
cover/land use (LCLU) changes and identifying critical areas for conserving biodiversity. Remote Sensing (RS) 
datasets  are  often  quite  large  and require  tremendous  computing power  to  process.  The  emergence  of  cloud- 
based  computing  techniques  presents  a  powerful  avenue  to  overcome  computing  limitations  by  allowing 
machine-learning algorithms to process and analyze large RS datasets on the cloud. Our study aimed to classify 
LCLU for the Talassemtane National Park (TNP) using a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model incorporating five 
spectral indices to differentiate six land use classes using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Optimization of the DNN

Helpful Answer:
The study primarily focuses on using a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model for Land-use and Land-cover Classification (LCLU) within the Talassemtane National Park (TNP), utilizing Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. This indicates that the main data format employed in this deep learning pipeline is image data. Specifically, the researchers utilized spectral indices derived from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery to create a dataset for training their DNN model. These spectral indices provide valuable information about various aspects of the landscape, such as vegetation health, water content, and soil composition. By leveraging these spectral indices, the researchers could effectively differentiate between six distinct land use classes within the TNP.

In summary, the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is image data, specifically the spectral indices extracted from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Other common data formats like audio, video, or CSV files do not appear to be relevant to this particular study.
