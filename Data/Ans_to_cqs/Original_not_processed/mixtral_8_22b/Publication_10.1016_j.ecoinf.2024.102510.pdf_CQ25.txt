bird image data is also a challenge, as deep learning algorithms require 
large amounts of labeled data to train effectively. The lighting condi-
tions, weather, and other environmental factors present in the image can 
also impact the appearance of birds, adding complexity to recognition. 
The dataset used to train a deep learning model may not represent the 
bird population in the wild, leading to bias and potentially impacting the 
accuracy of the model.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it appears that the deep learning models mentioned are primarily being used for image classification tasks. These models are designed to classify images into specific categories or classes, such as identifying different bird species from their images. Some examples include recognizing endemic birds, detecting birds in images, and distinguishing between various bird species. However, without more explicit details about each model's intended use case, it cannot be definitively stated what the exact purpose of every deep learning model is.
