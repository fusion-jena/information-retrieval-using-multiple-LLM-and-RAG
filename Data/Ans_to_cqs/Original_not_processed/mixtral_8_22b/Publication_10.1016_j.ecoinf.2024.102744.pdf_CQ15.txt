overfitting. Additionally, the Global Average Pooling layer summarizes features, generating input 

for the fully connected layer. This layer also facilitates the visualization of regions relied upon by 

the network for predictions. The subsequent three fully connected layers generate the predicted 

class for the original image

Faster RCNN belongs  to the RCNN family of object  detection networks.  Essentially, it 

comprises two modules:  the first  module utilizes CNN to  propose regions,  whereas the second 

module employs a Fast RCNN model to process these suggested regions. The Region Proposal 

Network  (RPN)  represents  a  significant  enhancement  to  the  Faster  RCNN  architecture, 

distinguishing it from other networks within the RCNN family. The RPN takes an input image of

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, we can infer that the models mentioned in the text, like YOLOv5 and Faster RCNN, use some form of optimization technique during their training phase. These optimization algorithms help minimize the loss function and update the weights of the neural network accordingly. Without knowing the exact implementation details, it cannot be confirmed whether SGD, Adam, or any other optimization algorithm was employed.
