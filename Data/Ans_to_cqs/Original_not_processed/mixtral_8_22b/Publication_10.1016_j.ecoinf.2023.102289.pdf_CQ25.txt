Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

A.1.2. Loading the pre-trained module 

By default, LaDeco employs the deeplabv3 þ resnet269 model. The deeplabv3 part is a semantic segmentation algorithm developed by Google 
(Chen et al., 2018), and Resnet269 is a 269-layer Resnet neural network (Zhang et al., 2020). Users can switch to other pre-trained models as needed 
(Please refer to https://cv.gluon.ai/api/model_zoo.html#). 

A.1.3. Setting the threshold 

The primary function of LaDeco is to calculate the pixel percentage of each landscape element in the image. Users can set a threshold to filter out 

negligible values; for example, values below 1% can be rounded to zero. This threshold is customizable.

2.3. MXNet and GluonCV 

MXNet  is  an  open-source  AI  platform  that  offers  a  comprehensive 
suite of neural network models and functionalities for AI development 
(Chen et al., 2015). MXNet serves as the central computational module; 
when combined with GluonCV, GluonNLP, and GluonTS, it constitutes a 
robust development system. In this study, we used GluonCV to develop 
LaDeco. 

GluonCV offers a set of 25 segmentation models, ten of which have 
been trained on the ADE20K dataset and are therefore well-suited for 
landscape applications (Ho and Ho, 2022). The ADE20K dataset devel-
oped by the MIT Torralba team contributes significantly to the SS field. 
This dataset focused on the recognition of 150 indoor and outdoor ob-
jects  (Zhou  et  al.,  2018a,  2018b).  In  this  study,  55  outdoor  visual 
landscape elements from the ADE20K dataset were used.

2.2. Semantic segmentation 

Semantic  Segmentation  is  a  technology  used  in  image  recognition 
that assigns specific objects to each pixel of an image (Guo et al., 2018; 
Yu  et  al.,  2018).  This  is  illustrated  in  Fig.  2.  An  SS  model  generally 
comprises two main components: a downsampling network, which de-
tects objects within an image, and an upsampling network, which as-
signs each pixel to its corresponding object. 

Semantic  segmentation  has  matured  into  the  field  of  Artificial  In-
telligence. Several open-source platforms offer SS functionality. Among 
these, MXNet, managed by the Apache Software Foundation, offers the 
most extensive selection of SS models. According to research conducted 
by  Ho  and  Ho  (2022),  models  trained  on  the  ADE20K  dataset  are 
particularly  well  suited  for  landscape-based  applications.  However,

Helpful Answer:

The purpose of the deep learning model employed by LaDeco is semantic segmentation. Semantic segmentation is a technology used in image recognition that assigns specific objects to each pixel of an image. It is primarily used to classify pixels into different categories or classes based on their features. In the case of LaDeco, the primary function is to calculate the pixel percentage of each landscape element in the image. By employing the deeplabv3+resnet269 model, users can identify and quantify various landscape elements present in images.
