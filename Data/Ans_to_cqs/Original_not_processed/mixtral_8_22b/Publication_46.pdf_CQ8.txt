kappa, with values 0.652 and 0.94, respectively, also gave support to the applicability of
CNN in comparison to conventional SDM’s such as BIOCLIM. These values showcase the
superiority of deep learning models for species probability distribution using the given set
of ecological and bioclimatic parameters.

modelling approaches and the increased number of datasets has made this model one of
the most globally accepted SDMs. There is a growing concern for the establishment of the
nonlinear relationship between the bioclimatic parameters through innovative approaches
such as deep learning-based models. It has been observed that the BIOCLIM model is
overestimates the species distribution and the higher probability of species occurrence at
the higher altitude. Moreover, it has been observed that the distribution pattern of the
predicted Rhododendron arboreum distribution using CNN architecture is quite different at
some places than from conventional BIOCLIM models. The current work proposed deep
learning-based CNN architecture for probability distribution modelling and proved to
perform better than the traditional BIOCLIM model. There was an underestimation of
species distribution observed in CNN than BIOCLIM. The distribution probability in CNN

This study is a novel approach towards establishing a CNN architecture and testing
the performance of CNN in SDM and its comparison with other well established SDMs
namely, BIOCLIM. This study was conducted on the foothills of the Himalayas, where the
altitudinal variation is very drastic and varies from 416 to 7801 m above mean sea level.
This high-altitude Himalayan ranges constitutes a heterogeneous ecosystem and is home to
many rare/endangered, medicinally, and economically important plant species. One of the
major economically and medicinally important plant species, Rhododendron arboreum,
was tracked and mapped in this study using different SDMs. Based on its occurrence and
several ecological and bioclimatic satellite-based observations, the probability distribution
of the Rhododendron arboreum was established. The CNN based probability distribution
model outperformed the presence only based BIOCLIM model with an AUC score of

Network (CNN) architecture is proposed, designed, and tested, which eventually gave much better
accuracy than the BIOCLIM model. Both of the models were given 16 input parameters, including
ecological and atmospheric variables, which were statistically resampled and were then utilized
in establishing the linear and nonlinear relationship to better ﬁt the occurrence scenarios of the
species. The input parameters were mostly acquired from the recent satellite missions, including
MODIS, Sentinel-2, Sentinel-5p, the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), and ECOSTRESS.
The performance across all the thresholds was evaluated using the value of the Area Under Curve
(AUC) evaluation metrics. The AUC value was found to be 0.917 with CNN, whereas it was 0.68
with BIOCLIM, respectively. The performance evaluation metrics indicate the superiority of CNN for
species distribution over BIOCLIM.
