analysis. However, while regression-based models remain prevalent (n
= 23), there was an increased use of machine learning techniques (n =
22), particularly Maxent, and, although limited, deep learning strategies
(e.g., neural networks, Cazau et al., 2023), likely suggesting a shift to-
wards machine learning methodologies (Maglietta et al., 2023). Another
notable trend was the increased incorporation of anthropogenic vari-
ables in modelling to assess the influence of human activity on species
habitat use, especially related to fishing and boating activities (n = 7
studies; e.g., Díaz L´opez and Methion, 2024).

2.4. Meta data coding & data synthesis

Science and SCOPUS), curating specific search terms and synonyms and
used Boolean operators and wildcards (asterisks) to account for word
variants and plural forms. Additional information on search strategy are
provided in the Appendix A along with Table S1 showing all the terms
included in the final search. The literature search was conducted in
January 2023 and considered all studies currently available in the two
databases until 31 December 2022. We did not add any language filters/
restrictions to the search strategy developed so that scientific literature
with an abstract in English but a full text in other languages was
potentially included in the search. Except for conference proceedings,
we did not include grey literature (technical reports, dissertations)
because we wanted to limit our search to the most relevant and
advanced scientific applications on the topic, given the extensive liter-
ature already available.

2.3. Screening process

for model validation, either in addition to internal validation strategies
(n = 22), or as the sole validation method (n = 17). Notably, a consid-
erable number of studies did not use an explicit validation method to
measure model performance or did not clearly state this in the text (n =
94, 32%) (category “not provided” in Fig. 10).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not mention any specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it discusses various projection methodologies utilized in ecological modeling, including regression-based models, machine learning techniques like Maxent, and deep learning strategies like neural networks. It also mentions the increasing use of anthropogenic variables in modeling to assess the impact of human activities on species habitat use. Furthermore, the context describes the screening process, meta-data coding, and data synthesis methods employed in the study. Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot determine which datasets were used in the deep learning pipeline.
