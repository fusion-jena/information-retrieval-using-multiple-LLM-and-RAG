Machine learning methods require text preprocessing, such as word 
segmentation and stop word removal, followed by the selection of a text 
portion to manually annotate emotions for accuracy verification. Among 
machine  learning  models,  the  enhanced  representation  through 
knowledge  integration  (ERNIE)  model  achieved  significant  results  in 
previous studies by learning prior semantic relationships and word order 
features from massive amounts of data (Sun et al., 2019). The ERNIE 
model  directly  models  prior  semantic  knowledge  units,  thereby 
enhancing model semantic representation (Wang et al., 2020). Test re-
sults for various Chinese tasks showed that the model performed better 
than  the  bidirectional  encoder  representations  from  the  transformer 
model proposed by Google AI (Sun et al., 2019). At the International 
Workshop on Semantic Evaluation 2020, the ERNIE model earned first 
place  for  a  mixed-language  emotional  analysis  task.  Detailed  de-

processing instructions can be found in Text S1. The final available data 
elements totaled 6802.

Tweets are usually short texts with such characteristics as sparsity, 
real-time nature, and irregularity. These features increase the difficulty 
of text processing (Edwards et al., 2022; Garg and Kumar, 2018; Sun 
et al., 2021) and require data cleaning to support subsequent analyses. 
Data cleaning includes text filtering and Chinese text segmentation. The 
former was used to filter out unnecessary symbols and noise, such as 
notes, advertisements, useless numbers, punctuation marks, stop words, 
and repeated texts on websites. User-generated text that deviated from 
the  theme  was  also  filtered  out  through  a  manual  review.  The  latter 
involved dividing the natural language composed of Chinese text into 
meaningful  words,  which  is  a  key  technology  in  text  analyses  (Tian 
et al., 2021). We used Python’s Jieba Library for Chinese text segmen-
tation and a lexical analysis and included location, time, and organiza-
tional nouns.

In the LDA model’s text generation process, the number of topics k 
requires presetting. We used perplexity to construct the optimal number 
of topics; the calculation formula is shown in Eq. 1. Perplexity refers to 
the  degree  of  uncertainty  when  using  the  LDA  model  to  classify  any 
corpus  (Palanichamy  et  al.,  2021).  In  general,  when  the  perplexity 
downward trend is not obvious or reaches the inflection point, k is the 
optimal number of topics (Qin et al., 2021). We set the Dirichlet dis-
tribution prior parameters α and β as the default values. For the posterior 
parameters φ and θ, the LDA model does not directly perform accurate 
calculations;  it  uses  the  variational  inference  and  approximate 
maximum likelihood function to estimate them (Blei et al., 2003; Sun 
and Yin, 2017). The maximum number of iterations in this study was set 
at 50. After determining the optimal number of topics k based on the

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved. These may include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization involves rescaling the input features so they fall within a specific range, often between 0 and 1. This helps prevent certain features from dominating others due to their scale. Scaling is another technique used to standardize the range of independent variables or features of data. It brings all features to the same level of magnitude, ensuring no single feature overpowers the others during the learning process. Cleaning is a crucial step that involves removing irrelevant information, correcting inconsistencies, handling missing data, and eliminating duplicates. In the given context, data cleaning for tweets includes text filtering and Chinese text segmentation. Text filtering removes unnecessary symbols and noise, while Chinese text segmentation divides the natural language into meaningful words, which is essential for text analysis.
