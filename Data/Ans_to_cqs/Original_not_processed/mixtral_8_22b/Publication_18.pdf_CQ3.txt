dataset for training is costly, the learning of CNNs on small datasets can be boosted by data-augmentation, which 
consists of increasing the volume of the training dataset artificially, and additionally by transfer learning, which 
consists of starting the learning of the network from a prior knowledge rather from scratch38,39.

Preliminaries on CNN models for image classification and object detection in images.  Deep 
Neural Networks (DNNs) are a subset of machine learning algorithms able to learn from a training dataset to 
make predictions on new examples called testset. They are built using a hierarchical architecture of increasing 
sophistication, each level of this hierarchy is called layer. One of their main particularities is their capacity to 
extract the existent features from data automatically without the need of external hand crafted features. Under the 
supervised learning paradigm, DNNs provide a powerful framework when trained on a large number of labelled 
samples.

rocks” (Data S1). Whale images for training the CNN were mainly aerial images. For step-2, the training dataset 
contains 700 aerial images, with whales and background, in which each whale is annotated within a bounding box 
(the total number of bounding boxes is 945).

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention all the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does indicate that one technique was employed for the specific task of identifying whales in aerial images. This technique involves bounding box annotation, where each whale in the image is enclosed within a rectangular boundary. This method is commonly used in object detection tasks, allowing the model to learn the visual characteristics of the target objects (whales in this case) and distinguish them from the background or other objects in the image. Other potential data annotation techniques that could have been used but are not mentioned include semantic segmentation (where every pixel in the image is assigned a class label), instance segmentation (which combines object detection and semantic segmentation to identify individual instances of objects), and landmark annotation (used for facial recognition tasks).
