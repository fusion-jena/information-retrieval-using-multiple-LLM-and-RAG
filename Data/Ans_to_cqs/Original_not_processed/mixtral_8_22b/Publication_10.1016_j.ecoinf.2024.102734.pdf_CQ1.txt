Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

query set are negative. Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2019) propose transductive
propagation that iteratively propagates labels from labelled instances to
unlabelled instances according to the graph structure of the embeddings.
Other semi-supervised learning techniques have been applied such as
active learning. Wang et al. (Wang et al., 2022) combines a few-shot

2.1. State of the art

Machine learning tasks designed for low-data contexts are referred to
as few-shot learning tasks. Within the context of bioacoustic applications,

the field of computational bioacoustics (Stowell, 2021) has experienced
significant development over the last few years, in part due to public
challenges such as the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes
and Events (DCASE) (Nolasco et al., 2023).

samples (red line) compared to randomly ordered samples, no active
learning (blue line), and active learning using high-certainty samples
(yellow line). The baseline accuracy is calculated using a 2-shot, 2-way
test accuracy without fine-tuning (81.4%). The AST feature extraction
model is fine-tuned on a subset of 500 training samples. Model perfor-
mance is re-evaluated on the test set at 10 sample increments using each
of the three sample orderings. Low certainty refers to queries with a
similar Euclidean distance to prototypical embeddings and therefore lie
along decision boundaries. For high-certainty samples, the order is
reversed with query embedding in close proximity to prototypical em-
beddings being prioritised for model fine-tuning.

Coloured vectors denote embeddings that were previously labelled.

Fig. 4. Prototypical learning provides a class probability distribution that a query belongs to each class. The probability distribution is used to rank the priority of
samples. The colours denote the class distributions in a simplified 2-dimensional view.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that raw field data are segmented into 5-second spectrograms, which suggests that the data might be collected through field recordings or sensor deployments. Additionally, the use of a pre-trained feature extraction model implies that publicly available datasets could also be employed for this purpose. Nevertheless, further details regarding the exact methodologies used for gathering raw data are not explicitly stated within the given context.
