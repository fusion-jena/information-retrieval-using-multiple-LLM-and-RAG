Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

specific steps are outlined: 

Step 1: Select appropriate water downloading gear and sensors for 
data collection. Pre-processing of the acquired data, such as denoising, 
image enhancement, and correction. In order to train and evaluate un-
derwater target detection models, the dataset needs to be labeled. Then 
separate underwater images collected from the underwater environment 
into training and test images. 

Step 2: Prepare hardware servers capable of training deep learning 
models to deploy the YWnet network. This allows learning weights to 
recognize  underwater  organisms.  Tune  the  hyperparameters  of  the 
model such as learning rate, batch size and network depth to achieve the 
best performance of the model.

To extract the input information, the SRC3 block employs a parallel 
analysis  of  the  input  feature  map  using  two  convolution  kernels.  In 
contrast to the C3 block, the SRC3 block incorporates two convolution 
kernels prior to the input of the bottleneck block. One of the kernels is 
responsible  for  halving  the  dimension  of  the  feature  map,  while  the 
other  maintains  the  dimension  unchanged.  This  approach  allows  for 
more  comprehensive  processing  of  the  input  features,  enabling  the 
model  to  capture  both  high-level  semantic  information  and  preserve 
relevant details during the feature extraction process. The convolution 
kernel size utilized is 3 × 3, which leads to a broader receptive field of 
information and richer characteristics compared to the 1 × 1 convolu-
tion kernel. The output semantic information can be augmented by the 
action of two convolution kernels. The information output from the first

compared  to  the  original  YOLOv5.  Krishnan  et  al.  (2022)  focused  on 
data  augmentation  techniques  to  increase  the  size  of  training  under-
water datasets, leading to improved detection performance and average 
precision.

3.1.1. Adding the attention module 

Through the attention mechanism, the network may better learn the 
correlation between data and enhance the overall model's performance. 
In this work, CBAM is embedded in the backbone network of YWnet to 
improve the feature extraction of underwater detection information. As 
illustrated in Fig. 2, CBAM is a lightweight, commonly used attention 
mechanism that combines spatial and channel attention. Given an in-
termediate feature map F ∈ RC×H×W as input, CBAM sequentially infers a 
1D channel attention map Mc ∈ RC×1×1  and a 2D spatial attention map 

Ms ∈ R1×H×W. The calculation formula is: 

F' = Mc(F) ⊗ F.

F'' = Ms(F') ⊗ F'.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it mentions preparing hardware servers capable of training deep learning models to deploy the YWnet network. This suggests that the deployment process likely involves setting up suitable hardware infrastructure to support the execution of the trained model. Additionally, the mention of tuning hyperparameters implies that optimization strategies were employed to ensure optimal performance of the deployed model. Unfortunately, without further context or additional information, it cannot be determined if other common practices like model serialization or platform selection were part of the deployment process.
