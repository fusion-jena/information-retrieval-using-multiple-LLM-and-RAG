cation  studies,  a  lack  of  data  is  the  greatest  challenge  and  limitation 
researchers encounter (Schneider et al., 2019). With the data collection 
compiled  in  this  work,  we  contribute  the  largest  fully  labeled  snow 
leopard dataset for deep learning research. In addition, we anticipate 
that our novel deep learning methods will encourage other academics to 
contribute  more  datasets  to  Whiskerbook.org  for  the  purpose  of 
continuously curating and enhancing the data used to improve the deep 
learning pipeline. Comparing these results to those of an earlier study by 
Johansson et al. (2020) that depended on human manual classification, 
without  AI  or  software,  determined  that  observers  significantly  over-
estimate  the  true  abundance.  AI-based  individual  ID  within  Whiske 
rbook.org  has  demonstrated  the  potential  to  enhance  the  precision 
and  efficiency  of  manual  observers,  approaching  more  accurate  esti-

Image classification 

To assess the efficacy of the various techniques, we compute the top- 
k accuracy on a test set, where k = 1, 5, and 10 represents the position of 
the correct match (i.e., an annotation of the same individual represented 
by a query annotation) within a list of proposed matches. Consequently, 
a top-1 rank is an accurate result supplied by the algorithm as the most 
probable match for a candidate annotation. A top-5 rating indicates that 
the correct answer might be any of the top-5 values among the returned 
options, and so on.

The  snow  leopard  training  pipeline  described  here  may  be  repur-
posed rather quickly to train new models if more users utilize the system 
and  additional  data  is  submitted.  The  existing  model  may  also  help 
bootstrap that data-curation process. There is a considerable possibility 
for  regional  and  global  research  collaborations  with  snow  leopard 
research  institutions  to  curate  and  independently  identify  data  that 
would advance these existing models toward greater sophistication and 
improved performance. Deep learning systems have the ability to sur-
pass humans in the re-identification of animals, even in the absence of 
obvious patterns and markings, if sufficient datasets and collaboration

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that researchers face challenges due to a lack of data in cation studies. It also states that the compiled data contributes to the largest fully labeled snow leopard dataset for deep learning research. Additionally, the authors anticipate that their novel deep learning methods will encourage other academics to contribute more datasets to Whiskerbook.org. This suggests that the data collection process likely involves gathering labeled images of snow leopards from various sources, possibly including surveys, sensors, or public datasets, but the exact methods are not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
