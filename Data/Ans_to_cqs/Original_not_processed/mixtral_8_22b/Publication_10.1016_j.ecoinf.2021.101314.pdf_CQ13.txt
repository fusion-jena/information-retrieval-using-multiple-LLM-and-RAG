Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

The method requires manually setting several parameters, described 
in more details in the user guide.7 In particular, about half a dozen pa-
rameters allow to set thresholds on the size of the support of the output 
redescriptions and to control the length and complexity of their queries. 
We required that at least 1% of localities satisfy both queries (Min-
SuppIn) and that at least 30% of localities satisfy neither of the queries 
(MinSuppOut). In other words, the intersection of the supports of the 
two  queries  (the  support  of  the  redescription)  and  their  union  were 
required to contain at least 1% and at most 70% of all localities. This is 
an inclusive choice, not overly restrictive, that aims at capturing local 
patterns. Increasing the upper threshold further would jeopardize the 
local aspect of the analysis, and would lead to something more akin to 
non-linear regression. For a redescription to be informative, its support

to three dental variables and two climate variables. In the second run, 
we allowed dental queries to involve disjunctions, and climate queries to 
contain up to three variables, but tightened the requirement of accuracy 
gain.  Specifically,  under  this  constraint,  a  candidate  query  can  be 
extended by automatically adding the next variable only if the accuracy, 
as measured by the Jaccard coefficient, increases by a least 0.1. The goal 
is to obtain interpretable, not overly complex (long) queries. This can be 
achieved either explicitly, by limiting the number of variables and the 
operators  used  in  the  queries,  as  in  the  first  run,  or  implicitly,  by 
allowing increased complexity only if it brings substantial improvement 
in terms of accuracy, as in the second run.

calities  that  support  both  queries,  only  the  dental 
trait query and only the climate query, are drawn in 
purple,  in  red  and  in  blue,  respectively.  For  each 
redescription,  we  list  the  query  over  dental  traits 
variables  (qD),  the  query  over  bioclimatic  variables 
(qC), the accuracy of the redescription (J) as well as 
the  size  of  its  support  as  a  percentage  of  the  total 
number of localities (supp %). (For interpretation of

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no information regarding the use of a deep learning model or any specific hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer. Instead, the text discusses a method that involves manually setting several parameters, which are detailed in a user guide. These parameters include thresholds on the size of the support of the output redescriptions and controls for the length and complexity of their queries. Some examples of these parameters mentioned in the context are MinSuppIn (at least 1% of localities satisfying both queries) and MinSuppOut (at least 30% of localities satisfying neither of the queries). However, these do not correspond directly to typical deep learning hyperparameters like learning rate or optimizer. Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot provide the requested information about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model.
