3.1. Training Evaluation

The model was trained for 350 epochs and evaluated using the scores precision, recall, F1, GIoU,
and mAP, as seen in Table 2. The scores are calculated from model validation data, consisting of
321 image tiles. The F1 score and mAP score are seen to follow each other closely, given indications on
the training at diﬀerent stages, the model quickly reached F1 and mAP scores of ~0.4, whereafter they
continue to increase but at a slower rate. At the end of the training, the model achieved the accuracy
scores of F1 = 0.530 and mAP = 0.557. The GIoU is steadily decreasing, indicating that the model is
becoming better at correctly locating targets.

Geo-Inf. 2020, 9, x FOR PEER REVIEW 12 of 15  Figure 10 shows an example of iceberg training data used in the model and is a good indicator of a complex situation where data are to be labelled. It could be argued that too many objects are not labelled, leaving them out of training, but in opposition to this, one could say that too many small objects are included, and these are not of great importance. In Figure 11, training objects are also seen to be located within the large piece of floating ice in the right side of the image, this also raises the question of icebergs being present in other types of ice, such as in this study [23], or if such large pieces of floating ice should be in a class of their own or maybe not be included at all.

2.4. Evaluation Metrics

The model is evaluated using the following metrics: Precision, Recall and F1, which are used to

measure the model detection performance [21]. The formulas include the classiﬁcation terms:

•
•
•

TP, true positive: model detects a true object;
FP, false positive: model detects a false object;
FN, false negative: model did not detect a true object.

The scores are calculated as:

Precision =

TP
TP + FP

Recal =

TP
TP + FN

F1 = 2 ∗ Precision ∗ Recall
Precision + Recall

Helpful Answer:

During the training process, the model was monitored using several evaluation metrics including precision, recall, F1 score, GIoU, and mean Average Precision (mAP). These metrics were calculated based on the model validation data, which consisted of 321 image tiles. The F1 score and mAP score followed each other closely throughout the training process, providing insights into the model's progress at different stages. Initially, the model rapidly attained F1 and mAP scores of approximately 0.4 before continuing to improve at a slower pace. By the conclusion of the training, the model had achieved an accuracy level characterized by F1 = 0.530 and mAP = 0.557. Additionally, the steady decrease in GIoU indicated that the model became increasingly proficient at accurately identifying target locations.

To summarize, the strategy employed to track the model's performance during training involved utilizing multiple evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, GIoU, and mAP. These metrics offered valuable insights into the model's development over time, enabling continuous monitoring and optimization of its performance.
