training, we set the learning decay rate to 0.7 so that the
learning rate gradually decays as the training progresses.
Table 1 shows the experimental results in which we ﬁxed
the voxel size and batch size and adjusted the regulariza-
tion strength, from which we can be told that result is better
while regularization strength is 0.2.

According to the pipeline of our framework, ﬁrst, we
compute the geometric partition. Then, each geometric
partition is converted into a superpoint. Next, we input the
superpoints in the SPG to a PointNet network for super-
point embedding. The ﬁnal operation is to segment the
point clouds based on context with a graph convolution
network. Therefore, the results of geometric partition have
a great impact on the semantic segmentation due to dif-
ferent superpoint caused by varying partition result.

We will discuss the regularization parameter l which
inﬂuences the coarseness of the partition. In formula (3),
the former term describes the ﬁdelity, and the latter is the
smoothness. The varying regularization parameter l causes
different partition results. Then, when we convert
the
partition to a superpoint, it will construct varied superpoint
graph, which is actually the neural network input.

overall accuracy (OA) as metrics. We adjusted three
parameters (voxel size is the voxelization subsampling
size, the regularization strength inﬂuences the coarseness
of the minimal partition, and batch size means the batch
number of point cloud samples in training). We used the
hold-out method to distinguish the test set and the training
set at a ratio of 3:7 for preprocessing the original data. We
further adjust the parameters of networks to explore the

inﬂuence of parameters on experimental results, and we
discuss the selection of the frame parameters.

Selection of the Frame Parameters

We investigated the effects of several parameters in our
framework, such as the regularization strength, voxel size
for the minimal partition, and training batch size. In

2. Model training: We process data with a deep neural
network and adjust the training epoch, batch size, and
volume size to output a classiﬁer for prediction.
3. Result output: The point cloud test set is segmented,
and we can obtain the ﬁnal segmentation results. The
output ﬁles include point cloud geometric partition
graphs, SPGs, and segmentation results.

Helpful Answer:
In this study, the authors use regularization methods to prevent overfitting in their deep learning pipeline. They mention using a learning decay rate of 0.7 to gradually decrease the learning rate during training. However, they do not explicitly state whether they use specific regularization techniques like dropout or L2 regularization. Instead, they focus on adjusting the regularization strength to improve the performance of their model. By experimenting with different values for the regularization strength, they found that a value of 0.2 yielded the best results. This suggests that the authors may have implemented some form of regularization, but they do not provide details about the exact technique used.
