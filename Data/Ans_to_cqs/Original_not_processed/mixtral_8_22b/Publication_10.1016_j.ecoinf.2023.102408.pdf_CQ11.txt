5. Discussion 

Agroforestry is a crucial segment of integrated agriculture and forest 
land use that supports high carbon sequestration and maintains regu-
lating services in the region (Chen et al., 2015). However, the current 
study analysed AGB estimation based on field data and predicted using 
remotely sensed optical and SAR datasets and their derived indices using 
machine learning models such as RF, ANN, and SVM. Most of the esti-
mated AGB in the Belpada block was within the range below 30 Mg/ha, 
suggesting relatively recent plantations. For instance, Rizvi et al. (2011) 
estimated the AGB in poplar (Populus deltoides)-based agroforestry sys-
tems in Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh, Yamunanagar, and Haryana. They 
found that AGB ranged between 27 and 32 Mg/ha in plantations and 
between 66 and 83 Mg/ha in agri-silviculture areas. Swamy and Puri

crucial role in mitigating overfitting. Smaller c values lead the optimiser 
to  select  a  larger  margin,  potentially  misinterpreting  numerous  data 
points.  Conversely,  higher  c  values  result in  smaller  margins and  can 
cause overfitting. Thus, we tuned the c value within the range of 0.1 to 
20,  ensuring  a  balanced  trade-off  between  the  margin  size  and  over-
fitting (Table S2).
