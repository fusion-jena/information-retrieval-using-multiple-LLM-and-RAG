2.3.2. Training of the bird sound noise reduction network based on deep 
feature loss

traditional noise reduction methods that generally tend to be suitable for 
eliminating  smooth  noise.  However,  field  recordings  often  consist  of 
significant  amounts  of  non-smooth  noise,  rendering  traditional  bio-
acoustic  noise  reduction  methods  at  least  partially  ineffective  for 
adaptive noise reduction in field recordings. In this context, relatively 
few  studies  to  date  have  sought  to  assess  the  potential  value  of  deep 
learning for bioacoustic noise reduction. Moreover, the current scarcity 
of  labeled  clean  bioacoustic  recordings  makes  it  challenging  to  train 
deep  learning-based  models  for  bioacoustic  noise  reduction.  Further-
more,  the  application  of  deep  learning  bioacoustic  noise  reduction 
methods for different types of noises and different frequency bands of 
bird species calls has yet to be thoroughly investigated. Given that birds 
are  considered  good  indicators  of  ecological  health  and  that  their

The  audio  classification  loss  network  consists  of  convolutional 
layers, average pooling layers, and a logic classifier layer. Layers 1 to 13 
also include convolutional operations, batch normalization, and LReLU 
operations,  with  down-sampling  operations  performed  between  each 
layer  with  a  factor  of  2.  Layer  14  includes  convolutional  operations, 
normalization, and nonlinear operations, omitting the down-sampling 
operation.  Layers  15  and  16  are  the  average  pooling  and  the  logic 
classifier layers, respectively. 

The loss is calculated as the weighted L1 distance between the first 
and  second  groups  of  activation  features,  which  can  be  expressed  as 
follows (Germain et al., 2018):

reducing noise, and accordingly, would not be suitable for processing 
large  volumes  of  recorded  data  collected  in  the  field.  Furthermore, 
compared with the bird sound noise reduction network based on deep 
feature loss and the SEGAN algorithm, we found that the noise reduction 
efficiencies of the WebRTC and Wiener Filter algorithms were notably 
higher. This disparity in performance can be attributed to the fact that 
the deep learning model is larger in size and is thus more demanding of 
computational resources. However, it should be noted that the execution 
time of the deep learning models on CPUs is acceptable.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to this query based on the given context.

Based on the provided context, there is no mention of any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The focus of the context is on the framework of a bird sound noise reduction network based on deep feature loss, including its architecture and training process. There is also discussion on the limitations of traditional noise reduction methods and the potential benefits of using deep learning for bioacoustic noise reduction. However, there is no reference to addressing data bias specifically.
