denoting  a  Gaussian  process  (MacKay,  2003).  During  model  fitting, 
hyperparameters  are  determined  from  the  data  using  methods  like 
maximum likelihood estimation or Bayesian approaches, accommoda-
ting diverse datasets with varying complexities (Sun et al., 2022; Wil-

new  data  points,  offering  both  point  estimates  and  insights  into  pre-

rior model performance is signaled by higher R2 scores, reduced RMSE 
and MAE scores, and MBE figures nearing zero. In these equations, xi 
and yi refer to the observed and predicted variable, and n is the number 
of sample data.

During the validation phase of the machine learning algorithms, a K- 
fold cross-validation technique was implemented. Additionally, a four- 
fold  cross-validation  was  conducted  on  the  training  dataset,  as  illus-
trated in Fig. 4. The dataset was initially extracted, and the feature set 
was randomly divided into four mutually exclusive folds through strat-
ified sampling (Guo et al., 2021; Psychalas et al., 2023). Each fold served 
as  the  validation  set,  while  the  remaining  three  folds  constituted  the 
training set for model training. To address imbalances, random under 
sampling (RUS) was applied to the training set, while the validation set 
remained unchanged. The model underwent training using the balanced 
three-fold  training  dataset  for  a  specified  number  of  epochs  and  was 
subsequently  tested  on  the  validation  fold to  generate  predictions for 
that specific fold. This process iterated four times with distinct valida-

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention the method used for optimizing the hyperparameters of the model. However, it does state that during model fitting, hyperparameters are determined from the data using methods such as maximum likelihood estimation or Bayesian approaches. These methods can be used to find optimal values for the hyperparameters based on the given data. Grid search and random search are common techniques used for hyperparameter optimization, but they are not mentioned specifically in this context. Therefore, without additional information, it cannot be definitively stated which method was used for hyperparameter optimization in this case.
