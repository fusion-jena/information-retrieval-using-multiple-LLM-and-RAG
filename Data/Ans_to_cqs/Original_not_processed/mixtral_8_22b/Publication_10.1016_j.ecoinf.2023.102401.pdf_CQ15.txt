To extract the input information, the SRC3 block employs a parallel 
analysis  of  the  input  feature  map  using  two  convolution  kernels.  In 
contrast to the C3 block, the SRC3 block incorporates two convolution 
kernels prior to the input of the bottleneck block. One of the kernels is 
responsible  for  halving  the  dimension  of  the  feature  map,  while  the 
other  maintains  the  dimension  unchanged.  This  approach  allows  for 
more  comprehensive  processing  of  the  input  features,  enabling  the 
model  to  capture  both  high-level  semantic  information  and  preserve 
relevant details during the feature extraction process. The convolution 
kernel size utilized is 3 × 3, which leads to a broader receptive field of 
information and richer characteristics compared to the 1 × 1 convolu-
tion kernel. The output semantic information can be augmented by the 
action of two convolution kernels. The information output from the first

their ability to automatically learn and extract low- and high-level visual 
features  directly  from  the  data.  Traditional  methods  often  require 
manual  feature  engineering,  where  domain-specific  knowledge  and 
expertise are used to design handcrafted features. Deep learning algo-
rithms,  on  the  other  hand,  can  learn  feature  representations  directly 
from the raw input data, eliminating the need for manual feature engi-
neering.  Efficiently  handling  these  multiscale  features  is  crucial  for 
network performance, given their diverse resolutions. Feature pyramid 
networks  (FPNs)  have  made  significant  advancements  by  integrating 
multiscale  features  in  a  top-down  manner.  The  path  aggregation 
network  (PANet)  (Liu  et  al.,  2016)  further  extends  the  FPN  by  intro-
ducing a bottom-up path. Another notable network learning mechanism, 
the bidirectional feature pyramid network (BiFPN) (Tan et al., 2020),

The convolutional layer, batch normalization (BN) layer, and SiLU 
activation function are combined to form the CBS block. The SPPF (Li 
et  al.,  2021)  block  operates  three  maximum  pooling  layers,  and  then 
each branch is aggregated to the concat layer. It is capable of combining 
information  from  several  scales.  The  CRFPN  is  utilized  in  the  neck 
portion to combine the extractive features and convey information to the 
head  portion.  Finally,  the  head  predicts  and  presents  the  bounding 
boxes, classes, and concordance scores. 

3.1. The backbone of YWnet

assigns different weights to each prefusion layer to facilitate adaptive 
feature  fusion.  In  Fig.  6,  we  present  a  novel  feature  fusion  network 
named  the  CRFPN,  which  combines  the  attention  mechanism  with 
feature  fusion.  After  extracting  features  using  the  backbone  network, 
three  output  layers  are  obtained  through  multiple  upsampling  and 
downsampling operations. However, due to the depth of the network, 
some information may be lost, leading to potential negative impacts. To 
address these issues, we propose incorporating a feature layer derived 
from the backbone network, processed by the attention module, as the 
output  layer  for  feature  fusion.  This  approach  not  only  enhances  se-
mantic  information  by  aggregating  additional  characteristics  but  also 
mitigates  the  loss  of  original  information  caused  by  the  increasing 
network depth.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't any explicit mention or discussion about specific optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) within the provided context. These optimization techniques are typically employed during the training phase of deep learning models to minimize the cost function and update model parameters effectively. However, without more detailed information regarding the training procedure or hyperparameters used in this particular deep learning pipeline, it remains uncertain which optimization technique was implemented.
