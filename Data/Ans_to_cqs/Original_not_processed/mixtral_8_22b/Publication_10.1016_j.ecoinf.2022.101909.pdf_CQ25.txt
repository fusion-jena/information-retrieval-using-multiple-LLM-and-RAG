2.7. Convolutional neural network (CNN) and transfer learning-based 
model 

We implemented a convolutional neural network (CNN) (LeCun and 
Bengio, 1995) to perform the automatic task of detection and identifi-
cation of 18 classes. A CNN is a type of network inspired by the visual 
cortex that shows good performance in recognizing objects in images, 
and  its  use  has  been  extended  to  the  acoustic  domain  (Aloysius  and 
Geetha, 2017; Stowell, 2022). The architecture is organized according to 
a hierarchy of layers designed for feature extraction based on a digital 
image. The first layers can detect edges, then simple shapes, and deeper 
layers can learn more complex shapes with a high level of abstraction 
(Albawi et al., 2017; Krizhevsky et al., 2012; LeCun et al., 2015).

On  the  other  hand,  supervised  learning  techniques  based  on  deep 
artificial  neural  networks  (deep  learning)  are  suitable  for  identifying 
species through the automatic analysis of recordings that can come from 
a  whole  season  in  different  simultaneous  locations  (Borowiec  et  al., 
2021; Zhong et al., 2021). 

Knowing  the  potential  of  these  technologies  and  the  context  of 
climate emergency and biodiversity loss (Butt et al., 2021; Sueur et al., 
2019;  Tittensor  et  al.,  2019),  we  wonder  how  we  can  precisely  and 
exhaustively  monitor  the  diversity  and  acoustic  activity  of  birds.  In 
addition, we are interested in examining some abiotic oscillations and 
their relationship with the annual dynamics of the calls of bird species as 
an approach to the field of acoustic phenology.

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model used in this study is to automatically detect and identify 18 classes of bird species. This is achieved by implementing a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is a type of network inspired by the visual cortex and known for its good performance in object recognition within images. Its application has also been extended to the acoustic domain. The CNN works by organizing its architecture into a hierarchy of layers designed for feature extraction based on a digital image or audio signal. The initial layers can detect basic features such as edges, while deeper layers can learn more complex patterns with higher levels of abstraction.
