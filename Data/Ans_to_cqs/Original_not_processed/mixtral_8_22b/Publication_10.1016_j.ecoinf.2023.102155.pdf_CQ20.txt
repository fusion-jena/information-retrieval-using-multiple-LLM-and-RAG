Following  the  tools  we  previously  developed  in  Guilbault  et  al. 
(2021),  we  present  in  this  paper  extensions  that  accommodate  for 
necessary practical model accomodation: bias correction and lasso-type 
penalties. Observer bias correction allows for one to overcome prefer-
ential sampling that arise from opportunistic surveys. Lasso control for 
model complexity and multicollinearity which is particuarly useful with 
low sample size. First, we compare via simulations different measures of 
performance in classification and predicted distribution for the new al-
gorithms  based  on  mixture  modelling  (EM  algorithm)  and  machine 
learning (semi supervised learning) developed to the simple approach of 
fitting  individual  PPMs  to  the  points  with  known  species  labels  only, 
while also incorporating lasso penalization and bias correction. We test 
their performances in the context of low species abundance, the pres-

3.1.1. Relabelling performance measure 

Fig.  1  shows  the  performance  in  classification  as  measured  by 
meanRSS for Test 1 for the best-performing methods across the combi-
nations  of  lasso  penalty  and  bias  correction  use.  The  relative  perfor-
mances of the methods in relabelling are similar regardless of the use of 
a  lasso  penalty or  bias  correction  for  a  low  percentage  of  hidden  ob-
servations.  Indeed,  we  note  that  methods  like  LoopT  and  knn  are 
competitive with the individual method. However, we can emphasize 
that adding the lasso regularization results in better performances—i.e. 
lower meanRSS—especially at 80% of hidden observations for the badly 
performing  methods  (kmeans,  random,  CoinF,  LoopA  and  LoopE) 
(Fig. 1). Adding bias correction does not change the performance of the

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models mentioned in the text. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether GPUs, TPUs, or other types of hardware were utilized during the training process. Further details regarding the computational infrastructure would be required to accurately address this query.
