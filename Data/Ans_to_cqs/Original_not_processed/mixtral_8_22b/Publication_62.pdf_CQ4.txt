Results and discussion

included two convolutional layers and two pooling layers (Table 2; https://doi.org/10.6084/
m9.ﬁgshare.5501716). The code used to deﬁne and train these CNNs can be found in our
Mathematica notebooks (Suppl. materials 1, 3, 2, 4).

Question: %INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the provided pieces of context to answer the query in less than 400 words. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

%Query
Query: "What are the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Fliping, Roating, Scaling)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based solely on this context.
