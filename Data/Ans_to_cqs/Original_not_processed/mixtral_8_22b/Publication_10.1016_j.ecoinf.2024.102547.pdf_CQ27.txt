5. Conclusion 

In  this  study,  we  analyzed  a  multifrequency  acoustics  dataset  ac-
quired  from  scientific  echosounders  in  the  West  African  waters  using 
FDA,  both  with  and  without  the  incorporation  of  spatial  dimensions.

stochastic process mainly valued in a Hilbert space. Statistical methods 
for functional data have received a lot of attention from the scientific 
community  (Ramsay  and  Silverman,  2005;  Silverman  and  Ramsay, 
2002) over the last decade. Li et al. (2022) and Koner and Staicu (2023) 
reviewed recently some of the fundamental concepts of the FDA, their 
recent advances, and their impact on practical cases. FDA is an alter-
native to the use of diverse and heterogeneous datasets (Pauthenet et al., 
2017, 2019) of functional, shape or more complex structure. Here we 
studied the relationships between the SSL spatial structuration and the 
pelagic environment to take advantage of all the information available 
in the data. Previous work by Diogoul et al. (2020), among others, has 
been  done  on  aggregated  features  from  the  original  data.  Classical
