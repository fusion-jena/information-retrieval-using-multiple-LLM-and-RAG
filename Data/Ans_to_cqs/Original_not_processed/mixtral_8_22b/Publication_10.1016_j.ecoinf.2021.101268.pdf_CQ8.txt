Deep Learning (DL) methods are at the top of the state-of-the-art on 
feature representation for different domains; albeit, DL lacks interpret-
ability. According to Doshi-Velez and Kim (2017), interpretability lets 
human specialists understand what a model is learning, making them 
flexible  real-world  solutions.  Given  such  topics,  this  paper  has  three 
significant contributions:  

1.  The  paper  introduces  the  first  Peruvian  Amazon  Forestry  Dataset, 
including  its  detailed  metadata  and  the  acquisition  protocol 
description. The dataset collects 59,441 samples from ten of the most 
profitable  and  endangered species (Finer  et al., 2014; Pinedo-Vas-
quez et al., 1992). Further-more, we employ six different commercial 
cameras  to  ensure  variability  and  to  develop  any  flexible  solution 
with real-world conditions in the future.

Too  et  al.  (2019)  fine-tune  CNN-based  models  (VGG,  ResNet, 
Inception,  and  DenseNet)  for  plant  species  classification  and  disease 
detection. Qian et al. (2020) monitor invasive plant species in the wild 
by  fine-tuned  models  (Alexnet,  VGG,  and  GoogLeNet).  Chulif  et  al. 
(2019) classify 10,000 plant species by using pre-trained InceptionNet 
models. Kaya et al. (2019) analyze deeply the effect of four different TL 
models on four publicly leaf datasets. (Barr´e et al., 2017) visualize that 
the  first  convolution  layers  learn  to  extract  leaf  venations  and  edges, 
while deeper layers derive high-level feature abstractions.

%Query
Query: "Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not explicitly mention where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer based solely on the given context. It would be best to refer to the original source or contact the authors directly for more specific details about the location of the code repository.
