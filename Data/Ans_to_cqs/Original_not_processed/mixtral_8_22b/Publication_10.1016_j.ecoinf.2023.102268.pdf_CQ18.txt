similarities. It is widely used to visualize high-dimensional data (van der 
Maaten  and Hinton, 2008). Here the  method has been applied to the 
fc1000 activation vectors returned by ResNet-50. 

4.2. Classifier model 

The labeled dataset was split 70/30 into training and testing data-
sets.  For  model  selection  and  parameter  optimization  50%  of  the 
training data were held-out for validation (see Supporting Information). 
The final classification model, a SVM with a cubic polynomial kernel, 
was trained using the ResNet-50 fc1000 activations of the full training 
dataset. A 10-fold cross-validation was then used to define the score-to- 
posterior-probability transformation function (Platt, 2000), which pro-
vides a basis for estimating the posterior probability for new observa-
tions. Fig. 9 shows a confusion matrix for the test data not seen during 
training.

when weights are used, the range of the kernels receiving full weight 
should be set larger than the confidence interval of the prediction.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves holding out 50% of the training data for validation purposes. This means that while the model is being trained on one portion of the data, its performance is continuously evaluated against another portion of the data that it hasn't seen before. This process helps ensure that the model doesn't overfit to the training data and can generalize well to unseen data. Additionally, a 10-fold cross-validation was used to define the score-to-posterior-probability transformation function, providing a way to estimate the posterior probability for new observations.
