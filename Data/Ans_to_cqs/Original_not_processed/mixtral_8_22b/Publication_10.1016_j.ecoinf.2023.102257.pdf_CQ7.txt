2.1. Objective 1: perform tagging efficiency experiment

Maine, USA (January–September 2022) using three tagging methods (one with ML bounding box assistance and 
two  without  assistance).  We  used  a  generalized  linear  mixed  model  to  examine  the  influence  of  ML  model 
performance  and  tagging  method  on  tagging  efficiency.  We  found  that  ML  bounding  boxes  offer  significant 
improvement in tagging efficiency when labelling data compared to unassisted tagging. Additionally, the time 
taken to label with bounding boxes was not statistically different from an unassisted tagging approach. However, 
we  found  that  gains  in  efficiency  are  contingent  on  the  ML  algorithm’s  performance  and  that  incorrect  ML 
predictions, particularly the 4.2% false positive and 3.6% false negative predictions, can slow the tagging process 
compared to a non-hybrid approach. These findings indicate that although practitioners usually forgo the pro-

duction of bounding boxes when selecting a data labelling process due to the increased effort, ML bounding box- 
assisted tagging can offer an efficient method for labeling. More broadly, ML-assisted data labelling offers an 
opportunity to accelerate the analysis of trail camera imagery, but an assessment of the ML model’s performance 
can illuminate whether the hybrid-tagging approach is ultimately a help or hinderance.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training such as train, test, and validation sets. However, typically, the dataset is divided into these subsets based on certain criteria. The most common practice is to randomly divide the dataset into three parts: training set (used to train the model), validation set (used to fine-tune the model during training), and testing set (used to evaluate the final trained model). The division ratio may vary depending on the size of the dataset, but it is often around 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. Other criteria for splitting datasets include stratified sampling (to maintain class distribution) and temporal splitting (for time series data).
