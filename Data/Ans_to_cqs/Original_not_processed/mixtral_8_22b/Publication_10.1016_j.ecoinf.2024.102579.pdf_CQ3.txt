In Eq. (7), n is the number of trees included in the sample at a given 
sample point, i.e. the number of sample trees. In the remainder of this 
paper, we referred to Eq. (7) as the inventory estimator.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not contain information about data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate response to the query using only the given context.
