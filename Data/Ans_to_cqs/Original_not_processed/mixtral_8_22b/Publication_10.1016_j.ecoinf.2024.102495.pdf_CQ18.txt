The  findings  indicate  that  Model  9  exhibits  the  highest  average 
performance,  with  an  89.30%  accuracy  rate,  87.22%  precision  rate, 
84.62% recall rate, and 0.8587 F1-Score. The obtained result surpasses 
that of the other models, indicating that Model 9, which incorporates 
dropout,  Adam’s  optimizer,  and  a  0.001  learning  rate,  is  the  most 
optimal deep-learning model. The ovitrap test employed Model 9, which 
had the highest running fold and demonstrated the most optimal per-
formance value. Figs. 14 and 15 indicate Model 9’s performance at each 
iteration of the training process.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To monitor the model performance during training, the study employs a technique called cross-validation or k-fold validation. This method involves dividing the dataset into 'k' subsets or folds, where one subset is used for testing while the remaining 'k - 1' subsets are used for training. This process is repeated 'k' times, ensuring that every subset serves as the test set once. By doing so, the researchers can evaluate the model's performance across different data splits, providing a more robust assessment of its generalization capabilities. Furthermore, the authors use various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC score to measure the model's performance. These metrics help quantify the effectiveness of the proposed deep learning approach in classifying mosquito species based on their wingbeat frequencies accurately.
