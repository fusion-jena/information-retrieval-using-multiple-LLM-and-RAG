In  order  to  train  the  model,  it  is important to provide not only 
the  class  of  the  object  but  also  the  bounding  box  data  of  the 
object  as  correct  answer.  In  this  context,  we  parsed  the  x,  y 
coordinates, width and height of the fish in the annotation of the 
image’s  dataset.  In  addition,  we  used  data  augmentation  to 
extend the amount of data. 

The  model  has  better  performance  as  number  of  epochs 
increases.  However,  when  number  of  epochs  exceeds  200,  the 
network  seems  to  be  overfitted  to  training  data.  As  a  result, 
Table  I  shows  the  hyper-parameters  used  to  train  and  validate 
the Yolo model.

This permits to induce better semantic information from the up-
sampled features and finer-grained information from the earlier 
feature map.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't explicit mention of specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, some clues can be derived from the references mentioned. For instance, Li et al. (2019) discuss deep learning for hyperspectral image classification, which suggests that they might have used hyperspectral imagery as their source of raw data. Similarly, Lumauag and Nava (2019) focus on fish tracking and counting using IEEE conference papers, indicating that video or image data could be their primary sources of raw data. Furthermore, Figure 2 displays various fish samples under different environmental circumstances, implying that images were collected as part of the raw data.

While these examples do not directly address the collection methods, one can infer that common techniques such as cameras, sensors, or publicly available datasets may have been employed. Cameras and sensors are often used to gather visual or environmental data, while public datasets offer pre-existing collections of relevant data. Nonetheless, without more specific details regarding the data collection process, it remains uncertain what exact methods were utilized in this case.
