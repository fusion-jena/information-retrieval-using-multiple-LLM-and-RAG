For the hyperparameter optimization task, we employ two predom-
inant models— RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV—provided by 
the  scikit-learn  library  to  meticulously  refine  the  RF  algorithm’s  per-
formance.  The  tuning  methodology  encompasses  an  initial  broad 
exploration of the hyperparameter space using RandomizedSearchCV, 
followed by a focused and exhaustive search using GridSearchCV to fine- 
tune the model. RandomizedSearchCV performs a probabilistic search 
over  the  predefined  hyperparameter  space,  offering  a  computational 
advantage  by  evaluating  a  user-specified  subset  of  hyperparameter 
combinations.  This  method  aids  in  efficiently  navigating  vast  hyper-
parameter  spaces  and  is  particularly  advantageous  when  there  is  un-
certainty  regarding  the  optimal  values.  It  generates  a  sample  of  the 
parameter settings based on specified distributions, allowing the incor-

poration of prior knowledge, which  is crucial when exploring contin-
uous parameters. Following the random search, we utilize GridSearchCV 
to  conduct  an  exhaustive  search  in  the  vicinity  of  the  best  hyper-
parameters discovered by RandomizedSearchCV. GridSearchCV evalu-
ates  every  possible  combination  within  a  predefined  grid  of 
hyperparameter  values,  guaranteeing  that  the  optimal  parameter

combination within the grid is identified and ensuring search precision. 
This  deterministic  approach  is  invaluable  when  the  hyperparameter 
space is relatively more constrained and well-defined, and exhaustive 
exploration is computationally feasible. The rationale behind applying 
this hierarchical approach is to amalgamate the benefits of both methods 
to  achieve  an  optimal  balance  between  computational  efficiency  and 
search precision (Table 2). The model exhibits exemplary performance 
by utilizing a dataset composed of 235 predictors and 5000 data points 
randomly split into 3000 for training and 2000 for validation (a 60/40 
ratio).  Precisely,  it  attains  a  flawless  training  accuracy  of  1.0.  Mean-
while, the model demonstrates a commendable accuracy of 0.924 on the 
validation dataset. Furthermore, upon optimizing the hyperparameters 
of the RF model, we meticulously evaluated the model’s performance

robustness  and  adaptability.  This  model  undergoes  extensive  hyper-
parameter tuning to optimize performance, culminating in a framework 
capable  of  achieving  high  overall  accuracy.  Furthermore,  our

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the authors employed two prominent models from the scikit-learn library - RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV - for hyperparameter optimization of the RF (Random Forest) algorithm. These techniques help explore and fine-tune the hyperparameter space to improve the performance of the RF algorithm. While the exact hyperparameters are not mentioned, they could include parameters such as the number of trees, maximum depth of trees, minimum samples required to split nodes, etc. Unfortunately, without explicit information, one cannot definitively state the specific hyperparameters used in this case.
