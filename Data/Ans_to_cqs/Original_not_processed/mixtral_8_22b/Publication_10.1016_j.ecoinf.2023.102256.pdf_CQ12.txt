The baseline model comprised a simple CNN architecture that had 
two  convolutional layers (8  filters of  size 16 × 16,  with ReLU activa-
tions), followed by max pooling (4 × 4), a flattening operation, and two 
fully-connected layers (32 ReLU and 22 softmax units respectively) (see 
Fig. 2). Given only a spectrogram input, the baseline model produced a 
probability for each of the 22 species.

Different methods were explored and tested to enhance the neural 
network with contextual information. One straightforward approach to 
incorporate additional information into a deep learning classifier, while 
maintaining  model  simplicity,  is  to  utilize  a  multi-branch  CNN.  As  a 
result, we investigate this approach as the initial method to integrate

Over  the  past  few  years,  deep  learning  has  revolutionized  several 
research  fields  such  as  bioinformatics  (Li  et  al.,  2020)  and  medicine 
(Piccialli et al., 2021) by enabling automated processing of large and 
complex  datasets.  Considered  a  branch  of  machine  learning,  deep 
learning refers to algorithms, commonly called deep neural networks, 
able  to  automatically  detect  very  complex  and  highly  discriminating 
patterns  in  data  (Chollet,  2018).  The  succession  of  processing  layers 
performing  linear  and  non-linear  transformations  allows  the  neural 
networks  to  learn  representations  of  data  with  multiple  levels  of 
abstraction  (LeCun  et  al.,  2015).  This  ability  makes  deep  learning 
particularly  relevant  for  solving  complex  problems  such  as  speech 
recognition, object detection, computer vision, and many other domains 
(Taigman et al., 2014; Hinton et al., 2012). Naturally, these practices

the network is trained on a relatively small number of examples, which 
is often the case in ecology datasets. We conducted preliminary exper-
iments  on  enhancing  deep  learning  with  metadata  using  the  Hainan 
gibbon case study and the network developed by Dufourq et al. (2021). 
Our findings revealed that this architecture, applied to the bird classi-
fication  task,  resulted  in  good  results  and  thus  we  adopted  this 
straightforward approach. The proposed methodology can be adapted to 
other CNN architectures.

Helpful Answer:
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used in the pipeline. The baseline model comprises a simple CNN architecture consisting of two convolutional layers with eight filters of size 16x16, followed by max pooling, a flattening operation, and two fully connected layers. The model takes a spectrogram input and produces a probability for each of the 22 species. Additionally, a multi-branch CNN was investigated as an approach to incorporate additional information into the deep learning classifier while maintaining model simplicity.
