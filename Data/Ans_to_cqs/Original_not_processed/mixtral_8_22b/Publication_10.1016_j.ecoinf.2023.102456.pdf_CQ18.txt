accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrices, among others, to compre-
hensively assess the performance and effectiveness of our model. 

Specifically,  the  use  of  confusion  matrices  will  provide  us  with 
detailed information regarding both correct and incorrect classifications 
made  by  our  model.  This  valuable  insight  will  enable  us  to  identify 
potential  deficiencies  in  classifying  specific  classes  or  categories.  In 
conclusion,  we  will  present  the  evaluation  results  through  the  use  of 
figures  and  numerical  data.  Graphical  visualizations  will  effectively 
portray the performance estimation achievement.

We  consider  the  false  positive  (FP)  and  false  negative  (FN)  per-
centage to measure how good the model fit is. These metrics allow us to 
know the percentage of hits that our model achieves for each class. In 
addition, we have observed that the metrics such as balanced accuracy 
(B.  Acc),  F-measure  Fβ,  Cohen’s  kappa  coefficient  k  and  Matthew’s 
correlation  coefficient  (MCC)  have  proven  to  be  adequate  in  similar 
contexts, although they have their own limitations (Chicco et al., 2021; 
Chicco  and  Jurman,  2020;  Lee  et  al.,  2021).  For  this  reason,  Table  1 
presents the results of these metrics in relation to the parameters of our 
model and the final results obtained in our real fire. Using these alter-
native measures gives us a more complete and accurate picture of the 
performance of our model, which is essential to properly evaluate. 

We use the following partitions, which determine the importance of ρ

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not explicitly state the strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions several methods used to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of the model after its development. These include accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrices, false positive and false negative percentages, balanced accuracy, F-measure, Cohen’s kappa coefficient, and Matthew’s correlation coefficient. These metrics are used to provide detailed information about the model's correct and incorrect classifications, enabling potential deficiencies in classifying specific classes or categories to be identified. Therefore, while the monitoring strategy during training isn't specified, it can be inferred that these same metrics may have been employed to track progress and adjust the model accordingly.
