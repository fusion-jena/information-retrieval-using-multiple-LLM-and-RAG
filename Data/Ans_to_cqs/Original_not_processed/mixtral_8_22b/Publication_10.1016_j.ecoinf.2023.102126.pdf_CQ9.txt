Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

To evaluate the datasets using F-UJI, the datasets were divided into 
the  top  eight  repositories  based  on  the  number  of  datasets  deposited 
(Fig.  2).  The number  of  datasets deposited in  these  eight  repositories 
accounted  for  94.9%  of  the  total  number  of  datasets,  which  was 
considered sufficiently representative. Of these eight repositories, four 
were general repositories, i.e., Figshare (https://figshare.com/), Zenodo 
(https://zenodo.org/), Dryad (https://datadryad.org/stash), and CSIRO 
(https://data.csiro.au/),  and  four  were  thematic  repositories,  i.e.,  Ag 
Data Commons (https://data.nal.usda.gov/), KNB Data Repository (htt 
ps://knb.ecoinformatics.org/),  ZALF  Open  Research  Data  (https:// 
open-research-data.zalf.de/default.aspx),  and  Agricultural  and  Envi-
ronmental  Data Archive (AEDA) (http://www.environmentdata.org/). 
The content distributions of the top eight repositories by content type 
are presented in Table 3.

Another aspect is the type of content, according to the differentiation 
made  by  the  DCI  between  the  dataset,  data  study,  and  software.  In 
general, most records are classified as either data studies  or datasets, 
with  software  being  much  more  residual.  Although  the  top  eight  re-
positories  contained  few  records  that  were  not  datasets,  the  case  of 
Figshare was different. In this repository, which was also the most used, 
90.52% of the records were of the data study type. Subsequently, when 
analysing the DOI of each repository through F-UJI, we found that the 
vast majority of the data study records belonged to papers published in 
this journal  (PLOS One, 2019). In the  subsequent F-UJI  analysis, Fig-
share obtained very low scores when PLOS ONE DOI was isolated from 
the remainder. This phenomenon illustrates the need to understand the 
differences between the different typologies of materials that can exist in

improvement. Finally, the datasets published in the Zenodo and Dryad 
repositories had the best results in terms of the FAIR principles, with Ag 
Data  Commons  (an  institutional  repository  in  the  agricultural  area) 
being rated third-best.

%Query
Query: "Where is the data repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
According to the given information, there are several data repositories mentioned such as Figshare, Zenodo, Dryad, CSIRO, Ag Data Commons, KNB Data Repository, ZALF Open Research Data, and Agricultural and Environmental Data Archive (AEDA). However, it does not provide specific details about a deep learning pipeline being available in any of these repositories. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
