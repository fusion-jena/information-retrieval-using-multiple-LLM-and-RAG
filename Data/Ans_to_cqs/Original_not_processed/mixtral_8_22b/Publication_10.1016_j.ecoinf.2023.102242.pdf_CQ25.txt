4.3. Data processing

4.4. Classification method

The  processing  of  high-resolution  remote  sensing  data,  which  en-
compasses  a  plethora  of  feature  information  (Girshick  et  al.,  2014), 
demands  significant  time  and  costs.  This  presents  considerable  chal-
lenges for many researchers (Modzelewska et al., 2020). Prior to clas-
sification, samples require training. The representativeness and quantity 
of  these  training  samples  significantly  influence  the  accuracy  of  the 
classification  models.  Platinum  (Ting,  2016)  demonstrated  that  when 
the training samples are not sufficiently typical, other categories can be 
easily misclassified into the sampleâ€™s category. If the number of training 
samples is insufficient, network training may not meet the requirements. 
Conversely, an excessive number of training samples can lead to data 
redundancy, reducing the efficiency of model training (Shi, 2018). To 
address  this  issue,  this  study  employed  feature  optimization  tools  to

methods  in  enhancing  classification  accuracy,  existing  research  in 
related  fields  still  presents  certain  limitations.  For  instance,  Bai  (Bai, 
2020)  encountered  challenges  during  the  segmentation  process. 
Although the use of ESP evaluation tools could effectively evaluate the 
target  and  reduce  the  number  of  repeated  experiments,  the  optimal 
segmentation scale obtained might involve multiple sets of segmenta-
tion parameters. This problem was also encountered during this study. 
After numerous comparisons and visual interpretations through multi-
ple  experiments,  the  optimal  segmentation  parameters  were  finally 
determined, as depicted in Figs. 7 and 9. The identification of optimal 
segmentation parameters necessitates a continuous process of compar-
ison  and  evaluation.  As  suggested  by  Jurandy  et  al.  (Almeida  et  al., 
2014), the accuracy of segmentation should be accurately evaluated to

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the purpose of the deep learning model used in this study is for classification. The text mentions that prior to classification, samples require training, and the representativeness and quantity of these training samples significantly influence the accuracy of the classification models. Additionally, the study employs feature optimization tools to enhance classification accuracy. However, there is no explicit mention of using the deep learning model for segmentation or detection purposes within the provided context.
