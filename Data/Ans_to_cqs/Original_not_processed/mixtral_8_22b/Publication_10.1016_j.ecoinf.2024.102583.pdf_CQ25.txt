loss function, effectively preventing overfitting and promoting simpler 
models,  utilization  of  a  more  advanced  optimization  approach  that 
combines  first-order  gradients  (loss  function  gradient)  with  second- 
order  gradients  (loss  function  curvature)  which  makes  it  faster  than 
some other models, ability to handle missing data during tree building 
by  employing  weighted  quantile  sketch,  built-in  cross-validation  sup-
port  that  aids  the  model  evaluation  and  hyperparameter  tuning,  and 
imbalanced  data  handling.  Thanks  to  its  exceptional  efficiency  and 
performance and its availability in various programming languages like 
Python, R, and Java, XGBoost has found widespread adoption in land-
slide risk assessment (Akinci et al., 2021; Badola et al., 2023; Can et al., 
2021; Hussain et al., 2022b).

Pourghasemi, 2021), and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) models (F. 
Huang et al., 2022; Y. Huang and Zhao, 2018; Shahzad et al., 2022; Xing 
et al., 2021). These models are flexible and adaptable systems that can 
manage diverse types of data and scenarios for LSM. Another type of 
MLM that has been explored for LSM is the Artificial Neural Network 
(ANN), especially in the Radial Basis Function (RBF) (W. Chen et al., 
2018; Ngo et al., 2021) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) configuration 
(Adnan  et  al.,  2020;  Chang  et  al.,  2022;  Z.  Zhao  et  al.,  2022).  These 
models can learn from data and adjust their parameters to improve their 
performance.

2.2.5. Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) 

XGBoost  is  a  popular  tree-based  ensemble  learning  technique, 
belonging  to  the  family  of  Gradient  Boosting  Machines  (GBM).  It  is 
designed  to  handle  diverse  machine-learning  tasks  like  classification, 
regression, ranking, and custom objectives. Sequentially, XGBoost cre-
ates  an  ensemble  of  weak  learners,  usually  decision  trees.  Each  new 
learner  focuses  on  correcting  the  mistakes  made  by  its  predecessors. 
XGBoost is enhanced with its innovative optimization and regularization 
techniques,  which  improve  accuracy  and  reduce  overfitting  risks  (T. 
Chen  and  Guestrin,  2016).  Key  attributes  of  XGBoost  include  the 
application of regularization (it applies L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge)) in the

pending data availability, we will investigate the scalability and trans-
ferability  of  the  ensemble  techniques  and  compare  their  performance 
with  deep  learning  models  such  as  Convolutional  Neural  Networks 
(CNN) and Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN). This 
broader  investigation  would  provide  a  more  robust  understanding  of 
landslide vulnerability across the entire and offer valuable insights into 
the effectiveness of advanced ML approaches in LSM.

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the deep learning models mentioned, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN), could potentially be used for various purposes including image classification, object detection, or semantic segmentation. The specific purpose of these models would depend on the task they are being applied to, which in this case appears to be related to landslide susceptibility mapping. Without further context, it cannot be definitively determined what the exact purpose of the deep learning models is.
