The  performances  of  ResNet50  and  EfficientNetB3  with  transfer 
learning are very similar; however, at the species level (3), ResNet50 has 
a  higher  standard  deviation  (0.32%).  State-of-the-art  models  trained 
with transfer learning and without MTL have an F1-score of 96%, similar 
to models trained with MTL at the species level. The models trained with 
ResNet  and  EfficientNet  have  the  absolute  best  performance  and 
outperform the benchmark YOLOv5 model on the TL dataset referenced 
in (Bjerge et al., 2023a). This is expected since the tasks performed by 
YOLOv5 include both object detection as well as classification. No other 
state-of-the-art CNN models were evaluated since it is not expected to 
achieve scores higher than 96% to 99% already achieved and the main 
purpose  was  to  demonstrate  that  different  CNNs  can  be  modified  for

Here  Wl1  and  Wl2  represent  the  weights,  and  bl1, bl2  represent  the 
biases for the independent FC layer representation. We apply dropout 
regularization  in  the  forward  pass  during  training  so  that  random
