Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The article does not provide explicit information on the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it mentions that a diverse dataset was used for training and validation purposes. The dataset consisted of samples from various wetland types with different levels of human impact, ensuring representation across different land use classes in the study area. This approach likely contributed to improving the model's ability to generalize well to unseen data. Additionally, the authors may have employed techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting during the development process, but these are not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
