Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

For thumbnail information, we classified the thumbnail character-
istics into six categories, including people, birds, objects, scenery, text, 
and food. Objects that we identified in the videos were either a camera 
or  binoculars.  Each  thumbnail  category  was  recorded  as  a  separate 
column (i.e., basically, with a value of 0 or 1 in a separate column of 
each category). 

2.3. Data analysis 

The  following  data  analyses  were  performed  using  R  software 
version 4.1.2 (R Core Team, 2021) with Boruta, lmerTest, car, MuMIn, 
and randomForest packages.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it is not explicitly mentioned what specific data annotation techniques were used in their deep learning pipeline. However, they did mention classifying thumbnail characteristics into six categories and recording each category as a separate column with a value of 0 or 1. This suggests that they might be using binary classification or multi-label classification methods. They also mentioned identifying objects such as cameras or binoculars in the videos, which could imply the use of object detection techniques like bounding boxes or semantic segmentation. But without more detailed information about their deep learning pipeline, it cannot be confirmed which exact data annotation techniques were employed.
