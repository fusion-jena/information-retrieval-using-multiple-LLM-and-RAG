gin-based active learning. After the first 30,000 active queries, the 

classifier  achieves  93.2%  overall  accuracy  which  further  confirms 

the usefulness of the suggested pipeline. More detailed results are 

available in Table S3.

Different strategies can be employed to select samples to be labelled 

by the oracle. The most naive strategy is selecting queries at random. 

Here  we  try  five  different  query  selection  strategies  and  compare

we try model uncertainty criteria (confidence, margin, entropy; Lewis
