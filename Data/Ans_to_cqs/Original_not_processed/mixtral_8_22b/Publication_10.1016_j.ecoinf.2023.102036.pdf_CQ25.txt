the growing computing capability of machines and availability of big 
data, making it possible to extract high levels of representation of image 
content  (Hassaballah  and  Hosny,  2019).  This  field  falls  into  artificial 
intelligence  and,  in  particular,  deep  learning,  which  has  recently 
received  large  attention  from  ecologists  (Christin  et  al.,  2019).  Deep 
learning  is  a  sub-field  of  artificial  intelligence  which  focuses  on  a 
learning method based on logical structures that closely resemble the 
architectural  characteristics  of  the  brain  (the  so-called  deep  artificial 
neural networks). It consists of processing units within the global system 
that  specialize  in  detecting certain  hidden  characteristics  in the  data.

Helpful Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the given context is not explicitly stated. However, considering the context, it can be inferred that the deep learning model might be used for image classification tasks. This assumption is based on the mention of 'a small number of classes to be identified', which suggests that the model could be classifying images into different categories or classes. Additionally, the text mentions 'K labelled images in each category', further supporting the idea of using the deep learning model for image classification purposes. Nevertheless, without explicit information about the specific task the model is designed for, this remains an educated guess.
