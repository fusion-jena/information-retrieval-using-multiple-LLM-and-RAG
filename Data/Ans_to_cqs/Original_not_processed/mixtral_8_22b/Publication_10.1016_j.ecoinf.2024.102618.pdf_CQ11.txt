diseases. We also propose using different ensembles to increase classi-
fication accuracy. To this end, five different deep-learning models are 
proposed to classify plant diseases. The chosen models are:  

Precision = TP

TP + FP

• DenseNet201 

• Recall 

(2)    

DenseNet is a network proposed by (Huang et al., 2017). In this 
network,  each  Layer  has  a  connection  with  subsequent  Layers. 
Densenet201 is a CNN that has 201 deep layers.

Another  approach  based  on  deep  learning  that  was  applied  to 
recognize leaf diseases is proposed in (Ghazi et al., 2017). In this work, 
the authors tested their methodology on the LifeCLEF 2015 dataset. The 
dataset contains 91,758 labeled images of different plant organs (e.g. 
flowers,  fruits).  It  utilizes  three  different  models,  namely,  AlexNet, 
GoogLeNet, and VGGNet. However, the proposed work achieves small 
accuracies on the proposed dataset. As the best-achieved accuracy was 
78.44% using VGGnet. The results also show the superior performance 
of AlexNet when trained from scratch due to its simpler architecture.
