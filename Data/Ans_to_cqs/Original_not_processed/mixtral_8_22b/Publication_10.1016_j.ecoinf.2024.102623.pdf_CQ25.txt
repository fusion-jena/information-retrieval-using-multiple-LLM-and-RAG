vancements in deep learning to enhance performance. Specifically, our 
MLP architecture consists of four layers, each containing 512 neurons 
and connected with residual connections (He et al., 2016). We employ 
batch normalization (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015) and the Rectified Linear 
Unit (ReLU) activation function in all layers except the final one, where 
instead a sigmoid function is used to enable multi-label classification. 
The model is trained with a batch size of 256 for 30 epochs using the 
AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017). Both the weight decay 
and learning rate are set to 0.0001. Additionally, we employ a learning 
rate scheduler with exponential decay of 0.95, and introduce dropout

Appendix B. Comparison with other ML losses 

In this section, we discuss and compare the full weighted loss to other losses commonly used by the machine learning community to address similar 

setups. 

Cross-entropy loss. Previous studies applying deep learning approaches to SDMs have frequently employed the categorical cross-entropy (CE) loss 
function (Deneu et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2022). However, conceptually, we argue that the CE loss may not be well-suited for the specific multi-species 
setup we are dealing with. This is because a single location can accommodate an arbitrary number of species, whereas the CE loss assumes the presence

%Query
Query: "What is the purpose of the deep learning model (e.g., classification, segmentation, detection)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model described in the given context is for multi-label classification. This is indicated by the use of a sigmoid function in the final layer of the MLP architecture, which enables multi-label classification. Multi-label classification allows for multiple labels or classes to be assigned to a single input, making it suitable for tasks such as predicting the presence of multiple species in a given location.
