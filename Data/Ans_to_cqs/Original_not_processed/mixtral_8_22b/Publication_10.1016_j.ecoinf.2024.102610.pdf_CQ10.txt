4. Discussion 

The  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  evaluate  how  well  a 
classical random forest machine learning model together with satellite- 
based environmental estimates can predict relative tsetse abundance in 
all of Kenya using a spatially limited set of tsetse trapping data. Based on 
our results, in this section we also pinpoint areas of improvement and 
opportunities to enhance the precision and reliability of predictions of 
tsetse fly relative densities within Kenya.

%Query
Query: "What is the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no information about the code repository link of any deep learning pipeline. The context only provides references to academic papers and software packages used for machine learning and deep learning approaches, such as 'caret', 'VSURF', and 'pdp'. However, it does not provide any specific links to a deep learning pipeline or its corresponding code repository. Therefore, without additional context, it is impossible to determine the requested code repository link.
