space  of  the  decision  boundary  that  separates  the  two  classes  (Yang 
et al., 2018). SVM also has the advantage of being able to work in n- 
dimensional  space,  which  makes  it  superior  to  other  algorithms. 
Furthermore, SVM does not influence the findings that were expected 
before  or  after  making  minor  changes  to  the  feature  extracted  data 
(Almansour  et  al.,  2019;  Gola  et  al.,  2019).  SVM  parameters  are  set 
based on the default values of GEE’s guideline (Radial Basis Function 
(RBF) was chosen as the kernel type, and the Gamma (γ) and cost pa-
rameters were set to 0.5 and 10, respectively). SVM is trained by training 
samples, and then the hybrid feature space (including the Sentinel-2 MS 
bands, Sentinel-2-derived VIs, water indices, bare soil indices, built-up 
indices, Sentinel-1  VV and VH bands, eight textural features, and the 
DSM) is fed to the classifier.

• Literature from ecological informatics: In the product mapping litera-
ture,  some  studies  have  focused  exclusively  on  ecological  infor-
matics. In this regard, Albayrak et al. (2021) used Random Forest and 
Decision Tree algorithms, which are among the ensemble learning 
techniques, and estimated the behavior of migratory bees. Using the 
results of the modeling study, practical information has been given to 
the migratory beekeepers with thematic maps for the whole country. 
In a similar study, Ayadi et al. (2022) performed a comprehensive 
survey of resolution methods for constraint networks using static and 
dynamic  algorithms  and  showed  that  ecological  informatics  is  the 
most appropriate constraint satisfaction problem resolution method 
for  a  given  context.  In  another  study,  by  applying  remote  sensing 
proxies  and  the  breakpoint  approach,  Royimani  et  al.  (2022)  esti-
mated  information  on  the  onset  of  grass  aging  to  understand  the

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) that are commonly used in the deep learning pipeline. However, there are references to Support Vector Machines (SVM) and their parameter optimization. The literature mentions that SVM parameters are set based on the default values of Google Earth Engine's guidelines, specifically choosing Radial Basis Function (RBF) as the kernel type and setting the Gamma (γ) and cost parameters to 0.5 and 10, respectively. Additionally, the context discusses the use of Random Forest and Decision Tree algorithms, which are part of ensemble learning techniques but do not directly relate to optimization techniques in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot provide a direct answer regarding the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
