Mean F1 scores obtained per dataset split, with standard deviations. The very 
high scores obtained by the model on the training and validation data were also 
reproduced on the test data. Details regarding the scores for individual ortho-
mosaics can be found in Table S2.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The table presented in the given context shows the mean F1 scores obtained per dataset split, including training, validation, and test datasets. Additionally, there are three different types of test datasets mentioned: test-over\_time, test-over\_location, and test-over\_source. However, the specific criteria used to split the data into these categories are not explicitly stated in the provided information. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer based solely on the given context.
