training, we set the learning decay rate to 0.7 so that the
learning rate gradually decays as the training progresses.
Table 1 shows the experimental results in which we ﬁxed
the voxel size and batch size and adjusted the regulariza-
tion strength, from which we can be told that result is better
while regularization strength is 0.2.

2. Model training: We process data with a deep neural
network and adjust the training epoch, batch size, and
volume size to output a classiﬁer for prediction.
3. Result output: The point cloud test set is segmented,
and we can obtain the ﬁnal segmentation results. The
output ﬁles include point cloud geometric partition
graphs, SPGs, and segmentation results.

overall accuracy (OA) as metrics. We adjusted three
parameters (voxel size is the voxelization subsampling
size, the regularization strength inﬂuences the coarseness
of the minimal partition, and batch size means the batch
number of point cloud samples in training). We used the
hold-out method to distinguish the test set and the training
set at a ratio of 3:7 for preprocessing the original data. We
further adjust the parameters of networks to explore the

inﬂuence of parameters on experimental results, and we
discuss the selection of the frame parameters.

Selection of the Frame Parameters

We investigated the effects of several parameters in our
framework, such as the regularization strength, voxel size
for the minimal partition, and training batch size. In

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The paper does not explicitly mention any specific criteria for determining when training is complete. However, it discusses various parameters that were adjusted during model training, including the number of training epochs, batch size, volume size, and regularization strength. These parameters could potentially influence the decision regarding when to stop training. For instance, one might decide to stop training after reaching a certain number of epochs or once the performance on a validation dataset stops improving. Nevertheless, without explicit information about stopping criteria, it cannot be definitively stated how the authors determined when training was complete.
