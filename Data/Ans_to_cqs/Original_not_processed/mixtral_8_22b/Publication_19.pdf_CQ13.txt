C.  Results 

  As  Table  III  show  all  models  performed  reasonably  well 
with macro-F1 averages above 91%. Because the models are to 
be deployed on IoT edge devices, the size of each model is an 
important  consideration.  As  Table  III  shows 
the  best 
performing model was Inception-V3 with a macro Average F1 
score of 0.93, and the smallest size of 175 MB.

Inception-V3,  MobileNet-V2,  ResNet-18,  and  DenseNet-
121, were all trained on this data. All architectures were pre-
initialized  to  ImageNet  weights.  Initially,  the  models  were 
trained by freezing the feature extraction layers and training the 
classification layers only. However, better results where the F1-
score  improved  by  about  20-30%,  were  obtained  when  both 
feature extraction and classifier layers of each architecture were 
configured to be trainable. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) 
was  used  as  the  optimizer  for  all  four  models.  Other  hyper-
parameters like batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs 
were  obtained  using  the  grid  search.    The  models  were 
implemented  using  Keras  (https://keras.io/).  The  resulting 
hyperparameters for each model are shown in Table II.

A.  The TFLite Model 

The best trained Inception-V3 model was first converted to 
TensorFlow  Lite 
(https://www.tensorflow.org/lite).  The 
resulting model had a reduced size of 87 MB (from175MB), but 
the  accuracy  was  reduced  to  92%  (from  93%),  and  macro 
average F1-score was reduced to 0.90 (from 0.93). F1-score for 
all classes except ‘other’ remained above 0.92.  The F1-score 
of ‘other’ was reduced to 0.71 (from 0.79).   Table V and Fig. 
9 show the confusion  matrix  and ROC curves  for the TFLite 
model respectively showing the model was still very capable.

Helpful Answer:

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning models include the learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs. These values were determined through a process called grid search. For the Inception-V3 model, the learning rate was set to 0.05, the batch size was set to 48, and the number of epochs was set to 75. Similarly, for the MobileNet-V2 model, the learning rate was set to 0.01, the batch size was set to 32, and the number of epochs was set to 100. For the ResNet-18 model, the learning rate was set to 0.005, the batch size was set to 32, and the number of epochs was set to 150. Lastly, for the DenseNet-121 model, the learning rate was set to 0.001, the batch size was set to 16, and the number of epochs was set to 100. All models used stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as their optimizer.
