5.2. Results

Fig. 4 shows a sample of detection and classiﬁcation results
using the developed recognition system based on Faster R-
CNN. High classiﬁcation accuracy was achieved for all tested
images of insect pests in the range of 97.0 to 99.0%. Moreover,
the developed UI of our mobile application is depicted in
Fig. 5, monitoring the identiﬁcation results; for example, in

case of the ﬂea beetles with a summary including the suggested
pesticides such as Neem oil and insecticidal soaps for guiding
farmers.

5.3. Comparative performance evaluation

The overall performance of developed system for insect pest
recognition has been evaluated using four basic classiﬁcation

metrics for image-based classiﬁers. It is estimated by summa-
tion of true positives (TP) and true negatives (TN) divided
by all possible outcomes of classiﬁcation process, as given in
(3). Second, precision is given in (4) to represent relationship
between the true positive predicted values and all positive pre-
dicted values. Third, the sensitivity or recall in (5) presents the
ratio between the true predictive positive values and the sum-
mation of both predicted true positive and predicted false val-
ues. Finally, the fourth evaluation metric is F1-score, which
demonstrates the overall accuracy measure of the developed
classiﬁer by combining the double ratio of both the precision
and recall metrics in (6).

metrics in (3–6); called accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-
score. Furthermore, Table 2 illustrates a comparison of the
resulted pest classiﬁcation performance with other methods
in previous studies, i.e. back propagation (BP) neural network
[44] and Single-Shot Detector (SSD) MobileNet [45,46]. These
results verify the outperformance of our proposed Faster R-
CNN for automatic identiﬁcation of crop pests. The BP neural
networks algorithm is relatively succeeded to classify aphids,
but it is completely failed to detect the red spider mites, as illus-
trated in Table 2. The SSD MobileNet showed a good perfor-
mance for identifying all
insect pests.
However, the proposed Faster R-CNN achieved the highest
value of average accuracy (98.0%) better than the accuracies
of BP neural network and SSD MobileNet of 50.0% and
86.0%, respectively.

4.4. Classiﬁcation performance analysis

To quantify the performance of the developed mobile applica-
tion for recognizing insect pests, cross validation estimator [43]
has been used for comparing between the true crop pest labels
of tested images and predicted classiﬁcation results of Faster
R-CNN model. That generates an error matrix or a confusion
matrix with four expected outcomes, namely True Positive
(TP), True Negative (TN), False Positive (FP), and False
Negative (FN), as illustrated in Table 1.

Consequently, we have calculated four well-known evalua-
tion metrics as follows. First, accuracy is one of the important

Helpful Answer:

The performance of the developed system for insect pest recognition is evaluated using four basic classification metrics for image-based classifiers. These include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Accuracy is calculated by summing true positives (TP) and true negatives (TN) divided by all possible outcomes of the classification process. Precision represents the relationship between the true positive predicted values and all positive predicted values. Recall, also known as sensitivity, presents the ratio between the true predictive positive values and the summation of both predicted true positive and predicted false values. Lastly, the F1-score demonstrates the overall accuracy measure of the developed classifier by combining the double ratio of both the precision and recall metrics.
