1.  Spectral segmentation and band selection

With regards to the difference between the results of the original, 
reduced,  and  augmented  datasets  applied  to  the  deep  learning 
model, we found that the original and augmented datasets are only 
under  a  few  specific  numbers  of  bands  and  data  formats  (e.g., 
VGG19 + 8band_256_8bit, VGG19 + 72band_256_8bit, ResNet50 +
8band_256_8bit, and ResNet50 + 36band_ 256_8bit). The classifica-
tion accuracy rate reached more than 50%, and there was no regu-
larity in the classification accuracy. However, the sampling action of 
reducing the data had a very obvious and consistent impact on the 
classification  accuracy,  especially  in  the  VGG19  model,  which  is 
more  similar  to  the  traditional  CNN  model.  This  representative 
sampling  action  resulted  in  incomplete  and  complete  feature 
extraction,  and  some  key  features  were  ignored.  Given  the  above 
reasons, it is recommended that sampling actions be avoided in the

built using the following steps:  

1.  Prepare  data:  Prepare  the  above  eight  categories  of  ground  truth 

images, and extract training samples.  

2.  Build  the  model:  Use  Keras  to  build  mathematical  functions  in 

TensorFlow.  

3.  Compilation: After the model built with mathematical functions, the 
shortest path is set in deep learning through code compilation.  
4.  Training:  The  fitting  action  (fit)  on  the  data  and  the  model  was 
performed  through  the  code,  and  deep  learning  parameters  were 
automatically adjusted according to the set number of epochs. In the 
process, the CPU and GPU were used to operate repeatedly as much 
as possible, and finally, the answer that conformed to the shortest 
path was found from each data.  

5.  Test: After Step (4), the feature weight and optimal solution in the 
model  were  obtained,  and  then  the  correct  rate  was  calculated 
through model evaluation.

as high-level semantics, which is essential for tasks such as image clas-
sification,  object  detection,  and  segmentation.  The  flexibility  of  deep 
learning  models,  particularly  convolutional  neural  networks  (CNNs), 
allows customization across diverse image tasks, from classification to 
style  transfer.  Deep  learning  has  consistently  delivered  unparalleled 
performance,  with  models  such  as  ResNet  and  Faster  R-CNN  setting 
benchmarks in their respective fields. The scalability of these models, 
contingent on available data and computational power, is particularly 
valuable for extensive image datasets. Transfer learning offers a critical 
advantage; models pre-trained on vast datasets, such as ImageNet, can 
be repurposed, enhancing their performance on tasks with limited data. 
Many current studies have proven the ability and effectiveness of CNN to 
distinguish specific tree species in forests using RGB images or hyper-

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, the exact optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned. However, it is common practice in deep learning to use optimization algorithms like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) during the training phase. These methods help minimize the loss function by adjusting the weights and biases of the model. Since the text mentions the use of TensorFlow and Keras, both of which support various optimization techniques including SGD and Adam, it can be assumed that one of these popular optimization techniques might have been employed in this case. Nevertheless, without explicit mention, it cannot be confirmed which specific optimization algorithm was utilized in this particular deep learning pipeline.
