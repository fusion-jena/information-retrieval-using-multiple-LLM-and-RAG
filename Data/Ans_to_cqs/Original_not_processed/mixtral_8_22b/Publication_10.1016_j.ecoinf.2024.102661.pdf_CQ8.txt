Hyperparameters  are  instrumental  in  shaping  the  architecture  of 
deep  learning  models and  steering  the  learning  process  (Bischl et  al., 
2023).  The  TPEBO  algorithm  stands  out  for  its  strategic  approach  to 
hyperparameter optimization. Beginning with an exploratory phase of 
random  searches  for  feasible  hyperparameter  configurations,  TPEBO 
progressively narrows down its focus to zones within the search space 
where a local optimum is identified, thereby approximating the global 
optimum  with  increasing  precision.  This  methodological  approach  is 
particularly  beneficial  for  fine-tuning  LSTM  models,  known  for  their 
intricate  structures.  By  automating  the  hyperparameter  adjustment 
process,  TPEBO  not  only  enhances  the  model's  efficiency  but  also 
significantly  curtails  the  time  traditionally  spent  on  manual  tuning, 
making the modeling workflow more efficient. The process is succinctly

Number of cells in hidden layers: Vital for fitting complex functions, 
the range for the number of cells in each layer is set between 10 and 200. 
This range balances the need to capture intricate data patterns and avoid

%Query
Query: "Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific location such as a link to a GitHub or GitLab repository. However, it would be reasonable to assume that the authors might have made their code publicly accessible alongside their published research papers. To find the relevant repositories, one could look up the authors' names or paper titles on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Alternatively, checking the references section of the respective publications may reveal links to any associated code repositories.
