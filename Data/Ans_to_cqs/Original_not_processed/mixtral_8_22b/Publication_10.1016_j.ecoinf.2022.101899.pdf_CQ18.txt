To consider the model uncertainty, the models given in Fig. 15 are 
considered  as  the  set  of  models,  Ψ  of  Section  2.2.2.  Then  the  BMA 
approach is implemented. Each model’s prior probability is set to 0.2 to 
give equal chances a priori. The resulting posterior model probabilities, 
P(m| D), and Bayes factors to compare the models are given in Fig. 15. 
Bayes factors can also be interpreted as the improvement in the proba-
bility of occurrence for a given model. This analysis provides insights 
into  which  model  is  most  impactful  in  predicting wildfire  occurrence 
probabilities  and  provides  evidence  on  if  forest  vulnerability  is  the 
dominant  predictor.  The  results  indicate  forest  vulnerability  as  the 
dominant predictor, as this model is 2.5 times more likely to occur based 
on the posterior odds. The model that includes forest vulnerability with 
mean  wind  speed  is  the  second  most  likely, with  2.3  times  improved

burn-in  steps,  171  thinning  steps  and  4  chains  were  extracted.  The 
resulting MCMC diagnostics are very similar to the informative model 
and  show  no  issues  with  representativeness  and  accuracy.  Diagnostic 
plots are given in Appendix. The model efficiency was 23.1 min on the 
same machine used in previous models, which is still efficient in terms of 
implementation time, considering the complexity of the model.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions using burn-in steps, thinning steps, and multiple chains in the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. These techniques are often used to ensure convergence and stability in the sampling process, indirectly monitoring the model performance during training. Additionally, diagnostic plots are mentioned, which could have been used to assess the quality of the sampled parameters and the overall fit of the model. Therefore, while there isn't a direct mention of a specific strategy, these methods suggest that the authors monitored the model performance during training through various means such as convergence assessment, parameter quality checks, and overall model fit evaluation.
