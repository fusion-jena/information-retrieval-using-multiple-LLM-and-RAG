A. Datasets

We used a leaf-scan dataset D that contains a total of
7,262 photos of 255 tree species from the Central Plateau
in Costa Rica. Leaf samples were collected during the ﬁrst
semester of 2016 by taxonomists from the Costa Rica National
Museum1 and digitized by a technician from the Costa Rica
Institute of Technology. All 255 species were used for training.
Images were re-sampled to a 224×224 resolution for the deep
learning experiment and to a 700×525 resolution for the hand-
crafted feature extraction experiment. Figure 2 shows a random
sample taken from the dataset. It is very important to mention
that, for this work, it is crucial to include as metadata no
only the species associated with each photo but also a unique
specimen identiﬁer.

%Query
Query: "Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The paper does not provide information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot determine if it is available on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
