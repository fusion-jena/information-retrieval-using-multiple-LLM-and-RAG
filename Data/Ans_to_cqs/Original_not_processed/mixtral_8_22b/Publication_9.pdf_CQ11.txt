Abstract

1.  Digitized specimens are an indispensable resource for rapidly acquiring big data-

sets and typically must be pre- processed prior to conducting analyses. One crucial 

image pre- processing step in any image analysis workflow is image segmentation, 

or the ability to clearly contrast the foreground target from the background noise 

in an image. This procedure is typically done manually, creating a potential bot-

tleneck for efforts to quantify biodiversity from image databases. Image segmen-
