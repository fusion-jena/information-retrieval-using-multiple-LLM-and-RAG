3. Results 

3.1. Model training efficiency 

Model  training  on  our  hardware  (NVIDIA  GTX  1080  GPU)  took 
~460  h.  The  optimization  was  stopped  once  the  validation  ENS 
repeatedly  failed  to  improve  compared  to  the  score  evaluated  from 
previous  epochs.  The  model  at  the  epoch  with  the  highest  attained 
validation  score  was  selected.  We  noted  a  significant  acceleration  of 
convergence  when  employing  the  baseline  framework,  as  shown  in

2.2. Data 

The data used here was provided as part of the EarthNet2021 Chal-
lenge and consists of 23,904 training datacubes located across Europe

4.3. The prediction task

Since  MAD,  OLS,  and  EMD  are  originally  defined  as  loss  metrics 
(which should be minimized), they were transformed here following the 
standard Earthnet2021 evaluation methodology (Requena-Mesa et al., 
2021)  into  scores  and  normalised  such  that  0  denotes  poor,  and  1  a 
perfect  fit  between  predictions  and  observation.  SSIM  is  a  similarity 
metric, with higher values indicating better model performance. In the 
following,  we  will  use  MAD,  OLS,  EMD,  and  SSIM  to  denote  score 
metrics - after transformation (all of which should be maximized). The 
ENS score as a harmonic mean of the four score components should thus 
also be maximized. 

EMD and OLS are computed based on the observed and predicted 
NDVI.  MAD  and  SSIM  are  computed  on  all  RGBI  bands. The  NDVI  is 
defined  based  on  reflectance  in  the  red  and  near-infrared  bands  (IR) 
(Pettorelli, 2013) and is computed as 

NDVI =

IR (cid:0) Red
.
IR + Red

Helpful Answer:

The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics, including Mean Absolute Difference (MAD), Optimal Linear Scaling (OLS), Earth Movers Distance (EMD), and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM). These metrics are calculated based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the RGBI bands.

MAD, OLS, and EMD are initially defined as loss metrics, but for this study, they have been transformed into scores according to the standard EarthNet2021 evaluation methodology. A perfect fit between predictions and observations results in a score of 1, while a poor fit yields a score of 0. On the other hand, SSIM is a similarity metric where higher values indicate better model performance.

The NDVI is derived from reflectance in the red and near-infrared bands (IR) and is computed using the formula provided in the given context. This index plays a crucial role in evaluating the performance of the deep learning model.
