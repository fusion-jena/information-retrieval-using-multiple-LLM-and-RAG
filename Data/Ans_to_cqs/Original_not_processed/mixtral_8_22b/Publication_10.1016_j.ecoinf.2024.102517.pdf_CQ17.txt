increased with each layer, from 20 in the first dilated convolutional layer 
to 212 in the 13th dilated convolutional layer. However, this was not used 
for the 14th  or final dilated convolutional layers. Batch normalization 
was performed using the adaptive normalization operator proposed by 
Chen  et  al.  (2017),  whereas  a  non-linear  operation  was  implemented 
using a leaky rectified linear unit (LReLU). The framework of the deep 
feature loss-based bird sound noise reduction network is shown in Fig. 4.

The  audio  classification  loss  network  consists  of  convolutional 
layers, average pooling layers, and a logic classifier layer. Layers 1 to 13 
also include convolutional operations, batch normalization, and LReLU 
operations,  with  down-sampling  operations  performed  between  each 
layer  with  a  factor  of  2.  Layer  14  includes  convolutional  operations, 
normalization, and nonlinear operations, omitting the down-sampling 
operation.  Layers  15  and  16  are  the  average  pooling  and  the  logic 
classifier layers, respectively. 

The loss is calculated as the weighted L1 distance between the first 
and  second  groups  of  activation  features,  which  can  be  expressed  as 
follows (Germain et al., 2018):

2.3.3. Experimental setting 

In our experiment, a deep learning environment based on Python and 
Tensorflow – GPU as well as CUDA was constructed under the Windows 
operating system. The deep feature loss bird noise reduction network 
model was trained for 50 epochs on an RTX 2080 Ti GPU using the Adam 
(cid:0) 4. In each 
optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014) with a learning rate of 10
epoch, the entire training set was presented in a random order, with one 
noisy bird sound signal per iteration. 

2.4. Comparative algorithms 

Using the same test  set, we compared the  denoising results of the 
deep feature loss-based bird sound noise reduction network with several 
other  bioacoustics  noise  reduction  algorithms,  namely  SEGAN, 
WebRTC, wavelet transform (Priyadarshani et al., 2016), Wiener filter 
(Loizou, 2017), and MMSE STSA (Brown et al., 2017) algorithms.

traditional noise reduction methods that generally tend to be suitable for 
eliminating  smooth  noise.  However,  field  recordings  often  consist  of 
significant  amounts  of  non-smooth  noise,  rendering  traditional  bio-
acoustic  noise  reduction  methods  at  least  partially  ineffective  for 
adaptive noise reduction in field recordings. In this context, relatively 
few  studies  to  date  have  sought  to  assess  the  potential  value  of  deep 
learning for bioacoustic noise reduction. Moreover, the current scarcity 
of  labeled  clean  bioacoustic  recordings  makes  it  challenging  to  train 
deep  learning-based  models  for  bioacoustic  noise  reduction.  Further-
more,  the  application  of  deep  learning  bioacoustic  noise  reduction 
methods for different types of noises and different frequency bands of 
bird species calls has yet to be thoroughly investigated. Given that birds 
are  considered  good  indicators  of  ecological  health  and  that  their

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization being used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, some techniques mentioned could potentially help mitigate overfitting indirectly. For instance, batch normalization is employed using the adaptive normalization operator proposed by Chen et al. (2017). This technique helps reduce internal covariate shift, making the model more stable during training and possibly reducing overfitting. Additionally, the use of the leaky rectified linear unit (LReLU) as a non-linear operation might also contribute to preventing overfitting due to its ability to introduce sparsity into the activations. Nonetheless, without further information, it cannot be definitively stated whether these techniques were explicitly utilized as regularization methods to combat overfitting.
