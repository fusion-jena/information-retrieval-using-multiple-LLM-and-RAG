3.2.2. Assessment of priority order in carbon sink ecosystems 

The ZONATION 5.0 model was used to identify key ecological carbon 
sinks  areas  (Casalegno  et  al.,  2014).  The  model  utilizes  an  iterative 
heuristic  algorithm  to  minimize  marginal  loss.  It  iteratively  removes 
raster  cells,  tranking  each  removal  to  create  a  nested  sequence  that 
represents the landscape’s priorities (Moilanen, 2007; Moilanen et al., 
2011). Areas removed earlier have lower priority, while those retained 
until the end have higher  priority. The model’s weighted elimination 
risk  curve  identifies  landscape  units  with  escalating  risks  as  priority 
protection zones for ecological carbon sinks (Lehtom¨aki and Moilanen, 
2013; Srivathsa et al., 2023). The core-area zonation (CAZ) was applied 
in this study, and when applying boundary length penalty, the modified 
formulas of CAZ are as follows.

The  urgent  intervention  and  priority  restoration  zones,  while 
encompassing the smallest area—64.44 × 108  m2 and 32.19 × 108  m2 
respectively—carry  significant  importance  and  risk.  They  were  pri-
marily located near significant lakes, ecologically fragile areas, and parts 
of high-quality ecological zones close to urban development areas, with 
land structures consisting mainly of forests, arable land, and grasslands. 
Despite its limited size, the priority restoration zone exhibits the second- 
highest carbon sink density, surpassed only by the long-term conserva-
tion  zone.  The  comprehensive  management  zone  covered  the  largest 
area at 460.18 × 108  m2  but had the lowest carbon sink density. The 
long-term conservation zone ranked second in terms of area but had the 
highest carbon sequestration density.
