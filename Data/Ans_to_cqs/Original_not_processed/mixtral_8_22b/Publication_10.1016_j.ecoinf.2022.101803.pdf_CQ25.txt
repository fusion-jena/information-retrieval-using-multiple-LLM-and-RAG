To  increase  the  flexibility  of  the  previously  discussed  models,  we 
integrate them into a classification and regression tree (CART). CARTs, 
originally proposed by Breiman et al. (1984), are based on a divide-and- 
conquer strategy, whereby the data space is divided into subsets defined 
by the decision rules of a bifurcating tree. The inner nodes of the tree, 
also called decision nodes, compare the values of selected input vari-
ables against certain decision thresholds. This confers a cybernetics-like 
interpretable logical structure to the model, which aids interpretability 
and  explainability.  All  the  decision  rules,  including  the  selection  of 
variables and decision thresholds, are systematically learned from the 
data. For the corresponding statistical inference methods and regulari-
zation  techniques  (to  prevent  overfitting),  we  refer  the  reader  to  the 
statistical literature (e.g. Breiman et al., 1984 and Hastie et al., 2008).

regularisation, confirming similar findings in Machine Learning litera-
ture (Sollich and Krogh, 1996). The combination of the proposed RBF- 
GFR  model  with  random  forests  (RBF-GFR-RF)  produced  the  best 
model  overall,  consistently  achieving  a  place  in  the  top  three  perfor-
mance rankings. An important additional finding was that almost all the 
methods proposed in this study outperform the original GFR model from 
Matthiopoulos et al. (2011), which was the initial aim motivating the 
present work. As shown in Fig. 2, the GFR model never achieves a rank 
better than 6. R2
DEV  in Eq. (18) is generally a better behaved measure-
ment than R2  in Eq. (17) for count data as described in Section 4.2. We 
used R2
DEV to calculate the out-of-sample predictive performance in these 
datasets  as  shown  in  Fig. S9  in  Supplement A.9.  However,  the  overall 
ranks using R2
DEV  are not different from the overall ranks using R2  in Eq.

While  the  ensemble  size  for  bagging  is  not  particularly  critical, 
provided it is sufficiently large (500 is a widely used default value), it 
does  matter  for boosting.  In  XGBoost, large  ensemble  sizes  can  cause 
over-fitting because the gradient technique focuses on the most difficult 
cases,  which  can  be  due  to  noise.  To  avoid  the  over-fitting  issue  in 
XGBoost, we use a nested k-fold cross-validation scheme. We split each 
dataset into 3 subsets: the tuning set (k-2 folds), validation set (1-fold), 
and test set (1-fold). For each choice of number of iterations and each 
fold, we train the model on the tuning set and monitor the performance 
on the validation set by calculating the out-of-sample prediction accu-
racy and taking the median of k-1 folds. This gives us k medians for each 
number of iterations, as explained in Algorithm 1 and shown in Fig. S2 in 
Supplement A.3.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the purpose of a specific deep learning model. However, it discusses the integration of models into a Classification and Regression Tree (CART) framework, suggesting that the primary goal might involve either classifying or predicting continuous variables. Additionally, the text mentions the use of Random Forests (RBF-GFR-RF) and their superior performance compared to other models, further indicating a focus on classification tasks. Nonetheless, without more precise details regarding the nature of the data and the intended application, it remains challenging to pinpoint the exact purpose of any potential deep learning model within this context.
