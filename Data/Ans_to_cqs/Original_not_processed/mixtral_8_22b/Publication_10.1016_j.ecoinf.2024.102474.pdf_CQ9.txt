In this work, we resorted to purely deterministic variants of these 

architectures.  The  models  were  implemented  using  the  deep  learning 
framework PyTorch Lightning (Falcon, 2019) which is built on top of 
PyTorch  (Paszke  et  al.,  2019)  and  enables  improved  scalability.  The 
hyperparameters were tuned using an Optuna-based (Akiba et al., 2019) 
hyperparameter optimization procedure.

Remote  sensing  datacubes  represent  scenes  from  the  Sentinel  2 
mission (Gascon et al., 2014), covering a spatial extent of 128 × 128 
pixels at 20 m resolution (2.56 × 2.56 km total extent), and providing 
surface  reflectance  every  5  days  in  four  wavelength  bands  (corre-
sponding  to  blue,  green,  red,  and  near-infrared  light  (RGBI)),  com-
plemented  with  a  binary  data  quality  mask  defining  the  presence  of 
clouds.  Following  the  EarthNet2021  Challenge  framework,  weather 
datacubes from E-OBS (Scheffler et al., 2017) are provided for each day. 
They have an extent of 80 × 80 pixels at a resolution of 1.28 km (cor-
responding  to  ≈ 0.1
,  referred  to  here  as  ‘low  resolution’,  covering 
102.4 × 102.4 km total extent) and provide information on precipita-
tion,  air  pressure  at  sea  level,  daily  mean,  minimum  and  maximum 
temperature. These variables have been shown to strongly correlate with

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given context, it does not explicitly state where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that the data used was provided as part of the EarthNet2021 Challenge and consists of 23,904 training datacubes located across Europe. To find out the exact location or platform where the data repository is available, further research would be required.
