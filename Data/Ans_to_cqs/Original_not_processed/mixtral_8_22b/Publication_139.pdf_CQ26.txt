Pre-training on the both ResNet50 (He et al., 2016) and Inception 
(Szegedy et al., 2014) neural networks did not meaningfully improve 
classification performance, therefore this simpler architecture, similar to 
those implemented by (Ruff et al., 2020; Sprengel et al., 2016) was used 
instead. 

2.6. Generating prediction record

2.3. Data pre-processing 

Once all of the audio data was collected, it was segmented into 8 s- 
long clips, to increase the likelihood  that both biological and  anthro-
pogenic sound sources with longer call lengths (the cardinal, with a song 
sequence that often lasts 4 s, and the siren call, one period of which lasts 
5  s)  to  be  captured  in  their  entirety.  Each  segment  was  then  down-
sampled to 16 kHz for processing efficiency, allowing each to be rep-
resented  as  a  128,000-sample  vector.  Finally,  these  segments  were 
converted into log-mel spectrograms using the Librosa python package

2.6. Generating prediction record 

After  neural  network  training  and  validation,  predictions  for  the 
entire  unvalidated  recording  period  were  generated.  Specifically,  for 
each of the five training folds, a single prediction for every 8 s-interval 
was made for the duration of the year. The five prediction records that 
resulted were then averaged together to create a single prediction re-
cord.  To  summarize  this  data  more  succinctly,  these  8  s-interval  pre-
dictions were then aggregated into hourly prediction records, containing 
the number of instances that each particular sound stimuli was predicted 
per  hour.  This  record  was  normalized  by  the  number  of  8-s  intervals 
actually recorded during that hour, to account for the possibility that 
missing audio data would render a given prediction record artificially 
low. 

2.7. Collecting weather data

approaches or post-prediction thresholding to allow for an arbitrary N 
number of sound classes to be considered, instead of defining N a priori 
(Thakur et al., 2019). As a final step, samples rejected in this way can be 
either manually annotated or themselves aggregated and clustered for 
possible later development into new sonic categories.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, there is mention of collecting audio data from various locations and times throughout the year, which could potentially help mitigate any biases related to location or time. Additionally, the use of log-mel spectrograms for representing audio data might also contribute to reducing certain types of biases, as they capture relevant features while discarding irrelevant ones. Nevertheless, without further details regarding the dataset and its potential biases, it is difficult to determine if these measures alone are sufficient to effectively address data bias during preprocessing.
