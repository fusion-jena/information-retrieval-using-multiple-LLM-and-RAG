Once data are generated by AI natural-
ists we must consider how they are
shared to ensure recognition of their au-
thors, observation traceability, and long-
term accessibility. We suggest following
the TDWG standards,43 such as Darwin-
Core among others, to ensure the data
are interoperable with other biodiversity datasets and can be
shared via the GBIF portal (www.gbif.org). Metadata accompa-
nying these datasets should include the AI model architecture,
technical speciﬁcities of the AI model training phase, digital ob-
ject identiﬁer of the dataset used to train it, AI model version,
classiﬁcation score of each image, date, location, photograph
name, and image license. Classiﬁcation score, which provides
a mathematical value of the conﬁdence in the prediction of a
model for a speciﬁc image, is particularly important as it can
be used in subsequent analyses to ﬁlter the data by the level
of conﬁdence in the classiﬁcation accuracy. A researcher will

the Pl@ntNet user community (currently 1.8 million user accounts). At the time
of writing, the CNN architecture used is the inception model49 extended with
batch normalization.50 The network is pre-trained on the commonly used Im-
ageNet dataset and ﬁne-tuned on Pl@ntNet data. Pl@ntNet currently covers
30,261 species illustrated by more than 2.9 million images. The taxonomic
coverage of our study is therefore one to three orders of magnitude larger
than previously published studies making use of automated species identiﬁca-
tion for ecological research. The training of Pl@ntNet CNN requires the mobi-
lization of a high-performance computing infrastructure and expertise in deep,
distributed, and large-scale learning. Thus, the resulting classiﬁcation tool is in
itself a major advance in biodiversity data science.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit details about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some indications that suggest certain practices might have been employed. For instance, the mention of using the ImageNet dataset for pretraining suggests that the model was exposed to diverse visual data before being fine-tuned on plant-specific data. This could potentially improve its ability to generalize across different types of plants. Additionally, the fact that the model has been trained on over 2.9 million images covering 30,261 species implies that the dataset used for training was quite extensive and varied, further enhancing the likelihood of good generalization performance. Lastly, while not explicitly stated, it is common practice in machine learning to employ techniques like cross-validation or stratified sampling during model development to prevent overfitting and enhance generalizability. Therefore, although not directly mentioned, it is plausible that similar strategies may have been adopted here as well.
