Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

wt+1 = µwt − α∆J(wt)

where µ is the momentum weight for the current weights wt and α is the learning rate.

The network weights, wt, can be randomly initialized if the network is trained from scratch.
However, this is suitable only when a large labeled training-set is available, which is expensive in
practice. Several previous studies have shown that data-augmentation ([44]) and transfer learning ([45])
help overcoming this limitation.

The training-zone used for training the CNN-based model. This zone is located in Cabo de
Gata-Níjar Natural Park, 36◦49(cid:48)43(cid:48)(cid:48) N, 2◦16(cid:48)22(cid:48)(cid:48) W, in the province of Almería, Spain (Figure 2).
The climate is semi-arid Mediterranean. The vegetation is scarce and patchy, mainly dominated
by large Ziziphus lotus shrubs surrounded by a heterogeneous matrix of bare soil and small
scrubs (e.g., Thymus hyemalis, Launea arborescens and Lygeum spartum) with low coverage ([49,52]).
Ziziphus lotus forms large hemispherical bushes with very deep roots and 1–3 m tall that trap and
accumulate sand and organic matter building geomorphological structures, called nebkhas, that
constitute a shelter micro-habitat for many plant and animal species ([19,49,53]).
Test-zone-1 and test-zone-2 belong to two different protected areas. Test-zone-1 is located 1.5 km

In terms of user productivity, the training of ResNet-classiﬁer was performed only once and
took 8 min 22 s on a laptop with Intel(R) Core(TM) i5 CPU running at 2.40 GHz and 4 GB RAM.
In the test phase, also called deployment phase, executing ResNet-classiﬁer together with the
detection proposals technique on the same laptop for test-zone-1 and test-zone-2 took 58.48 and
26.4 s, respectively. Whereas, ﬁnding the best conﬁguration for OBIA on each test-zone took 10 h
on the same laptop. Applying the obtained CNN-detector to any new image of similar sizes will
take seconds; however, applying OBIA to a new image will take several hours. This execution can
be partially reduced by using semi-automatic tools to estimate scale parameters ESP v.2 [59].
In summary, our results show that the user becomes more productive with CNNs than with OBIA and
reaching higher accuracies.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of a specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it is common practice in machine learning to use techniques such as cross-validation or validation sets to evaluate the model's performance during training. These methods help prevent overfitting and ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data. In addition, monitoring metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., can provide insights into the model's performance. It is important to note that the choice of evaluation metric depends on the problem statement and the dataset being used.
