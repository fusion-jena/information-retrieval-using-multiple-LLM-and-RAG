2.4.1. Random forest classification

Random  Forest  is  a  machine  learning  method  combining  decision 
trees  and  bootstrapping.  Developed  by  Breiman  (2001),  RF  has  been 
found to be insensitive to overtraining, small or noisy datasets. Every 
decision tree in the implemented RF algorithm is trained with a boot-
strapped sample of the training data and, at every split node, a subset of 
randomly  selected  features  is  utilized.  Then  for  each  pixel,  the  final 
classification  is  obtained  by  a  majority  vote.  RF  has  proven  to  be  an 
effective tool for mapping coastal and seagrass habitats (Fauzan et al., 
2021; Traganos and Reinartz, 2018b; Wicaksono et al., 2019). Two sets 
of RF models were performed using the multispectral images retrieved in 
2010. In the first set, the response variable was the presence/absence of 
the total seagrass meadows (hereafter identified as seagrass meadows), 
where areas with <20% seagrass cover were considered absence (Valle

%Query
Query: "What optimization techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., SGD, Adam)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide information on the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine which optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) have been applied.

The context primarily focuses on the application of Random Forest Classification, a machine learning technique based on decision trees and bootstrapping, for mapping coastal and seagrass habitats. It mentions two sets of RF models being performed using multispectral images but does not discuss any details about the deep learning pipeline or the optimization techniques employed within it.
