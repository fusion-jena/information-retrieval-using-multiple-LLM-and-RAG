2) Deep Learning: We chose CNNs [28] because of the
impressive results obtained in classiﬁcation challenges such
as ImageNet [29]. The main strength of this approach comes
from its ability to learn discriminant visual features directly
from the raw pixels of the images without falling into the
trap of the curse of dimensionality [30]. This is achieved by
stacking multiple convolutional layers, which are the core
building blocks of a CNN. A convolutional layer basically
takes images as input and produces as output feature maps
that correspond to different convolution kernels, while looking
for different visual patterns.

B. Computer Vision Approaches/Pipelines

We use two pipelines to classify leaf-scan images into
species. In one, we use a traditional hand-crafted feature
extraction approach, speciﬁcally, LBPU to extract
texture
features from the images, as done in [14] and [27]. We also
use a deep learning approach as a second pipeline. Both are
discussed in the following subsections.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the data format used is likely images. This is suggested by the discussion of using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are commonly used for image classification tasks, and the reference to the impressive results obtained in the ImageNet challenge, a large-scale image recognition task. Additionally, the term 'leaf-scan images' is mentioned, further supporting the idea that the data format used is images. Therefore, it can be concluded that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is most likely images.
