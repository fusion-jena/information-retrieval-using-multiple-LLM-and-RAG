%Query
Query: "What type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer model was employed.
