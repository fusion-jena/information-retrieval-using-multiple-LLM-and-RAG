Image  classification  on  the  CNN  architecture  known  as  AlexNet  was  proposed  by  Alex 
Krizhevsky and won the 2012 ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (Krizhevsky 
et al., 2012). There are eight layers in the network, containing five convolutional layers and three 
fully connected layers (Fig. 3). All feature extractors were initialized with white Gaussian noise 
and learned from data, and the resulting feature maps were passed through rectified linear units 
(ReLUs),  a  type  of  non-linearity  unit.  The  model  was  trained  using  stochastic  gradient  descent 
and  the  backpropagation  algorithm  included  in  Caffe  (Jia  et  al.,  2014),  with  the  learning  rate 
policy set to “step”. The learning rate set to 10-2 for all layers initially for the reason of accept the 
newly  defined  last  fully  connected  layer  set  to  10-2.  The  learning  rate  (lr)  was  decreased  by  a

Helpful Answer:
In this study, the authors utilized a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) called AlexNet for butterfly classification. This particular CNN architecture was introduced by Alex Krizhevsky and won the 2012 ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge. AlexNet consists of eight layers, including five convolutional layers and three fully connected layers. The feature extractors were initialized with white Gaussian noise and learned from the data. The resulting feature maps then went through rectified linear units (ReLUs), a type of non-linearity unit. The model was trained using stochastic gradient descent and the backpropagation algorithm included in Caffe, with the learning rate policy set to'step'. Initially, the learning rate was set to 10^-2 for all layers to accommodate the newly defined last fully connected layer, also set to 10^-2. The learning rate was subsequently reduced during training.
