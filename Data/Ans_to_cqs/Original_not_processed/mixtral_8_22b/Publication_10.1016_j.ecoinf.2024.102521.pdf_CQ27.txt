derived.  

2.  STARdbi_train 

Input: 
The output directory of STARdbi_split_images, as described above, 
Output: 
A classification model (ResNet152, He et al. (2015)) in the form of a 

binary pickle file.  

3.  STARdbi_inference 

Input:  

I.  A directory with unannotated single-insect image files, with the 
same  naming  convention  as  described  in  the  output  of 
STARdbi_split_images.

Similar considerations slowed the development of other data-intensive 
fields.  The  solution  lies  in  regulation,  either  by  top  journals  that 
consider  data  sharing  as  a  publication  requirement,  or  by  funding 
agencies wishing to maximize the impact of their investment (Michener, 
2015). STARdbi will urge its users to make their data as open as possible. 
We start by raising this issue here.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the deployed deep learning model is a classification model (ResNet152, He et al. (2015)). This model is stored in the form of a binary pickle file after being trained using the STARdbi\_train function. However, there isn't explicit information about the specific process used to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed step-by-step process based solely on the available context.
