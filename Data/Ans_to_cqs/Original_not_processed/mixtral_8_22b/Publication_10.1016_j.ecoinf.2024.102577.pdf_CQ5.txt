Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The article does not provide specific details about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions several environmental variables that could potentially be used as input features for machine learning models. These include current speed, temperature, sea level anomaly, mixed layer depth, bottom temperature, sea surface temperature (SST), net primary production, dissolved molecular oxygen concentration, chlorophyll concentration, chlorophyll fronts, SST fronts, thermocline intensity, thermocline depth, temperature gradient, bathymetry, latitude, longitude, and month. The article also references other studies that have applied machine learning techniques to marine ecology and fisheries management, but it does not specify which datasets were used in those cases either. Therefore, without further information, it is not possible to determine exactly what datasets were used in this study's deep learning pipeline.
