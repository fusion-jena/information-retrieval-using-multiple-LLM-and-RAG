2024). However, there remain limitations, such as low image resolution, 
low estimation accuracy, and high uncertainty in estimation biomass, 
peculiarly in regions characterized by dense forestation (Colgan et al., 
2013; Domingo et al., 2019; Duarte et al., 2018; Lu, 2007). The rela-
tively coarse resolution of these data sources, along with indirect metrics 
of  dendrometry  traits,  culminates  in  the  attenuated  precision  of  the 
deduced AGB estimates. For instance, the RMSE of tree height estima-
tions  derived  from  satellite  observations  frequently  exceeds  4  m  (Liu 
et al., 2022; Torresani et al., 2023).

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, some common methods used to improve the generalizability of deep learning models include using diverse datasets, cross-validation, and stratified splitting.

A diverse dataset helps expose the model to various scenarios, reducing overfitting and improving its ability to perform well on unseen data. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into multiple folds or sets, training the model on one set while validating it on another, and repeating this process until each fold has been used for both training and validation. This technique provides a more robust estimate of the model's performance on new data.

Stratified splitting ensures that the distribution of classes within the training and testing datasets remains consistent with the original dataset. This method prevents imbalanced class distributions during training and evaluation, which could negatively affect the model's performance.

While the given context does not provide explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, these are some commonly employed strategies to achieve this goal.
