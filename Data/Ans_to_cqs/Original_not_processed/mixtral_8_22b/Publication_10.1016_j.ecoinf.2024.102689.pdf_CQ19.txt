GPU  and  utilizes  CUDA  version  11.4.  Python  3.6  serves  as  the  pro-
gramming language, and Pytorch version 1.8.0 is used in conjunction 
with  the  virtual  environment  function  of  Anaconda3.  Optimization  is 
carried out using the Adam optimizer with a Momentum of 0.9 and a 
Batch size of 16. Images are processed at a resolution of 1024 × 1024, 
with an initial learning rate set at 0.001 and a minimum learning rate of 
0.0001. The descent mode is step, and training spans 300 epochs.

As clearly evident in Table 3, the refined model, integrated with the 
VOS  algorithm,  outperforms  both  the  YOLOv5  and  YOLOv8  models 
across  all  evaluation  metrics,  encompassing  Box_loss,  Seg_loss,  Preci-
sion, Recall, Precision (M), Recall (M), mAP, and mAP (M).

0.3 FPS. The primary reason for this discrepancy lies in the intricate and 
resource-intensive  nature  of  our  model’s  network  architecture.  In 
contrast,  the  LFGT  algorithm  achieves  a  more  streamlined  and  light-
weight design by segmenting its model into global and local branches. 
During the prediction phase, LFGT relies solely on the global branch for 
individual recognition. While our algorithm’s average processing time 
for  individual  data  stands  at  a  mere  0.05  s,  satisfying  real-time  re-
quirements, there is ample potential for enhancing its efficiency through 
further  lightweighting.  We  recognize  that  there  is  much  room  for 
improvement in this aspect of our methodology.

tanayak  et  al.,  2021).  Furthermore,  we  will  explore  knowledge 
distillation methods, which have been surveyed extensively and proven 
effective  in  model  compression  through  distillation  and  quantization 
(Gou  et  al.,  2021;  Polino  et  al.,  2018  preprint:  not  peer  reviewed). 
Through this comprehensive suite of improvements and optimizations, 
we aspire to develop lightweight yet powerful fish individual recogni-
tion algorithms, thereby providing robust technical support for intelli-
gent aquaculture and marine ecological protection initiatives.
