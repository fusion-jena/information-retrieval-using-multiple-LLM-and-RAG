In  addition  to  calculating  MAE  values,  we  also  compared  the 
inference-time to determine the most computationally efficient model. 
We set the batch to 400 to achieve 100% GPU utilization of each model 
and to measure the maximum queries per second (QPS) achieved under 
real-world conditions (Ding et al., 2021). All models were tested under 
the same experiment setting and the same GPU to make comparisons 
between them fair. To do so, we first expand the dataset by a factor of 
five (from 8002 to 40,010 images). Then, we fed batches of 50 images 
into the model to warm up the hardware, before recording the inference- 
time of batches of 100 to quantify QPS.

struggle with adult pandas, often categorizing pandas aged 17 to 25 with 
pandas aged 7 to 17 years.

RepVGG has fewer parameters and the highest speed (Table 3). For 
example,  RepVGG-A0  was  26%  and  17%  faster  than  ResNet-18  and 
MobileNet-V3, respectively. RepVGG-A1 was 4.7 times as fast as VGG- 
16-BN  with  roughly  same  number  of  parameters.  RepVGG  showed  a 
favorable  MAE-speed  trade-off  (Table  2  and  Table  3).  Among  these, 
RepVGG-A0 with the OR method achieved the lowest MAE (2.51) and 
the fastest speed (4270). Notably, the number of parameters was not the 
only factor affecting the inference speed, as RepVGG Networks are more 
parameter-efficient than VGG and ResNet networks.
