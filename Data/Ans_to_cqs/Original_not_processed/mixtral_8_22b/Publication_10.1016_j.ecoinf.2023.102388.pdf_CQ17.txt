• No-overfitting. In this setting, the optimization algorithm of CNNs is 
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), with a learning rate of 0.0001 
and a weight decay of 0.5. The batch size is set to 32, the number of 
training epochs to 200 and finally the batch-norm and dropout (0.5) 
are used to reduce the overfitting level.  

• Overfitting.  We  use  the  same  hyperparameters  setting  as  the  no- 
overfitting  but  we  remove  the  use  of  batch-norm,  weight  decay 
and dropout techniques to ensure that the model overfits.

The traditional way of training machine learning models normally 
aims at avoiding the overfitting phenomenon (Ravoor and T.S.B., 2020; 
Santos and Papa, 2022). Indeed, the main concern about overfitting is 
that it occurs when the model performs well on the training data but 
generalizes  poorly  on  unseen  samples  (i.e.,  test  set).  In  the  privacy 
domain,  overfitting  has  also  been  shown  to  make  the  model  more 
vulnerable to privacy attacks as it results in the model memorizing more 
information  about  the  training  set  (Shokri  et  al.,  2017;  Song  et  al., 
2019).

prominent  in  demanding  tasks  like  the  re-identification  of  marine 
mammals in underwater environments. 

The  challenge  of  generalization  often  arises  as  a  consequence  of 
network overfitting during the training phase. In simplified terms, the 
network’s  weight  parameters  are  adjusted to  optimize  their  fit  to  the 
provided training examples, thus effectively “memorizing” the training 
data. However, when applied to new and unseen data during testing, the 
network’s  response  exhibits  a  more  balanced  consideration  of  the 
diverse training examples. This discrepancy frequently leads to dimin-
ished performance on the test dataset and might persist even after the 
network  has undergone  prolonged training over  numerous epochs.  In 
recent  years,  significant  research  endeavors  have  been  dedicated  to 
mitigating overfitting challenges to enhance model generalization.

Helpful Answer:
Regularization methods are crucial in preventing overfitting in deep learning pipelines. Two commonly used regularization methods mentioned in the given context are Dropout and Weight Decay (L2 Regularization).

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored or "dropped out" during training, which helps to make the model more robust by reducing its dependence on any single feature. It can be seen in the 'No-Overfitting' scenario where a dropout rate of 0.5 is employed.

Weight Decay, also known as L2 Regularization, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of all trainable parameters. This encourages smaller weights, leading to simpler models that generalize better. In the given context, a weight decay of 0.5 is utilized in the 'No-Overfitting' setup.

Additionally, another method not explicitly mentioned but implied through the use of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is Early Stopping. Although not directly listed as a regularization method, early stopping involves monitoring the validation error while training and halting the process once the error stops decreasing. This prevents the model from fitting too closely to the training data.

Lastly, Batch Normalization is another technique used to combat overfitting. By normalizing the activations of each layer, it reduces internal covariate shift, making the network easier to train and improving its ability to generalize. In the provided context, Batch Normalization is used in the 'No-Overfitting' case but removed in the 'Overfitting' scenario to intentionally induce overfitting.
