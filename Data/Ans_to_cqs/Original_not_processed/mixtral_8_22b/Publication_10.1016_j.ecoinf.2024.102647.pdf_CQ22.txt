The performance of machine learning models was evaluated by four 
criteria:  coefficient  of  determination  (R2),  NSE  (Nash  and  Sutcliffe, 
1970), Kling–Gupta efficiency (KGE) (Gupta et al., 2009), and correla-
tion coefficient (COR) (Sardoei et al., 2024).

Five performance criteria, including Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) 
(Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970), accuracy, sensitivity, Kappa (K), and Area 
under  the  Receiver  Operating  Characteristic  (ROC)  Curve  (hereafter 
AUC), were applied for the validation assessment of statistical models (i. 
e., FR and SI models). An AUC value of <0.6 indicates weak accuracy, 
between 0.6 and 0.7 medium accuracies, 0.7 and 0.8 high accuracy, and 
>0.8 very high (Evans et al., 2005). The AUC values of ROC indicate the 
accuracy  of  both  classification  models  (i.e.,  statistical  and  machine 
learning models). The model’s accuracy would be acceptable whenever 
the  under-curve  area exceeds  70%. The  pROC  package of R  Software 
(Ver. 3.5.6) was applied to indicate model accuracy based on ROC in this 
research (Robin et al., 2011).

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, the performance of machine learning models is evaluated using several criteria. However, it should be noted that these criteria are not specific to deep learning models but rather apply to machine learning models in general. The evaluation criteria mentioned include the coefficient of determination (R2), NSE (Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970), Kling–Gupta efficiency (KGE) (Gupta et al., 2009), and correlation coefficient (COR) (Sardoei et al., 2024). These metrics assess different aspects of the model's performance, such as its ability to fit the data, predict new instances accurately, or capture the underlying patterns in the data. It is important to note that while some of these metrics may have similarities with common evaluation metrics for deep learning models like accuracy, precision, or recall, they are not directly equivalent. For instance, the coefficient of determination (R2) measures the proportion of variance explained by the model, which can be seen as a measure of 'goodness of fit'. On the other hand, accuracy, precision, and recall are more commonly used in classification tasks to quantify the number of correct predictions made by the model. Therefore, while there are overlaps between the two sets of metrics, they serve slightly different purposes and are used in different types of evaluations.
