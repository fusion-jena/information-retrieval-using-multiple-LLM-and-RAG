Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

To summarize, we have a total of 60 experimental

conﬁgurations, which vary on the following parameters:

1. Choice of deep learning architecture:

AlexNet,
GoogLeNet.

2. Choice of training mechanism:

Transfer Learning,
Training from Scratch.

3. Choice of dataset type:

Color,
Gray scale,
Leaf Segmented.

4. Choice of training-testing set distribution:

Train: 80%, Test: 20%,
Train: 60%, Test: 40%,
Train: 50%, Test: 50%,
Train: 40%, Test: 60%,
Train: 20%, Test: 80%.

• Weight decay: 0.0005,
• Gamma: 0.1,
• Batch size: 24 (in case of GoogLeNet), 100 (in case of AlexNet).

All the above experiments were conducted using our own fork of
Caﬀe (Jia et al., 2014), which is a fast, open source framework for
deep learning. The basic results, such as the overall accuracy can
also be replicated using a standard instance of caﬀe.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that one of the parameters varied in the experimental configurations is the choice of dataset type, including color, grayscale, and leaf segmented datasets. This suggests that some form of image preprocessing or annotation may have been applied to these datasets before being used in the deep learning models. Unfortunately, without more detailed information about how these datasets were prepared, I cannot specify whether techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation were employed.
