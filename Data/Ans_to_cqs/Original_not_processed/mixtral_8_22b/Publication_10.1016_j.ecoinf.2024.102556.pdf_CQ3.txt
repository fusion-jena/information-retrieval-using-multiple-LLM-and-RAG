to learn features of various sizes, leading to potential matching errors 
when the scale of the target changes. To address these shortcomings, it is 
imperative  to  introduce  a  multiscale  feature-extraction  network 
(MSNet).

Inspired  by  Res2Net,  a  novel  residual  network  structured  with 
Res2Net modules and group convolution was introduced to replace the 
FEN in the Deep SORT algorithm. This enhancement refines the multi-
scale representation in the Deep SORT FEN, achieving a more intricate 
and detailed level of feature-extraction.

features  from  images,  comprising  three  convolutional  layers:  Con-
v+BatchNorm+SiLU integration module (CBS), Efficient Layer Aggre-
gation Networks (ELAN), and Hybrid Convolutional (MPConv). As  an 
efficient aggregation network, the ELAN layer is designed with a multi- 
stream  structure  to  learn  various  features  through  different  convolu-
tional  streams. Unlike  the normal  pooling layer,  the  MPConv layer  is 
branched into a CBS layer and a Maxpool layer. Features extracted from 
each layer were fused through the Concat operation, facilitated by the 
aggregated feature pyramid structure. With the SPP pyramid structure, 
the header network is designed for multiple inputs and transferring in-
formation from the bottom to the top. Finally, the RepConv structure is 
utilized to adjust the number of channels for different scaled features.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit details about specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the references mentioned, we can infer some possible methods. For instance, Schindler and Steinhage (2022) discuss instance segmentation and tracking of animals in wildlife videos, which suggests the use of instance segmentation as a data annotation technique. Similarly, Kellenberger et al. (2018) focus on detecting mammals in UAV images, implying the use of object detection techniques like bounding box annotations. Furthermore, Khan et al. (2022) mention introducing an Urdu Digits Dataset, indicating digit recognition tasks where pixel-level annotations might be employed. Lastly, the discussion around enhancing multi-scale representations in the Deep SORT FEN could imply the use of semantic segmentation or other advanced annotation techniques. Nevertheless, without direct evidence from the provided context, this remains speculative.
