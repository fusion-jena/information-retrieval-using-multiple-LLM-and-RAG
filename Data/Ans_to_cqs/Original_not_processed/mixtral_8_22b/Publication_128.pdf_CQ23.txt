2.5. Model training 

  To ensure the accuracy of the experimental results and obtain the best classification, the exact 
parameters  and  functions  as  well  as  classifier  built-in  the  six  neural  network  models  are 
designed as follows: 

  The resolution of input data is 224×224 with Red Green Blue (RGB) format, and the inputs 

are batch normalized before training; 

  Batch size is applied which is set to 30 when training, but images are tested one by one; 
  An  optimized  rectified  linear  activation,  Leaky  ReLU,  was  introduced  into  models  after 

convolution or concatenate layer; 

In MobileNet, width multiplier is 1.2, resolution multiplier is 1; 

  Learning rate and dropout rate adopt same value 0.001, bias value is 0;  
 
  For the neural networks with lower depth, the higher training epochs are, the higher probability 
of over fitting is. Therefor models in which less than 100 layers adhibit raw data 60 epochs, 
otherwise executed 80 epochs;

functions require three typical CNN computations are: 1) convolution obtains image features; 2) pooling 
for redundancy reducing, and 3) non-linear activation function provides the capacity of network. For a 
feature  map  with  width,  height  and  channels  of  w,  h  and  c,  respectively,  the  exportation  of  flatten 
operation is a one-dimension array with size w×h×c.

  A fully connected layer with softmax activation has 28 nodes, which is regarded as classifier 

while training but removed when inference.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, there are some aspects mentioned that can contribute to improving the model's performance and potentially its generalizability:

1. Data preprocessing: Input data is resized to 224x224 pixels with RGB format, and batch normalization is applied before training. This standardizes the input data, making it easier for the model to learn from different examples.

2. Optimizer and Activation Function: The Leaky ReLU activation function is used, which helps prevent the vanishing gradient problem during backpropagation. Additionally, the learning rate and dropout rate are both set to 0.001, while the bias value is set to 0. These settings help regulate the learning process and reduce overfitting.

3. Training Epochs: Depending on the number of layers in the model, either 60 or 80 training epochs are performed. Adjusting the number of epochs based on the complexity of the model can help improve its ability to generalize better.

4. Hardware and Software Environment: The experiments are conducted on a CentOS Linux operating system with 32 CPUs, each having 64 processors. The development environment uses Python version 3.6.2, along with tool packages like TensorFlow and NumPy. Having a powerful hardware setup and appropriate software tools can aid in building more robust and accurate models.
