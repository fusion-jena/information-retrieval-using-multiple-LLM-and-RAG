%Query
Query: "What are the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet)? "

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific dataset used in the deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it mentions two datasets related to remote sensing and land cover classification:

1. Santa Barbara County coast (2020): This is a dataset available through the Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity. It could potentially be used as input data for training and testing deep learning models for land cover classification tasks.

2. NAIP Imagery: Prasai et al. (2021) discuss using Google Earth Engine Python API and NAIP imagery for land use and land cover classification in Florida, USA. Although this isn't specifically mentioned as a dataset, NAIP imagery can serve as input data for deep learning models.

In summary, while there aren't explicit references to popular deep learning datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, the context suggests that datasets such as Santa Barbara County coast (2020) and NAIP imagery might have been employed for land cover classification tasks.
