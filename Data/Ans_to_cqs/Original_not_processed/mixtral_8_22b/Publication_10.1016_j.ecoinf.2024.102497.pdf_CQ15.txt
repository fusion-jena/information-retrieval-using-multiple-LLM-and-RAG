by selecting features and thresholds that minimize the variance of the 
target  variable  within  each  subset.  This  iterative  process  employs  a 
greedy  algorithm,  gradually  building  the  tree  until  specific  stopping 
conditions  are  met.  The  key  components  of  CART  involve  feature  se-
lection, tree generation, and pruning. For our implementation, we uti-
lized the Python programming language to build the CART model. The 
CART algorithm was imported from the ‘sklearn’ library in Python. To 
optimize the regression decision tree for efficiency and suitability, we 
fine-tuned  specific  model  parameters  such  as  ‘max_depth’,  ‘min_sam-
ples_leaf’, and ‘max_leaf_nodes’. Ultimately, we set these parameters to 
8,  5,  and  20,  respectively.  These  parameter  values  were  selected  to 
prevent overfitting and minimize cross-validation error in our model.

Advancements  in  bathymetry  retrieval  methods  have  led  to  the 
development  of  various  models,  including  linear  or  nonlinear  regres-
sion, logarithmic ratio transformation, and machine learning techniques 
such  as  CART,  RFR, and  SVM (Ashphaq et  al.,  2021; Cahalane et  al., 
2019; Lyzenga, 1978; Lyzenga et al., 2006). Gabr et al. (2020) utilized a 
linear model to estimate bathymetry and confirmed the equivalence of 
Landsat images to high-resolution PlanetScope (3 m) predictions. Sun 
et al. (2021) applied two regression tree models (CART and Cubist) to 
retrieve  coastal  bathymetry  and  analyze  vertical  water  environment 
information.  Zhang  et  al.  (2019)  employed  the  SVR  (support  vector 
regression) model to provide technical support for bathymetry data in 
Arctic waters. However, despite several studies, the application of CART 
and  RFR  models  in  nearshore  turbid  waters  for  bathymetry  has  been

The Random Forest model  is an  ensemble learning  technique that 
combines  multiple  decision  trees  to  make  predictions.  In  regression 
tasks, the Random Forest Regression (RFR) algorithm constructs several 
independent  decision  trees  by  randomly  sampling  data  and  features. 
Each  tree  generates  predictions,  and  the  final  regression  result  is  ob-
tained by aggregating predictions from all trees in the forest. Notably, 
the RFR model exhibits strong noise resilience and reduces the risk of 
overfitting. The RFR method is particularly advantageous in nearshore 
bathymetry  studies,  as  it  doesn’t  require  prior  knowledge  of  water 
properties  or  seabed  type,  enhancing  accuracy  in  predicting  water 
depths.  To  implement  the  RFR  model,  we  utilized  the  Python  pro-
gramming  language,  importing  the  RFR  algorithm  from  the  ‘sklearn’ 
library.  Fine-tuning  the  model  parameters  -  such  as  ‘n_estimators’,

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, there is no mention of any specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). Instead, the text focuses on the use of Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and Random Forest Regression (RFR) algorithms for bathymetry prediction.

For the CART algorithm, the authors fine-tune specific model parameters like'max\_depth','min\_samples\_leaf', and'max\_leaf\_nodes'. They select these parameter values to prevent overfitting and minimize cross-validation error in their model.

Similarly, when implementing the RFR model, they utilize the Python programming language and import the RFR algorithm from the'sklearn' library. Here too, they fine-tune model parameters such as 'n\_estimators'.

However, without further information about the training process or the specific libraries used, it is not possible to determine which optimization techniques might be involved in this deep learning pipeline.
