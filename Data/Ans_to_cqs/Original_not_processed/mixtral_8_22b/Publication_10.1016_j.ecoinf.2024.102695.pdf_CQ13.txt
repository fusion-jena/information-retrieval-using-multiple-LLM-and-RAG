During  training,  the  input  tensor  comprises  three  dimensions:  the 
batch  size,  the  number  of  model  variables,  and  the  future  prediction 
length. The dimension concerning the number of features is segmented 
by dynamically changing the slice sizes and strides, and the segmented 
tensors are folded, adding a slice dimension. Finally, by merging the first 

In the second stage of the attention calculation, the covariates are 
dynamically segmented, capturing their features at different time scales 
through multiscale attention. Specifically, for the static variables S(t),

rate of 0.05 is implemented. Throughout the training process, a learning 
rate of 0.0001 is used, with 300 training epochs and 24 data instances 
processed  per  batch.  To  prevent  data  snooping  bias,  the  dataset  is 
divided chronologically: 70% for the training set, 10% for the validation 
set, and 20% for the test set. This allocation strategy better simulates 
real-world scenarios, ensuring that the data in the validation and test 
sets differ from the training set data, thereby enhancing the generaliz-
ability of the model. All the tests are run on a Windows 11 operating 
system  using  Python  3.8,  with  specific  hardware,  including  a  laptop 
possessing a 12th-Gen Intel Core i7-12700H GPU at 2.30 GHz and an 
NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 GPU. Due to the early stopping strategy, the 
training process converges before the last epoch, preventing overfitting 
issues.

2.2. Transformer 

Since its introduction by Vaswani and others in 2017 Vaswani et al. 
(2017), the Transformer model has led to a significant revolution in the 
field of natural language processing (NLP). One of the key innovations of 
the  Transformer  is  the  self-attention  mechanism,  which  allows  the 
model  to  weigh  the  importance  of  different  parts  of  the  input  data 
differently.  The  core  self-attention  mechanism  is  represented  by  For-

Here,  Q,  K,  and  V  represent  the  query,  key,  and  value  matrices, 
respectively.  The  query  matrix  represents  the  current  word  or  token 
being processed, while the key and value matrices represent the entire 
̅̅̅̅̅
input sequence. The term 
dk
is a scaling factor used to normalize the 
dot products, where dk  is the dimensionality of the keys.

Helpful Answer:
The deep learning model uses a learning rate of 0.0001 throughout the training process. An early stopping strategy is also employed, causing the training process to converge before the last epoch and preventing potential overfitting issues. Additionally, a dropout rate of 0.05 is applied during training. The model was trained for 300 epochs with 24 data instances processed per batch. However, the context does not provide information about the specific optimizer used in this case.
