Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The paper does not provide explicit information on the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model used for vocalization tracking and classification. However, it can be inferred from the methodology section that the authors employed a diverse dataset consisting of various song variants and patterns (as shown in Table 1), which likely contributed to the robustness and applicability of their model across different scenarios. Additionally, while not explicitly mentioned, techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting might have been utilized during the training process to further enhance the model's performance and prevent overfitting. Nevertheless, without more detailed information regarding these aspects, it is difficult to definitively state the exact methods employed by the researchers to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model.
