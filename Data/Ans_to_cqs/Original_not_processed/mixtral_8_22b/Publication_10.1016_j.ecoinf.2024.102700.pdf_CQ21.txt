Although a model can never be absolutely “true,” the core of
modelling is to discover the best-fitted model that closely approaches
conceptual truth (Anderson and Burnham, 2002). This critical evalua-
tion is undertaken during the validation phase, an essential step in the
modelling process. Model processing indeed involves both calibration
and validation phases, where presence sites are divided into two inde-
pendent samples: the “training” dataset, used to build the model, and the
“testing” dataset, used to assess the model's efficiency with a subset of
data not employed for calibration (Guisan et al., 2017; Phillips et al.,
2006).

3.6. Model results

The majority of model results consisted of species spatial predictions
(n = 241, 82%), as opposed to species spatial projections (predictions
outside the study area or time used to train the model, n = 35, 12%). In
the remaining cases, no spatial predictions or projections were made,
and modelling was conducted solely for descriptive purposes (n = 35,
12%).

Helpful Answer:
After the model training phase, there are several postprocessing steps that can be taken to evaluate the performance and interpretability of the model. Some common postprocessing techniques include:

1. Saliency maps: These visualizations highlight which input features had the most significant impact on the model's output. They help identify important patterns and relationships within the data.

2. Metrics calculation: Various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC AUC, etc., can be calculated to quantify the model's performance. These metrics provide insights into how well the model generalizes to unseen data.

3. Confusion matrix: It is a table layout that allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm. Each row of the matrix represents the instances in an actual class while each column represents the instances in a predicted class.

4. Cross-validation: To ensure the robustness of the model, it can be evaluated using cross-validation techniques like k-fold cross-validation. This helps prevent overfitting and provides a more reliable estimate of the model's performance.

5. Hyperparameter tuning: After evaluating the initial model, hyperparameters can be fine-tuned to improve its performance further. Techniques like grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization can be used for this purpose.

These postprocessing steps play a crucial role in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the model, identifying areas for improvement, and ultimately making informed decisions based on the model's outputs.
