between layers, whereby a different connectivity pattern is introduced
with direct connections from all current layers to all subsequent layers as
compared to conventional CNNs. The change within the resulting
feature maps is facilitated by downsampling, whereas multiple densely
connected layers result in an even deeper DNN. Subsequently, the log-
mel spectrograms are fed as input imagery to our models. Only the
features prior to the second-to-last fully connected layer are obtained.
Finally, a modified one-dimensional attention-based fully connected
layer is attached. The output of this network contains clip- and frame-
wise outputs.

In ecology, changes in environmental conditions are often closely linked to shifts in species diversity. This
relationship can be investigated by analyzing avian vocalizations, which are robust indicators of trends in
biodiversity. Within this contribution, we explored various data augmentation techniques and deep learning
strategies for the classification of birdsong within natural soundscapes. For this purpose, we employed three
fundamental deep neural network architectures, such as vision transformers, to classify 397 different bird spe-
cies. To improve both the accuracy and generalizability of our models, we incorporated up to 19 well-established
data augmentation techniques commonly used in audio classification. This included an iterative selection process
where only augmentations that enhanced classification performance were selected. The primary augmentation
technique involved the integration of various noise samples and non-bird audio elements, which significantly

Overview of our augmentation strategies, their IDs, and related information. For DenseNet-161 and ViT-B/16, their training times are provided in minutes per epoch
for the different augmentation methods. For IDs 5 and 6, we added noise of the bird audio detection data set from the DCASE challenge (Berger et al., 2018; Himawan
et al., 2018; Liaqat et al., 2018), which is abbreviated as BAD.

For the ViT models, we adapted the approach of pretraining deep
bidirectional transformers for language understanding (BERT) by Devlin
et al. (2018) for birdsong classification. Table 3 provides an overview of
the investigated ViT models with their respective parameterizations.
ViT-S/16, for example, denotes a ViT variant of reduced complexity with
an input patch size of 16 × 16. The sequence length of the transformer
models is inversely proportional to the square of the provided patch size.
In the following, ViT-B/16 is further investigated as it strikes a balance
between general model complexity and classification performance.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention any specific dataset names like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it mentions using log-mel spectrograms as inputs to the models, suggesting that the dataset might contain audio files. Additionally, there is a reference to integrating noise samples and non-bird audio elements from the bird audio detection data set from the DCASE challenge. Therefore, while the exact dataset names are not mentioned, it appears that the study uses some form of audio dataset containing bird sounds and potentially other types of noises.
