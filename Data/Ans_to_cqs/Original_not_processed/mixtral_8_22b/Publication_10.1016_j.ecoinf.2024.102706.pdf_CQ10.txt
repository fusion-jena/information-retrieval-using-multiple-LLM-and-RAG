linear to machine learning methods, were fitted in training data to
construct regression equations. We used multiple linear regression, Enet,
SVM, RF, XGboost and LightGBM to predict canopy cover from planet
data. In general, all the mentioned models are used in machine learning
as they use algorithms to automatically learn patterns and relationships
from data to make predictions or decisions. However, we categorised

and time overhead (Ke et al., 2017). LightGBM sets itself apart from
other tree-based methods through its leaf-wise splitting approach, which
generates more intricate trees. These trees are adept at minimising loss,
leading to enhanced accuracy. The splitting process is guided by a
unique sampling method called Gradient-Based One Side Sampling
(GBOSS) (Ke et al., 2017). This method excludes data with small gra-
dients while utilising the remainder for estimating information gain and
facilitating tree growth. A collection of hyperparameters, such as lear-
ning_rate, max_depth, bagging_fraction, bagging_freq, and n_estimators,
controls the algorithm. These parameters are crucial in shaping how the
leaves are structured within the trees. The model's complexity gradually
rises as the tree grows, guided by these parameters. Simultaneously, loss
decreases, and the algorithm becomes more adept at learning from the
data, thereby improving its efficiency. Moreover, this model is suscep-

linear as a simple statistical model and the rest of the advanced machine
learning models as machine learning. The regression analyses were
conducted using Python 3.12.2, distributed by Anaconda Inc. The Scikit-
learn library (Pedregosa et al., 2011) was employed for all models except
those utilising XGboost and LightGBM. For XGboost and LightGBM
models, the respective Python libraries “xgboost” (Chen and Guestrin,
2016) and “lightgbm” (Ke et al., 2017) were utilised. Additionally, a 5-
fold cross-validation grid search strategy was implemented to tune
hyperparameters within the training dataset for all machine learning
models, leveraging functionalities inherent in their respective Python
packages. The information on hyperparameters and their optimised
value for all machine learning models are presented in Table 4. More-
over, we converted the canopy cover output percentage to a fraction
(0–1) for convenience and smoothness in the further calculation.

approach (Li et al., 2022) have also been efficiently used in satellite
image-based vegetation indices for predicting forest canopy cover. The
application of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) for semantic
segmentation has also been investigated across various types of young
vegetation cover (Cameron et al., 2022). Regarding advanced machine
learning approaches, the RF and SVM were the foremost priorities for
the researchers for canopy cover modelling from O'brien, 2007 to 2017,
as reported by Thanh Noi and Kappas (2017). Other advanced ML ap-
proaches have recently been added to similar studies (Li et al., 2022;
Zhou et al., 2020). The boosting methodology represents a synthesis of
robust prediction techniques, frequently surpassing the performance of
individual models such as single decision trees. The emergence of
refined ensemble machine learning techniques like light gradient
boosting machines
represents notable advancements

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough context to provide the exact code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The given text does not mention any specific links to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or other code repositories related to the deep learning pipeline. It only discusses the application of different machine learning models, including Enet, SVM, RF, XGBoost, and LightGBM, for predicting canopy cover from Planet data. The authors used Python 3.12.2, distributed by Anaconda Inc., along with several libraries such as Scikit-learn, xgboost, and lightgbm. They also applied a 5-fold cross-validation grid search strategy to tune hyperparameters within the training dataset for all machine learning models. However, no explicit reference to a code repository containing the deep learning pipeline is made in the provided context.
