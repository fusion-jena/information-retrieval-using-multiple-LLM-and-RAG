In this paper, we employ machine learning (ML) techniques to ex-
amine the presence–absence of seagrass meadows in the Mediterranean
Sea, and the environmental relationship among seagrasses at family
level. To achieve these, we combine data from a broad and diverse
range of databases, such as EMODnet, UNEP, and CMEMS, aiming to
determine the most appropriate variables aﬀecting the distribution of
seagrasses. We used static and temporal variables and chose the most
important ones with variable importance method by the random forest
algorithm. The temporal variables have additional features such as the
values for each month, along with the year min, max and average for
surface and seabed, totaling 217 variables. In order to perform binary
classiﬁcation we propose a method to automatically generate an ab-
sence dataset based on the presence dataset. For both binary and multi-
class classiﬁcation, 7 diﬀerent classiﬁers are compared and their results
are discussed.

%Query
Query: "Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not mention any information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if the code repository is available on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
