The  landscape  of  aquatic  environmental  monitoring  has  been 
notably transformed by recent technological advancements, particularly 
through the integration of machine learning (ML) methodologies with 
satellite data interpretation. Pioneering studies by (Cao et al., 2020; Kim 
et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2008) have marked a significant leap in refining 
the  precision  of  satellite-derived  analytical  processes,  particularly  for 
the estimation of Chl-a concentrations. Notably, (Binh et al., 2022) have 
spearheaded  the  development of  sophisticated algorithms  tailored for 
atmospheric  correction,  optimized  for  application  with  data  from  the 
Sentinel-3 satellite. Their research has yielded algorithms that demon-
strate marked efficacy in the nuanced analysis of Chl-a concentrations 
within the optically complex waters of shallow lakes.

concentrations.

Beyond obtaining satellite images with high-quality geometric and 
radiometric  information,  many  biogeophysical  parameters  have  been 
obtained from the processing of these images (Sowmya et al., 2017; Vos 
et  al.,  2019;  Yang  et  al.,  2013).  For  instance,  from  the  spatial  and 
spectral ranges provided by the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging 
Spectroradiometer)  sensor,  44  different  standard  data  products  have 
been developed and are classified into Atmosphere, Land, Cryosphere 
and  Ocean  products  (Justice  et  al.,  2002).  Moreover,  the  continuous 
development of new retrieval algorithms and the launch of new high-

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide explicit information on the specific purpose of any deep learning models used. However, it mentions the use of machine learning (ML) methodologies in conjunction with satellite data interpretation for aquatic environmental monitoring. This suggests that ML models, potentially including deep learning models, could be employed for tasks like image classification, object detection, or semantic segmentation to analyze satellite imagery and extract meaningful insights about water bodies, such as estimating chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations.
