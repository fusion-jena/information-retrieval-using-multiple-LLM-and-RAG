predictive efficiency, handle large datasets, and reduce training time. It 
is typically recommended for tabular datasets. LightGBM differs from 
other tree-based methods by implementing leaf-wise splits that create 
more  complex  trees,  which  are  more  efficient  in  reducing  loss  and 
resulting  in  higher  accuracy.  The  split  is  based  on  a  novel  sampling 
method named Gradient-Based One-Side Sampling (Ke et al., 2017), in 
which data with small gradients are excluded, and the rest are used for

2.4. Hyperparameter optimisation 

Hyperparameter  optimization  searches  for  the  best  set  of  hyper-
parameters  for  a  machine  learning  model  that  can  perform  best  on  a 
given  task.  In  many  packages,  random  or  grid  search  is  the  default 
method  for  selecting  optimal  hyperparameters  (Snoek  et  al.,  2012). 
There are many studies on the selections of optimization algorithms for 
theoretical  problems  or  engineering  applications,  in  which  various 
versions  of  Bayesian  optimizers  and  Swarm-based  algorithms  were 
compared (Stenger et al., 2019; Stenger and Dirk, 2022).

information  gain  estimation  and  tree  growth.  This  algorithm  is 
controlled by several parameter groups, including (1) Boosting param-
eters such as Max_depth, Learning_rate, and gamma, and (2) Learning 
task  parameters  such  as  loss  function  type,  evaluation  metric,  and 
number of iterations. As a result, the model becomes more complex as 
the tree grows, but more loss is reduced than level-wise, and the algo-
rithm learns faster.
