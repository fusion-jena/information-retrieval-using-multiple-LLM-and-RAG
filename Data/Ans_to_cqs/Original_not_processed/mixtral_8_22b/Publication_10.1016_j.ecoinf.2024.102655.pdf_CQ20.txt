%Query
Query: "Which hardware resources are used for training the deep learning model (e.g., GPUs, TPUs)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide information about the specific hardware resources used for training the machine learning or deep learning models. Therefore, I cannot determine which hardware resources were used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs.
