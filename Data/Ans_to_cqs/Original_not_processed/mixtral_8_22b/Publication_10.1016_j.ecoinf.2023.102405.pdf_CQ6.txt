3.2. Data pre-processing 

Data  pre-processing,  a  crucial  step  in  ensuring  the  reliability  and 
integrity of data, involves preparing and cleaning the dataset to enhance 
its  quality  and  completeness.  In  this  study,  we  employed  various 
methods to pre-process the data, making it suitable for analysis. A sig-
nificant aspect of our pre-processing involved data cleansing, where we 
diligently identified and removed any incomplete or inaccurate records 
to ensure the dataset's accuracy.

Furthermore, Chou et al. (2018) demonstrated a machine learning 
method for evaluating the water quality in reservoirs, highlighting the 
ANNs model's accuracy while expressing worries about its scalability. 
Our study presents a customized paradigm for water pollution analysis 
in aquaculture, building on previous efforts. The AODEGRU model of-
fers increased accuracy and efficiency while addressing scaling issues. 
The  use  of  deep  learning  models  for  classifying  water  pollution  in 
aquaculture is still developing, despite its potential in several domains 
(Arepalli and Naik, 2023a, 2023b, 2023c; Zhang et al., 2021; Haq and 
Harigovindan,  2022).  Current  deep  learning  models  face  difficulties 
including inconsistent data, interpretability constraints, and poor per-
formance in this setting. To address this, we provide a novel attention 
based AODEGRU model in our study, which deviates greatly from pre-

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be taken to improve the quality and usability of the data. These may include:

1. Normalization: This process scales numeric variables to a common range to prevent attributes with larger values from dominating those with smaller ones. Common techniques include min-max normalization and z-score normalization.

2. Scaling: Similar to normalization, scaling adjusts the range of independent variables or features so they have zero mean and unit variance. This helps algorithms converge more quickly towards optimal solutions during training.

3. Cleaning: Removing missing, erroneous, or irrelevant data points ensures better performance by reducing noise and improving the signal-to-noise ratio. Techniques such as imputation, outlier detection, and removal of duplicates can help clean datasets.

4. Feature engineering: Creating new features based on existing ones can reveal patterns not immediately apparent in raw data. Examples include binning continuous variables, creating interaction terms, or applying dimensionality reduction methods like PCA.

5. Encoding categorical variables: Converting non-numeric categories into numerical form allows them to be used in mathematical operations required by many machine learning algorithms. One-hot encoding and label encoding are popular approaches.

6. Splitting data: Dividing available data into separate sets for training, validation, and testing purposes enables evaluation of model performance across different subsets of data.

In the given context, the authors mention employing various methods to pre-process their data, including diligent identification and removal of incomplete or inaccurate records to ensure dataset accuracy. However, specific details regarding other preprocessing steps applied remain unclear without further information.
