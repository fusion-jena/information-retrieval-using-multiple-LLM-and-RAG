4.5. Implementation details

We have implemented our models in PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2017).
We trained 𝑀 = 5 models with batch size 𝐵 = 64 and a base learning
rate 𝛼 = 10−4. The learning rate is automatically reduced by a factor
of 0.1 when the validation loss has not improved for 15 consecutive
epochs. We apply weight decay to control the strength of the unit
Gaussian prior, with an empirically chosen magnitude of 10−3 that
is inversely proportional to the hyperparameter 𝜆 from Eq. (1). We
chose 𝛽1 = 0.9, 𝛽2 = 0.999 and 𝜖 = 10−8 as hyper-parameters for the
Adam optimizer. Each neural network was trained on a single Nvidia
RTX2080Ti GPU for ∼14 days.

5. Experimental results and discussion

In addition, we conduct a residual structure analysis of each variable
with respect to all others, i.e., we investigate how the residuals in one
variable are distributed across other variables’ value ranges. Note that
to get more stable estimates, we remove data points exceeding the 99th
percentile of the respective variable before binning. For this analysis,
we used 𝑏 = 10 bins. In Fig. 7, the column indicates the query variable,
whose ground truth values (clipped to the 99th percentile for stability)
are discretized into 𝑏 bins and define the ordering along the 𝑥-axis.
The row indicates the target variable whose residual distribution is
plotted (so, for instance, the fourth graph in the top row are the P95
residuals ordered by the corresponding pixels’ Gini coefficient). The
solid green line denotes the mean residual, the shaded area the resid-
uals’ standard deviation. Mean residuals close to zero (gray line) mean

Helpful Answer:
Answer: The text does not provide explicit information about the specific optimization technique used for selecting the hyperparameters of the model. However, it mentions that the learning rate is automatically reduced by a factor of 0.1 when the validation loss has not improved for 15 consecutive epochs. This suggests that some form of early stopping or learning rate scheduling might be employed during the training process. Additionally, the Adam optimizer is used with specific hyperparameters (β1=0.9, β2=0.999, and ϵ=10^-8), but no further details regarding their selection are mentioned. Therefore, based on the available information, it cannot be determined whether techniques such as grid search or random search were utilized for hyperparameter optimization.
