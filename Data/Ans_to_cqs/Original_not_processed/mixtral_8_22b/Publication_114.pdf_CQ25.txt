In the past few years, CNNs have been a hot topic in the ﬁeld of image classiﬁcation. Since the
publication of AlexNet [38], a number of classical CNN architectures have been proposed, including
VGG [39], GoogLeNet [40], and ResNet [41]. VGG can be considered as a deepened version of AlexNet,
which employed small convolutional kernels. GoogLeNet adopted the Inception module, which is
easy to use for network modiﬁcation. It also removed the fully connected layers to reduce the number
of parameters. Moreover, it used two auxiliary classiﬁers to accelerate network convergence. As a
consequence of the auxiliary classiﬁers, GoogLeNet is not as scalable as VGG. On the other hand, the
depth of networks is a crucial factor that inﬂuences CNN performance [39]. Richer features of diﬀerent
levels can be extracted from deep CNN layers, whereas deep models are not easy to optimize. In
many studies, batch normalization (BN) is employed to hamper vanishing/exploding gradients in deep

identity and projection shortcuts) have been introduced for residual learning. Recently, these networks have been introduced into the field of remote sensing. Our tree species classification strategy takes advantage of recent CNNs for patch-wise classification. We formulated the tree species classification as a supervised image classification problem to identify 18 tree species (17 dominant trees species and a class of “Others”). For this purpose, we adopted AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet50 implemented in Caffe for individual tree Forests 2019, 10, 1047

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model in this case is for image classification. Specifically, the authors aim to classify 18 different types of tree species using various Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures such as AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet50. These networks were originally developed for general image classification tasks but have since been applied to remote sensing applications like tree species identification. The goal is to accurately distinguish between different tree species by analyzing their visual characteristics captured in images. This task is framed as a supervised image classification problem where the model learns to predict the correct label for each input image based on labeled training data.
