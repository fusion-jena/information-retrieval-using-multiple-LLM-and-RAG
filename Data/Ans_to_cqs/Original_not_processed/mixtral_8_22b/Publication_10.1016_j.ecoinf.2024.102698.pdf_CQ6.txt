convolutional  neural  networks  (CNN),  auto  encoders  and  generative 
adversarial  networks  (GAN),  and  are  better  at  learning  sophisticated 
patterns in data but can be more computationally expensive and require 
more data to train (Endres et al., 2022).

5.4. Connectivity data 

The  synthetic  connectivity  data  was  generated  using  a  Generative 
Adversarial Network (GAN) model based on the y-data-synthetic Python 
package (YData, 2023), as this model was able to replicate the sparse-
ness  of  the  original  connectivity  matrices  best  and  performed  best  in 
terms of the utility metrics. GAN models feature a generator component, 
which learns the latent features of the data to generate a data sample, 
and  a  discriminator,  which  is  a  classification  model  which  learns  to 
classify real and synthetic data. Backpropagation from the discriminator 
updates the model parameters in the generator with the magnitude of 
the update depending on the success of the discriminator in classifying

Classical and deep learning methods are increasingly being used to 
generate synthetic data as they can perform better at emulating complex 
patterns and relationships in the original datasets, and do not require 
knowledge  of  prior  or  posterior  distributions  for  dataset  variables. 
Classical  machine  learning  methods  include  regression,  K-nearest 
neighbours,  and  support  vector  machines,  and  can  perform  better  on 
smaller data sets and take less time to train than deep learning methods. 
Deep  learning  methods  are  based  on  neural  networks,  including

5.2. Initial coral cover data 

The  initial  coral  cover  model  was  developed  using  a  TVAE  model 
from SDV, which is based on a Variational Autoencoder model. In this 
model,  an  encoder  maps  the  original  data  to  distributions  in  a  lower 
dimensional latent space. Data is then sampled from the latent space and 
transformed back to the original space using a decoder. In the learning 
phase the decoder learns by finding a transformation with minimal loss 
between the original and final data distributions. This loss is quantified 
using the evidence lower bound (ELBO), which transforms intractable 
inference  problems  into  optimisation  problems  which  can  be  solved 
using gradient methods (Xu et al., 2019). 

The model learns the spatially dependent distribution of cover for 
each of the six species of coral modelled in ADRIA. The radially sampled 
latitudes and longitudes from the synthetic site data set are then used to

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps may be required to ensure optimal performance and accuracy. These steps often involve preparing the input data so it can be effectively processed by the model. Some common preprocessing techniques include:

1. Normalization: This involves rescaling the input data to have a mean of zero and unit variance. It helps stabilize the learning process and improve convergence during optimization. Common normalization techniques include min-max normalization, z-score normalization, and batch normalization.

2. Scaling: Similar to normalization, scaling adjusts the range of input features to prevent any single feature from dominating the others due to its scale. Techniques such as Min-Max scaling, Logarithmic scaling, and Power Transformations like Box-Cox can be applied.

3. Cleaning: Removing noise, outliers, missing values, and irrelevant information from the input data improves the overall quality and reliability of the trained model. Various imputation strategies, such as replacing missing values with statistical measures (mean, median, mode) or using advanced algorithms like k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) or Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE), can be employed.

4. Encoding categorical variables: Deep learning models typically work with numerical inputs. Therefore, categorical variables need to be converted into numerical representations. One-hot encoding and label encoding are popular techniques for handling categorical variables.

5. Feature extraction/selection: Identifying relevant features and eliminating redundant ones can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the deep learning model. Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and other dimensionality reduction techniques can help achieve this goal.
