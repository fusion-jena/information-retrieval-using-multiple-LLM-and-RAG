(2) how does TensorFlow perform when it encounters species that do not exist in its 
reference library? To answer these questions, we generated 20 spectrograms per spe-
cies for this new dataset, resulting in a total of 440 spectrograms, to be subjected to 
identification using the CNN developed in Challenge 1.

3.  Challenging TensorFlow to identify all 41 species for which recordings are available 
We increased the number of species in the TensorFlow reference library to 41 by add-
ing 21 new, undescribed species (one species in the new dataset was already present 
in reference library, owing to a recent taxonomic change; Brown et al. 2015b). Then, 
we followed the same procedure as in Challenge 1, to test performance on a reference 
library that is twice as large as the original (i.e., 41 classes).

In this study, we demonstrate the efficacy of deep learning technology for reliably identi-
fying—and distinguishing among—closely-related frog species, as exemplified by single-
note call segments (Fig. 1). Given known phylogenetic relationships (Brown et al. 2015b), 
we were surprised that multiple closely-related species pairs were distinguished from one 
another perfectly (100% success). For example, species pairs P. indeprensus and P. mim-
ulus  (both  members  of  the  subgenus  Lupacolus),  P.  hazelae  and  P.  montanus  (subgenus 
Tirahanulap),  and  P.  levigatus  and  P.  insulatus  (subgenus  Lahatnanguri)  could  each  be 
predicted, by virtue of their close phylogenetic relationships, to have similar spectral (fre-
quency-related) and temporal (time-related) call properties—which they do (Fig. 1). Still, 
with  only  a  single  isolated  note  per  species,  TensorFlow  is  able  to  distinguish  them  and

Across broader taxonomic scales and phylogenetic relationships (e.g., Chan and Brown 
2017), other means (biogeographic realm, ectomorph type, classification, etc.) of restrict-
ing/limiting  candidate  species  pools  may  prove  useful  for  ‘fine-tuning’  of  TensorFlow’s 
automation of species recognition. Additional caveats for future consideration include (1) 
single notes per species and (2) sample sizes, which will be limited for rare species, those 
that occur at naturally low abundances, or taxa characterized by reduced detection proba-
bilities due to cryptic microhabitat preferences, narrow activity patterns, or seasonally-lim-
ited  reproductive  cycles  (Wells  2010).  Avenues  for  future  development  of  these  methods 
in  our  immediate  plans  include  application  to  additional  taxonomic  groups  (e.g.,  insects, 
birds), and automation of call detection from environmental sound samples as a precursor 
step to automated species identification.
