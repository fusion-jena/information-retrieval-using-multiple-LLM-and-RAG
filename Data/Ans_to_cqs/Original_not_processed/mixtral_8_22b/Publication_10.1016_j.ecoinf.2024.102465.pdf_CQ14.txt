Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Finally,  the  independent  variables  derived  are  matched  with  the 
response  variables  to  create  an  XGBoost  model.  The  SHAP  method  is 
then employed to interpret the calculations. The findings are visualized 
and analyzed through the ArcMap software.

Following 

The experiment utilized the pre-trained “ERNIE” model (https://gith 
ub.com/PaddlePaddle/LARK/tree/develop/ERNIE). 
a 
comparative  analysis  of  the  accuracy  of  Rostcm  6.0,  Simple  Bayesian 
Networks,  Long  Short-Term  Memory  networks  (LSTM),  and  Convolu-
tional  Neural  Networks  (CNN)  in  pre-tests,  the  decision  was  made  to 
employ the combined LSTM-CNN-based sentiment analysis framework 
for  determining  the  sentiment  index.  The  LSTM-CNN  model  out-
performed the other models in sentiment task analysis (Sosa, 2017). This 
model leverages the long-term memory capability of LSTM and the local 
feature  extraction  capability  of  CNN  to  process  text  data,  harnessing 
their unique strengths for enhanced model performance.

%Query
Query: "How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available from the given context to determine how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. None of the sources mentioned in the context discuss or provide details about the optimization methods used for tuning the hyperparameters of the model. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether grid search, random search, or any other optimization technique was used for this purpose.
