tionally, our technique is compared with state-of-the-art deep learning models, and from the baseline model we 
recorded  a  17.65%  increase  in  FPS,  28.55%  model  parameters  reduction,  and  50.92%  in  FLOPs  reduction. 
Furthermore, our model has a faster model loading time, which is critical for deployment in remote areas. This 
enables real-time species recognition on basic hardware, aiding conservation efforts through rapid analysis. The 
model advances deep learning in ecology by balancing efficiency with performance.

Understanding  the  computational  cost  and  parameters  of  a  single 
layer allows for precise estimation and control of the total requirements 
of our model. Computational complexity is quantified in FLOPs, calcu-
lated considering the convolutional kernel size (k2), the number of input 
Cin  and output Cout  channels, and the feature map’s height (hout) and 
width  (wout).  FPS  measure  the  model’s  speed,  encompassing  pre-
processing, inference, and non-maximum suppression speeds, providing 
an overall assessment of the model’s efficiency in real-time applications.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it can be inferred that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are likely involved due to references to techniques such as Inception-v4, dense convolutional neural networks, and deep convolutional neural networks. Additionally, there are mentions of transformers meeting convolutional neural networks for plant disease classification, suggesting a possible combination or integration of these two types of models. Nonetheless, without explicit confirmation, it cannot be definitively stated what exact type of deep learning model is employed in the pipeline.
