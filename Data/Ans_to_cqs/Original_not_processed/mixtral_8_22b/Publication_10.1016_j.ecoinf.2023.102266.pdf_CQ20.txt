where t and h represent temperature and humidity resp. 
b.Modification  of  the  update  criterion  and  application  of  ma-
chine learning: We will seek to improve our model by modifying the 
update  criterion,  maintaining  stochasticity  but  making  it  differen-
tiable. This will allow us to take advantage of machine-learning tools 
and turn our model into an intelligent cellular automaton. 
c.Optimising  the  scope:  We  will  make  changes  in  the  partitions 
used to increase the number of cells exposed in each iteration. This 
will become another adjustable parameter to improve the accuracy 
and efficiency of the model. 
d.Strategies of variance-reduction: As previously mentioned, the 
estimator  given  by  Eq.  6  may  not  have  the  minimum  variance. 
Therefore, it opens the possibility to investigate and develop new and 
more sophisticated estimators by using variance reduction strategies 
such as the importance sampling, stratified sampling, Quasi-Monte

5.1. Limitations of the model as a classification model 

Our classification model is built upon the Monte Carlo method. While 
Monte Carlo codes have achieved significant sophistication, simulations 

suffer  from  the  drawback  of  demanding  extensive  computational  re-
sources  to  attain  an  adequate  level  of  result  confidence.  Hence,  it  is 
crucial to acknowledge the associated limitations. 

Specifically, a substantial number of tests may be required. Insuffi-
cient  testing  could  lead  to  a  heightened  sampling  error,  resulting  in 
overly broad confidence intervals. Ensuring an ample number of trials is 
crucial to obtain more precise and reliable estimates.

makes our model a powerful tool for predicting real-world phenomena 
such as wildfire spreads or pest plants propagation, since we take into 
account the most important variables in the representation.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, based on general practices in machine learning and deep learning, it can be assumed that the researchers might have used either Graphical Processing Units (GPUs), Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), or both. These specialized processors are designed to handle large amounts of data and perform complex mathematical operations efficiently, making them ideal for training deep learning models. Nevertheless, without explicit information about the hardware resources used, this remains an assumption.
