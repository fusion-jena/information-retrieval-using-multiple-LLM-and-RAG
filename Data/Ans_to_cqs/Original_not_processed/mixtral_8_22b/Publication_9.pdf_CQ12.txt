Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The pipeline uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as its deep learning model. CNNs are particularly effective for image processing tasks due to their ability to automatically extract features from images through convolution operations. They have been widely adopted for various applications such as object detection, facial recognition, and image segmentation. In this case, the CNN is pre-trained on ImageNet, which contains over 14 million high-resolution images across nearly 22,000 categories. Pre-training on large datasets like ImageNet allows the model to learn useful features that can then be fine-tuned for specific tasks, improving overall performance.
