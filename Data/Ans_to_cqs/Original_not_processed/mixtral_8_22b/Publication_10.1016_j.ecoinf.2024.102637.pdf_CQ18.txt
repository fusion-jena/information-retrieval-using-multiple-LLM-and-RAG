connection  layer  and  a  dropout  layer.  The  entire  connection  layer 
multiplies the output of the previous layer by a weight matrix. It per-
forms nonlinear operations using an activation function by mapping the 
input  to  the  final  classification  result.  Simultaneously,  dropout  tech-
nology  is  used  to  prevent  overfitting  and  improve  the  generalisation 
ability of the model.

The  evaluation  indicators  of  the  experiment  mainly  included  the 
testing accuracy, inference time, precision, recall, specificity, F1 score, 
and sensitivity. In the experiment, the batch size was set to 16, and the 
learning rate was 0.00005, which was optimised using the Adam opti-
miser. For the AlexNet and SIAlex models, the number of epochs was set 
as 200. A cross-entropy loss function was adopted the cross entropy loss 
function.

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given information, it appears that the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves several key components. Firstly, the learning rate is set to 0.00005, which determines how much the weights should be adjusted with respect to the loss gradient during backpropagation. This value affects the speed and stability of convergence. Secondly, the Adam optimizer is utilized, which is an extension of stochastic gradient descent that computes adaptive learning rates for different parameters. This helps in achieving faster convergence and improved performance. Thirdly, the number of epochs is set to 200, indicating the number of times the algorithm will work through the entire training dataset. Lastly, the cross-entropy loss function is employed, which measures the difference between predicted probabilities and actual labels. By monitoring these metrics throughout the training process, one can evaluate the model's performance and make necessary adjustments if needed.
