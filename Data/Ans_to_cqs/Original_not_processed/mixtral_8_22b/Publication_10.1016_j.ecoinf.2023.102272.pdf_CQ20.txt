2.5. Model selection procedure 

The model selection procedure was performed as follows (Capinha 
et  al.,  2021;  Van  Kuppevelt  et  al.,  2020):  we  randomly  generated  5 
models for each of the four available deep-ANN architecture types (20 
models in total) and trained each one with a small subset of the training 
data  (data  partition  At)  for  4  epochs  (an  “epoch”  corresponds  to  the 
complete training dataset being passed forward and backward across the 
network  one  time;  Capinha  et  al.,  2021).  The  accuracy  of  candidate 
models,  as  provided  by  mcfly  (i.e.,  the  “proportion  of  cases  correctly 
classified”), was then compared using a left-out validation data set (data 
partition Av) and the model with the highest performance was selected 
for training on the full training data (data partition Bt; Bt = At + Av) for 
up to 30 epochs.

number of eggs (i.e., 1 to 25% and > 25 to 50%; Table 1). 

3.2. Deep learning model accuracy, predictive performance, and predictor 
importance 

Concerning the performance of the candidate models, the best vali-
dation accuracies were achieved by model 12 in all the years (accuracy 
= 0.833 ± 0.005; mean of years ± sd) (Fig. 2), a model having a Deep 
Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (DeepConvLSTM) architecture. 
Model  19,  also  with  a  DeepConvLSTM  architecture  had  high  vali-
dation accuracies too (accuracy = 0.829 ± 0.003; mean of years ± sd), 
followed  by model 14, a Convolutional Neural Network  (CNN) archi-
tecture reaching a validation accuracy of 0.821 ± 0.005 (mean of years 
± sd).

Deep learning models are complex artificial neural networks (ANN; 
Lek and Gu´egan, 1999; Olden et al., 2008) composed of a large number 
of trainable parameters (LeCun et al., 2015), which are able to perform 
complex  tasks  with  high  performance,  such  as  computer  vision  and 
natural language processing but also image and sound data classification 
(Christin et al., 2019; LeCun et al., 2015). In the context of disease vector 
abundance  prediction,  a  key  difference  of  deep  learning  models  over 
conventional  approaches  is  that  the  former  allow  using  time  series 
directly as predictors and the relevance of the features found in these 
data is evaluated by the models themselves (Capinha et al., 2021; Fawaz 
et al., 2019). This is in sharp contrast to prior research, where predictors 
were typically temporally invariant, usually corresponding to a statis-
tical summarization of the variability observed in the time series data (e.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no information provided about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The given context only discusses the model selection procedure, parameter settings, and performance metrics for different models, including deep learning models like DeepConvLSTM and CNN architectures. However, it does not mention any details regarding the hardware resources utilized during the training process.
