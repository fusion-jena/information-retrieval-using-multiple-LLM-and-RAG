bearing in mind that a poor groundwater-based response could lead to 
long-term drought and the annihilation of many aquatic and endangered 
species that rely on the GAB's groundwater resources (e.g., Barron et al., 
2011). Additionally, some innovative techniques have been employed to 
evaluate groundwater-related aspects, such as changes in groundwater 
levels across seasons (Pandey et al., 2020) and identifying the potential 
for  groundwater  availability  using  factors  such  as  geological  charac-
teristics and land use (Kumar et al., 2023), which shows the significance 
of groundwater assessment in areas (e.g., India) where water resources 
are crucial for sustainability and livelihood which directly or indirectly 
aligns with the objectives of our study (Kumar et al., 2023; Pandey et al.,

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information about the regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline to prevent overfitting. However, based on general knowledge, there are several common regularization methods used in deep learning models to prevent overfitting. These include:

1. Dropout: This method randomly drops out neurons during training, effectively making the layer thinner. It helps to reduce overfitting by preventing complex co-adaptations on training data.

2. L2 Regularization: Also known as weight decay, this method adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of all weights in the model. This encourages smaller weights, leading to simpler models that generalize better.

3. Early Stopping: This method involves monitoring the validation error while training the model. When the validation error starts increasing, it indicates that the model is starting to overfit, so we stop training.

4. Data Augmentation: This technique increases the amount of training data available by applying random transformations to existing examples, such as rotation, scaling, or flipping. This can help improve the model's ability to generalize.

5. Batch Normalization: This method normalizes the activations of each layer, reducing internal covariate shift and improving the speed and stability of the training process. It also has a slight regularizing effect, similar to dropout.
