was cropped to sizes of 1 × 1, 4 × 4, and 8 × 8 in addition to the input of 32 × 32. We
did not include the 16 × 16 size to reduce the overall size of the network. For each size,
we developed a separate network path following a simple ResNet conﬁguration, except
for the 1 × 1 which used dense layers instead of convolution layers and no residual
connections. Residual connections in CNNs were introduced by He et al. [46]. Residual
connections force the next layer in the network to learn something different from the
previous layers and have been shown to alleviate the problem of deep-learning models not
improving performance with depth. Global average or max pooling was applied at the end
of each path and dropout layers were added in an attempt to improve generalization. The
outputs from each path were concatenated and fed into a set of ﬁnal dense layers for class
prediction. All activations were Gaussian Error Linear Units (GELU), which have shown

the ensemble results. All CNNs were trained using the TensorFlow backend on a Tesla
M100 graphic processing unit.

There are numerous aspects to consider for enhancing the deep-learning classiﬁer,
speciﬁcally regarding the input image size; network conﬁguration, depth, and width; and
training strategy. In initial experimentation, several standard forms of deep-learning CNN
architectures were tested based largely on ResNet [46] and Inception [63], but these did
not perform well due to the range of image objects size/scales encountered. To account
for objects represented as a single pixel up to larger assemblages extending beyond the
32 by 32 pixel input image, the ensemble with varying input image sizes was selected.
Segmentation-based approaches were also considered as an alternative, but sufﬁcient
quality training data for segmentation was a limitation.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide the exact code repository link of the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context. However, it can be inferred that the authors might have used popular deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow, considering they explicitly mention using its backend for training their Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

To find the specific code repository, one could search for relevant papers published by the same authors or look for open-source projects related to the described methodology. Additionally, searching through platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket using keywords from the paper may lead to discovering the desired code repository.

However, without more details about the authors, publication date, or other identifying factors, providing a direct link to the code repository is currently impossible.
