Abstract: Fish is one of the most extensive distributed organisms in the world. Fish taxonomy
is an important component of biodiversity and the basis of ﬁshery resources management. The
DNA barcode based on a short sequence fragment is a valuable molecular tool for ﬁsh classiﬁcation.
However, the high dimensionality of DNA barcode sequences and the limitation of the number of
ﬁsh species make it difﬁcult to reasonably analyze the DNA sequences and correctly classify ﬁsh
from different families. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning method that fuses Elastic
Net-Stacked Autoencoder (EN-SAE) with Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), named ESK model. In
stage one, the ESK preprocesses original data from DNA barcode sequences. In stage two, EN-SAE is
used to learn the deep features and obtain the outgroup score of each ﬁsh. In stage three, KDE is
used to select a threshold based on the outgroup scores and classify ﬁsh from different families. The

As shown in Tables 4–6, the AE has the shortest running time and the poorest clas-
siﬁcation results compared with the other two models. The AE consists of only a single
Autoencoder, but only one Autoencoder cannot learn the deep features of DNA barcode se-
quences well, resulting in poor classiﬁcation results compared with deep learning methods.
Although the ESK time consumption is longer than AE, the accuracy, recall, and F1-Score
improved for all datasets, by 8.44%, 8.77%, and 4.84%, respectively.

Another considerable experimental result is that Elastic Net can improve the perfor-
mance of the proposed model. A good deep learning model usually requires abundant
data to train and analyze, while the limitations of obtaining DNA barcode sequences of ﬁsh
species from different families and the problem of overﬁtting in small datasets are more
and more serious. To solve the overﬁtting problem in training process on small datasets
is of great importance. In our study, Elastic Net is used to solve overﬁtting problem and
improve the generalization ability of the ESK model. Moreover, genetic characteristics
of species belong to high-dimensional data, which are time consuming during training.
However, directly combining a set of fully connected EN-SAE is often has little effect for
extracting useful information. Elastic Net provides sparse connection, which can also save
training time. Therefore, Elastic Net can improve the performance of proposed model.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any information about the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses various aspects such as fish classification using DNA barcodes, the use of Elastic Net-Stacked Autoencoder (EN-SAE) with Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) in the ESK model, and the comparison of the ESK model with other models like AE. However, there is no mention of any specific code repository links related to these topics or the deep learning pipeline.
