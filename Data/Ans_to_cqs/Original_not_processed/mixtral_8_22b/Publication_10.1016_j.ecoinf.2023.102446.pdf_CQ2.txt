Biogeographic systems of the Himalayas are essential parts of South 
Asia and the global water cycle and represent rich biodiversity hotspots 
(Chauhan  and  Ghosh,  2020).  Various  Himalayan  ecosystems  provide 
high-quality  tangible  and  non-tangible  products  such  as  plant  fibers, 
resins,  medicines,  fodder,  fuelwood,  and  timber  to  society  and  other 
living organisms (Pan et al., 2020a; Xu et al., 2019). Moreover, the In-
dian Himalayan region is home to nearly 50 million people, comprising 
around  173  ethnic  communities,  over  950  bird  species,  10,000  plant 
species,  300  mammal  species,  and  approximately  170  reptile  species 
(Negi et al., 2013; Rawal et al., 2013). Changes in the ecohydrology of 
the Himalayas can significantly impact the lives of millions of people 
and influence the global economy (Chakraborty et al., 2018; Cui et al., 
2021).  Therefore,  the  long-term  sustenance  of  vulnerable  Himalayan

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The information provided does not specify the type of data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the study uses half-hour temporal resolution flux tower data for all variables. This suggests that the data could be in a time series or numerical format, possibly stored in a CSV file or similar structured format. Without further details on the specific deep learning pipeline used in the research, I cannot determine the exact data format employed.
