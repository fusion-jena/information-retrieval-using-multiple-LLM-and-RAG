2.2. Deep learning in remote sensing

In the last decade, deep learning has revolutionized the way infor-
mation is extracted from images. In particular, convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) have achieved unprecedented results in areas like
image classification (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Simonyan and Zisserman,
2015; He et al., 2016), semantic segmentation (Long et al., 2015; Chen
et al., 2016), object detection (Szegedy et al., 2013; Girshick et al.,
2014; Redmon et al., 2016) and further perception tasks.

to get blurred (as information over an increasingly larger receptive
field is mixed through repeated convolutions). We visualize our model
architecture in Fig. 5 and in the following, the data flow in the model
is described in more detail.

As commonly done in deep learning, we iteratively learn the model
parameters with stochastic gradient descend, starting from a random
initialization. In each iteration, we randomly sample a batch of 𝐵 = 64
reference data patches of size 15 × 15 pixels, where a patch is only
considered for training if the center pixel is forested. We consider a
pixel forested if and only if it contains vegetation points (points with
𝐷𝑧 > 1.3 m, see Section 3.1) and also is considered forested based on
NIBIO’s Norway-wide timber volume map (Astrup et al., 2019). We use
the latter as an additional precautionary measure to avoid unnecessary
noise from non-forested areas, as we are interested in learning forest
characteristics only. For every reference data patch, we randomly pick
an optical image from the correct year and two SAR images (one as-
cending and one descending orbit) with acquisition dates near the one
of the optical image. Using SAR with both ascending and descending

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit details about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of optical images and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images with both ascending and descending orbits. This suggests that satellite imagery could be one source of raw data collection. Additionally, the mention of NIBIO's Norway-wide timber volume map implies the use of existing public datasets. Unfortunately, there is no direct mention of other potential sources such as ground surveys or sensor networks.
