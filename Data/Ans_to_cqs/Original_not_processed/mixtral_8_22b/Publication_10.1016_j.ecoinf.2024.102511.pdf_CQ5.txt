Advances in computing have led to a dramatic increase in the op-
portunities  to  use  machine  learning  for  bioacoustic  classification 
(Bianco et al., 2019; Mutanu et al., 2022; Stowell, 2022). In particular, 
use of deep neural networks show great promise for large datasets on a 
wide variety of taxa, including marine mammals (Frainer et al., 2023; 
Frasier et al., 2017; Li et al., 2020a; Rom´an Ruiz et  al., 2023; Zhong 
et al., 2020). Neural networks typically require significant sample sizes 
for all classes, although there are increasingly new tools to enhance data 
or combined disparate datasets (Dufourq et al., 2022; Nanni et al., 2020; 
Nolasco et al., 2023; Padovese et al., 2023; Shorten and Khoshgoftaar, 
2019).  There  is  a  significant  learning  curve  to  understand  how  to

development (Kahl et al., 2021; Kirsebom et al., 2022). Despite the great 
potential for deep learning methods, modification of existing machine 
learning  methods  with  a  lower  barrier  to  entry  may  be  sufficient  for 
many bioacoustic classification tasks.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific datasets used in the deep learning pipelines such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it discusses various studies and research papers related to bioacoustic classification using deep learning techniques, particularly focusing on marine mammals. The authors emphasize the potential of deep neural networks for analyzing large datasets across different species but also acknowledge the challenges associated with obtaining adequate sample sizes for all classes. They highlight recent advancements in tools designed to enhance data and combine disparate datasets. While no explicit dataset names are mentioned, these statements suggest that researchers might be working with diverse and potentially customized datasets tailored to their specific study objectives.
