The CNN model was trained using epochs and batch sizes of 10 and 
32,  respectively.  This  model  was  compiled  using  a  categorical  cross- 
entropy loss function, and the hyperparameters used in the CNN algo-
rithm  were  tuned  using  a  root  mean  square  propagation  (RMSProp) 
optimizer. The model generated in the training process was evaluated 
using stratified 10-fold cross-validation with calculated values of accu-
racy,  precision,  recall,  F1-Score,  area  under  the  curve  (AUC)  score, 
confusion  matrix,  and  model  training  time  for  binary  and  multiclass 
classifications (Forman and Scholz, 2010; Grandini et al., 2020; Ouyang 
et al., 2015). The model performance needs to be evaluated to determine 
the model’s ability to classify mosquitoes, and a good model is charac-
terized by high values of predetermined performance parameters.

The standard deviation values for each performance indicator were 
compared  to  determine  the  optimal  configuration  (Table  4).  Configu-
ration 8 was determined as the ideal parameter (number of bands: 60, 
number of frames: 40, hop length: 256, and length of the FFT window: 
1024)  owing  to  its  reduced  standard  deviation  value.  The  feature 
extraction parameters that yielded the best performance were employed 
during the feature extraction phase in the optimization process of the 
CNN  deep  learning  model.  The  model  optimization  outcomes  were 
derived  using  performance  criteria  identical  to  those  employed  to 
optimize  feature  extraction  parameters.  Fig.  9  illustrates  the  perfor-
mance evaluation of each model. Additionally, Model 1 exhibited the 
most favorable average performance outcome, with an 89.43% accuracy 
rate, 91.38% precision, 95.52% recall, and 0.816 F1-Score. The obtained

The  findings  indicate  that  Model  9  exhibits  the  highest  average 
performance,  with  an  89.30%  accuracy  rate,  87.22%  precision  rate, 
84.62% recall rate, and 0.8587 F1-Score. The obtained result surpasses 
that of the other models, indicating that Model 9, which incorporates 
dropout,  Adam’s  optimizer,  and  a  0.001  learning  rate,  is  the  most 
optimal deep-learning model. The ovitrap test employed Model 9, which 
had the highest running fold and demonstrated the most optimal per-
formance value. Figs. 14 and 15 indicate Model 9’s performance at each 
iteration of the training process.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the model was trained using epochs and batch sizes of 10 and 32, respectively. Secondly, the model was compiled using a categorical cross-entropy loss function, and the hyperparameters were tuned using a root mean square propagation (RMSProp) optimizer. Thirdly, the model was evaluated using stratified 10-fold cross-validation with calculated values of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score, area under the curve (AUC) score, confusion matrix, and model training time for binary and multiclass classifications. Lastly, the standard deviation values for each performance indicator were compared to determine the optimal configuration. Configuration 8 was determined as the ideal parameter due to its reduced standard deviation value. These measures ensured that the deep learning model had a high level of generalizability.
