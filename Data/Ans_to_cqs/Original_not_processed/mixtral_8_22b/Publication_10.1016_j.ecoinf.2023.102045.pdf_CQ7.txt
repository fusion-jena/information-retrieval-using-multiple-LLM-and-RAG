Colour gamut is of primary importance to synthesise the information 
contained in a dataset/map. Summarising, there are three main impor-
tant elements/steps when applying a colour gamut to data rendering: (i) 
the possibility of using different colour palettes in a software, (ii) the 
choice made by the map producer about one of the possible palettes, and 
(iii) how such a choice is perceived by users. From this point of view, 
awareness  of  the  uncertainty  and  potential  limitations  of  the  use  of 
colours in maps may enhance map interpretation and use. While colour- 
coding guidelines are needed, we are far from having an etiquette on this

Helpful Answer:
The article does not provide direct information regarding the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (train, test, validation). However, generally speaking, the common practice is to randomly divide the available dataset into three subsets: training set, validation set, and testing set. The training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set is employed during the training process to fine-tune hyperparameters or select models. Lastly, the testing set is utilized after the model has been trained to evaluate its performance and generalizability. Typically, the ratio for splitting the datasets can be around 60% for training, 20% for validation, and 20% for testing, but it depends on the specific requirements and size of the dataset.
