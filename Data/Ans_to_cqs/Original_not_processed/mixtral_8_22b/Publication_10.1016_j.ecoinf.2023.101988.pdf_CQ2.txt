Field work and species identification from audio was undertaken by 
author S.Fischer using a combination of observer knowledge, data from 
the  website  eBird  (eBird,  2021)  and  two  low-cost  phone  apps:  Mor-
combe and Stewart Guide to Birds of Australia (PDA Solutions, 2021) 
and Bird Song Id Australia (Sunbird Images, 2019). 

Data  were  analysed  using  the  ‘R  Stats  Package’,  version  4.0.1  in 

RStudio (R version 4.0.1 (2020-06-06)) (RStudio Team, 2020). 

Initially, paired t-tests were used to compare the overall number of 
species identified between survey types (point-count and line-transect) 
and  between  survey  methods  (observer  and  acoustic).  The  Shapiro- 
Wilk  test  found  data  met  the  assumptions  of  normality  (W  = 0.95,  p 
= 0.69).

Query: "What data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., image, audio, video, CSV)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The study uses audio data for its deep learning pipeline. This is evident from the use of bird song identification software like Bird Song Id Australia and Raven Lite, which are designed to identify birds based on their unique vocalizations. Additionally, the fieldwork involved identifying species from audio recordings using observer knowledge, data from the website eBird, and two low-cost phone apps. Furthermore, the analysis was conducted using the 'R Stats Package', which can handle various data formats but is particularly suited for statistical analysis of numerical data. However, it does not explicitly mention handling other data formats like images or videos. Therefore, we can infer that the primary data format used in this study is audio.
