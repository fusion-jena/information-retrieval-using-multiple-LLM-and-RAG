On  the  other  hand,  supervised  learning  techniques  based  on  deep 
artificial  neural  networks  (deep  learning)  are  suitable  for  identifying 
species through the automatic analysis of recordings that can come from 
a  whole  season  in  different  simultaneous  locations  (Borowiec  et  al., 
2021; Zhong et al., 2021). 

Knowing  the  potential  of  these  technologies  and  the  context  of 
climate emergency and biodiversity loss (Butt et al., 2021; Sueur et al., 
2019;  Tittensor  et  al.,  2019),  we  wonder  how  we  can  precisely  and 
exhaustively  monitor  the  diversity  and  acoustic  activity  of  birds.  In 
addition, we are interested in examining some abiotic oscillations and 
their relationship with the annual dynamics of the calls of bird species as 
an approach to the field of acoustic phenology.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no direct information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to use fixed seeds or set specific initial conditions when training models to ensure reproducibility and consistency across experiments. This helps reduce variability caused by random initialization of weights, shuffling data, or selecting batches during training. Some popular libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras provide built-in functions to control randomness and manage seed values.

To summarize, while the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, common practices include setting fixed seeds or initial conditions to maintain reproducibility and consistency across experiments.
