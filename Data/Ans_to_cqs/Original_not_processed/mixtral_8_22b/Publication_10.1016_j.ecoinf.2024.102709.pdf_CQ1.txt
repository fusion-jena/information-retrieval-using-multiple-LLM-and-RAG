split  data  with  the  highest  mAP50  (0.987)  for  the  prediction  of  our 
model.

Using this ideal split, a test was conducted using unprocessed data. 
This indicates that the test dataset appeared to be similar to the training 
data  because  it  consisted  of  images  of  the  extracted  clusters  without 
further processing. 

The  dataset  used  in  this  study  included  single-tree  point  clouds, 
images of single-trees, and *. csv containing the attributes used to pro-
duce the images, reference data, clusters of numbers (in two different 
point-thickness settings), labeled numbers, preprocessed images of the 
numbers, numbers from the best split, and tables containing the results 
of  our  digit  recognition  are  freely  available  under:  Doi:  https://doi.

on  data  collection,  feature  extraction,  and  parameter  estimation  by 
applying two major ground-based systems, stationary TLS and mobile 
laser scanning (MLS), including PLS (Bienert et al., 2021; Gollob et al., 
2020a, 2020b; Tockner et al., 2022).

Three models (Models 4, 5, and 6) were trained using our own data 
(clusters of extracted numbers), as described above, as input for training, 
whereas the other three models (Models 1, 2, and 3) were trained with 
the modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) 
dataset of handwritten digits, which can be used to train classification 
models (Deng, 2012).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Two major ground-based systems, stationary Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) and Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS), including Personal Laser Scanning (PLS), are employed for data collection in the deep learning pipeline. These systems have been applied in studies such as those by Bienert et al. (2021), Gollob et al. (2020a, 2020b), and Tockner et al. (2022). Additionally, the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset of handwritten digits is also used as a source of data for training classification models (Deng, 2012).
