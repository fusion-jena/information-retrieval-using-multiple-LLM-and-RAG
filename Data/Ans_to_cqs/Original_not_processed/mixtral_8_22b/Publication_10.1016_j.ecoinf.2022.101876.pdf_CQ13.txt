formance which is likely to continue to improve as more training data 
are  made  available  and  new  model  advancements  are  evaluated  and 
modified. We encourage prospective AI users to carry out similar eval-
uations as performed in this study to gain more relevant information on 
model performance specific to their study systems. However, we antic-
ipate the minimum detection size limits we identified are more gener-
alizable to different study systems provided the model is well trained on 
a particular object class (i.e., under ideal conditions, MegaDetector is 
likely to detect animals when they occupy at least 60px in an image) 
(Fig. 3). Other image characteristics such as complex vegetation, poor 
lighting, low image resolution, and unique camera angles are likely to 
decrease  MegaDetector's  overall  performance  (Beery  et  al.,  2018; 
Greenberg, 2020a).

images  that  need  to  be  reviewed  and  analyzed  (Norouzzadeh  et  al., 
2018; Swanson et al., 2015). These data processing tasks often represent 
a significant bottleneck in the research process from the collection of 
images  to  having  useful  information  to  answer  research  questions.  In 
response  to this challenge, many have  turned  to the field  of artificial 
intelligence (AI) to build computer vision models that leverage machine 
learning to help automate these data processing tasks (Christin et al., 
2019; Miao et al., 2019; Norouzzadeh et al., 2018; S. Schneider et al., 
2018; Tabak et al., 2019; Thomson et al., 2018; Tuia et al., 2022; V´elez 
et  al.,  2022).  With  rapid  adoption  and  advancement  of  automated 
methods,  the  time-consuming  burden  of  manually  reviewing  and  la-
beling images has been significantly reduced, ultimately reducing the 
lag between data collection and application and alleviating some of the

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide any explicit information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. It primarily focuses on discussing the performance evaluation of a pre-trained model called MegaDetector, developed by Microsoft AI for Earth, for detecting wildlife in camera trap images from Arctic Alaska. The text discusses various aspects like true positive rates, recall, and other performance measures but does not delve into the details of the underlying deep learning architecture or its hyperparameters. Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
