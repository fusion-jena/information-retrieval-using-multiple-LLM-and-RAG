2.4. Segmentation and classiﬁcation

Most importantly, scale sensitivity implies that if one had used
only one scale (e.g., the scale of one available dataset), the conclu-
sion would have depended strongly on which scale was used. This
result argues for more frequent and rigorous investigation of scale
sensitivity. We hope that the ArcGIS Python scripts developed for

this research project might make this kind of scale sensitivity test
more accessible for other analysts. Another solution is to compare
the results with other datasets, even qualitatively, to check for spuri-
ous scale-dependent relationships. In our case, we were able to refer
to dendrochronological work done on the same system (Schriver and
Sherriff, 2015), but in historical ecology more generally these data
sources can include historical land surveys and travel journals
(Grossinger, 2012).

4.2. Opportunities of the modeling approach

Segmentation and classiﬁcation strategies in eCognition are still
rapidly evolving; methods and rule sets for automatically selecting
segmentation parameters are under development (Dragut et al.,
2010, 2014; Martha et al., 2012), but there is not yet consensus on
best practices. Better classiﬁcations, which could then better capture
the process of interest, may be possible as these tools develop fur-
ther. Machine learning techniques are being brought together with

segmentation to more automatically classify images (Nancy Thomas,
personal communication). This set of approaches with historical im-
agery could become more powerful as new methods are developed.
We do caution that even with machine learning, some supervision
and validation using aerial photo interpretation techniques or
other data sources are still necessary (Sexton et al., 2015).

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses segmentation and classification strategies in eCognition, which is a software tool used for image analysis and object-based image processing. The text mentions that segmentation and classification strategies are rapidly evolving, and methods for automatically selecting segmentation parameters are under development. It also notes that machine learning techniques are being combined with segmentation to more automatically classify images.

Regarding data bias, the text suggests that better classifications may be possible as these tools develop further, implying that improved accuracy in image classification could help reduce data bias. Additionally, the text emphasizes the importance of supervision and validation using aerial photo interpretation techniques or other data sources when applying machine learning techniques. This indicates that incorporating diverse data sources and manual verification processes can help mitigate potential biases introduced by automated algorithms.

While the context does not explicitly mention stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, these techniques are commonly employed to address data bias in deep learning pipelines. Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing subsets while maintaining the original distribution of classes within each subset. Oversampling increases the representation of minority classes in the dataset, while undersampling reduces the representation of majority classes. Diverse data collection aims to gather a wide range of examples from different sources to ensure that the model generalizes well across various scenarios. These techniques can be applied during the preprocessing stage of the deep learning pipeline to minimize data bias and improve overall performance.
