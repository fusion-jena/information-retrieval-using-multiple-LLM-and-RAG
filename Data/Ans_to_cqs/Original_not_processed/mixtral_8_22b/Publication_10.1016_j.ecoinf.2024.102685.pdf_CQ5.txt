Including seasonal images as input  variables  for machine  learning 
classification  models  was  found  as  the  most  effective  approach  to 
maximize  the  classification  accuracy  in  many  environments,  such  as 
forests (Pratic`o et al., 2021; Zhu and Liu, 2014), grasslands (Esch et al., 
2014) and Mediterranean rural areas (Senf et al., 2015). Previous studies 
analyzing the intra-annual variations in seagrass meadows distribution 
suggested that these communities display large fluctuations in biomass 
and species cover over seasons (Fauzan et al., 2021; Menu et al., 2021; 
Roelfsema et al., 2013; Zoffoli et al., 2020). Therefore, the inclusion of 
the seasonality might greatly improve the accuracy of seagrass in clas-
sification models. This translates into a probable reduction of the clas-
sification noise due to other environmental factors (e.g., algae blooms, 
water turbidity) (Acquavita et al., 2015; Christia et al., 2018; LÃ¸nborg

Seagrass meadows play a vital role for lagoon ecosystems and their biota, sustaining multiple ecosystem services. 
Their distribution and functioning are closely tied to the environmental pressures induced by global changes. 
Long-term monitoring of seagrass species and communities is, hence, important to depict their response to past 
and  future  scenarios.  The  availability  of  long  term  open-access  satellite  data  offers  a  new  remote  sensing 
perspective for monitoring seagrass communities dynamics in shallow waters, especially when combined with 
machine learning algorithms. In this study, seasonal multispectral images (from 1999 to 2019) were collected 
from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper and 8 Operational Land Imager satellites to map the seagrass meadows, at the 
community and species levels, within the vast Grado and Marano lagoon (Northeast Italy) using a Random Forest

Helpful Answer:

The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. However, it can be inferred from the context that the study uses seasonal multispectral images from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper and 8 Operational Land Imager satellites to classify seagrass meadows in the Grado and Marano lagoon in Northeast Italy. These images were collected between 1999 and 2019. It appears that the authors use a random forest algorithm for the classification task. Unfortunately, there is no mention of any standard benchmark datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in this study.
