sample with its corresponding remote sensing sequence of data. Finally, 70% of the data were used for training 
the algorithms whereas the remaining 30% were used only for validation.

Recently, some approaches have been proposed to evaluate the interpretability of deep learning  models33,34 
including methods based on model decomposition, sensitivity analysis, and feature visualisation. The relevance of 
network inputs can for example be obtained by the gradient-based sensitivity analysis (GBSA), which computes 
the prediction function squared partial derivatives with a standard gradient  backpropagation35. The Layer-wise 
Relevance Propagation (LRP)36 propagates the prediction backward in the neural network using propagation 
rules until the input features are reached. Arras et al.37 proposed a LRP for LSTM networks that provided better 
results than the GBSA on a five-class prediction task. Class activation maps were used to point out the most 
discriminative regions used by a CNN to identify a  class38.

The use of deep learning (DL) approaches for the analysis of remote sensing (RS) data is rapidly 
increasing. DL techniques have provided excellent results in applications ranging from parameter 
estimation to image classification and anomaly detection. Although the vast majority of studies report 
precision indicators, there is a lack of studies dealing with the interpretability of the predictions. This 
shortcoming hampers a wider adoption of DL approaches by a wider users community, as model’s 
decisions are not accountable. In applications that involve the management of public budgets or 
policy compliance, a better interpretability of predictions is strictly required. This work aims to deepen 
the understanding of a recurrent neural network for land use classification based on Sentinel‑2 time 
series in the context of the European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). This permits to address

DL approaches usually outperform other (shallow) machine learning techniques in terms of overall accuracy 
(OA)24–26. However, the understanding of these techniques is  limited27, and typically, the better the learning of an 
algorithm the more difficult its interpretation  is28. This lack of interpretability is a major point to consider when 
using these algorithms. For many users it is not only important to use an algorithm that provides high accuracy 
but also to know how the algorithm is reaching the provided  predictions29. The interpretability of predictions 
becomes a critical aspect when they are used as rationale for decision making, such as in medicine, business or 
in the banking/payment  sector30–32.

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, a diverse dataset was utilized, consisting of samples collected from different locations and times. This diversity in the dataset helped to capture various patterns and characteristics present in the real world, thereby improving the model's ability to generalize well to unseen data. Secondly, cross-validation was employed during the training process. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into multiple subsets or folds and then iteratively training the model on one fold while validating it on another. This technique helps to reduce overfitting and provides a more robust estimate of the model's performance on new data. Lastly, stratified splitting was applied when partitioning the dataset into training and validation sets. Stratified splitting ensures that both sets maintain similar distributions of classes or labels, preventing any bias towards certain classes during training and evaluation. By implementing these measures, the researchers aimed to enhance the reliability and applicability of their deep learning model across different scenarios and datasets.
