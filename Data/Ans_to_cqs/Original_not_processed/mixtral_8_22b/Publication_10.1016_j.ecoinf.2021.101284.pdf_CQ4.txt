Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

of districts within the NUTS3 units. 

In summary, it should be emphasized that both the environmental 
data, i.e. the information related to population and geographic condi-
tions, and the air pollution data, are of the Big Data type. Its volume is in 
the order of terabytes in size.

This section presents the tools and statistical models used to analyse 
the dependencies in this article. The first tool that was helpful in pre- 
processing  the  data  was  standardization  (Williamson  and  Piattoeva, 
2019). This is a kind of normalization that allows changing the scope of 
individual variables so that they are presented in a similar numerical 
range. It should be emphasized here that this transformation preserves 
the distance relations between individual data. Thus, suppose one have a 
set of records xj ∈ ℝn, j = 1, …, m where n is the number of features. For 
each element j = 1, …, m, the variables are transformed as follows:

As described above, only 8 of the describing variables were adopted 
for the next tested model. In the M5 model, the alternative YNG_PCT was

where: xj, i
given  data,  mi  is  the  arithmetic  mean  of  the  i  feature  and  stdi  is  the 
standard deviation of this feature. It is worth emphasizing here that the 
standardization of data is independent for each of the considered fea-
tures i = 1, …, n. The data standardization procedure is carried out in 
most  tasks  that  use  tools  from  the  domain  of  statistical  analysis  and 
machine learning. Standardization is not recommended for data that we 
know are not normally distributed. The factors analysed in this study 
were  normalized  according  to  the  formula  (1),  therefore,  they  had 
values in a similar range and could be compared with each other.

Query: "What are the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Fliping, Roating, Scaling)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any information about the application of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, or scaling in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer based on the given context. However, these techniques are commonly used in image classification problems to increase the amount of training data by applying various transformations to existing images.
