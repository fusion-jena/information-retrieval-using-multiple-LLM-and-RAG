During the DeepLabV3+ model training process, feeding large-size 
images directly to the network may lead to memory overflow. There-
fore, it is necessary to cut all remote sensing images and semantic labels 
of land cover classes into a series of regular image blocks for input. To 
maximize the sample size and maintain consistency with the cropping 
approach in the model prediction stage, we set the cropping size to 32 ×
32  pixels  with  a  redundancy  rate  of  0.5.  In  continuing,  70%  of  the 
dataset  was  used  for  training  and  the  remaining  for  validation.  The 
training set was enhanced by: (i) Flipping the images and labels along 
the X or Y axis; (ii) Exchanging between multiple image channels while 
the  labels remain unchanged; (iii)  Randomly rotating  the images and 
◦
labels by 90
; and (iv) randomly adding noise to the 
images  while  maintaining  the  labels  unchanged  (Ye  et  al.,  2022).

Messina, G., Pe˜na, J.M., Vizzari, M., Modica, G., 2020. A comparison of UAV and

match in land cover remains unclear. This issue becomes highlighted in 
the case of the study area with a high distribution of plough and water, 
where frequent fluctuations in crops and water levels have caused sig-
nificant changes among the images taken in various periods. Finally, this 
study  was somehow limited  to the evaluation  of the DeepLabV3+ al-
gorithm in terms of selecting deep learning models. In the near future, it 
is also recommended to strengthen the horizontal comparative study of 
various  deep  learning  models  for  remote  sensing  image  classification 
and to search for more suitable classification methodologies for this task.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information on handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it mentions several strategies employed during the training process of the DeepLabV3+ model to enhance the dataset and prevent overfitting. These techniques can be considered as ways to introduce controlled randomness and variability into the training data. They include:

1. Image flipping: Images and labels are flipped along the X or Y axes, which introduces new perspectives and patterns for the model to learn from.
2. Channel exchange: Multiple image channels are exchanged while keeping the labels unchanged. This helps the model generalize better by learning features independent of their specific channel representation.
3. Rotation: Images and labels are randomly rotated by 90 degrees. This augmentation technique allows the model to recognize objects regardless of their orientation.
4. Noise addition: Random noise is added to the images while maintaining the labels unchanged. This strategy helps improve the model's robustness against noisy inputs and enhances its ability to focus on relevant features.

These methods contribute to reducing the impact of randomness in the deep learning pipeline by increasing the diversity and complexity of the training data. Although they do not directly address issues related to random seed values, these strategies help mitigate the effects of randomness by promoting model generalization and preventing overfitting.
