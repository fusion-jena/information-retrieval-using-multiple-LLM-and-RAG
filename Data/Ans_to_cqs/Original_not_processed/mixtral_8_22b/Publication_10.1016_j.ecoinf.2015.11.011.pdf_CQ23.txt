Most importantly, scale sensitivity implies that if one had used
only one scale (e.g., the scale of one available dataset), the conclu-
sion would have depended strongly on which scale was used. This
result argues for more frequent and rigorous investigation of scale
sensitivity. We hope that the ArcGIS Python scripts developed for

this research project might make this kind of scale sensitivity test
more accessible for other analysts. Another solution is to compare
the results with other datasets, even qualitatively, to check for spuri-
ous scale-dependent relationships. In our case, we were able to refer
to dendrochronological work done on the same system (Schriver and
Sherriff, 2015), but in historical ecology more generally these data
sources can include historical land surveys and travel journals
(Grossinger, 2012).

Segmentation and classiﬁcation strategies in eCognition are still
rapidly evolving; methods and rule sets for automatically selecting
segmentation parameters are under development (Dragut et al.,
2010, 2014; Martha et al., 2012), but there is not yet consensus on
best practices. Better classiﬁcations, which could then better capture
the process of interest, may be possible as these tools develop fur-
ther. Machine learning techniques are being brought together with

segmentation to more automatically classify images (Nancy Thomas,
personal communication). This set of approaches with historical im-
agery could become more powerful as new methods are developed.
We do caution that even with machine learning, some supervision
and validation using aerial photo interpretation techniques or
other data sources are still necessary (Sexton et al., 2015).

(Mixed GAM Computation Vehicle; Wood, 2006). The GAM was ideal
for these data for two reasons: 1) a Markovian random ﬁeld (MRF)
basis was available for the smoothing function, which is designed for
use with polygons with potentially irregular sizes (which some of the
cells have after applying the forest-only analysis mask); and 2) mgcv
had extensions for non-normal response variables. The quasi-binomial
family was an appropriate choice, as it allowed for overdispersion. The
response variable was then framed as a number of 1-m by 1-m cells
within the 20-m by 20-m cell of the DEM which were classiﬁed as
‘woody cover’ as binomial successes, and those classiﬁed as ‘herbaceous
cover’ as binomial failures.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, such as using diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it mentions several aspects related to improving the robustness and reliability of the models and analyses performed.

Firstly, the authors emphasize the importance of investigating scale sensitivity, arguing for more frequent and rigorous testing of scale sensitivity. They also mention developing ArcGIS Python scripts to facilitate this type of scale sensitivity tests for other analysts. Additionally, they suggest comparing results with other datasets, including historical land surveys and travel journals, to validate findings and avoid spurious scale-dependent relationships.

Secondly, the authors discuss segmentation and classification strategies in eCognition, highlighting ongoing developments in methodologies and rule sets for automatically selecting segmentation parameters. They express optimism that better classifications will be achievable as these tools continue to advance. Furthermore, they note the integration of machine learning techniques with image segmentation to improve automatic image classification. Despite this progress, they stress the necessity of human supervision and validation using aerial photo interpretation techniques or additional data sources.

Lastly, the authors describe their use of Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) for analyzing their data due to its suitability for dealing with polygons of varying sizes and non-normal response variables. They employed a Markovian Random Field basis for the smoothing function and chose the quasi-binomial family to account for overdispersion.

In summary, while the text does not explicitly detail specific measures like diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, it highlights various efforts aimed at enhancing the robustness and reliability of the models and analyses conducted. These include investigating scale sensitivity, utilizing advanced segmentation and classification strategies, integrating machine learning techniques, and employing suitable statistical models for handling complex datasets.
