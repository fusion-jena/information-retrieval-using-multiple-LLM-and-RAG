Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

bilityâ€”differences between recording devices. By reducing device bias, 
we enhance the applicability of these indices for broader comparative 
analyses, potentially extending their use to fields like machine learning 
and deep learning, which require consistent feature spaces across studies 
regardless of the recording device used (Purwins et al., 2019).

3.  Differences gains among recording devices: The signal amplitude of a 
microphone depends on the sound pressure that the microphone may 
capture. This depends on the manufacturing materials and its level of 
degradation.  Significant  differences  in  gain  are  expected  from  mi-
crophones of different brands or after severe outdoor use. 

2.3. Proposed preprocessing approach 

Fig. 2 shows the proposed preprocessing methodology to tackle the 

abovementioned issues. It consists of three steps:

Considering these limitations, our study employs specific metrics (K- 
S  and  DKL)  to  quantify  the  effectiveness  of  bias  reduction  strategies 
within EAI. These tools enable us to evaluate the variability reduction 

when addressing biases introduced by recording devices. Although these 
metrics efficiently demonstrate improvements, it is crucial to recognize 
that the observed reduction in variability does not always translate into 
complete statistical significance. This challenge highlights the intricate 
nature of ecoacoustic data analyses and underscores the importance of 
further  exploring  methodologies  that  comprehensively  address  these 
complex issues.

Our proof-of-principle example demonstrates the effectiveness of our 
comprehensive  processing  pipeline  in  mitigating  device  biases  in  site 
comparisons  using  ecoacoustic  indices  (EAI).  Although  EAIs  are  not 
typically  used  for  site  comparisons  due  to  contradictory  correlations 
with biological variables across different study sites (Bradfer-Lawrence 
et  al.,  2019a),  our  methodology  addresses  one  of  the  previously  un-
considered sources of variability that could explain these contradictions, 
such  as  differences  between  recording  devices.  By  eliminating  device 
bias, we expand the applicability of EAI to emerging fields like machine 
learning  and  deep  learning,  which  require  consistent  feature  spaces 
regardless of the recording device used.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text provides information about a study that aims to reduce bias in ecoacoustic indices (EAIs) caused by differences between recording devices. However, it does not explicitly mention any specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Instead, the study proposes a preprocessing methodology consisting of three steps to tackle the mentioned issues related to device bias. Unfortunately, the details of this methodology are not included in the given context. Therefore, based on the provided information, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
