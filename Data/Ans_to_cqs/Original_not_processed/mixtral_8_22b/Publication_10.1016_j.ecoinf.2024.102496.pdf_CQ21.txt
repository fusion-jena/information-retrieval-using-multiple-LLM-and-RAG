filter, WQ inlets, weekly street sweeping, wet pond, and wetland detention. Bars with gray outlines and white filling represent BMPs for which efficiency data was 
not available.

Fig.  6  provides  an  overview  of  the  tool,  highlighting  its  various 
features, which are identified by corresponding numbers in the figure. 
These  features  include  1)  zoom  in  and  out,  default  extent,  and  my 
location;  2)  search  bar  to  find  a  place  or  address;  3)  environmental 
justice indices alongside total pollutant loads before and after BMP; 4) 
map legend; 5); filtering metrics based on specific values; 6) addition of 
online  data;  7)  selection  of  different  basemaps;  and  8)  selection  of  a 
specific region, print map and share the tool. Using the drop-down menu 
labeled as #3 in Fig. 6, users can access pollutant loads pre- and post- 
BMP  implementation,  as  well  as  EJ  metrics  and  indices.  All  data  are 
color-coded based on quantile mapping, which means there are equal 
numbers of watersheds or census tracts within each class, representing 
different  tiers  of  pollution  or  social  vulnerability.  Pollutant  loads  are

pollutant  loads  intersecting  with  disadvantaged  communities.  Lastly, 
the  tool  offers  post-BMP  analysis  for  nutrient  pollution  levels,

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the postprocessing steps involved after model training such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, confusion matrix etc. However, generally speaking, some common postprocessing steps after model training could be:

* Model Evaluation: This involves calculating various evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC AUC etc. to assess the performance of the trained model.

* Hyperparameter Tuning: This involves fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the model to improve its performance. Common techniques used for this purpose are Grid Search, Random Search, Bayesian Optimization etc.

* Visualizing Results: This involves visualizing the results obtained from the trained model using tools like confusion matrices, ROC curves, Precision-Recall curves etc. These visualizations help in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the model.

* Explainability Techniques: This involves using techniques like LIME, SHAP, GradCAM etc. to explain the predictions made by the model. These techniques help in building trust in the model and making it more interpretable.
