We  adapted  an  instance  segmentation  algorithm  based  on  Mask- 
RCNN.  Mask-RCNN,  a  two  stage  detector  model,  was  chosen  because 
of  its  demonstrated  superiority  in  various  segmentation  applications 
(Jiao  et  al.,  2019;  Soviany  and  Ionescu,  2018),  underlining  its  effec-
tiveness in accurately segmenting bacteria within complex image (Naets 
et al., 2021). However, it is important to note that there are other models 
that can be utilized for this purpose as well, such as You Only Look Once 
(Yolo) model (Yadav et al., 2022). We anticipate that the faster one stage 
models like Yolo can be integrated into the whole system to enable a real 
time  segmentation  with  microbe  species  on  the  chip.  We  started  the 
training of the algorithm on one of the datasets (images of bacteria from 
the Swedish soil) and then extended its recognition ability to the other

The three sampling locations exhibit noticeable differences in bac-
terial abundance and morphology, which can be attributed to various 
experimental conditions and strong differences in image quality. These 
data were utilized as a validation set to assess the efficacy of our deep 
learning recognition model in accurately capturing and quantifying such 
differences, thereby demonstrating its proof of concept. The sampling 
sites  were  thus  chosen  to  provide  large  differences  in  environmental 
conditions to demonstrate the versatility of the approach; it should be 
noted that our objective did not encompass a comparison of the effects of 
different experimental conditions on bacterial morphology.

makes it possible to obtain a more direct microbial community charac-
terization  and  in  the  future  create  big  databases  on  bacterial 
morphology. Cell morphology is not predictable from molecular data-
sets, and combining morphological data from soil chips with classical 
molecular  biodiversity  datasets  will  enable  a  deeper  functional  inter-
pretation of bacterial communities. We demonstrated the applicability 
of an interdisciplinary approach combining microfluidics and AI in mi-
crobial ecology research using a widely used model, Mask R-CNN. The 
synergy of AI and microfluidics allows biologists to design and fabricate 
complex  micro-structures,  visualize  the  activities  of  migrated  active 
microbes, and analyze characteristics of individual or communities in an 
automated manner. The versatility of the algorithm to adapt to different 
microscopy  settings  including  a  portable  field  microscope  allows  to

bacterial  abundance  and  morphology  for  work  carried  out  on  micro-
fluidic platforms. Statistical data of distribution and morphology of live 
microbe in a soil-analogue environment gained from such methods is 
valuable  for  community  characterization  since  phenotypic  traits  of 
living organisms are as important as the commonly used cell biochem-
ical  constituents.  Enormous  efforts  have  been  done  to  promote  deep 
learning-based methods for researchers without coding expertise (Berg 
et al., 2019; G´omez-de Mariscal et al., 2021; In´es et al., 2019; Midtvedt 
et al., 2021; Ouyang et al., 2019; Sys et al., 2022; von Chamier et al., 
2021). Our work showcases that the approach works under significantly 
different conditions, allows quantifying bacterial populations, and de-
tects differences among bacterial communities from different locations.

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model used in this study is instance segmentation. This model is based on Mask-RCNN, a two-stage detector model known for its effectiveness in accurately segmenting objects within complex images. The authors chose Mask-RCNN due to its demonstrated superiority in various segmentation applications. They trained the algorithm initially on one dataset (images of bacteria from Swedish soil) and later expanded its recognition capabilities to include other datasets. The goal was to develop a model capable of accurately capturing and quantifying differences in bacterial abundance and morphology across different environments, thereby demonstrating its proof of concept. Additionally, the authors mention considering integrating faster one-stage models like YOLO into their system for real-time segmentation with microbe species on the chip.
