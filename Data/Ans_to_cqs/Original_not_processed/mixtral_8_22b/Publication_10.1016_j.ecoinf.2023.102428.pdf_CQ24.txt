differentiation as a feedforward propagation (FP) algorithm to train the 
neural networks by employing supervised learning based on stochastic 
gradient descent (SGD). Backward pass always improves the efficiency 
of MLP neural networks. Generally, MLP consists of three main layers of 
nodes: an input layer, an output layer, and one or more hidden layers in- 
between them (Kumar and Agrawal, 2023). Apart from the input layer,

vances,  several  LULC  simulation  models,  including  the  MLP  neural 
network-Markov chain (MLPnn-MC) model (Nasiri et al., 2019; Vass and 
Elofsson, 2016; Vinayak et al., 2020), SD-CLUE-S model (Liang et al., 
2017), Logistic-CA-MC model (Guan et al., 2019), FLUS model (Liang 
et al., 2018), SLEUTH model (Kumar and Agrawal, 2022), PLUS model 
(Tao  et  al.,  2023)  and  others,  integrated  with  carbon  mapping  and 
valuation model, i.e., InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Ser-
vices  and  Tradeoffs),  have  emerged  as  reliable  techniques  providing 
promising results for stakeholders and decision-makers.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some common strategies used in machine learning and deep learning include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using ensemble methods to reduce variance caused by random initialization, and applying regularization techniques like dropout to prevent overfitting due to randomness.
