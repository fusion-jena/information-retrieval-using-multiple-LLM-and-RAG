The model was trained over 200 epochs using the Adam optimizer 
(cid:0) 5. The batch size 
(Kingma and Ba, 2015), with a weight decay of 1 × 10
was fixed at 16, and the loss function was updated as per Eq. (6). The 
learning rate was initially set at 0.001 and was subsequently reduced by 
a  factor  of  0.1  in  a  step-wise  manner  whenever  the  validation  loss 
remained  constant  for  five  epochs.  The  minimum  learning  rate  was 
(cid:0) 5. The hyper-parameter λ in Eq. (4) was set to 0.8, 
established at 1 × 10
Mk  in Eq. (5) was defined as 2k+1(k = 1, 2, …K), and β in Eq. (6) was set 
to 0.4.

their  convolutional  kernels  and  pooling  layers.  Regarding  this  issue, 
Zhang  et  al.  (2019)  incorporated  a  long  short-term  memory  (LSTM) 
network to develop a 3DCNN-LSTM model as a classifier, making the 
network more sensitive to the temporal changes in birdsong informa-
tion. It is important to note that the use of RNNs such as the CRNN model 
requires  more  computing  resources  for  training,  and  performance 
improvement is not always guaranteed. Another common approach to 
addressing  the  limitations  of  CNNs  is  to  introduce  attention  mecha-
nisms.  For  example,  Soundception  (Sevilla  and  Glotin,  2017)  was 
developed  by  introducing  time  and  time-frequency  attention  mecha-
nisms to Inception V4; the resulting model achieved first place in the 
BirdCLEF  2017  Competition.  Fu  et  al.  (2023)  proposed  an  improved 
ACGAN model named DR-ACGAN based on the residual structure and an

from data, thereby reducing the need for manual feature selection; such 
networks  have  demonstrated  considerable  potential.  The  mainstream 
deep  learning  approach  for  sound  recognition  involves  mapping  the 
sound amplitude onto a 2-D mel-scale spectrogram and using a modified 
network  architecture  adapted  from  advanced  image  recognition  for 
automatic  feature  learning.  The  effectiveness  of  convolutional  neural 
networks  with  residual  connections  in  recognizing  bird  sounds  was 
demonstrated  in  the  annual  LifeCLEF  Bird  Identification  Challenge 
(BirdCLEF) competition (Kahl et al., 2021a, 2022, 2023).

propagation. Then, the specific hierarchical features Fh,k(⋅) are obtained 
and  transmitted  to  the  classification  module.  This  module  consists  of 
parallel  K  fully-connected  layers  followed  by  a  softmax  activation

S = {̂s1, ̂s2, ⋯, ̂sK},  repre-
function,  which  generates  predicted  scores 
senting the probability of each class within the K classification levels. 
Finally, a path correction scheme is utilized to generate the predictive 
labels ̂y. Our primary objective is to learn the model parameters, namely 
θ = {θa, θb, θc}, through end-to-end training to enable the model for bird 
sound identification. More specific technical details are elaborated on in 
the subsequent sections.

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, it is mentioned that the model was trained using the Adam optimizer. The Adam optimizer is a popular choice for stochastic gradient descent methods used in machine learning models. It combines the advantages of two other extensions of stochastic gradient descent, Adagrad and RMSProp, to provide an optimization algorithm that can handle sparse gradients on noisy problems. The learning rate was initially set at 0.001 and was subsequently reduced by a factor of 0.1 in a step-wise manner whenever the validation loss remained constant for five epochs. The minimum learning rate was established at 1 × 10^-5. These settings indicate that the learning rate scheduler was implemented to adjust the learning rate during training dynamically. Additionally, weight decay was also employed as a regularization technique to prevent overfitting.
