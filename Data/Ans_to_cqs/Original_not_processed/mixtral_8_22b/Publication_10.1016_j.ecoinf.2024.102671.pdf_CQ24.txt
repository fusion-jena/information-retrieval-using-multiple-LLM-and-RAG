Helpful Answer:
To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, several strategies can be employed. One common approach is using fixed seeds for reproducibility. By setting a specific seed value, the results generated from different runs will remain consistent. Another strategy involves averaging multiple models trained with different initializations or data shuffling. This technique, known as ensemble learning, helps reduce the impact of any single model's random initialization. Additionally, techniques like dropout regularization and batch normalization can also help mitigate the effects of randomness during training. Dropout randomly drops out neurons during training, preventing overfitting and improving generalization. Batch normalization standardizes inputs to layers, reducing internal covariate shift and accelerating convergence. Lastly, it's important to note that some level of randomness may still exist due to factors such as hardware variations and non-deterministic algorithms used in certain operations. However, these strategies can significantly improve consistency and reliability in deep learning pipelines.
