In the past few years, CNNs have been a hot topic in the ﬁeld of image classiﬁcation. Since the
publication of AlexNet [38], a number of classical CNN architectures have been proposed, including
VGG [39], GoogLeNet [40], and ResNet [41]. VGG can be considered as a deepened version of AlexNet,
which employed small convolutional kernels. GoogLeNet adopted the Inception module, which is
easy to use for network modiﬁcation. It also removed the fully connected layers to reduce the number
of parameters. Moreover, it used two auxiliary classiﬁers to accelerate network convergence. As a
consequence of the auxiliary classiﬁers, GoogLeNet is not as scalable as VGG. On the other hand, the
depth of networks is a crucial factor that inﬂuences CNN performance [39]. Richer features of diﬀerent
levels can be extracted from deep CNN layers, whereas deep models are not easy to optimize. In
many studies, batch normalization (BN) is employed to hamper vanishing/exploding gradients in deep

kernels. GoogLeNet adopted the Inception module, which is easy to use for network modification. It also removed the fully connected layers to reduce the number of parameters. Moreover, it used two auxiliary classifiers to accelerate network convergence. As a consequence of the auxiliary classifiers, GoogLeNet is not as scalable as VGG. On the other hand, the depth of networks is a crucial factor that influences CNN performance [39]. Richer features of different levels can be extracted from deep CNN layers, whereas deep models are not easy to optimize. In many studies, batch normalization (BN) is employed to hamper vanishing/exploding gradients in deep CNNs. However, the accuracy often becomes saturated and then degrades (degradation problem) in the training phase, even though BN layers are used. ResNet [41] addressed the degradation problem by using shallow layers and identity mapping for network construction. Two shortcuts (i.e., identity and projection shortcuts) have been

identity and projection shortcuts) have been introduced for residual learning. Recently, these networks have been introduced into the field of remote sensing. Our tree species classification strategy takes advantage of recent CNNs for patch-wise classification. We formulated the tree species classification as a supervised image classification problem to identify 18 tree species (17 dominant trees species and a class of “Others”). For this purpose, we adopted AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet50 implemented in Caffe for individual tree Forests 2019, 10, 1047

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The pipeline uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for tree species classification. Specifically, the study adopts AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet50 implemented in Caffe for individual tree identification. These networks have been popular in the field of image classification since the publication of AlexNet. The choice of CNNs is suitable due to their effectiveness in handling spatial data such as images.

Unhelpful Answer:
The pipeline does not use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers for tree species classification. Instead, it employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), specifically AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet50.
