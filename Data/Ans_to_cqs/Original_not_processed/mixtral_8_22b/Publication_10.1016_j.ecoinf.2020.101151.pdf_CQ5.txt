for the FWI and FFMC data layers with a spatial resolution of 1 × 1 km.
The nine-cell approach, the results of which are shown in this paper, led
to slightly better prediction results of the variants, likely because it
smoothed existing data inaccuracies within single grid cells.

With the exception of the FFMC / FWI values, which are daily up-
dated and delivered to the server, the data layers used for the IFDS
prototype are of static nature. All datasets are available at a spatial
resolution of 100 × 100 m, leading to matrices of 5731 × 2951 cells to
cover all of Austria. We converted the FFMC / FWI calculations from
the original 1 × 1 km grid to the 100 × 100 m spatial resolution used in
the IFDS prototype. For this purpose, the Python framework “Numpy” is
used, which was developed especially for large arrays/matrices. For the
provision of data layers and calculated indices, “Mapserver”, a free web
map tool for converting raw map data into retrievable tiles, was used.
The experimental operation of the IFDS prototype started in spring
2018 and is an ongoing research project. Several improvements have
already been implemented on the platform, e.g. a calendar feature, a
function to generate new weighting variants, the georeferenced display

weather, human influence, lightning induced fires, vegetation, aspect
and slope. The data layers implemented in our IFDS were generated
during different projects and in different years (Appendix A). Therefore,
the respective forest fire records used differ in terms of accuracy and
time span. For the IFDS validation, forest fire data of 2018 and 2019
were used.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the data layers used for the IFDS prototype include meteorological data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation, and solar radiation. Additionally, other factors like human influence, lightning-induced fires, vegetation, aspect, and slope are also considered. These data layers are derived from various sources and projects, but no specific dataset names are mentioned.
