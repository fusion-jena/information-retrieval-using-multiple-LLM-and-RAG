neglecting  this  task  can  lead  to  devastating  consequences,  including 
undesirable  events  like  harm  to  properties,  displacement  of  commu-
nities, and loss of human lives (Kalantar et al., 2020). Many data-driven 
LSM  techniques  have  been  developed  recently  thanks  to  advances  in 
remote sensing and geospatial analysis technologies (Reichenbach et al., 
2018; Shano et al., 2020). Among the most used methods are weights-of- 
evidence  (Moazzam  et  al.,  2020;  Vakhshoori  and  Zare,  2018;  Van 
Westen  et  al.,  2003;  Zhang  et  al.,  2023b),  frequency  ratio  (F.  Huang 
et al., 2022; Nakileza and Nedala, 2020; Nohani et al., 2019), weighted 
overlay  (Imtiaz  et  al.,  2022),  analytical  hierarchy  process  (Wu  et  al., 
2016),  and  evidential  belief  function  (Nohani  et  al.,  2019).  LSM  and 
other  remote  sensing  and  geospatial  applications  have  also  benefited

pending data availability, we will investigate the scalability and trans-
ferability  of  the  ensemble  techniques  and  compare  their  performance 
with  deep  learning  models  such  as  Convolutional  Neural  Networks 
(CNN) and Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN). This 
broader  investigation  would  provide  a  more  robust  understanding  of 
landslide vulnerability across the entire and offer valuable insights into 
the effectiveness of advanced ML approaches in LSM.

Huang et al., 2022; Y. Huang and Zhao, 2018; Shahzad et al., 2022; Xing 
et al., 2021). These models are flexible and adaptable systems that can 
manage diverse types of data and scenarios for LSM. Another type of 
MLM that has been explored for LSM is the Artificial Neural Network 
(ANN), especially in the Radial Basis Function (RBF) (W. Chen et al., 
2018; Ngo et al., 2021) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) configuration 
(Adnan  et  al.,  2020;  Chang  et  al.,  2022;  Z.  Zhao  et  al.,  2022).  These 
models can learn from data and adjust their parameters to improve their 
performance.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does reference various machine learning models and techniques commonly used in landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM), which often rely on geospatial data. Some common sources of geospatial data include satellite imagery, LiDAR data, and other remotely sensed data. Additionally, ground truth data may be collected through field surveys or using sensor networks. Publicly available datasets, such as those provided by government agencies or research institutions, may also be used. In summary, while the exact methods for collecting raw data are not specified in the given context, some potential sources of data for use in a deep learning pipeline for LSM could include satellite imagery, LiDAR data, field surveys, sensor networks, and publicly available datasets.
