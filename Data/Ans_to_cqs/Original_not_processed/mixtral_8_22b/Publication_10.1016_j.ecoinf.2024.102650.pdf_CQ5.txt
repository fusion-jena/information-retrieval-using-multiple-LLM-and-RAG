Machine learning methods require text preprocessing, such as word 
segmentation and stop word removal, followed by the selection of a text 
portion to manually annotate emotions for accuracy verification. Among 
machine  learning  models,  the  enhanced  representation  through 
knowledge  integration  (ERNIE)  model  achieved  significant  results  in 
previous studies by learning prior semantic relationships and word order 
features from massive amounts of data (Sun et al., 2019). The ERNIE 
model  directly  models  prior  semantic  knowledge  units,  thereby 
enhancing model semantic representation (Wang et al., 2020). Test re-
sults for various Chinese tasks showed that the model performed better 
than  the  bidirectional  encoder  representations  from  the  transformer 
model proposed by Google AI (Sun et al., 2019). At the International 
Workshop on Semantic Evaluation 2020, the ERNIE model earned first 
place  for  a  mixed-language  emotional  analysis  task.  Detailed  de-

Tweets are usually short texts with such characteristics as sparsity, 
real-time nature, and irregularity. These features increase the difficulty 
of text processing (Edwards et al., 2022; Garg and Kumar, 2018; Sun 
et al., 2021) and require data cleaning to support subsequent analyses. 
Data cleaning includes text filtering and Chinese text segmentation. The 
former was used to filter out unnecessary symbols and noise, such as 
notes, advertisements, useless numbers, punctuation marks, stop words, 
and repeated texts on websites. User-generated text that deviated from 
the  theme  was  also  filtered  out  through  a  manual  review.  The  latter 
involved dividing the natural language composed of Chinese text into 
meaningful  words,  which  is  a  key  technology  in  text  analyses  (Tian 
et al., 2021). We used Pythonâ€™s Jieba Library for Chinese text segmen-
tation and a lexical analysis and included location, time, and organiza-
tional nouns.

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific dataset used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the final available data elements totaled 6802. This could potentially refer to the size or number of samples in the dataset used for training the machine learning models. Unfortunately, without more information about the source or nature of these data elements, we cannot definitively identify them as belonging to a known dataset like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
