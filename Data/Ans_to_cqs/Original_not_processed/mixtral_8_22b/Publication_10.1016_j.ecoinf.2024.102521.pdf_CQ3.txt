dataset  (Fig.  4,  legend),  it  encompasses  only  a  tiny  fraction  of  insect 
diversity.  Thus,  STARdbi  provides  a  built-in  mechanism  for  users  to 
manually  label  some  of  their  images,  and  trigger  retraining.  These 
innovative features are not available in existing datasets of annotated 
insect  images  (e.g.,  Ciampi  et  al.,  2023;  Wang  et  al.,  2020).  We  also 
acknowledge the rapid development pace of general AI-based methods 
for  image  processing,  with  the  speed  and  accuracy  of  the  algorithms 
steadily improving. Thus, we aim to periodically replace the networks 
that are currently implemented in STARdbi by new state-of-the-art ones 
as better algorithms are released. With this in mind, we don’t focus on 
STARdbi’s performance compared to other AI software for insect iden-
tification. In fact, we welcome suggestions for improved models from

2.5. Automatic insect classification 

Automatic,  AI-based,  insect  classification  is  not  yet  part  of  the 
STARdbi pipeline. Users may download images and their box annota-
tions (as Comma Separated Values, csv, files), train models locally, and 
apply them to unlabeled data. The programs that we applied to this end 
(case study 1 in the Results section) are available in the STARdbi web- 
site as a Google Colab notebook. We also welcome collaborations with 
other researchers, in which our team will take the role of designing and 
trouble-shooting classification models to meet specific needs. 

The available programs for the generation of classification models 

include:

2.  A  web-based  pipeline  for  image  deposition,  minimal  annotation, 
visualization, and retrieval. The pipeline is already operational, and 
is described in the Methods section below.  

3.  An authorization system that assigns differential view/annotation/ 
edit  permissions  to  users,  regarding  different  sets  of  images  (e.g., 
permission to modify images in a specific project vs. in the whole 
database). The first and major role of this system is preserving data 
integrity. Yet the policy that it applies has important implications for 
its  usability  as  a  public  resource.  The  details  of  the  authorization 
system are presented in the Methods section. The controversial topic 
of policy is suspended to the Discussion.

Helpful Answer:

The text does not provide explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that users can manually label some of their images and trigger retraining. This suggests that one possible technique could be manual annotation, where users draw bounding boxes around objects or perform instance segmentation to outline individual instances within an image. Additionally, the mention of downloadable images and their box annotations (Comma Separated Values, csv, files) implies that bounding box annotation might be employed. Nevertheless, without further clarification, it remains uncertain whether these are the only annotation techniques utilized in the deep learning pipeline.
