The root trimmed mean squared prediction error (RTMSPE) is uti-
lized to select the appropriate values for the tuning parameters τ and ϕ, 
removing  the  impact  of  heterogeneous  observations.  The  RTMSPE  is 
defined as follows:

such as eBird, Pl@ntNet, iNaturalist, and Observation.org, available on 
the  Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), are accessible  for 
use. However, the analysis of PO data from such sources requires special 
attention, compared to PA data obtained through designed surveys, due 
to the potential for issues such as species identification errors and local 
over-aggregation of records.

To simultaneously carry out shrinkage estimation and variable se-
lection,  we  employ  the  penalized  loss  function  with  an  L1  penalty 
(Tibshirani, 1996), defined as follows:

where lΞ  is the loss function minimized by solving the estimating eqs. (2)

and (3), and is given by eq. (10) in Appendix A. We set ϕ0
ϕ (k ∕= 0, ϕ ≥ 0) as a constant tuning parameter. The loss function has no 
penalties for the intercept parameter β0 of the intensity function and the 
coefficient  paramter  α  for  the  detection  probability  model.  We  can 
compute the L1  penalized estimates using the gradient ascent method 
(Goeman,  2010).  The  detailed  computation  algorithm  is  provided  in 
Appendix C.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the provided context, it does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses various environmental variables related to ecology, such as land area, forest area, water area, elevation, standard deviation of elevation, laplacian slope, geological category, annual average radiation, organic carbon, cation exchange capacity, pH of soil, temperature, precipitation, evapotranspiration amount, etc. These variables suggest that the data might be in a structured format like CSV or similar tabular form. Additionally, there is a reference to citizen science platforms like eBird, Pl@ntNet, iNaturalist, and Observation.org, which could imply the use of images or other multimedia data formats. Nevertheless, without explicit information about the data format used in the deep learning pipeline, one cannot definitively state the exact data format being utilized.
