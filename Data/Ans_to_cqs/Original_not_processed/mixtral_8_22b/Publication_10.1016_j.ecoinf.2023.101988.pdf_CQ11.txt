%Query
Query: "What is the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information regarding the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. However, based on the references cited in the text, it can be assumed that the authors may have used publicly available datasets from various sources, including those found in the listed repositories. To find the exact dataset used by the authors, one would need to refer to their original paper or contact them directly for more information.
