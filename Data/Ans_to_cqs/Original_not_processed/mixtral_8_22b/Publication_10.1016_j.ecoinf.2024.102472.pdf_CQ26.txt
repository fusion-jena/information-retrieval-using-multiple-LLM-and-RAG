adjusted to optimize the model (Jafarzadeh et al., 2021). Whereas node- 
size  determines  the  smallest  number  of  observations  in  a  tree  subset 
terminal node, and default value is always at 1 (Jafarzadeh et al., 2021; 
Pham et al., 2018). Gradient boosting iteration is a repetition process of 
increasing  or  decreasing  weights  in  a  training  datasets  (Huang  et  al., 
2022). All hyperparameters were tuned with a grid search method. 

2.5.1. Artificial neural networks

Extreme  Gradient  boosting  (XGBoost)  is  known  for  its  speed  and 
accurate  prediction  process,  especially  when  dealing  with  large  and 
complex  datasets.  Its  power  lies  in  its  ability  to  minimize  bias  error 
within  and  between  spectral  predictors.  XGBoost  builds  sequential 
models to reduce errors of predictors that could potentially lower the 
estimation accuracy (Huang et al., 2022; Tamiminia et al., 2022; Zhang 
et al., 2019b). In each sequent model, the weights of all weak learners 
(predictors)  are  increased  (or  boosted)  and  the  weights  for  strong 
learners in the model are decreased (Huang et al., 2022; Pham et al., 
2021). This process is repeated until the error is reduced, and the data is 
correctly  predicted.  Furthermore,  XGB  permits  model  tuning  through 
various  hyper-parameters,  namely:  ntree,  tree  node  size  and  gradient 
boosting iteration. Ntree builds a multitude of decision trees and select

During  the  MLPNN  training  phase,  initial  arbitrary  connection 
weights were assigned. Inputs were forward-fed from the input to the 
hidden  layer.  Hidden  neurons  multiplied  inputs  by  weights,  summed 
products,  and  processed  sums  through  a  transfer  function.  Results 
propagated  to  the  output  layer,  with  output  values  compared  to  ex-
pected  values  for  error  computation.  Iterative  error  back-propagation 
adjusted  connection  weights  until  reaching  a  target  minimal  error. 
The network then accurately estimated carbon stocks for both training 
and new input data without training data. This required tests to deter-
mine optimal learning rate (0.01), momentum (0.18), and training it-
erations  (500).  The  trained  network  was  subsequently  used  for  feed- 
forward predictions on continuous spatial data.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no direct mention of specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, some relevant information can be found regarding the use of Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) which is known for minimizing bias error within and between spectral predictors. XGBoost builds sequential models to reduce errors of predictors that could potentially lower estimation accuracy. It does this by increasing the weights of all weak learners (predictors) and decreasing the weights for strong learners in the model. This process is repeated until the error is reduced, and the data is correctly predicted. Additionally, XGBoost allows for model tuning through various hyperparameters including ntree, tree node size, and gradient boosting iteration. These parameters help improve the performance of the model and may indirectly contribute to addressing data bias.
