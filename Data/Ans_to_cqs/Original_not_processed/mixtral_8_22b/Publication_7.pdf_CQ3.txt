Image representations extracted from deep neural networks,
trained on large datasets such as ImageNet [9] and ﬁne tuned
on domain speciﬁc datasets, have shown state-of-art perfor-
mance in numerous image classiﬁcation problems [14]. The
activation vectors of the ﬁrst fully connected layer of a pre-
trained VGGnet [24] are employed as feature representations
in our work. The weights of this deep network are ﬁne tuned
using the Benthoz15 dataset [23] which consists of expert-
annotated and geo-referenced marine images from Australian
seas.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) [9], also known as
deep networks, are an important class of machine learning
algorithms applicable, among others, to numerous computer
vision problems. Deep CNNs, in particular, are composed of
multiple layers of processing involving linear as well as non-
linear operators. To solve a particular task, the parameters of
networks are learned in an end-to-end manner. Image represen-
tations extracted from deep CNNs trained on a large dataset
such as ImageNet [10] have shown to produce a promising
performance for diverse classiﬁcation and recognition tasks
[11], [12], [13], [14] and [15]. Spatial pyramid pooling (SPP)
[16] and Multi-scale Orderless Pooling (MOP) [17] schemes
have made CNNs independent of the input image size and
robust for diverse classiﬁcation and recognition applications.
In this paper, we propose a computer vision and deep
learning based framework for the automatic annotation of

information [7]. An accurate automatic annotation of marine
imagery would enable automatic counting, sizing and move-
ment tracking of speciﬁc marine organisms. Computer vision
and machine learning based techniques [8] have the potential
to automate the annotation of marine images and also reduce
the time consumed in manual processing. The accuracy of
these techniques depends on the availability of high quality
expertly annotated training and testing data.

Helpful Answer:
The authors do not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in their deep learning pipeline. However, they do refer to using expert-annotated and geo-referenced marine images from the Benthoz15 dataset [23] for fine-tuning the weights of a pre-trained VGGnet [24]. This suggests that some form of supervised learning is being applied, where the ground truth labels or annotations are likely provided by human experts. Without further information, it cannot be determined whether these annotations involve bounding boxes, instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, or other forms of labeling.
