siderations made earlier, a Bayesian Deep Learning model, if properly
configured and trained, can return satisfactory results even with limited
datasets, which is the scenario studied in the present work.

Within the context of phenology prediction, applications of Deep
Learning incorporating Bayesian concepts are still sparse, if not entirely
absent. A work with a similar theme, in which Bayesian deep learning is
used to assess the health of a plant and detect possible diseases, is
(Hern´andez and L´opez, 2020). Here, the authors use Monte Carlo
Dropout (Gal and Ghahramani, 2016), a technique known to be a good
approximation of Bayesian inference, to estimate the uncertainty of a
Convolutional Neural Network. Despite achieving satisfactory results,
this work relies on the use of pre-trained models. While this can be seen

Use the provided pieces of context to answer the query in less than 400 words. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

%Query
Query: "What is the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. It seems like the context only provides references to various studies related to smart farming, IoT in agriculture, deep learning, and Bayesian concepts but does not provide any specific details regarding the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the data repository link from the given context.
