available in Supplementary text S1). This methodology enhances pre-
dictive  accuracy  by  combining  forecasts  from  multiple  statistical 
models, mitigating the uncertainties and biases inherent in relying on a 
single modelling method (Araújo and New, 2007; Hysen et al., 2022). 
Five  statistical  models  were  used  in  this  ensemble  framework, 
including  generalized  linear  models  (GLM),  maximum  entropy  (Max-
Ent),  random  forest  (RF),  generalized  boosting  model  (GBM),  and 
multivariate  adaptive  regression  lines  (MARS).  To  facilitate  model 
training, we employed a 3:1 train-test split for the occurrence points. 
Additionally, following Barbet-Massin et al. (2012), we generated 1000 
random  pseudo-absence  points  (five  times  the  number  of  occurrence 
points per species) across the study area. These pseudo-absence points 
are crucial for model execution and provide a reference for areas that are 
unlikely to be inhabited by the target species.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not directly address the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, it mentions the use of five statistical models in an ensemble framework to enhance predictive accuracy and mitigate uncertainties and biases inherent in relying on a single modeling method. While these techniques do not specifically refer to regularization methods in deep learning pipelines, they can still contribute to reducing overfitting by incorporating diverse perspectives and minimizing reliance on any one particular approach.

The mentioned statistical models include Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Maximum Entropy (Max-Ent), Random Forest (RF), Generalized Boosting Model (GBM), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS). Each of these models has its own strengths and weaknesses, but when combined in an ensemble framework, they can help improve overall performance and reduce overfitting. Additionally, the context discusses using a 3:1 train-test split for occurrence points and generating 1000 random pseudo-absence points to facilitate model training and provide a reference for unlikely inhabitation areas. These practices also aid in preventing overfitting by ensuring a balanced dataset and providing a more comprehensive representation of potential habitats.
