as a sum of two terms: binary cross-entropy and Dice coefﬁcient-related loss of the three predicted
masks [50–52]. We used the optimizer RMSprop (unpublished, adaptive learning rate method proposed
by Geoff Hinton here http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~tijmen/csc321/slides/lecture_slides_lec6.pdf)
with an initial learning rate of 0.0001. We trained our network for 300 epochs with 24 images per batch.

inventory of species is the ‘Reserva Biológica do Jaru’, which is a part of the same forest patch but
not included in the GeoEye-1 images. The list of species encountered in the reserve can be found

Identifying ecological mechanisms that govern natural plant distribution and range is
a fundamental question of ecology [1]. The answers to this long-standing challenge are particularly

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The article does not provide information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that they used a modified version of the U-Net architecture for semantic segmentation and trained it using the optimizer RMSprop with an initial learning rate of 0.0001. They also mention that they trained their network for 300 epochs with 24 images per batch. However, there is no reference to any specific code repository or platform where the code for this implementation is publicly available.
