Deep  learning  is  a  relatively  recent  development  in  ML.  Its 
main tool, the deep neural network (DNN), builds upon Artificial 
Neural Networks (ANNs) which were already conceived in the 
middle of the last century. Essentially, “deep learning” refers to a 
set of techniques that allow the training of larger (more neurons) 
and  deeper  (more  layers)  ANNs  (Nielsen,  2015).  These  high 
capacity  networks  became  possible  due  to  the  development  of 
improved  algorithms  for  optimizing  connection  weights  [e.g., 
stochastic  gradient  descent  (Rumelhart  et  al.,  1986)]  and  a 
steep  increase  in  available  computing  power  and  training  data 
(Goodfellow et al., 2016). While these improvements may seem 
only gradual, current DNNs not only outperform their simpler 
ANN  ancestors,  but  frequently  also  perform  better  than  other 
ML approaches in standardized tests of prediction accuracy (e.g.,

Addressing  current  global  challenges  such  as  biodiversity  loss,  global  change,  and 
increasing  demands  for  ecosystem  services  requires  improved  ecological  prediction. 
Recent increases in data availability, process understanding, and computing power are 
fostering quantitative approaches in ecology. However, flexible methodological frameworks 
are needed to utilize these developments towards improved ecological prediction. Deep 
learning  is  a  rapidly  evolving  branch  of  machine  learning,  yet  has  received  only  little 
attention in ecology to date. It refers to the training of deep neural networks (DNNs), i.e. 
artificial neural networks consisting of many layers and a large number of neurons. We 
here  provide  a  reproducible  example  (including  code  and  data)  of  designing,  training, 
and  applying  DNNs  for  ecological  prediction.  Using  bark  beetle  outbreaks  in  conifer-

The hyper-parameters evaluated iteratively were network capacity 
(number of layers and neurons per layer), applied regularization 
techniques, as well as the used loss function and optimizer. The 
training of the individual candidate networks was stopped when 
the accuracy of the network on the test dataset did not increase 
further.  The  thus  determined  network  architecture  was  also 
used for Experiment 2 (Abadi et al., 2016). All experiments and 
predictions  were  conducted  using  the  TensorFlow  framework 
and  run  on  a  desktop  PC  with  an  Intel  QuadCore  CPU  (Intel 
i5-6600) and equipped with an NVidia GTX 1070 GPU.

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the model was trained on a diverse dataset, which likely included various features related to bark beetle outbreaks in conifers. This diversity in the dataset helps prevent overfitting and improves the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data. Secondly, the hyper-parameters of the model were evaluated iteratively, including network capacity (number of layers and neurons per layer), applied regularization techniques, the used loss function, and optimizer. Regularization techniques help reduce overfitting by adding constraints to the model during training, while the choice of loss function and optimizer can significantly impact the performance of the model. Lastly, the training of each candidate network was stopped when the accuracy of the network on the test dataset did not improve further. This early stopping technique prevents overfitting by halting the training process before it starts fitting noise in the training data. Although the text does not explicitly mention cross-validation or stratified splitting, these techniques could have been employed as part of the evaluation process to further enhance the model's generalizability.
