workflow  can  compensate  for  some  of  these  biases  –  through  data 
classification  and  spatio-temporal  aggregation  –  mainly  when  large 
input datasets are used. Generally, it is worth noting that all big data 
processing methods are approximate, but they can discover general and 
valuable knowledge if the approximation is tolerated within the appli-
cation context (Coro, 2020b).

multi-resolution  decision  approach  is  usually  effective  in  these  cases 
(Magliozzi  et  al.,  2019).  Another  aspect  of  our  approach  is  that  the 
statistical analysis has a higher precision when vessel data are abundant, 
and the analysis resolution is suited to the study area. Thus, the user 
should provide statistically significant data and use the most appropriate 
spatial resolution for the analysis. These considerations relate to general 
issues  with FAIR  data and  big data processing: easy access  to a  large 
amount of data comes at the expense of a low guarantee of data quality 
and completeness. The precision of our workflow's output depends on (i) 
the  completeness  of  the  input  vessel  data,  (ii)  the  update  rate  of  the 
GRSF, (iii) the completeness of the OBIS data in the selected time range, 
and (iv) the suitability of the selected spatial resolution for the analysis. 
However, our first and second case studies have demonstrated that our

principles’  practicability.  It  is  open-source  (Supplementary  material) 
and was integrated with the DataMiner Cloud computing platform of the 
D4Science e-Infrastructure (Coro et al., 2017), which allows accessing 
the mentioned knowledge sources on-the-fly during processing (Candela 
et al., 2016; Coro et al., 2015a). Data FAIRness is facilitated through the 
indexing of these resources in the D4Science catalogue (Assante et al., 
2019b), which can be accessed by all processes via the Catalogue Services 
for the Web (CSW) standard of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC, 
2020). Geospatial data are offered as standarised NetCDF files available 
on  a  distributed  ISO/OGC  compliant  Spatial  Data  Infrastructure

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not explicitly mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, there are several aspects discussed in the text that could contribute to the robustness and applicability of such models.

Firstly, the context mentions using large input datasets for data classification and spatio-temporal aggregation. This practice can help improve the performance and generalization capabilities of deep learning models by exposing them to diverse examples and patterns.

Secondly, the multi-resolution decision approach is highlighted as being effective in certain scenarios. While this may not directly refer to a deep learning model, employing multiple resolutions or scales in training a model could potentially enhance its ability to capture different features and relationships present in the data.

Thirdly, the importance of providing statistically significant data and selecting the most appropriate spatial resolution for analysis is emphasized. Ensuring high-quality input data and choosing suitable parameters for modeling can positively impact the overall performance and generalizability of a deep learning model.

Lastly, the implementation of a FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) approach suggests that the workflow aims to facilitate reproducibility and transparency, which are essential factors for building reliable and generalizable models.

Overall, while no explicit measures like cross-validation or stratified splitting are mentioned in the context, the practices described above indicate efforts towards ensuring the generalizability of the applied techniques, including potential deep learning models.
