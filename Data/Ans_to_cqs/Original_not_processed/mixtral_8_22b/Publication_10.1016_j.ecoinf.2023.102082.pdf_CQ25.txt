separately in 30 forest plots situated in the northern Italian Alps, in 100 plots in the forested area of Traunstein 
(Germany) and successively in all the 130 plots through a cross-validation analysis. Forest density information 
was also included as influencing factor in a multiple regression analysis. Our results show that the GEDI CHMs 
can  be  used  to  assess  biodiversity  patterns  in  forest  ecosystems  through  the  estimation  of  the  HH  that  is 
correlated  to  the  tree  species  diversity.  However,  the  results  also  indicate  that  this  method  is  influenced  by 
different factors including the GEDI CHMs dataset of choice and their related spatial resolution, the heteroge-
neity indices used to calculate the HH and the forest density. Our finding suggest that GEDI LIDAR data can be a

extreme  CHM  values  (increasing  the  Rao’s  Q  and  CV  values  in  our 
study). Lang10m, having a finer spatial resolution (derived fusing GEDI 
data and Sentinel-2 images using a deep learning algorithm), is more 
spatially  precise  and,  in  our  areas  characterized  by  a  generally  high 
density (Table 2) and HH which does not reach extremely high values,

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the given context is to create a high-resolution Canopy Height Model (CHM) of the Earth at a 10-meter resolution. This is achieved by utilizing Sentinel-2 optical images and applying a deep learning approach using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model was tested separately in various forest plots located in the northern Italian Alps and Germany, and then applied to all the plots through a cross-validation analysis. The goal of creating this high-resolution CHM is to assess biodiversity patterns in forest ecosystems by estimating the horizontal heterogeneity (HH) correlated to tree species diversity.
