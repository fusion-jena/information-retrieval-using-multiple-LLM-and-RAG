The EF network architecture consisted of three convolutional layers (Conv) including the
Rectiﬁed Linear Unit (ReLU), two Max-pooling layers (MaxPool), and two Fully Connected layers
(FC), with a softmax layer at the end with two outputs, corresponding to “deforestation” and
“no-deforestation” classes. The ﬁlter and output size of each layer are summarized in Table 3.

contained in 10% of the image. Hence, instead of looking at the entire image, the analyst would focus
on 10% of it, reducing human work by 90%. As expected, as Recall increased, the area to be observed
also increased, but, in this particular case, CSVM (with three layers) presented the best results (see
Figure 13a). For Recall beyond 96%, the threshold values were very close to zero, most pixels tended
to be classiﬁed as deforestation, and the area to be observed went up to 100%, as can be observed in
Figure 13b.
