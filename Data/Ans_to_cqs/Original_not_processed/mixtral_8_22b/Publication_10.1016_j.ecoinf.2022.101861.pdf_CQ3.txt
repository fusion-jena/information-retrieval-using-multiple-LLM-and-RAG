Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it is mentioned that the BirdNET app uses machine learning algorithms to enable citizen scientists to participate in global bird research. This suggests that some form of data labeling or annotation may be involved in training these models. Additionally, the paper by LeBien et al. discusses a pipeline for identifying bird and frog species in tropical soundscapes using a convolutional neural network, but again no explicit details on the type of data annotation technique used are given. Therefore, based on the information available, we cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipelines discussed in the provided context.
