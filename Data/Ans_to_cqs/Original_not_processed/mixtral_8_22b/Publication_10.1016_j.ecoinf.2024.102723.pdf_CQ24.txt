Deep Neural Networks are architectures that present remarkable
advantages and can potentially map every possible function, but they
are often affected by many issues such as overfitting. The main draw-
back of standard Deep Learning is that Neural Networks compute single
values of their parameters and therefore they are incapable of correctly
assessing the uncertainty related to the data (aleatoric uncertainty) or to
the model itself (epistemic uncertainty); in fact they often produce
overly confident decisions about the correct class, prediction or action to
take, even if the sample is very far from the training data we provided.
The purpose of Bayesian Neural Networks is to use probability theory
to express uncertainty, especially in the prediction phase. The advantage
is clear in areas where decision making plays a fundamental role. To be
more specific, a Probabilistic Neural Network handles the aleatoric
uncertainty by placing a probability distribution (whose parameters can

5. Conclusions

The ongoing need for advances in Deep Learning techniques applied
to agriculture is driving research towards the development of cost-
effective models, robust to noise and variability, facilitating real-time
decision-making (Attri et al., 2023). Current frameworks are hindered
by their reliance on large datasets, limited interpretability, and chal-
lenges in generalization; they are deployed on personal computers,
which are inefficient and energy-intensive for practical applications.
Therefore, it is essential for emerging smart farming–oT initiatives in
agriculture to be supported by a new perspective in artificial intelligence
research (Abdar et al., 2021; Attri et al., 2023; Gupta et al., 2022).

Fig. 4. Neural networks architecture consists of: an input layer with two nodes, one for DOY and the other for GDD; two hidden layers with 32 nodes each, Dense
layers with Monte Carlo Dropout in the MCD approach, DenseVariational layers in the VBI approach; an output layer which is the combination of a Dense layer with
two nodes and a DistributionLambda layer that maps the values of these two nodes into the parameters of a Gaussian distribution, used to predict the BBCH value.

Helpful Answer:
In the context of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, there are several strategies that can be employed. One common source of randomness is the initialization of weights in neural networks, which can significantly impact the performance of the model. To mitigate this, researchers often employ techniques like Xavier/Glorot initialization or He initialization, which aim to initialize weights in a way that preserves the variance of activations across layers. Another strategy is to use ensemble methods, where multiple models are trained independently with different initializations and then combined to make predictions. This can help reduce the variance caused by any individual initialization. Additionally, techniques like dropout regularization can also introduce controlled randomness during training, helping prevent overfitting and improving generalization. However, it should be noted that while these strategies can help manage randomness, they do not eliminate it entirely. Ultimately, understanding the sources of randomness and how they affect the model's performance is crucial for developing effective strategies to handle them.
