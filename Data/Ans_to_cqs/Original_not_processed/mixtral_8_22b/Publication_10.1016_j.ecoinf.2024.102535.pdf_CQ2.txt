Motivated  by  the  scenario  described  above,  this  work  investigates 
deep learning-based techniques for substratum classification in hydro-
thermal vent environments. Hydrothermal vents are high-temperature 
fluid  emissions  that  arise  on  the  seafloor  and  that  sustain  unique 
faunal  communities.  Our  main  goals  are  to  reduce  the  human  effort 
involved  in  substratum  characterization;  alleviate  the  subjectivity 
inherent to human photo interpretation; and contribute to reduce the 
costs and time involved in monitoring the deep sea. 

With  those  purposes  in  mind,  we  devised  a  DL-based  solution  for 
automatically labeling deep-sea images, which employs different CNN 
architectures and allows human photo interpreters to audit the DL-based 
predictions,  considering  only  a  small  fraction  of  the  complete  image 
dataset.

Each rectangle indicates the operations performed at a block of layers. Conv and SConv stand for regular convolution and depth-wise separable 
convolution, respectively. The values that follow such operations indicate the number of filters, filter size, stride, and dilation rate. Regarding the 
maxpooling operation, the values correspond to the kernel dimension and stride. Dropout refers to the number of neurons randomly turned off during 
each training inference. The number of neurons in the dense layer of the classifier module corresponds to the number of classes in the dataset. 

All architectures were modified mainly in the block of fully connected layers, where we opted to use just the output layer after the feature extractor 
instead of two fully connected layers. Additionally, residual blocks were used at the architectures’ stems rather than in the full feature extractor. All 
those modifications were experimentally determined.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the context that the primary focus is on image data, specifically deep-sea images. This is evident from phrases like "substratum classification," "seabed mineral image segmentation," and references to various papers related to image processing and computer vision. Therefore, it can be concluded that the data format primarily used in the deep learning pipeline is likely image data.
