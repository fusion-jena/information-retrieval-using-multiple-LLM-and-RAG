Helpful Answer:
After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be taken to evaluate and interpret the results. Here are some common methods used:

1. Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE): This method involves maximizing the log-likelihood function to estimate the optimal parameters of a given model. In this case, it was used to find the best value for the parameter θ in the thinning Poisson point process (PPP) model.

2. Removal of Sampling Bias Effect: To eliminate the influence of sampling bias on the estimated intensity function, the parameter α was set to zero. This step ensures that the resulting intensity function accurately represents the underlying spatial distribution of events.

3. Tuning Parameter Selection: Appropriate values for the tuning parameters τ and ϕ were selected using the Root Trimmed Mean Squared Prediction Error (RTMSPE). This metric helps identify the most suitable parameter settings while minimizing the impact of heterogeneity in the data.

4. Model Evaluation Metrics: Various metrics can be calculated to assess the performance of the trained model. These may include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, or area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Depending on the specific application, different evaluation criteria might be more relevant.

5. Visualization Techniques: Tools such as saliency maps or confusion matrices can provide insights into how well the model performs across different classes or regions. For example, a saliency map could highlight areas where the model has high confidence in its predictions, while a confusion matrix would show the number of correct and incorrect classifications made by the model.
