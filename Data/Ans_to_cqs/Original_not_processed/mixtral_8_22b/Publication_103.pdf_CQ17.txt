the network. Therefore, a common practice is to initialize
the network by pre-training it on a big available dataset
and then fine-tune it on the scarcer domain-specific data.
Concretely, the methodology we used in our experiment
for transferring knowledge from dataset A to dataset B is
the following:

1. The network is first trained from scratch on dataset
A by using a multinomial logistic regression on top
of the SOFTMAX layer and the linear classification
layer.

2. The linear classification layer used for dataset A is
then replaced by a new one aimed at classifying the
classes in B. It is initialized with random weights.

3. The other layers are kept unchanged so as to

initialize the learning of dataset B with the weights
learned from A.

4. The network is trained on the images in B.

Experiments and results
All experiments measured the top-1 and top-5 accu-
racy of the trained deep learning model under different
circumstances, i.e., herbarium specimens classification
(“Herbarium specimen classification” section, Table 3),
transfer learning across herbarium data from differ-
ent regions (“Cross-Herbaria transfer learning” section,
Table 4), and transfer learning from herbarium data to
non-dried plant images (“Transfer learning from herbar-
ium to non-dried plant images” section, Table 5).

For each of these experiments, table columns are

defined as follows:

Helpful Answer:
The papers referenced in the given context do not explicitly mention specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, they discuss techniques related to preventing overfitting in deep learning models. For instance, Vanhoucke and Rabinovich (2015) present a paper about going deeper with convolutions, which could potentially help avoid overfitting by increasing the complexity of the model. Similarly, Ioffe and Szegedy (2015) introduce batch normalization, a technique that can improve training speed and reduce generalization error. Additionally, He et al. (2015) delve into rectified activation functions, which may also contribute to better convergence and reduced overfitting. Although none of these directly address regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization, they provide insights into strategies for improving deep learning pipelines and mitigating overfitting.
