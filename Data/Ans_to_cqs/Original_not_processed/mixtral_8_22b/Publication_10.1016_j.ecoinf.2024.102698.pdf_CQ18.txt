Description

outputs  perform  sufficiently  well  in  replicating  the  statistics  of  the 
original data and offer significant runtime reductions.

is generally developed based on a selection of input data points and the 
complex model’s response to those data points. Surrogate models can be 
highly effective, but the data points used to build the model on must be 
sampled  carefully  and  the  surrogate  model’s  parameters  need  to  be 
optimized  to  balance  variance  and  bias.  Surrogate  models  can  be 
developed  using  reduced  order  approximations,  such  as  using  radial 
basis  functions,  through  multi-fidelity  models  such  as  Kriging,  which 
combine  data  sources  of  differing  fidelity,  or  via  machine  learning 
methods (Alizadeh et al., 2020).

As a first conceptual framework for a synthetic reef data pipeline the 
models developed here serve their purpose in facilitating decision sup-
port  tool  testing  and  demonstrations  during  development,  although 
alternative  models  could  be  investigated  to  reduce  the  time  taken  to 
create  some  of  the  synthetic  datasets  and  improve  fidelity  to  the 
ecological dynamics if needed for other applications. Machine learning 
and neural network-based models are ideal for fitting models to a wide 
range of data sets but can take time for model training. The models for 
site data, coral cover and connectivity all show reasonable runtimes, but 
the PAR environmental data model’s runtime could be improved upon

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions that the models were evaluated based on their ability to replicate the statistics of the original data while offering significant runtime reductions. This suggests that monitoring the model performance might have involved comparing the output statistics with the original dataset and assessing computational efficiency. Additionally, the use of correlation scores and mean data quality scores implies that these metrics may also have been employed to track the progress and accuracy of the models during training.
