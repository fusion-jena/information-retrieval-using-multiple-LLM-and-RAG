in satellite images (Al-hasn and Almuhammad, 2022; Atun et al., 2020; 
Kalkan and Maktav, 2018). For this reason, the first action taken was to 
perform atmospheric correction on the images in QGIS.

forests  using  564  fire  ignition  points  and  ten  different  variables.  The 
Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (AUC = 0.894) demonstrated the 
best performance, and NDVI was among the variables analyzed. Corre-
lation analysis of forest fire ignition points and variables showed that the 
NDVI (r = 0.51) index was the most reliable predictor of fire occurrence. 
In contrast, Iban  and  Sekertekin (2022) developed  a fire  risk map 
using  seven  machine  learning  techniques,  RS  data,  and  GIS.  Thirteen 
different variables affecting forest fire risk were employed in this study. 
The accuracy of the maps obtained using seven machine-learning tech-
niques ranged from 0.817 to 0.879, as measured by AUC values. NDVI 
was  among  the  variables  used  in  this  study.  The  correlation  analysis 
showed that the elevation variable (r = 0.626) had the highest corre-
lation with fire risk, while NDVI (r = 0.256) exhibited a low correlation.

Nguyen et al. (2018) employed three distinct machine learning al-
gorithms,  namely  Support  Vector  Machine,  Multilayer  Perceptron 
Neural Network, and Random Forests, to evaluate fire risk in tropical

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there is no mention of specific hyperparameters used in any deep learning models. Therefore, it is not possible to provide accurate details about the hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizers used in the deep learning models.
