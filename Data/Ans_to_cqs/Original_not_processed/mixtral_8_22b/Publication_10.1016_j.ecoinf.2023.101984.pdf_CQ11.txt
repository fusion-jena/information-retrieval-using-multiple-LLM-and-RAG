Occurrence  data  refers  to  sets  of  coordinates  (X-Y)  where  species 
have been observed. We used the location points from the GBIF-Global 
Biodiversity Information Facility (https://www.gbif.org/) online data-
base  to  obtain  the  coordinates  of  the  two  oak  species  in  the  Iberian 
Peninsula. The database indicated a total of 3308 occurrences of Quercus 
ilex subsp. ilex and 6739 of Quercus pubescens Willd. Based on the work of 
Hijmans (2012), in order to reduce the potential location biases in the 
species  records,  we  applied  filters  to  narrow  the  datasets,  such  as 
removing the occurrences of Quercus ilex subsp. rotundifolia, and delet-
ing duplicates and outliers using R and ArcGis programs. The ocurrences 
of the two oak species were standarized in 10 km grids as a way to obtain 
a homogeneous sample for use in modelling. In total, 298 locations were 
selected for Quercus pubescens Willd. and 288 for Quercus ilex subsp. ilex 
(Fig. 3).

%Query
Query: "What is the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The query asks for the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the given context, there is no mention or information about any specific deep learning pipeline or its corresponding data repository link. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a direct answer to this query based solely on the provided context.

However, one of the sources mentioned in the context is the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), which is a data repository for biodiversity data. It was used to obtain the coordinates of the two oak species in the Iberian Peninsula. The link to access the GBIF database is <https://www.gbif.org/>. But again, without more specific details about the deep learning pipeline, it cannot be confirmed if this is the correct data repository link being asked for in the query.
