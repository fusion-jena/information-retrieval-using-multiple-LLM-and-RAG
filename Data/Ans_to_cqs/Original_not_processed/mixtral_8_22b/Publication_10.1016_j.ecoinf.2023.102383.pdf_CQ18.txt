Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves precision and recall trade-offs, which provide a method to assess the overall effectiveness of the model. Additionally, hard negative mining is employed, focusing on challenging negative examples during the training process. This approach allows the model to learn to better distinguish between objects and background regions, improving its overall performance. Furthermore, more time is allocated for training and detection, while selecting smaller feature maps reduces the number of parameters and increases detection speed. These strategies enable a trade-off between detection accuracy and performance. Ultimately, the monitoring of the model's performance during training is based on trials and errors.
