However, for machine learning algorithms like backpropagation to 
be successful, a critical condition must be met: all functions involved 
must be differentiable to compute gradients accurately. As said above, 
to make the update criterion differentiable, we use the Gumbel softmax 

function.  So,  by  changing  our  update  criterion  to

Uk,  we  manage  to 

compute the gradients. 

This new data-driven architecture aims to learn the neighbourhood 
relationship Rk to improve the results of our model. In addition, learning 
the  neighbourhood  relationship  has  value  in  itself,  as  it  allows  us  to 
know and learn how the different elements of the system interact. For 
this purpose, as we can see in Fig. 13 a neural network ANN (or other 
objects) might be defined as Rk, which may take two kinds of inputs:

data to effectively implement the proposed new strategy.

Despite the positive outcomes yielded by our model, we contend that 
substantial improvements could be achieved by implementing a more 
flexible and complete neighbourhood relation Rk  in terms of variables. 
For  this  reason,  in  Section  5,  we  explore  an  architecture  capable  of 
learning  such  neighbourhood  relationships  through  experience  and 
accumulated data. 

5. Intelligent cellular scheme 

In this section, we aim to present an innovative architecture that uses 
existing  data  and  historical  databases  to  generalize  the  concept  of 
neighbourhood relations. To achieve it, machine learning is a powerful 
tool, with a backpropagation algorithm (Rumelhart et al., 1986) at the 
heart of it.

Helpful Answer:

To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. One common approach is stratified sampling, where the dataset is divided into strata based on specific criteria, ensuring each subset maintains the same distribution of classes as the overall dataset. This technique helps prevent class imbalance issues and ensures that the training set remains representative of the entire population.

Oversampling and undersampling are also popular methods for handling class imbalance. Oversampling involves duplicating examples from the minority class to balance the dataset, while undersampling removes instances from the majority class. Both techniques help create a more balanced dataset, but oversampling can lead to overfitting due to duplicate samples, whereas undersampling risks losing valuable information.

Diverse data collection is another essential aspect of addressing data bias. Collecting diverse datasets that represent various demographics, scenarios, and edge cases can significantly reduce biases and improve the performance of deep learning models. Additionally, augmenting existing datasets with synthetic data generated using generative adversarial networks (GANs) or other techniques can further enhance diversity and mitigate potential biases.

Lastly, employing appropriate evaluation metrics, such as precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC), can provide insights into the model's performance across different classes and help identify any remaining biases in the dataset. Regular monitoring and updating of these metrics throughout the development process can ensure continuous improvement and fairness in the final model.
