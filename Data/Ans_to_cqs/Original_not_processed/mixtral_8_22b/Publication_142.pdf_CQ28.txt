the Pl@ntNet user community (currently 1.8 million user accounts). At the time
of writing, the CNN architecture used is the inception model49 extended with
batch normalization.50 The network is pre-trained on the commonly used Im-
ageNet dataset and ﬁne-tuned on Pl@ntNet data. Pl@ntNet currently covers
30,261 species illustrated by more than 2.9 million images. The taxonomic
coverage of our study is therefore one to three orders of magnitude larger
than previously published studies making use of automated species identiﬁca-
tion for ecological research. The training of Pl@ntNet CNN requires the mobi-
lization of a high-performance computing infrastructure and expertise in deep,
distributed, and large-scale learning. Thus, the resulting classiﬁcation tool is in
itself a major advance in biodiversity data science.

Access to the Pl@ntNet classiﬁcation tool is provided through a dedicated
API available at my.plantnet.org. The main feature of this API is a RESTful
JSON-based web service that can accept one to ﬁve images of a plant and re-
turns a list of likely species. The species are associated with classiﬁcation
scores (the softmax output of the CNN), as well as a list of matching images
retrieved from the database. To facilitate the implementation of future studies
based on the methodology of this paper, we have developed the ‘‘plantnet’’51
R-package allowing users to query the Pl@ntNet API. The package is available
online at https://github.com/BiologicalRecordsCentre/plantnet.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention which specific cloud platform or deployment environment was used to host the Pl@ntNet classification tool. However, it mentions that access to the tool is provided through a dedicated API available at <https://my.plantnet.org>. This suggests that the application may be hosted on a custom server or a private cloud solution rather than a public cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. Additionally, the text states that the training of Pl@ntNet's Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) required mobilizing a high-performance computing infrastructure, indicating that significant computational resources were involved in developing the model. Unfortunately, without further details about the hosting environment, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the exact platform used to deploy the deep learning model.
