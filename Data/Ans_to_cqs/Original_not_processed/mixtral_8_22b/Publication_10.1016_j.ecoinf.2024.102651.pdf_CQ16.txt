Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

The proposed classification network in this paper demonstrates su-
perior performance on the dataset, as indicated by the results presented 
in Table 3. In each classification network, the accuracy for the “medium” 
is consistently higher than that for the “small”. Besides, the experimental 
data in Table 3 also indicates that the classification network proposed 
achieves the highest classification accuracy among the “medium”  and 
“small”.  In  our  proposed  model,  the  classification  accuracy  for  both 
“medium”  and “small”  is improved by 3.56% and 2.93% respectively, 
compared to the ResNet50 and ViT. Additionally, the classification ac-
curacy for the “medium” is 5.6% higher compare with the “small” in the 
CA-Hybrid network.

increase in accuracy compared to the ResNet and ViT. By incorporating 
CAM, the network gains the capability to attend to important regions, 
thus improving classification accuracy.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it does not provide information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, common criteria used to determine when training is complete include a validation loss plateau, where the validation loss stops decreasing or starts increasing, indicating overfitting; a maximum number of epochs, where training is stopped after a certain number of iterations through the entire dataset; or early stopping, where training is stopped if the validation loss does not improve for a certain number of epochs.
