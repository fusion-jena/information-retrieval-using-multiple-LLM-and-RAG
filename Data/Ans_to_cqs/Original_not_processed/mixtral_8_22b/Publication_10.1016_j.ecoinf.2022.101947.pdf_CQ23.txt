mean of the predicted test set size diverges from the actual test set size. 
Optimal classification accuracy was obtained when the test set size 
was smallest relative to the training set. However, even when the test to 
training set  ratio  was  32:12, the  predicted value  was  close  to the  ex-
pected value, demonstrating the robustness of the model.

team. The track ID method, based on an objective approach described by 
Sharma et al., 2005, failed because survey teams were unable to obtain 
enough data at the field site during the study period.

Data validation was performed on the captive Amur tiger dataset to 
determine the optimal number of footprint trails required for the algo-
rithm training set and test sets that could provide an accurate population 
estimate. Fig. 4 shows the result of a holdback trial partitioning test on 
training sets for 44 captive Amur tigers. Using the algorithm generated 
in FIT, the analysis was iterated 10 times for each combination of test/ 
training  size,  with  randomly  selected  trails,  to  examine  how  the  pre-
dicted outcome compared with the known test set size. The figure shows, 
for example, that then the test set size (y axis) comprises trails from 4 
tigers, and the test/training set size comprises trails from 04/40 tigers, 
the predicted test set sizes are very similar across a range of partitioning 
trials. However, when the test set size is 36 tigers, and the test/training 
ratio 36/08 tigers, there is a wide range of predicted test set sizes and the

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention any specific techniques such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting used to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does describe a process that contributes to this goal. Data validation was performed using a holdback trial partitioning test on training sets for 44 captive Amur tigers. This involved iterating the analysis 10 times for each combination of test/training size, with randomly selected trails, to compare the predicted outcome with the known test set size. This process helps to evaluate the performance of the model under different conditions and ensures its robustness. Additionally, the fact that optimal classification accuracy was achieved when the test set size was smallest relative to the training set suggests that some form of balanced sampling might have been employed to prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize.
