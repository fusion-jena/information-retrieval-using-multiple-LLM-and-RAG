layers. ANNs require a substantial amount of training data to achieve 
effective learning. Among ANN architectures, the multi-layer perceptron 
(MLP) neural network stands out as the most used.

During  the  MLPNN  training  phase,  initial  arbitrary  connection 
weights were assigned. Inputs were forward-fed from the input to the 
hidden  layer.  Hidden  neurons  multiplied  inputs  by  weights,  summed 
products,  and  processed  sums  through  a  transfer  function.  Results 
propagated  to  the  output  layer,  with  output  values  compared  to  ex-
pected  values  for  error  computation.  Iterative  error  back-propagation 
adjusted  connection  weights  until  reaching  a  target  minimal  error. 
The network then accurately estimated carbon stocks for both training 
and new input data without training data. This required tests to deter-
mine optimal learning rate (0.01), momentum (0.18), and training it-
erations  (500).  The  trained  network  was  subsequently  used  for  feed- 
forward predictions on continuous spatial data.

Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about the specific purpose of the deep learning model used in these studies. However, we can infer some possible purposes based on the general use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and machine learning models in similar applications.

In the study by De Lucia et al. (2022), they discuss using explainable AI for hyperspectral image classification in edge computing environments. While not explicitly stated, this suggests that their deep learning model might be used for image classification tasks. Similarly, Domingues et al. (2020) mention using artificial neural networks on integrated multispectral and SAR data for high-performance prediction of eucalyptus biomass. In this case, the deep learning model could be employed for regression tasks, such as estimating biomass quantities.

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are widely used for various tasks like classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. They consist of multiple layers of interconnected nodes called neurons, which process and transmit signals. One popular type of ANN architecture mentioned in the context is the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network. During the training phase of MLPNN, initial arbitrary connection weights are assigned, and inputs are fed forward from the input to the hidden layer. The results propagate to the output layer, where output values are compared to expected values for error computation. Through iterative error back-propagation, connection weights are adjusted until reaching a target minimal error. Once trained, the network can estimate outputs for both training and new input data without requiring additional training data.

While the exact purpose of the deep learning model in these studies remains unclear due to limited context, it is reasonable to assume that they may have been used for tasks such as image classification, object detection, or regression analysis based on the broader application of ANNs and machine learning models in related fields.
