Our experimental results show that the approach is feasible, as our 
feature representation outperforms acoustic indices and has an execu-
tion time comparable to MFCC. This would make it possible to calculate 
a feature representation using our method for smaller datasets (up to a 
few  days)  on  a  medium-range  laptop,  and  larger  datasets  on  a  high- 
performance  PC.  Additionally  the  approach  is  quite  flexible,  with 
many  different  auto-encoder  architectures  being  possible.  As  such,  a 
viable useage scenario for our technique could be when:  

1.  Annotated training data is not available  
2.  MFCC is not viable for the species (The principal that is thought to 
make MFCCs work well for human speech (Davis and Mermelstein, 
1980) may not hold for all species (Eichinski, 2018)) 

3. A small, fast to calculate feature representation is needed (for ma-

chine learning with bigdata, for example)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The paper compares the performance of various feature representations using several evaluation metrics. These include bcubed precision, bcubed recall, bcubed Fscore, and purity. Bcubed precision measures how many events within each cluster belong to the same class, while bcubed recall calculates the proportion of correctly classified events per class. The bcubed Fscore combines both precision and recall into one metric. Purity evaluates the homogeneity of each cluster, measuring the percentage of elements belonging to the most common class in the cluster.
