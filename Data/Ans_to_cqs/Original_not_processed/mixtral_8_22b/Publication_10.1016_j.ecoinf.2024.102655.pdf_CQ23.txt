study and larger datasets do not necessarily produce more precise
models as the use of too much data can lead to model overtraining and
precision loss (Sj¨oberg and Ljung, 1995). Additionally, water quality
datasets are composed of a large number of parameters that often
represent redundant information (Haghiabi et al., 2018; Muharemi
et al., 2019). Despite these known issues, detailed analysis of historical
variation in a dataset is rarely employed for selecting training data
subsets prior to developing predictive models. It is anticipated that their
implementation may improve the training step and, therefore, lead to
improved predictive outputs. For these reasons, analyzing historical
trends in water quality is necessary to find the most variable and
representative scenarios useful for machine learning model training.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit details about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention some relevant aspects related to this topic.

In section 2.6, it discusses the issue of using too much data leading to model overtraining and precision loss. This implies that careful consideration was likely given to the selection of training data subsets to avoid such problems. The text also mentions the importance of analyzing historical trends in water quality to identify the most variable and representative scenarios for machine learning model training. These points suggest that efforts might have been made to create a diverse dataset for training the model.

Additionally, while the context does not explicitly mention techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting, these methods are commonly used to evaluate and enhance the performance and generalizability of machine learning models. Given the focus on improving predictive outputs through better training data selection, it is plausible that similar techniques could have been employed here.

However, without further information, we cannot definitively state which specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
