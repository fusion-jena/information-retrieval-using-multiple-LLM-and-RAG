5.3. Limitations and further prospects 

Certain limitations remain in the study that future research should 
address. First of all, the framework relies on a matrix that aligns carbon 
sinks  priorities  with  landscape  risks,  but  it  may  not  capture  the  full 
complexity  of  carbon  sink  dynamics.  Future  investigations  should 
further analyze natural factors, such as ecosystem services, biodiversity, 
ecosystems’  sensitivity  and  climate  change  resilience,  to  refine  in-
dicators assessing carbon sink capacity and risk. (Yang et al., 2021; Onil 
Banerjee et al., 2020). Moreover, while the MCDA methods provide a 
structured  analysis,  their  reliance  on  fixed  weights  and  scores  might 
impede their adaptability to evolving varous conditions. A more flexible 
intelligent algorithms scoring system would improve responsiveness to 
environmental  changes,  enhancing  the  framework’s  ability  to  tackle 
emerging ecological challenges (Krivoguz, 2024).

Helpful Answer:
To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting is a method used to ensure that the training and testing datasets have similar distributions of classes or labels. This technique involves dividing the dataset into subsets based on class labels before splitting them into training and testing sets. By doing so, we maintain the original distribution of classes in both the training and testing datasets, reducing potential biases caused by imbalanced classes.

Oversampling is another approach used to handle data imbalance issues. It involves duplicating samples from the minority class to achieve a balanced dataset. One popular oversampling technique is Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), which generates synthetic examples rather than simply copying existing ones. SMOTE helps prevent overfitting and improves the generalizability of models trained on these augmented datasets.

Undersampling is the opposite of oversampling, focusing on removing instances from the majority class instead of adding samples to the minority class. Random under-sampling is one common undersampling strategy, where random samples from the majority class are removed until balance between classes is achieved. However, this method may discard valuable information contained in the deleted samples. To mitigate this issue, informed undersampling techniques like NearMiss can be applied, which selectively remove majority class samples based on their proximity to minority class instances.

Lastly, collecting diverse data is crucial for minimizing data bias in deep learning pipelines. Ensuring that the dataset includes various features, scenarios, and edge cases allows models to learn better representations and generalize well across different situations. Additionally, gathering data from multiple sources and domains can help create robust models capable of handling real-world complexities and variations.

In conclusion, addressing data bias during preprocessing of deep learning pipelines requires employing techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Each method has its strengths and weaknesses, making it essential to choose appropriate strategies depending on specific use cases and requirements.
