Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

30/3 epochs),
• Momentum: 0.9,
• Weight decay: 0.0005,
• Gamma: 0.1,
• Batch size: 24 (in case of GoogLeNet), 100 (in case of AlexNet).

All the above experiments were conducted using our own fork of
Caﬀe (Jia et al., 2014), which is a fast, open source framework for
deep learning. The basic results, such as the overall accuracy can
also be replicated using a standard instance of caﬀe.

%Query
Query: "What is the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The authors did not provide any specific information about the code repository link of their deep learning pipeline in this excerpt. However, they mentioned that all the experiments were conducted using their own fork of Caffe (Jia et al., 2014), which is a fast, open-source framework for deep learning. Therefore, it might be possible to find the relevant code by searching for the authors' names or keywords related to their work within the Caffe project on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Unfortunately, without more specific details, I cannot provide a direct link to the exact code repository.
