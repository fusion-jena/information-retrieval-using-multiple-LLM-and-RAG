The Landsat 8 OLI and TIRS bands (Band 4, 3, and 2) of 30-m reso-
lution and remote sensing image data from Google Earth Engine (GEE), 
which  was accessed on April 21,  2023, were used in this study. Geo-
metric, radiometric and image mosaicking, and cropping are all aspects 
considered  in  the  remote  sensing  image  pre-processing.  The  slope, 
aspect, drainage, and parent material of the topographic variables from 
DEM  were  calculated  using  the  System  for  Automated  Geoscientific 
Analysis (SAGA) GIS. After image processing, the original image's Digital 
Number (Fortuna et al., 2022) provided the measured Surface Reflec-
tance (SR). The TOA and SR picture sets from Google Earth Engine (GEE) 
helped to speed up data processing. The function ee. Image Collection in 
image  preprocessing  used  the  Landsat  8  SR  images  (High  resolution 
satellite  L2)  from  the  GEE  platform.  Only  the  chosen  photos  were

The outputs of the Land Use and Land Cover studies (LULC) based on 
the  Geographic  information  system  (GIS)  indicate  that  agricultural 
(30%), horticultural (40%), and forest land (about 16%) uses account 
for >86% of the total area of the region studied. The remaining area 
includes  wastelands,  ravine  streams  and  urbanized  sites.  The  land 
mostly  consists  of  mountains  and  valleys.  The  river  Jhelum  and  its 
tributaries are the principal irrigation supplies. In the northwest part of 
the  study  area is  located the  Wular Lake,  the  Asia biggest freshwater 
lake. The native vegetation in the region includes Pinus spp., Fir spp., 
Citrus spp., Salix spp., Populus spp., and Ulmus spp.. The Indian gov-
ernment  has  prohibited  deforestation  in  the  region  because  of  its 
extreme vulnerability (Bashir et al., 2022). Fig. 1 provides an illustrative 
map of the area studied.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the study does not use any of the commonly known datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet for deep learning pipelines. Instead, the study utilizes remote sensing image data from Google Earth Engine (GEE) with Landsat 8 OLI and TIRS bands (Band 4, 3, and 2) of 30-m resolution. These satellite images are processed using geometric, radiometric, image mosaicking, and cropping techniques. Additionally, topographic variables like slope, aspect, drainage, and parent material are calculated using the System for Automated Geoscientific Analysis (SAGA) GIS. Therefore, the datasets used in this study primarily consist of satellite imagery and geospatial data rather than traditional machine learning datasets.
