3.1. Neural networks settings

Deep Neural Networks are architectures that present remarkable
advantages and can potentially map every possible function, but they
are often affected by many issues such as overfitting. The main draw-
back of standard Deep Learning is that Neural Networks compute single
values of their parameters and therefore they are incapable of correctly
assessing the uncertainty related to the data (aleatoric uncertainty) or to
the model itself (epistemic uncertainty); in fact they often produce
overly confident decisions about the correct class, prediction or action to
take, even if the sample is very far from the training data we provided.
The purpose of Bayesian Neural Networks is to use probability theory
to express uncertainty, especially in the prediction phase. The advantage
is clear in areas where decision making plays a fundamental role. To be
more specific, a Probabilistic Neural Network handles the aleatoric
uncertainty by placing a probability distribution (whose parameters can

Fig. 4. Neural networks architecture consists of: an input layer with two nodes, one for DOY and the other for GDD; two hidden layers with 32 nodes each, Dense
layers with Monte Carlo Dropout in the MCD approach, DenseVariational layers in the VBI approach; an output layer which is the combination of a Dense layer with
two nodes and a DistributionLambda layer that maps the values of these two nodes into the parameters of a Gaussian distribution, used to predict the BBCH value.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, the given context does not provide explicit information regarding the hyperparameters used in the deep learning models, such as the learning rate or the type of optimizer employed. However, it does offer some insights into the structure of the neural network architecture used in both the MCD and VBI approaches.

In Figure 4, we see that the neural network architecture consists of an input layer with two nodes (one for Day Of Year - DOY, and another for Growing Degree Days - GDD), followed by two hidden layers containing 32 nodes each. These hidden layers employ either Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD) or DenseVariational layers (VBI). Lastly, there is an output layer comprised of a dense layer with two nodes and a DistributionLambda layer, which maps the values of those two nodes into the parameters of a Gaussian distribution used to predict the BBCH value.

While the context does not explicitly state the hyperparameters used, it does mention that the study focuses on scenarios with limited datasets. This suggests that the authors may have chosen hyperparameters suitable for working with smaller datasets, though without further details, it remains speculative.
