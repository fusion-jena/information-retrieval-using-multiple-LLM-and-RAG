Measurement of Performance
To get a sense of how our approaches will perform on new unseen
data, and also to keep a track of if any of our approaches are
overﬁtting, we run all our experiments across a whole range
of train-test set splits, namely 80–20 (80% of the whole dataset
used for training, and 20% for testing), 60–40 (60% of the whole
dataset used for training, and 40% for testing), 50–50 (50% of

the whole dataset used for training, and 50% for testing), 40–60
(40% of the whole dataset used for training, and 60% for testing)
and ﬁnally 20–80 (20% of the whole dataset used for training,
and 80% for testing). It must be noted that in many cases, the
PlantVillage dataset has multiple images of the same leaf (taken
from diﬀerent orientations), and we have the mappings of such
cases for 41,112 images out of the 54,306 images; and during all

Each of these 60 experiments runs for a total of 30 epochs,
where one epoch is deﬁned as the number of training iterations
in which the particular neural network has completed a full pass
of the whole training set. The choice of 30 epochs was made based
on the empirical observation that in all of these experiments, the
learning always converged well within 30 epochs (as is evident
from the aggregated plots (Figure 3) across all the experiments).
To enable a fair comparison between the results of all the
experimental conﬁgurations, we also tried to standardize the
hyper-parameters across all the experiments, and we used the
following hyper-parameters in all of the experiments:
• Solver type: Stochastic Gradient Descent,
• Base learning rate: 0.005,

• Learning rate policy: Step (decreases by a factor of 10 every

However, there are a number of limitations at the current stage
that need to be addressed in future work. First, when tested on a
set of images taken under conditions diﬀerent from the images
used for training, the model’s accuracy is reduced substantially,
to just above 31%. It’s important to note that this accuracy is
much higher than the one based on random selection of 38 classes
(2.6%), but nevertheless, a more diverse set of training data is
needed to improve the accuracy. Our current results indicate
that more (and more variable) data alone will be suﬃcient
to substantially increase the accuracy, and corresponding data
collection eﬀorts are underway.

Helpful Answer:
The authors do not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps after the model training in their study. However, they discuss various aspects related to performance measurement and evaluation. They measure the performance of their models using different train-test split ratios ranging from 80-20 to 20-80. Each experiment runs for a total of 30 epochs, with stochastic gradient descent as the solver type and a base learning rate of 0.005. To ensure a fair comparison among the experimental configurations, they standardized the hyperparameters across all experiments. Although not mentioned directly, it can be assumed that common practices like calculating metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score) and generating confusion matrices were employed to evaluate the models' performance. Additionally, the authors acknowledge the limitation of reduced accuracy when applying the trained model to images captured under different conditions than those used for training. This suggests that further analysis or visualization techniques, such as saliency maps, might be beneficial to understand the model's behavior better.
