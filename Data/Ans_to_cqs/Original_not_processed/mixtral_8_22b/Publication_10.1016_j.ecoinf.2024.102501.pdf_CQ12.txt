The  above  results  and  analyses  show  that  traditional  machine 
learning  methods  (SVR)  and  deep  learning  methods  (LSTM)  can  be 
adapted  to  address  the  problems  of  poor  generalization  ability,  local 
optimum, underfitting, and overfitting of conventional models to predict 
DO concentration successfully. The machine learning and deep learning 
literature also discuss the prediction of DO concentration. For example,

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the authors have utilized various types of machine learning and deep learning models for their studies. However, when specifically focusing on deep learning models, one paper mentions the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This information can be found in the first reference cited:

Heddam, S., Kim, S., Mehr, A.D., Zounemat-Kermani, M., Malik, A., Elbeltagi, A., et al., 2022b. Predicting dissolved oxygen concentration in river using new advanced machines learning: long-short term memory (LSTM) deep learning. In: Computers in Earth and Environmental Sciences. Elsevier, pp. 1–20.

Therefore, we can conclude that the type of deep learning model used in this particular pipeline is the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network.
