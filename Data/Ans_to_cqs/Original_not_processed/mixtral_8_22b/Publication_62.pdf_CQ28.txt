Deep   learning   might   ultimately   be   leveraged   in   many   ways   for   many   diﬀerent   types   of
NHCs.   Here,   we   focus   on   the   digitized   portion   (currently   1.2   million   specimens)   of   the
United States National Herbarium. Our analyses, focused on the detection of specimens
previously treated with mercury and the discrimination of superﬁcially similar plant families,
are complementary to those recently published on species identiﬁcation (Carranza-Rojas et
al. 2017) and further demonstrate how CNNs might be used to learn more from NHCs.

Materials and methods

included two convolutional layers and two pooling layers (Table 2; https://doi.org/10.6084/
m9.ﬁgshare.5501716). The code used to deﬁne and train these CNNs can be found in our
Mathematica notebooks (Suppl. materials 1, 3, 2, 4).

%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not specify which platform was used to deploy the deep learning models described in the paper. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether they were deployed using Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or another platform.
