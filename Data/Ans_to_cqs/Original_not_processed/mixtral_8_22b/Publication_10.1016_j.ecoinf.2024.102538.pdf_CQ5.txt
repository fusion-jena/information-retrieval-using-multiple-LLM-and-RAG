their  convolutional  kernels  and  pooling  layers.  Regarding  this  issue, 
Zhang  et  al.  (2019)  incorporated  a  long  short-term  memory  (LSTM) 
network to develop a 3DCNN-LSTM model as a classifier, making the 
network more sensitive to the temporal changes in birdsong informa-
tion. It is important to note that the use of RNNs such as the CRNN model 
requires  more  computing  resources  for  training,  and  performance 
improvement is not always guaranteed. Another common approach to 
addressing  the  limitations  of  CNNs  is  to  introduce  attention  mecha-
nisms.  For  example,  Soundception  (Sevilla  and  Glotin,  2017)  was 
developed  by  introducing  time  and  time-frequency  attention  mecha-
nisms to Inception V4; the resulting model achieved first place in the 
BirdCLEF  2017  Competition.  Fu  et  al.  (2023)  proposed  an  improved 
ACGAN model named DR-ACGAN based on the residual structure and an

3.4. Baseline model 

To assess the impact of hierarchical information, we established a 
baseline  model  employing  a  single  classifier.  Considering  the  limited 
computing resources, we adapted the Xception network Chollet (2017) 
with  a  positional  attention  mechanism  Fu  et  al.  (2019)  to  ensure  the 
effectiveness  of  bird  recognition.  Due  to  the  superiority  of  the  deep 
separable  convolutional  (DSC)  structure,  the  Xception  architecture 
outperforms other CNN architectures of the same caliber such as Resnet 
and DenseNet, delivering significant performance improvement. More-
over,  the  Xception  network  exhibits  quicker  training  and  inference 
speeds compared to vision transformers.

from data, thereby reducing the need for manual feature selection; such 
networks  have  demonstrated  considerable  potential.  The  mainstream 
deep  learning  approach  for  sound  recognition  involves  mapping  the 
sound amplitude onto a 2-D mel-scale spectrogram and using a modified 
network  architecture  adapted  from  advanced  image  recognition  for 
automatic  feature  learning.  The  effectiveness  of  convolutional  neural 
networks  with  residual  connections  in  recognizing  bird  sounds  was 
demonstrated  in  the  annual  LifeCLEF  Bird  Identification  Challenge 
(BirdCLEF) competition (Kahl et al., 2021a, 2022, 2023).

Helpful Answer:
The deep learning pipelines mentioned in the given context utilize two main datasets: BirdCLEF2018-Small (BC-S), BirdCLEF2018-Large (BC-L), Lishui-Zhejiang Birdsdata (LS), and Lishui-Zhejiang Birdsdata (LS*). These datasets were released in different years, with BC-S and BC-L being published in 2018, while LS and LS* were published in 2024. The BC-S and BC-L datasets contain recordings from Europe and America, whereas the LS and LS* datasets consist of recordings from China. Each dataset has its own set of sounds and categories, which can be found in Table 3 of the provided context.
