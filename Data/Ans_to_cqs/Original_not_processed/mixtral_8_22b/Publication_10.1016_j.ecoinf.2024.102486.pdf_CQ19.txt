Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

other programming languages are also used, such as the Deep Learning 
Toolbox  by  MathWorks  (Beale  et  al.,  2018),  cuDNN  (Chetlur  et  al., 
2014), and Darknet (Redmon, 2013–2016).

2.  A CUDA-capable Virtual-Machine (VM) instance should be created on Google Cloud. Various choices are available by searching for ‘CUDA’ in the 
Google Cloud ‘Marketplace’. We recommend a VM named “Debian 10 based Deep Learning VM with M97”, as it comes with the necessary drivers 
and compilers pre-installed. At the time of writing, this instance uses CUDA 11.6. Documentation is available if additional information about 
similar Google Cloud VMs is required.  

3.  The VM can be launched using the ‘Launch’ button on the aforementioned page, after which the required hardware specification of the VM must be 
selected. For most small projects, 16GB of memory and an SSD boot drive of 30GB should suffice. The number and type of GPUs can be selected at 
this stage.

%Query
Query: "Which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text mentions several tools and libraries used for building deep learning models, including the Deep Learning Toolbox by MathWorks, cuDNN, and Darknet. However, it does not explicitly mention TensorFlow or PyTorch. It is important to note that these tools may serve different purposes within the context of deep learning development. For example, cuDNN is a library developed by NVIDIA for optimizing neural network computations, while Darknet is an open-source neural network framework written in C and CUDA. To determine whether TensorFlow or PyTorch were used specifically, more context would be needed.
