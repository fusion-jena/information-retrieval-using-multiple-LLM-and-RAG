1. Introduction

that are explicitly corrected by NN1 and NN2. This is interesting and 
strategic information prompting future research to continue along these 
lines and to optimise estimators which result in low bias and low rRMSE 
values  by  balancing  the  weights  of  sample  trees  with  those  of  their 
neighbours.

Generally  speaking  the  NN4  estimator  (Eq.  11)  that  considers  the 
weights of both sample trees and of the neighbours of sample trees is in 
most cases an improvement over the NN3 estimator (Eq. 10), although 
the  improvement  of  NN4  over  the  inventory  estimator  (Eq.  7)  is  low 
except for diversity index U. Explorative test simulations have shown 
that averaging as in Eq. (11) retains a comparatively large influence of 
the weights of the sample trees as opposed to those of their neighbours 
and this appears to keep the overall sampling error low. The inventory 
â€² 
estimator is generally the best choice for the M and M
indices, whilst T is 
situated halfway between U and M in terms of the best choice of esti-
mator, where the inventory estimator, NN3 and NN4 largely show quite 
similar performances.

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be taken to improve its performance. These may include data normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Data normalization involves transforming the input features so they fall within a specific range, often between 0 and 1. Scaling refers to adjusting the values of numeric columns to have similar scales, which helps prevent certain features from being given more importance due to their larger numerical values. Cleaning data involves handling missing values, removing outliers, and correcting inconsistent entries. Additionally, feature engineering techniques such as encoding categorical variables, extracting relevant features, and dimensionality reduction might also be applied depending on the dataset and problem requirements.
