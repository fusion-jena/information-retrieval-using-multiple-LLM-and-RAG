2023; Yuan et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2023c). The model’s initial learning 
rate was set to 0.01, further refined via iterative testing. The number of 
iterations was 150, with a batch size of 4, downsampling multiplier set 
at 8, and utilized SGD optimizer, ReLu activation function, and Dice loss 
function.

The  model  developed  here  demonstrates  the  capability  to  extract 
fine-scale variations in vegetation across drylands using readily avail-
able  remote  sensing  data,  enabling  large-scale  assessments  over 
extended periods. Enhancing the model’s accuracy can be achieved by 
integrating  various  optimization  algorithms,  including  the  Genghis 
Khan Shark Optimizer, Gazelle Optimization Algorithm, and Dandelion 
Optimizer (Agushaka et al., 2023; Hu et al., 2023a, 2023b), to optimize 
the framework’s parameters. Moreover, the incorporation of ensemble 
methods such as the Bagging algorithm, Boosting algorithm, and stacked 
generalization can enhance the model’s precision further (Friedman and 
Popescu, 2008; Wu and Wang, 2023; Zhao et al., 2023a). Given that this 
study solely relied on satellite imagery, limited to identifying vegetation 
at a generic level, future investigations should consider employing high-

DATAID=217).  Both  climate  and  DEM  data  were  resampled  to  10  m 
spatial resolution through ArcGIS. Mean groundwater data from April to 
September, featuring a 10 m resolution, were derived from a Machine 
Learning  model  constructed  based  on  groundwater  monitoring  data 
collected from 74 wells in the lower Tarim River Basin (model details 
can be referenced in Liu et al., 2022b).

Helpful Answer:

The text does not explicitly state how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, it mentions that the model's initial learning rate was set to 0.01 and then further refined via iterative testing. This suggests that some form of iterative or adaptive method might have been used to optimize the learning rate. Unfortunately, without more specific information, we cannot definitively determine whether methods like grid search or random search were employed. It is also worth noting that the text mentions several optimization algorithms, such as the Genghis Khan Shark Optimizer, Gazelle Optimization Algorithm, and Dandelion Optimizer, which could potentially be used for hyperparameter tuning. Nonetheless, these algorithms are not mentioned specifically in relation to the model described in the given context. Therefore, while there may be speculation about possible methods used for hyperparameter optimization, the exact approach remains unclear based on the provided information.
