Identification of optional ecological sources 

The SOFM is an unsupervised learning neural network approach that 
combines dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis to allocate 
research units into different ES bundles based on spatial similarities. The 
ES bundles were divided using SOFM (using the R package kohonen) 
based on the results of the reconstructed ESV, and the ideal number of 
bundles  was  established  by  calculating  the  Davis-Boldin  Index  (DBI), 
which was used as the basis for identifying ecological sources and setting 
scenarios. Furthermore, this study used hotspot analysis (Getis-Ord G*
i ) 
to  analyze the  spatial clustering of  ESV and  considered  hotspot areas 
with a significance level of 90% or more as optional ecological sources.

2)  Three  scenarios  were  established  based  on  identifying  service 
bundles: product supply, water conservation, and habitat maintenance. 
The  number  of  sources  was  11,  4,  and  4  for  each  type,  respectively, 
accounting for 37.6% of the total area of the region. Under these three 
scenarios, 30, 36, and 36 ecological corridors were identified and clas-
sified into five categories. 

3) In Guangzhou, the minimum area threshold for ecological sources 
is 10 km2. The CWD values for identifying ecological pinch points were 
20,000,  62,000,  and  93,000  for  the  three  scenarios,  while  the  search 
radii for ecological barriers were 320, 200, and 500 m.

learning neural network characterized by the topographic map structure 
of  the  input  scenario.  This  algorithm  overcomes  the  shortcomings  of 
linear dimensionality reduction techniques and can objectively classify 
ecosystem functions according to a predefined setting and automatically 
form weights among the elements, avoiding the subjectivity of weight 
setting  (Zhao  et  al.,  2023).  Consequently,  applying  SOFM  to  identify 
ecological sources can effectively analyze the geographical variability 
and similarity of ESs while also uncovering the dominant service func-
tions and ecological values of the land-use types where the ecological 
sources  are  located.  This  study  combined  the  SOFM  algorithm  with 
traditional  ESP  construction  paradigms,  which  emphasize  the  consid-
eration of the capacity of different regions to provide dominant ESs, and 
can  provide  a  new  idea  for  the  construction  and  optimization  of

3.1.1. Accounting for the value of ecosystem services 

The table of ecosystem service value (ESV) per unit area of different 
ecosystems was constructed to estimate the static ESV of Guangzhou in 
2020 (Table A.1), according to the “China Terrestrial Ecosystem Unit 
Area Value Equivalent Scale of Ecosystem Services” (Xie et al., 2003). 
Following  the  four  categories  proposed by  the  Millennium  Ecosystem 
Assessment (MA), this study identified seven ESs: water conservation, 
soil  formation  and  erosion  control,  biodiversity  conservation,  food 
production, raw materials, carbon sequestration, and recreational cul-
ture. Ecosystems are dynamic rather than static. This study measured 
the importance and spatial richness index of various ESs, enabling the 
dynamic  reconstruction  of  the  static  ESV,  according  to  Wang  et  al. 
(2019). The importance index was calculated by the multiyear average 
rate of change in ESVs to correct the ESV assessment results. The degree

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available from the given context to determine which specific platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. The text only mentions the use of the R package 'kohonen' for implementing the Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM) neural network but does not specify any details about the deployment environment or cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. Therefore, it is impossible to accurately state which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model based solely on the provided context.
