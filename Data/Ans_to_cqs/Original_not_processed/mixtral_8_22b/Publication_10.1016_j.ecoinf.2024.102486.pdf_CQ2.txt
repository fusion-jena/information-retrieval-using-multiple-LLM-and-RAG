the  proportion  of  articles  using  GPU  computing  rose  rapidly  from 
approximately 1% in 2016 and 2017 to 12–15% in 2021–2023. By far 
the most common use (139 of 143 articles, i.e., 97%) was in machine 
learning  where  the  training  phase  can  readily  be  parallelised  and 
accessible software tools are available to utilise GPUs for this purpose. 
(A review of machine learning in ecology is given by Pichler and Hartig,

classification  of  visual  images  (e.g.  Atila  et  al.,  2021)  or  acoustic  re-

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does suggest that some of the research involves image and audio data. For instance, one study uses animal audio classification, while another focuses on recognizing and classifying visual images. Additionally, a reference to the Deep Learning Toolbox by MathWorks implies potential usage of various data formats, including images, videos, and signals. Furthermore, the mention of TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch suggests the possibility of working with different types of data, as these libraries support multiple data formats like images, text, time series, and more. Therefore, while the exact data formats used in the deep learning pipeline cannot be definitively determined from the provided context, it can be inferred that they likely include image and audio data, among others.
