For the ViT models, we adapted the approach of pretraining deep
bidirectional transformers for language understanding (BERT) by Devlin
et al. (2018) for birdsong classification. Table 3 provides an overview of
the investigated ViT models with their respective parameterizations.
ViT-S/16, for example, denotes a ViT variant of reduced complexity with
an input patch size of 16 × 16. The sequence length of the transformer
models is inversely proportional to the square of the provided patch size.
In the following, ViT-B/16 is further investigated as it strikes a balance
between general model complexity and classification performance.

In ecology, changes in environmental conditions are often closely linked to shifts in species diversity. This
relationship can be investigated by analyzing avian vocalizations, which are robust indicators of trends in
biodiversity. Within this contribution, we explored various data augmentation techniques and deep learning
strategies for the classification of birdsong within natural soundscapes. For this purpose, we employed three
fundamental deep neural network architectures, such as vision transformers, to classify 397 different bird spe-
cies. To improve both the accuracy and generalizability of our models, we incorporated up to 19 well-established
data augmentation techniques commonly used in audio classification. This included an iterative selection process
where only augmentations that enhanced classification performance were selected. The primary augmentation
technique involved the integration of various noise samples and non-bird audio elements, which significantly

1. Introduction and motivation

Recent research increasingly acknowledges the potential of (semi-)
automated birdsong recognition systems that integrate computer vision
(CV) and machine learning (ML) principles. These systems are pivotal
for monitoring avian biodiversity, a task traditionally demanding
considerable labor and specialized expertise when performed manually
(Font et al., 2021; Kahl et al., 2021a). In recent evaluation campaigns,
including previous BirdCLEF challenges (Kahl et al., 2018, 2019, 2020,
2021a), deep learning (DL) models have demonstrated their effective-
ness. These models proficiently identify and classify birdsong by
leveraging sophisticated,
task-specific methods tailored for varied
environmental contexts.

In 2021, BirdCLEF organized a challenge to classify 397 bird species
in 5–300 s snippets of continuous audio recordings from different

2.4. Model architecture

The proposed model architectures are based on DenseNet-161
(Huang et al., 2017) and ResNet-50 (He et al., 2016a, 2016b) as well
as different vision transformers (ViT) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Steiner
et al., 2022) for sound event detection.

The design of our SED models is inspired by the 2019 DCASE
workshop and large-scale PANNs for audio pattern recognition (Kong
et al., 2019). DenseNets are utilized to improve the information flow

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model is to classify 397 different bird species. The authors employed three fundamental deep neural network architectures, including vision transformers, for this task. They also integrated up to 19 well-established data augmentation techniques to enhance the accuracy and generalizability of their models. The main goal was to develop an automated system for monitoring avian biodiversity, which would reduce manual labor and require specialized expertise.
