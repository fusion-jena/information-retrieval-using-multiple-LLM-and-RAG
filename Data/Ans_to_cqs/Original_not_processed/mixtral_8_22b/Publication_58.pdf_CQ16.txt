3.4. Sampling Method

The SPOT6 satellite data for our ﬁve study areas were preprocessed to be fed into the
different Deep Learning architectures and the XGBoost model. First, the data were split
into three mutually exclusive parts: a learning set, a validation set and a test set totally
independent of the two previous ones.

Four of the ﬁve areas were used for learning and validation. The last, isolated scene
was then used as the test set. It contained all the classes for the two nomenclatures, the ﬁve
LC classes, and the 12 LU classes. In addition, this image contained all the environments
representing the New Caledonian landscape: urban, mining, mountainous and forest
environment with variations from the coastline to the inland mountain areas. It is on this
entire scene that the ﬁnal confusion matrix and quality metrics were computed.

Table 4. Table 8 presents the results of the LU classiﬁcation on the test area and Table A2, in
the Appendix, presents the results of the LU classiﬁcation on the four training areas.

3.5. Mapping and Confusion Matrix

After ﬁtting the parameters of the different Deep Learning architectures as well as
XGBoost on the training set, they were run on the test set to obtain a complete mapping of
LC and LU as described above. Confusion matrices were extracted from these results. Four
quality metrics are used: Overall Accuracy (OA), Producer Accuracy (PA), User Accuracy
(UA) and the F1-score. The OA takes the sum of the diagonal of the confusion matrix. The
PA takes the number of well-ranked individuals divided by the sum of the column in the
confusion matrix. The UA takes the number of well-ranked individuals divided by the sum
of the line. Finally, the F1-score is calculated as the harmonic mean of precision and recall.
This last metric allows calculating the accuracy of a model by giving an equal importance
between the PA and the UA. Note that the shadow and cloud areas were not taken into
account in the confusion matrix.

All architectures were trained with stochastic gradient descent using a similar protocol,
with a momentum of 0.9 and starting from an initial learning rate of 10−2. Every 20 epochs,
the learning rate is divided by 10 until reaching 10−6.

Neural networks do not perform well when trained with unbalanced data sets [41]. In
the case of “central-pixel labeling” architectures it is possible to make balanced data sets
with the initial pixels selection used for the learning. In the case of “semantic labeling” the
composition of the images makes it more difﬁcult to precisely control the number of pixels
per class. We tried several methods, but found negligible differences in performance. All
reported experiments use the median frequency balancing method.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, we can infer some possibilities based on common practices in machine learning.

In general, training could be considered complete when certain conditions are met, such as achieving a desired level of performance or when further training does not lead to significant improvements. This is often determined by monitoring various metrics during the training process, such as validation loss or accuracy.

From the context, we know that the models were trained using stochastic gradient descent with a momentum of 0.9 and an initial learning rate of 10^-2. The learning rate was decreased every 20 epochs until it reached 10^-6. This suggests that the training might have been stopped after a certain number of epochs or when the decrease in learning rate no longer resulted in improved performance.

However, without explicit mention of the stopping criterion, we cannot definitively state what criteria were used to determine when training was complete.
