However,  although  research  on  the  urban  AE  gained  traction  in 
recent years, sophisticated methods to quantify its complex properties 
on  a  larger  scale  are  still  scarce.  This  is  especially  true  for  big  audio 
datasets, which are so extensive that listening to the files becomes no 
longer  feasible.  To  date,  few  approaches  have  been  used  to  quantify 
large datasets of the urban AE. Classical approaches reach their limits 
when  it  comes  to  analyzing  longer  recording  periods  (e.g.  several 
months) (Gage et al., 2017). In recent years, sound event classification 
using  machine  learning  approaches  became  more  popular  (Phillips 
et al., 2018; Sethi et al., 2022; Stowell et al., 2019; Ulloa et al., 2018), 
but is still not ready to be deployed unconfined (Alcocer et al., 2022). In 
psychoacoustics, mostly smaller field studies have been conducted (Hall 
et  al.,  2013;  Ma  et  al.,  2021;  Montoya-Belmonte  and  Navarro,  2020;

3.2.3. Complex network measures 

After the network is constructed, a plethora of quantitative network 
measures become available (Newman, 2018). We investigate the utility 
of the network’s Average Shortest Path  length (ASPL) for the studied 
networks. ASPL can be defined as (Barab´asi, 2013): 

ASPL =

d(s, t)
n(n (cid:0) 1)

∑

s, t ∈ V
s ∕= t

the  analysis  of  observational  complex  networks  can  inform  novel  ap-
proaches for model representations (e.g. stochastic block models (Fas-
kowitz  et  al.,  2018)).  A  special  feature  of  this  work  is  that  we  have 
concentrated on diel cycles, but concerning the possibility that FCMs can 
be  formed  for  any  recording  groups,  other  time  scales  also  become 
feasible. For instance, networks for days, weeks or months can be build 
or  we  could  even  analyze  networks  within  single  recordings.  Finally, 
evolving networks could reveal transitions in the dynamics of the urban 
AE (Belykh et al., 2014).

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some indications that suggest possible strategies employed by researchers.

Firstly, the mention of large audio datasets implies that diverse data was collected to train the model. The use of such extensive datasets increases the likelihood of capturing various patterns and characteristics present in the urban acoustic environment (AE), thereby improving the model's ability to generalize well across different scenarios.

Secondly, while not explicitly stated, the adoption of machine learning approaches for sound event classification suggests that techniques like cross-validation might have been utilized during training. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into multiple subsets, where each subset serves as a validation set once while the remaining subsets form the training set. This process helps assess the model's performance on unseen data and reduces overfitting, ultimately contributing to better generalization.

Lastly, the reference to psychoacoustics and smaller field studies indicates that stratified sampling may have been applied when collecting data. Stratified sampling ensures that the sample represents all relevant aspects of the population, thus enhancing the model's capacity to capture diverse features of the urban AE.

In conclusion, based on the given context, it appears that the researchers likely employed diverse datasets, cross-validation, and possibly stratified sampling to improve the deep learning model's generalizability. However, without further details, these assumptions remain speculative.
