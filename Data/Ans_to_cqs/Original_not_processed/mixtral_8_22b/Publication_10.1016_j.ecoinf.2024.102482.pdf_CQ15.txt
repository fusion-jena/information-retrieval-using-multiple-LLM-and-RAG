Recent advances in deep learning techniques have revolutionized the 
field  of  ecology,  surpassing  the  predictive  performance  of  traditional 
methods and giving rise to innovative prediction systems (Capinha et al., 
2021). Deep learning technology has achieved notable success in various 
applications, including the vocalization detection of the North Atlantic 
right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) (Padovese et al., 2023), the recognition 
of soybean leaf diseases (Yu et al., 2023), bird vocalization recognition 
(Xie et al., 2023), and the monitoring of biological soil crusts (Herdy 
et  al.,  2024).  These  diverse  research  efforts  demonstrated  the  recent 
advancements and promising results achieved by applying deep learning 
techniques to ecological data.

2.2. Feature extraction 

To  solve  problems  using  the  machine  learning  method,  extracting 
features from the raw data to be used as inputs for the machine learning 
model is necessary. Although the importance of feature extraction has 
decreased with the introduction of deep learning, there are still aspects 
where features play a key role, such as considering the computing power 
of devices, reducing training time, and ensuring real-time performance 
in decision-making. 

In  this paper,  we used  the BLS  entropy profile to  characterize the 
swimming behavior of C. elegans, as in the work by Jeong et al. (2019). 
The BLS profile has also been used to calculate the Levenshtein distance, 
an indicator of how similar two sequences are, in order to illuminate the 
similarities  and  differences  in  swimming  patterns  of  C.  elegans  in  a 
controlled and chemical-contaminated water environment (Kang et al.,

As a machine learning model capable of using diverse information 
for  data  represented  as  a  graph,  the  Graph  Neural  Network  (GNN) 

presents  a  potential  solution  (Zhou  et  al.,  2020).  Recently,  the  GNN 
model has been increasingly applied in various fields of ecology, such as 
studies on air quality prediction (Dun et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2021) and 
water quality prediction (Li et al., 2024). By representing the swimming 
behavior of C. elegans as a UBN, a kind of graph, the GNN could incor-
porate information, such as distinguishing the head and tail or the di-
rection  of  movement.  Furthermore,  the  GNN  can  be  combined  with 
LSTM, leading to the possibility of constructing a hybrid model (Con-
cepcion et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2020). This hybrid model could provide 
a basis for the design of a biomonitoring system, offering expectations 
for improved performance and utility.

Helpful Answer:
Although the given context does not explicitly mention specific optimization techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), it provides insights into the application of deep learning methods in ecology. The papers cited discuss various applications of deep learning models, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) for tasks like streamflow forecasting, air quality prediction, and water resource management.

Optimization techniques are crucial components of any deep learning pipeline, as they help minimize the loss function during the training process. While the context does not directly address these techniques, it is important to note that popular optimization algorithms like SGD and Adam are commonly employed in deep learning pipelines.

SGD is a simple yet effective optimization technique that updates the weights of the model iteratively based on the gradient of the loss function. On the other hand, Adam combines the advantages of both SGD and another optimization algorithm called Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp) to adaptively adjust the learning rate for each weight individually.

In conclusion, while the given context does not specifically mention optimization techniques like SGD or Adam, their use is implicit when employing deep learning models in ecological studies. These optimization techniques play a vital role in improving the accuracy and efficiency of deep learning models in various ecological applications.
