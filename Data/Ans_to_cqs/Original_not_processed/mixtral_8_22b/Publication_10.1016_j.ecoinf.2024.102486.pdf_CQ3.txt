the  proportion  of  articles  using  GPU  computing  rose  rapidly  from 
approximately 1% in 2016 and 2017 to 12–15% in 2021–2023. By far 
the most common use (139 of 143 articles, i.e., 97%) was in machine

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does discuss some general aspects related to deep learning and its application in various fields like ecology and wildlife population modeling.

In terms of deep learning, the context mentions several libraries and frameworks commonly used for developing and implementing deep learning models, including TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch. These tools often include functionalities for handling different types of data annotations, but the specific methods used would depend on the particular dataset and problem being addressed.

Additionally, the context refers to a few papers discussing image and sound recognition tasks, which may involve data annotation techniques like object detection, semantic segmentation, or even more specialized forms of labeling depending on the nature of the task. For example, Nanni et al. (2020) focus on analyzing acoustic recordings, while other studies mentioned in the context deal with visual image analysis.

However, without further information about these specific research projects, we cannot definitively determine what type of data annotation techniques they employed within their respective deep learning pipelines.
