Yuan et al. (2022) claimed that the superior performance of a ViT can 
primarily be attributed to extensive pre-training data. If a ViT is trained 
from  scratch  on  a  medium-sized  dataset,  its  performance  lags  behind 
that of a CNN model with comparable parameter sizes. To address this 
limitation, they proposed Volo with the novel Outlook Attention as the 
token mixer module, which enabled fine-grained token representation 
and the aggregation of global information.

2.2. Transformer-like model 

Transformer  was  proposed  by  Vaswani  et  al.  (2017)  and  initially 
designed for Seq2Seq tasks, replacing long short-term memory (LSTM) 
with a full-attention structure. It was primarily applied in NLP, and both 
the  transformer  and  its  subsequent  iterations  demonstrated  excellent 
performance in a wide range of downstream tasks. With the success of 
the transformer in NLP, researchers have begun to explore its applica-
tion in CV. 

The core structure of the transformer-like visual model is an encoder 
module, which comprises several stacked blocks. Each block consists of 
two  components:  a  token  mixer  module  (Yu  et  al.,  2022)  for  fusing 
spatial information and an MLP module for fusing channel information. 
The main distinction among the different transformer-like visual models 
lies in the variations in the token mixer module. For example, the token 
mixer in a ViT (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) is a self-attention module.

As  the  transformer  model  (Vaswani  et  al.,  2017)  has  achieved 
remarkable  progress  in  natural  language  processing  (NLP),  the  vision 
transformer  (ViT)  paradigm  (Dosovitskiy  et  al.,  2020)  has  gradually 
gained prominence in computer vision (CV). Recently, Liu et al. (2022) 
introduced  transformer-based  methods  for  pest  and  disease  classifica-
tions. They proposed a self-supervised transformer pre-training method 
based  on  feature  relationship  conditional  filtering  (FRCF)  and  latent 
semantic masking auto-encoder (LSMAE), which attained an accuracy of 
74.69%  on  the  IP102  dataset.  Peng  and  Wang  (2022)  proposed  a 
network combining a CNN and transformer structures. They used a CNN 
to extract representative features from the input images and employed a 
novel  classification  head  to  fully  leverage  the  spatial  information  of 
these  features.  Their  method  achieved  classification  accuracies  of

2.1. CNN-like model 

CNN is a classical model in CV, renowned for its robust translational 
invariance and ability to extract high-level semantic features. ResNet, 
proposed by He et al. (2016), is a well-known CNN model with a core 
structure of residual units. This innovative design addresses the issue of 
gradient disappearance as the number of layers increases. This allows for 
a  greater  depth  in  the  network,  leading  to  the  extraction  of  more 
expressive  features.  ResNet  has  exhibited  superior  performance 
compared with previous models in various downstream recognition and 
detection tasks.

Helpful Answer:

The given text does not provide specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, I can share some general knowledge regarding common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. These include:

1. Bounding Box Annotation: This technique involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects within an image or video frame. The coordinates of these boxes are then stored along with their respective labels. This approach is commonly used for object detection tasks.

2. Instance Segmentation: Unlike bounding box annotation, instance segmentation provides pixel-wise labeling of each individual object within an image. This results in precise delineation of object boundaries, making it suitable for applications requiring accurate object localization.

3. Semantic Segmentation: In contrast to instance segmentation, semantic segmentation focuses on categorizing every pixel into a particular class without distinguishing between instances of the same class. This technique is often used for scene understanding tasks such as autonomous driving.

4. Polygon Annotation: Similar to bounding box annotation, polygon annotation involves outlining objects using vertices instead of rectangles. This method offers better precision when dealing with irregularly shaped objects.

5. Landmark/Key Point Annotation: Used mainly for facial recognition and pose estimation tasks, landmark annotation involves marking specific points on an object or person. These key points help define the shape and orientation of the subject matter.

6. Image Classification: A simpler form of annotation where entire images are labeled based on their content. This technique is widely used for training models to recognize broad categories like animals, vehicles, etc.
