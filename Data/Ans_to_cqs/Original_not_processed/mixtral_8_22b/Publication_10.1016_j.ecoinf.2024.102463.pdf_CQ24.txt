The key idea behind Hyperband is to explore several configurations 
in parallel while allocating more training resources to promising con-
figurations. This enables a more efficient search of the hyperparameter 
space, particularly when computational resources are limited. In sum-
mary, Hyperband combines an initial random search with a ‘successive 
halving’  strategy  to  quickly  identify  promising  configurations  while 
eliminating those that show inferior performance. 

The  detail  of  the  grid  of  possible  combinations  is  presented.  The 
number of convolution layers is lower than that given in the article, the 
network has two convolution layers. Their size and the associated max- 
pooling will be determined in the following interval for each:

the prediction of two outputs on alpha and beta radioactivity. To our 
knowledge, there is no study on the use of data models to predict 137Cs 
concentrations  in  a  nuclearized  river.  Notably,  there  are  no  deeper 
networks applied to this topic or the use of the temporality of the data

2.  Partial training: Models are partially trained (on a small fraction of 
the data) to quickly eliminate underperforming configurations.  
3.  Successive Halving: The remaining configurations are grouped into 
sets of different sizes, and the associated models are trained further. 
The best-performing configurations in each set are promoted to the 
next  stage,  while 
the  under-performing  configurations  are 
eliminated. 

4. Repeat: Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until only one configuration re-
mains, which is then considered the best configuration found.

Helpful Answer:
Hyperband, a method used for optimizing hyperparameters in machine learning algorithms, employs several strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. One such strategy is partial training, where models are initially trained on a small fraction of the data to quickly eliminate underperforming configurations. This approach helps manage the variability introduced by random initialization of weights and biases in neural networks. Another strategy used by Hyperband is successive halving, which involves grouping the remaining configurations into sets of different sizes and training them further. Only the best-performing configurations from each set are promoted to the next stage, while underperforming ones are eliminated. By iteratively repeating these steps, Hyperband efficiently explores various configurations in parallel while allocating more training resources to promising ones. This process allows for a more effective search of the hyperparameter space, especially when computational resources are limited. Additionally, Hyperband combines an initial random search with a'successive halving' strategy to rapidly identify promising configurations while eliminating those with inferior performance. These techniques help mitigate the impact of randomness in the deep learning pipeline, ultimately leading to improved model performance and stability.
