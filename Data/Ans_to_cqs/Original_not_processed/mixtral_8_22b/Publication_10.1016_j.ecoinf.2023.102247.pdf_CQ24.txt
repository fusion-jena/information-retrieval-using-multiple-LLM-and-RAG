To  predict  the  distribution  of  the  study  species,  we  employed  an 
ensemble  modeling  approach  in  BIOMOD2  package  (Thuiller  et  al., 
2009) in R (R Development Core Team, 2014) (See text S1). With this 
approach,  we  weight  averaged  four  different  models,  including  one 
regression-based 
three 
machine-learning  (Maximun  entropy  (MaxEnt),  RF(Random  Forest), 
and  Support  Vector  Machines  (SVM))  models,  to  generate  a  final 
ensembled model for each species. To test for model performance, we 
employed cross-validationby using 70% of the dataset as training data to 
build  the  models  and  the  other  30%  as  testing  data  to  calculate  the 
models’  accuracy. The Area Under the Receiving Operator Character-
istics Curve is the index we used to specify the accuracy (AUC). AUC is a 
scale that ranges from 0.5 to 1.0. A higher AUC value indicates that the 
model  is  more  accurate  (Phillips  and  Dudík,  2008).  We  considered  a

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The authors do not directly address handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or setting specific random seed values. However, they use ensemble modeling techniques to improve prediction accuracy by combining multiple machine learning algorithms. This can help reduce variability caused by random factors such as initial weights or biases in neural networks. Additionally, they employ cross-validation with separate training and testing datasets to evaluate their models, which also helps mitigate the impact of randomness on results.

Unhelpful Answer:
The article does not provide information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or setting specific random seed values. Therefore, it is impossible to determine what strategies were employed to manage these aspects.
