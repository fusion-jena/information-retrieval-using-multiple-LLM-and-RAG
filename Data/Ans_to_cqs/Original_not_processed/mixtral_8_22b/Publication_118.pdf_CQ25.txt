has been highly annotated and used in previous studies. The extensive 
annotation of the dataset allowed the feature representation produced 
by the auto-encoder to be easily evaluated and to be trained on a higher

3.3. Network architecture 

The architecture used was a heavily modified version of that used in 
“Unsupervised Deep Learning with Pytorch” by github user “eelxpeng” 
(eelxpeng, 2018). As the size of our audio spectrograms has been con-
strained to 128 × 128 pixel RGB images with values repeated in each 
color channel to produce a greyscale image. For this initial experiment 
testing  the feasibility of using an auto-encoder-generated feature rep-
resentation for ecoacoustic analysis, we chose a basic auto-encoder ar-
chitecture  to  minimise  the  complications  that  may  be  introduced  by 
more advanced architectures. A rectified linear unit (ReLU) based acti-
vation function was be used, to help mitigate the vanishing/exploding 
gradient  problem  (Xu  et  al.,  2015).  Networks  using  implicit  pooling 
(determined using pytorch) and explicit max-pooling were used.

For  deep  learning  tasks  you  often  start  from  a  point  of  labelling 
training your data. However this can be slow and problematic. It can be 
useful to have a general representation for machine learning, that does 
not  rely  on  labeled  data  or  domain  specific  features.  This  paper  will 
focus on the use of auto-encoders for automatic feature extraction. First 
we  will  explore  the  relevant  literature,  then  explain  our  method  for 
automatically learning features, our method for comparing with other 
feature  representations,  results,  and  finally  our  discussion  and 
conclusions. 

The outcome of this research is an alternative method for analysing 
eco-acoustic  data.  It  will  be  of  significance  to  the  fields  of  Machine 
Learning and Soundscape Ecology. This research will be of direct benefit

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, it can be inferred that the model is being used for unsupervised feature extraction, specifically through the use of an auto-encoder. Auto-encoders are typically used for dimensionality reduction or denoising purposes, but they can also be used for generating new data samples or anomaly detection. In this case, the authors mention that they are testing the feasibility of using an auto-encoder generated feature representation for ecoacoustic analysis. Therefore, it can be assumed that the goal of the deep learning model is to extract meaningful features from the audio spectrograms that can be used for further analysis in the field of soundscape ecology.
