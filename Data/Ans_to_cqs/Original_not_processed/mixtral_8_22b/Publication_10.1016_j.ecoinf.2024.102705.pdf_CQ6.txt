The term “deep learning” refers to the utilization of neural networks, 
a statistical model for data representation in solving complex problems 
(LeCun  et  al.,  2015;  Christopher  and  Hugh,  2024).  These  neural  net-
works are constructed through training, involving a large set of inputs 
and  labeled outputs. Comprising layered nonlinear transformations, a 
neural  network  contains  numerous  adjustable  parameters.  Training  a 
neural network requires multiple iterations, during which the network 
may produce incorrect results. The discrepancy between the current and 
expected outputs is calculated as loss values. Optimization algorithms 
such as Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) (Herbert and Sutton, 1951), 
Adaptive Gradient (AdaGrad) (Duchi et al., 2011), Root Mean Square 
Prop (RMSProp) (Tieleman and Hinton, 2012), and Adam (Kingma and 
Ba, 2014) are then employed to assess each parameter’s contribution to

feature representations, which are crucial for predicting the threshold of 
image  processing  algorithms  (Wang  et  al.,  2018).  In  this  study,  we 
propose a compact network incorporating a non-local layer capable of 
extracting  long-distance  features  to  predict  parameters  for  the  image 
processing module. Additionally, we introduce a joint training approach 
for image adaptive enhancement modules and deep learning models to 
ensure  that  the  image  processing  results  contribute  to  improved  per-
formance  of  the  deep  learning  model.  The  proposed  method  demon-
strates superior performance across a diverse range of environments. it 
enables  expedited  transitions  from  field  surveys  to  reporting,  even  in 
challenging circumstances, thereby facilitating efficient data collection 
and analysis on a larger scale.

3.1. Implementation details 

The training protocol outlined by (Redmon and Farhadi, 2018) was 
followed during the training process. The YOLOv3 model served as the 
baseline for all experiments. To expand the training dataset, various data 
augmentation  techniques  were  employed,  including  random  adjust-
ments to image size, image flipping, cropping, and conversion. The AIP- 
OD  model  was  trained  using  the  Adam  optimizer  (Kingma  and  Ba, 
2014). The training process consisted of 150 epochs with a batch size of 
(cid:0) 4and gradually decreased to 
4. The learning rate initially started at 10
over  the  course  of  training.  The  experiments  were  conducted  using 
Tensorflow 1.14 and executed on a GTX2080Ti GPU. 

3.2. Evaluating indicator 

The evaluation of models commonly utilizes Average Precision (AP) 
as a mainstream performance metric. AP represents the area under the 
precision-recall curve, denoted as P (precision) and R (recall) at different 
thresholds.

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be applied to the input data to improve its quality and ensure better performance. Some common preprocessing steps include:

1. Normalization: This involves rescaling the input data so that they fall within a specific range, typically between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. Normalization helps prevent any single feature from dominating the others due to differences in scales. It also improves convergence speed during optimization.

2. Scaling: Similar to normalization, scaling involves changing the range of input data but without necessarily restricting them to a fixed interval. For example, one might use standardization, where the mean value of each feature is subtracted from every sample, followed by dividing the result by the standard deviation. Scaling ensures that all features have equal importance and contributes to faster convergence.

3. Cleaning: Data cleaning involves removing noise, outliers, missing values, and irrelevant information from the input data. Noise reduction can be achieved through smoothing techniques like moving averages or Gaussian filters. Outlier detection methods such as z-score or interquartile range (IQR) can help identify extreme values that may negatively impact model performance. Missing values can either be filled using imputation strategies or removed entirely if their absence does not significantly affect the overall dataset.

4. Augmentation: Data augmentation techniques involve creating new samples by applying transformations to existing ones. Common examples include rotation, translation, zooming, flipping, and cropping. Augmentation increases the diversity of the training dataset, making the model more robust against overfitting and improving generalizability.

In the given context, the authors mention employing various data augmentation techniques, including random adjustments to image size, image flipping, cropping, and conversion. However, other preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning are not explicitly mentioned.
