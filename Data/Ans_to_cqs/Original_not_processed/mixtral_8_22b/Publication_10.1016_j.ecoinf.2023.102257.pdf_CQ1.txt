Maine, USA (January–September 2022) using three tagging methods (one with ML bounding box assistance and 
two  without  assistance).  We  used  a  generalized  linear  mixed  model  to  examine  the  influence  of  ML  model 
performance  and  tagging  method  on  tagging  efficiency.  We  found  that  ML  bounding  boxes  offer  significant 
improvement in tagging efficiency when labelling data compared to unassisted tagging. Additionally, the time 
taken to label with bounding boxes was not statistically different from an unassisted tagging approach. However, 
we  found  that  gains  in  efficiency  are  contingent  on  the  ML  algorithm’s  performance  and  that  incorrect  ML 
predictions, particularly the 4.2% false positive and 3.6% false negative predictions, can slow the tagging process 
compared to a non-hybrid approach. These findings indicate that although practitioners usually forgo the pro-

Helpful Answer:
The article discusses the use of trail cameras or camera traps for wildlife monitoring as part of a deep learning pipeline. Camera traps are remote, motion-activated devices that capture images or videos of animals in their natural habitats. The collected data is then labeled manually by human experts, which can be a time-consuming task. To improve this process, machine learning models such as bounding box algorithms have been developed to assist in data labeling. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of these models in improving tagging efficiency while considering factors like model performance and potential errors. Other relevant studies mentioned in the materials and methods section also focus on utilizing camera trap images for various purposes, such as detecting and classifying ungulates, identifying empty images in camera-trap data, and comparing deep learning techniques with citizen science approaches for counting wildlife in aerial survey images.
