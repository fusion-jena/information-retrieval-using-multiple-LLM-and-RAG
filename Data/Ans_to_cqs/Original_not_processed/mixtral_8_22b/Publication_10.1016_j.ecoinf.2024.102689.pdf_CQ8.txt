GPU  and  utilizes  CUDA  version  11.4.  Python  3.6  serves  as  the  pro-
gramming language, and Pytorch version 1.8.0 is used in conjunction 
with  the  virtual  environment  function  of  Anaconda3.  Optimization  is 
carried out using the Adam optimizer with a Momentum of 0.9 and a 
Batch size of 16. Images are processed at a resolution of 1024 × 1024, 
with an initial learning rate set at 0.001 and a minimum learning rate of 
0.0001. The descent mode is step, and training spans 300 epochs.

tanayak  et  al.,  2021).  Furthermore,  we  will  explore  knowledge 
distillation methods, which have been surveyed extensively and proven 
effective  in  model  compression  through  distillation  and  quantization 
(Gou  et  al.,  2021;  Polino  et  al.,  2018  preprint:  not  peer  reviewed). 
Through this comprehensive suite of improvements and optimizations, 
we aspire to develop lightweight yet powerful fish individual recogni-
tion algorithms, thereby providing robust technical support for intelli-
gent aquaculture and marine ecological protection initiatives.

As deep learning continues to flourish, a myriad of researchers has 
pivoted  their  focus  towards  animal  individual  recognition,  aiming  to 
gain  deeper  insights  into  animal  behavior,  growth  status,  and  more. 
However,  the  pursuit  of  animal  individual  recognition  necessitates  a 
substantial  dataset  of  animal  images,  and  acquiring  such  datasets  is 
often challenging. To overcome the hurdle of dataset collection, Ferreira 
et al. (2020) developed a program that autonomously gathers training 
data, generates training datasets, and trains Convolutional Neural Net-
works (CNNs) for their study on small bird individual recognition. This 
approach  alleviates  the  need  for  manual  annotation  and  independent 
neural network training.

%Query
Query: "Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information regarding the specific location or platform where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available is not explicitly mentioned within the given context. Therefore, it cannot be determined from these sources alone whether the code repository can be found on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other similar service. Further research would be required to locate the exact repository.
