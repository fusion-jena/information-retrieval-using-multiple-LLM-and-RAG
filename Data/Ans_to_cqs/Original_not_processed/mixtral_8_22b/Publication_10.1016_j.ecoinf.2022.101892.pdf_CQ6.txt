different VGG nets, such as VGG-11, VGG-16, and VGG-19. VGG-16 has 
been applied in many researches and it is often used to extract features in 
the age estimation tasks Pan et al. (2018). In this study, we replaced the 
last three Fully-Connected (FC) layers of the original VGG model with 
one FC layer to reduce parameters. And we adopt Batch Normalization 
(BN) (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015) to accelerate the training of networks. 
For this study, we selected VGG-11-BN and VGG-16-BN to extract the 
features from panda facial images.

We  used  Pytorch  to  build  our  deep  neural  network,  which  was 
trained on Nvidia V100 GPU. In order to accelerate the convergence of 
the model, our model was pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset (Deng 
et  al., 2009) and then independently  fine-tuned on our  PAD Full and 
PAD Lite datasets. However, some individuals cross multiple age groups. 
Thus, to eliminate the influence of individuals, we applied a five-fold 
subject-exclusive  (SE)  (Han  et  al.,  2014;  Pan  et  al.,  2018)  which 
ensured the same subject did not appear in the training set and testing 
set at the same time. We downscaled the resolution of all images to 224 
× 224 pixels before feeding them to seven models. To avoid overfitting 
and imbalanced problem, we applied aggressive data augmentation. Our 
original images were captured under different illumination and angles. 
Thus, we augmented all training sets randomly via horizontal flipping,

2.2.2. ResNet 

However,  with  the  network  depth  increasing,  the  degradation 
problem has been exposed. The degradation indicates that the gradient 
vanishing will limit the performance of the network. Inspired by VGG 
nets, ResNet (He et al., 2016) was proposed to address this problem by 
adding identity mapping (two-branch architecture). ResNets have lower 
complexity and higher performance. In this work, we used ResNet-18 
and ResNet-50 as backbone networks for our experiments. 

2.2.3. RepVGG 

Multi-branch architectures have better performance during training, 
but inference speed is limited. Thus, RepVGG was developed to use a re- 
parameterization technique to decouple the training-time multi-branch 
and inference-time plain architecture to increase inference speed while 
maintaining performance (Ding et al., 2021). RepVGG models are over 
80% faster than ResNets with better performance. And RepVGG-A0 and 
RepVGG-A1 were applied in our experiments.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about specific preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it mentions two important preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning models. Firstly, the resolution of all images was downscaled to 224 × 224 pixels before being fed into the models. This step helps to standardize input dimensions and can also help improve computational efficiency. Secondly, the text mentions applying aggressive data augmentation to avoid overfitting and imbalance problems. Data augmentation techniques can include various transformations like rotation, zooming, cropping, and flipping, among others. These techniques help create more diverse training samples and improve the robustness of the trained models.
