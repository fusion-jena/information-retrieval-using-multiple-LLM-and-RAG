H. ovalis) with a max stride of 32. It is worth noting that data augmen-
tation is a well-proven and common technique to avoid overfitting and 
to render a model generalised. We applied random cropping, horizontal/ 
vertical flipping, image rotation, image translation, zooming, brightness 
adjustment,  contrast  adjustment,  hue  and  saturation  adjustment, 
gaussian  noise,  random  erasing  both  of  our  models  training,  which 
helped increase the size and variability of our dataset.

bottom-up  path,  which  improves  low-level  feature  propagation.  By 
linking the feature grid with all feature levels, adaptive feature pooling 
is used to propagate useful information directly between feature levels. 
PANet uses more accurate localisation signals in lower layers of the 
network, which enhances the location accuracy of objects. Finally, the 
head section generates three different sizes (18 × 18,36 × 36,72 × 72) of 
feature maps to enable multiscale prediction and help the model handle 
small, medium and large objects. The CSPDarknet backbone extracts the 
feature from the input data, and then these feature maps are fed into the 
PANet for feature fusion. Finally, the head layer predicts the class, score 
and location of the objects (Xu et al., 2021).

A  novel  compound  scaling  method  was  proposed  in  EfficientNet, 
which  uses  a  compound  coefficient  ϕ  to  scale  uniformly  and  adjust 
dynamically three parameters’  depth α, width β  and resolution γ  in a 
principled way: 

depth : d = αϕ
width : w = βϕ
resolution : r = γϕ
s.t. α.β2.γ2 ≈ 2 α ≥ 1, β ≥ 1, γ ≥ 1.

where constant α, β and γ is determined by the grid search operation. 
User-specified coefficient ϕ  controls the available resources for model 
scaling, while constant α, β and γ identify the way to assign these extra 
resources to network width, depth and resolution, respectively. 

3. Methodology

Helpful Answer:
After the model training step, there are several postprocessing steps that can be taken to evaluate the performance of the model and visualize its predictions. Some examples include:

* Saliency Maps: A saliency map is a heatmap that highlights the regions of an input image that contribute most strongly to the output of a neural network. This can be helpful for understanding what features the model is focusing on when making its predictions.
* Metrics Calculation: Various metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy can be calculated to quantify the performance of the model. These metrics provide insight into how well the model is able to correctly classify or detect objects within images.
* Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification algorithm. Each row represents the instances in an actual class, while each column represents the instances in a predicted class. The diagonal elements represent the number of points for which the predicted label is equal to the true label, while off-diagonal elements are those that are mislabeled by the classifier.

In addition to these postprocessing steps, it may also be necessary to perform other tasks such as threshold tuning, non-maximum suppression, or bounding box regression depending on the specific requirements of the application.
