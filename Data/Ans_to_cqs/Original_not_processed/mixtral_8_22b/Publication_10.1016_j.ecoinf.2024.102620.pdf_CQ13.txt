Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

The  PLUS  model  consists  of  two  main  modules:  the  transformed 
specification mining framework based on the land expansion analysis 
strategy (LEAS) module and the cellular automata (CA) model based on 
a multi-type random patch seed mechanism (CARS). In the LEAS mod-
ule, the PLUS model employs the random forest algorithm to obtain the 
development probabilities of each land use type based on two periods of 
land use data. This approach is considered superior to the FLUS model, 
which  uses  an  artificial  neural  network  (ANN)  to  determine  develop-
ment  probabilities  based  on  only  one  period  of  land  use  data.  Addi-
tionally,  the  PLUS  model  proposes  a  decreasing  threshold  rule  for 
generating  patch  seeds.  This  gradual  constraint  on  patch  growth  of 
various land use types is achieved through the iterative process. Cells 
with a higher total probability are more likely to change preferentially

Here, Tε1(x, t) represents the limiting effect of vegetation at low and 
high temperatures, while Tε2(x, t) denotes the ambient temperature to 
which the vegetation is exposed. Wε(x, t) signifies the effect of humidity 
conditions  on  the  use  of  light  energy.  εmax  represents  the  vegetation 
conversion efficiency to APAR under an ideal condition, signifying the 
maximum percentage utilization of the light energy. Parameter εmax  is 
pivotal  for  calculating  light  use  efficiency  in  the  model  and  its  value 
varies  according  to  region  and  vegetation  type.  Huang  et  al.  (2023) 
applied  the  CASA  model  to  estimate  NPP  in  the  ASEAN  region  by 
exploring and adopting locally εmax  value. In this research, we employed 
the εmax  value proposed by Zhu et al. (2007), which is suitable for the 
Chinese region and has been utilized for regional-scale NPP estimation 
(Xiao et al., 2022). The εmax  of each vegetation type used in this research

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no information available regarding the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model such as learning rate or optimizer. The given context primarily discusses the PLUS model, which is not explicitly stated to be a deep learning model. Furthermore, it focuses on the components of the PLUS model, including the LEAS module and the CA model based on the CARS mechanism. It also mentions the application of the random forest algorithm within the LEAS module but does not provide any details about specific hyperparameters related to a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information based on the given context.
