the satellite. The labeling part determines the labeling methodology for 
training  the  deep  learning  model.  In  the  classification  part,  a  deep 
learning model was trained based on the results of previous steps. The 
target PSI, which has the same format as the trained PSI, can be classi-
fied using the trained model. Here, the format refers to the spatial res-
olution and spectral band used, interval in PSI, and chronological order 
of  each  band.  If  satellite  imagery  accumulates  owing  to  continuous 
satellite observations, the PSI can also be continuously generated, and 
classification can be continued using the model. This enables PCF land 
monitoring.

To generate training data for the PCF, 16,660 grid cells with a res-
olution  of  2560  m  were  created  in  South  Korea.  This  resolution  was 
selected because the training unit of the U-Net model was 256 pixels, 
and 2560 m contains 256 pixels of Sentinel-2 with a 10 m resolution. 
Fig. 6a and b show the extracted results, where 8330 cells (half of the 
total) were randomly extracted as a mask for training data in Fig. 6a, and 
3,332 cells (20% of the total) were randomly extracted as a mask for 
validation data in Fig. 6b. The PSI was extracted from Fig. 6a and b to 
prepare input data for model training. The sub-class land-cover map of 
South Korea can be transformed into a macro-class land-cover map by 
converting all sub-class items into macro-class items (Fig. 4). This con-
version  process  resulted  in  the  production  of  a  completely  converted 
sub-class  land-cover  map  of  South  Korea,  as  shown  in  Fig.  6c.  Addi-

The use of deep learning models has become prevalent across various 
scientific  fields.  Specifically,  these  models  have  demonstrated  excep-
tional  performance  in  image  classification.  Consequently,  numerous 
researchers are employing these models for land-cover classification and 
extraction of ecological information (Capinha et al., 2021; Jagannathan 
and Divya, 2021; Kırbas¸ and Çifci, 2022; Passah and Kandar, 2023). The 
U-Net model, a type of convolutional neural network (CNN), is a deep 
learning  algorithm  that  performs  classification  through  supervised 
learning  (Ulmas  and  Liiv,  2020).  The  model  was  trained  using  both 
training and validation data, and classification was performed based on 
these data (Kattenborn et al., 2021). Consequently, the availability of 
labeling data is crucial for U-Net model applications. However, in North 
Korea, there is no official land-cover map based on national-scale field

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model such as the U-Net model mentioned in the given context, several preprocessing steps may be involved depending on the specific requirements of the dataset and the problem being addressed. While the exact preprocessing steps are not explicitly stated in the provided context, some common techniques often employed include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing or correcting any inconsistencies, errors, or missing values within the dataset. It ensures that the model receives accurate and reliable inputs during training.

2. Normalization or Scaling: These techniques help adjust the range of feature values so they fall within a similar scale. For instance, pixel intensities in images might be normalized between 0 and 1. This step helps improve the convergence speed and overall performance of the model.

3. Labeling: As indicated in the context, generating labeled data is essential for training a supervised learning model like the U-Net model. Labeled data consists of input features along with their corresponding output labels. In this case, the target PSI with the same format as the trained PSI needs to be classified using the trained model.

4. Data Augmentation: Although not directly mentioned in the context, data augmentation is another commonly used technique to increase the size of the training set artificially. This can involve applying transformations such as rotations, flips, or zooming to existing samples, thereby creating new ones.

While these are general preprocessing steps typically applied when working with deep learning models, it should be noted that the specific methods and techniques required will depend on the unique characteristics of the dataset and the objectives of the project.
