Nowadays, machine learning and the artificial neural network (ANN) 
computational technique are emerging tools which has put forth a va-
riety  of  remarkable  advancements  in  algorithms  and  processing  tech-
niques. These techniques have been capable of developing models for 
accurate  prediction  utilizing  correlation  patterns  between  input  and 
output datasets, and have been utilized to solve problems in biological 
sciences  (Haykin,  1994;  Kolay  and  Baser,  2014;  Lashkarblooki  et  al., 
2012; Tufail et al., 2008; Yilmaz and Kaynar, 2011). Some researchers 
have  used  image  analysis  with  machine  learning  (ML),  deep  learning 
(DL) and model combination (MC) techniques to identify, monitor and 
estimate plant disease severity under field conditions (Alves et al., 2022; 
Mzoughi  and  Yahiaoui,  2023;  Singh  et  al.,  2022,  2023).  Moreover, 
Revathi and Hemalatha (2014) and Caldeira et al. (2021) have used ML

2.2. Machine learning and deep learning tools 

In the present study machine learning (bootstrap forest, boosted tree) 
and deep learning (artificial neural network) models were employed to 
forecast  the  percent  disease  incidence  of  CLCuD  under  the  prevailing 
weather data on minimum, maximum and average temperature, stan-
dard meteorological week (SMW)-wise growing degree days (henceforth 
mentioned  as  GDD),  minimum  relative  humidity  (RHmini.),  maximum 
relative humidity (RHmax.), average relative humidity (RHave.), cumu-
lative rainfall (mm) and whitefly per three leaves. The weather param-
eters recorded from 2011 to 2019 at weather stations based at all four 
locations  were  used  for  calculating  the  GDD  as  per  the  following 
equations.

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is important to note that data annotation plays a crucial role in training deep learning models. Commonly used data annotation techniques include bounding box annotation, where objects within images are identified by drawing rectangles around them, and instance segmentation, where each pixel in an image is classified according to the object or class it belongs to. Other techniques include semantic segmentation, landmark annotation, polygon annotation, and key point annotation. Each technique serves different purposes depending on the type of problem being solved and the nature of the dataset. In this case, since the research focuses on forecasting the percentage of disease incidence using machine learning and deep learning models, it can be assumed that some form of data annotation was likely used during the development of these models. However, without further information, we cannot determine the exact data annotation techniques used in this particular study.
