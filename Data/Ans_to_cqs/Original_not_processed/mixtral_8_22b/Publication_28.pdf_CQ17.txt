Stochastic  gradient  descent  (SGD)  on  BP  is  managing  stochastic 
input,  then  not  stochastic  unit  within  the  networks.  The  solution  is 
named as “reparameterization trick”, which is to transfer the sampling 
to input layer. It is easy from N(μ(x), θ(x)) by sampling ∈ ~ N(0, I), af-
terward calculating pmodelz = μ(x) + θ1/2(x) * e. Where μ(x) and θ(x) are 
the mean and covariance of (z| x). So, Eq. (13) is calculated as:

In VAE is comprised of input layer, various AEs, and output layer. 
Then, an unsupervised pre-training step, the supervised fine-tuning step 
is implemented for learning the entire network parameters by employ-
ing the BP technique. This technique is comprised of 1 input layer, 5 
hidden layers, and 1 output layer.

1.2. Paper's contribution 

This  paper  presents  a  new  parameter  tuned  deep  learning  based 
EfficientNet model with Variational Autoencoder (PTDLEN-VAE) model 
for satellite imagery analysis on ecology management. The goal of the 
PTDLEN-VAE model is to examine the satellite images using DL model 
for  ecological  condition  monitoring.  Initially,  the  satellite  images  are 
pre-processed to improve the contrast level of the image. Besides, the 
PTDLEN based feature extractor is utilized using EfficientNet model for

satellite image classification using deep learning approach. In: Machine Learning

A  detailed  comparative  outcomes  analysis  of  the  PTDLEN-VAE 
manner  takes  place  with  other  techniques  on  the  AIM  dataset  in 
Table 4 and Fig. 9 (Li et al., 2020). From the outcomes, it can be obvious 
that  the  CNN-RBFNN,  CA-CNN–BiLSTM,  and  CNN  manners have  out-
performed  least  performance  over  the  other  techniques.  In  line  with, 
MLRSSC-CGNN-SGAT,  MLRSSC-CGNN-MLGAT,  and  AL-RCNN  algo-
rithms have accomplished reasonably closer results. Besides, the DLEN- 
LSTM,  DLEN-DNN,  and  DLEN-VAE  approaches  have  resulted  in 
competitive  outcomes  with  respect  to  various  measures.  But,  the

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The paper does not explicitly mention any specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, the use of variational autoencoders (VAEs) in the proposed PTDLEN-VAE model could potentially help mitigate overfitting due to their ability to learn more robust representations of data through the incorporation of stochasticity during training. Additionally, the use of efficient preprocessing techniques like histogram equalization and normalization may also contribute to reducing overfitting by improving the quality and consistency of the input data.
