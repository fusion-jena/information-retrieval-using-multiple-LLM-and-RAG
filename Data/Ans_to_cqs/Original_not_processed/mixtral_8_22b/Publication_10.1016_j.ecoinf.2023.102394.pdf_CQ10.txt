The  successful  prediction  is  also  attributed  to  the  robust  deep 
learning models. Lamichhane et al. (2019) reviewed soil carbon map-
ping methods and reported that deep learning is a promising technique 
for improving SOC prediction. The emphasis on deep learning has also 
been noted by Wadoux et al. (2019), who used this technique to predict 
soil  C.  They  found  that  the  deep  learning  technique  significantly 
increased  prediction  accuracy.  In  addition  to  SOC  prediction,  some 
recent studies have used deep learning in the field of ecological infor-
matics and  demonstrated the  ability of this technique  to improve the 
prediction  of  ecological  components  such  as  forest  vegetation  cover 
(Kalinaki  et  al.,  2023)  and  agriculture-related  elements  (Attri  et  al., 
2023).  According  to  them,  deep  learning  has  the  potential  to  be  a 
valuable technique for ecological analysis.

Query: "What is the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no information about the specific code repository link of the deep learning pipeline used for soil carbon mapping or any other mentioned applications like forest vegetation cover or agriculture-related elements. Therefore, it is not possible to provide the requested link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other code repository platform.
