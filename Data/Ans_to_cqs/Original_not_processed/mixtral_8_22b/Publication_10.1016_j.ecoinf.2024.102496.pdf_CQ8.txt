online  tool,  we  also  offer  a  comprehensive  map  package  that  can  be 
downloaded and utilized within a desktop GIS software suite. This map 
package provides complete access to all the layers utilized in the tool, 
allowing users to fully explore and analyze the data offline. The online 
tool serves as a valuable guide for decision-makers seeking to promote 
environmental equity. By identifying areas with existing social vulner-
abilities and high pollution loads, our online tool empowers decision- 
makers  to  strategically  allocate  limited  public  funds  where  they  are 
needed  most.  The  information  on  different  types  of  BMPs  and  their
