Learning

Optimizer 

SVM: 
C 

γ 

The number of images you send to the model in each iteration. 
Model parameters are updated after each batch during training. 
How many times you pass the full image dataset through the model. 
The error metric that you wish to minimize. 
e.g. Cross entropy loss for multi-class classification. 
A small number (0, 1] that determines the amount to alter parameters 
during training with respect to the loss. 
Also known as the step size. 
An algorithm that modifies CNN parameters according to a particular 
strategy to minimize the loss. 
e.g. the Adam optimizer sets the learning rate adaptively for faster and 
more efficient training.

dataset size. 

Testing time was found to be equivalent between the two classifi-
cation approaches, but vary with hardware. Using a GPU completed the 
testing  phase,  on  average,  0.87  ( ± 0.7) minutes  faster  across  both 
methods. GPU-enabled testing time ranged between 0.1 and 3.88 (μ =
1.43 ± 1.38) minutes compared to 0.28–5.87 (μ = 2.26 ± 2.9) minutes 
using just the CPU. 

4. Discussion 

In this work we have demonstrated that automatic classification of 
habitats from benthic imagery is possible with high accuracy. We use 
multiple datasets (of varying sizes) to confirm this, captured by a range 
of imaging platforms in varying geographic regions.

screening tool to improve quality of the ground-truth. Here although the 
task  is  a  simple  one,  its  time-consuming  nature  means  that  for  many 
large datasets it would be impossible to complete this task fully due to 
manual analysis constraints. Thus there is a suitable trade-off with the 
error-rate and efficiency of the approaches used. Regardless, the accu-
racy  and  reliability  of  annotations  should  always  be  interrogated,

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, common practices include monitoring metrics such as validation loss or accuracy over epochs and stopping the training process when these values reach a plateau or no longer show significant improvement. Additionally, early stopping can be employed to halt training if the monitored metric stops improving for a certain number of consecutive epochs. These techniques help prevent overfitting and ensure optimal model performance.
