options, contribute to the stability of the search. Additionally, its effi-
cient standard marking system can remove low-quality pixels, thereby 
improving  search  quality  (Li  et  al.,  2023a,  2023b,  2023c,  2023d). 
However, L2gen requires an accurate understanding of aerosol types to 
obtain high-quality Rrs  retrieval, and the complex aerosols of PL make 
this practice less efficient.
