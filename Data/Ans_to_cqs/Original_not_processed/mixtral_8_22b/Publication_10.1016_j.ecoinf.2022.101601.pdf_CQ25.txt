5.3. Limitations 

identification of missing or unneeded linkages, and act as an alternative 
evaluation  method  for  determining  which  variables  in  the  model  are 
most influential; conditional probabilities can also be learned from al-
gorithms,  such  as  the  Lauritzen  –  Spiegelhalter  algorithm  or  Gibbs 
sampling  (Chen  and  Pollino,  2012).  Finally,  the  inclusion  of  decision 
nodes can limit the tools and algorithms available for use in the GeNIe 
software  program.  The  inclusion  of  decision  nodes  results  in  the  BN 
being classified as an “influence diagram,” and some tools, such as the 
“sensitivity  analysis”  tool,  are  unavailable  for  use  with  influence  dia-
grams within the software. The decision nodes would either need to be 
removed or converted to chance nodes prior to running these tools in 
GeNIe.

3.2. PermaBN development 

The  objectives  of  PermaBN  are  to:  (1)  provide  an  alternative 
permafrost modeling framework that improves understanding and pre-
diction  of  permafrost  dynamics  under  various  climate  or  ecosystem 
conditions (i.e., provide a method that allows for exploratory and sce-
nario analysis), (2) identify knowledge and data gaps that hinder our 
understanding (and modeling capabilities) of permafrost dynamics, and 
(3)  facilitate  participatory  modeling  among  researchers  and/or 
stakeholders.

There  are  advantages  and  disadvantages  to  every  model  develop-
ment  approach.  For  instance,  while  analytical  models  can  provide

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that there isn't enough information to determine the specific purpose of any deep learning model mentioned. However, we do have details about the Bayesian Network (BN) model called PermaBN, developed using the GeNIe software.

PermaBN aims to achieve three main objectives:

1. Providing an alternative permafrost modeling framework that enhances understanding and prediction of permafrost dynamics under different climate or ecosystem conditions. This enables exploratory and scenario analyses.

2. Identifying knowledge and data gaps that impede our understanding and modeling capabilities of permafrost dynamics.

3. Facilitating participatory modeling among researchers and stakeholders.

While this does not directly address the purpose of a deep learning model, it provides insight into the goals of one particular model used in the study. Unfortunately, without further context regarding other potential deep learning models, I cannot accurately describe their purposes.
