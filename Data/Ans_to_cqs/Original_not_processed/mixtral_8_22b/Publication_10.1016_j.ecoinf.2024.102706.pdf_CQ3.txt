and time overhead (Ke et al., 2017). LightGBM sets itself apart from
other tree-based methods through its leaf-wise splitting approach, which
generates more intricate trees. These trees are adept at minimising loss,
leading to enhanced accuracy. The splitting process is guided by a
unique sampling method called Gradient-Based One Side Sampling
(GBOSS) (Ke et al., 2017). This method excludes data with small gra-
dients while utilising the remainder for estimating information gain and
facilitating tree growth. A collection of hyperparameters, such as lear-
ning_rate, max_depth, bagging_fraction, bagging_freq, and n_estimators,
controls the algorithm. These parameters are crucial in shaping how the
leaves are structured within the trees. The model's complexity gradually
rises as the tree grows, guided by these parameters. Simultaneously, loss
decreases, and the algorithm becomes more adept at learning from the
data, thereby improving its efficiency. Moreover, this model is suscep-

image-based vegetation indices for predicting forest canopy cover. The
application of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) for semantic
segmentation has also been investigated across various types of young
vegetation cover (Cameron et al., 2022). Regarding advanced machine
learning approaches, the RF and SVM were the foremost priorities for
the researchers for canopy cover modelling from O'brien, 2007 to 2017,
as reported by Thanh Noi and Kappas (2017). Other advanced ML ap-
proaches have recently been added to similar studies (Li et al., 2022;
Zhou et al., 2020). The boosting methodology represents a synthesis of
robust prediction techniques, frequently surpassing the performance of
individual models such as single decision trees. The emergence of
refined ensemble machine learning techniques like light gradient

verages bagging over boosting. This implies that RF constructs trees
independently and amalgamates their forecasts, a strategy that may
prove less efficacious in capturing intricate patterns when compared
with boosting techniques like LightGBM and XGboost. Both LightGBM
and XGboost stand out as potent gradient boosting models, each char-
acterised by unique variances in their tree growth strategies - leaf-wise
and tree level-wise, respectively. LightGBM specifically emphasises
expeditious training performance through the selective sampling of
high-gradient instances within extensive datasets, high-dimensional
data sets, and categorical attributes, owing to its employment of
histogram-based segmentation and adept management of categorical
variables (Al Daoud, 2019).

from data to make predictions or decisions. However, we categorised

Helpful Answer:
I apologize, but there isn't any specific mention of data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline in the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful response based on the available information.

However, generally speaking, some common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include bounding box annotation, polygon annotation, landmark annotation, image classification, and instance segmentation. Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest in images, while polygon annotation uses irregular shapes to outline objects. Landmark annotation involves placing dots or points on key features of objects, and image classification assigns labels to entire images. Instance segmentation combines object detection and semantic segmentation to identify individual objects and their boundaries within an image.
