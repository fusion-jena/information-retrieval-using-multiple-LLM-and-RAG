kernels. GoogLeNet adopted the Inception module, which is easy to use for network modification. It also removed the fully connected layers to reduce the number of parameters. Moreover, it used two auxiliary classifiers to accelerate network convergence. As a consequence of the auxiliary classifiers, GoogLeNet is not as scalable as VGG. On the other hand, the depth of networks is a crucial factor that influences CNN performance [39]. Richer features of different levels can be extracted from deep CNN layers, whereas deep models are not easy to optimize. In many studies, batch normalization (BN) is employed to hamper vanishing/exploding gradients in deep CNNs. However, the accuracy often becomes saturated and then degrades (degradation problem) in the training phase, even though BN layers are used. ResNet [41] addressed the degradation problem by using shallow layers and identity mapping for network construction. Two shortcuts (i.e., identity and projection shortcuts) have been

that is, the tree species training sample and its quality. As long as the tree sample can be measured well
in ﬁeld work, deep learning networks will work well. Further, it is beneﬁcial to collect tree samples
with the aid of crowd sourcing. In terms of the sampled area in species diversity, our method is also
applicable for other scales (50 × 50 m, 90 × 90 m, etc.), depending on the quadrat size in the ﬁeld work
or the requirements of species diversity estimation.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there isn't any explicit mention of specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, some aspects mentioned could contribute to the robustness and applicability of the model. For instance, the methodology allows for the processing of large datasets, suggesting that the model might have been trained on a diverse set of data. Additionally, the authors note that their approach has the potential for transfer to other forest regions due to on-the-fly data acquisition and processing capabilities. This implies that the model may have been designed with adaptability in mind, although no concrete validation techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting are explicitly stated.
