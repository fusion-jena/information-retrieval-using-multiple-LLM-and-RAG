1. Introduction 

Target variables are usually fully labeled in the classical supervised 
machine learning setting. In real-world predictive tasks, however, labels 
are often scarce and/or noisy. Various definitions and terms are used in 
the  literature  to  describe  variants  of  noise  and  scarceness  of  labels 
(Allison, 2001; Xie and Huang, 2018; Nikoloski et al., 2021; Sun et al., 
2010; Gao et al., 2017; Alarc´on and Destercke, 2021; Van Engelen and 
Hoos, 2020), and each setting requires tailored approaches for exploit-
ing such target labels. In this study, we formulate a new computational 
setting for regression, where target labels are structurally incomplete. We 
computationally study this task via a case study in predictive modeling 
of global vegetation cover. 

1.1. The vegetation modelling task

Various other terms have been used to describe weakly supervised 
learning tasks in the literature (Table 1). Weak labels (Sun et al., 2010) 
or  partial labels (Xie  and  Huang, 2018)  are  mainly  considered  in  the 
context  of  binary  labels.  They  often  include  different  types  of  noise 
coming from the labeling process and data sources and lacks constraints. 
Distribution learning (Gao et al., 2017) entails the constraint that the 
outputs  must  sum  to  unity,  but  this  constraint  is  already  met  in  the 
training data, unlike in our structural incompleteness setting.

In our setting of structurally incomplete targets, in some observations, 
targets form a complete distribution (that sums up to one), whereas in 
other  observations,  targets  are  structurally  incomplete.  From  this 
perspective, the task resembles semi-supervised learning where a vast 
amount of unlabeled data is used with a small number of labeled ex-
amples  (Zhu, 2005;  Van  Engelen  and  Hoos,  2020;  Kostopoulos  et  al., 
2018). In Nikoloski et al. (2021), the authors have proposed using semi- 
supervised  predictive  clustering  trees  (Levati´c  et  al.,  2018)  that  can

An example training instance for different weakly-labeled settings. Here yj indicates the targets of an instance. Red indicates an 
error in the training data (deviation from ground truth) – it is not known to the user where errors occur. Note that in the weak 
j=1yj = 1 and yj⩾0). In our setting 
label setting, only 0s may be errors. Shading represents a constraint (in this example, that 
(structurally incomplete), the constraint may not be met, but errors are neither random deviations. Mixtures of these settings 
are possible, e.g., we may have structurally incomplete with missing labels, etc.
