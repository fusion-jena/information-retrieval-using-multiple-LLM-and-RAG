Description

thresholds,  such  as  those  too  hot  or  deep  to  implement  a  restoration 
activity. Finally, the criteria are weighted according to their importance 
or  the  decision  maker’s  preference  for  a  particular  restorative  inter-
vention and aggregated to give a single value for each site. The sites are 
then ranked from highest value to lowest and the top N sites are chosen 
to implement the restorative activity at.

As a first conceptual framework for a synthetic reef data pipeline the 
models developed here serve their purpose in facilitating decision sup-
port  tool  testing  and  demonstrations  during  development,  although 
alternative  models  could  be  investigated  to  reduce  the  time  taken  to 
create  some  of  the  synthetic  datasets  and  improve  fidelity  to  the 
ecological dynamics if needed for other applications. Machine learning 
and neural network-based models are ideal for fitting models to a wide 
range of data sets but can take time for model training. The models for 
site data, coral cover and connectivity all show reasonable runtimes, but 
the PAR environmental data model’s runtime could be improved upon

A  key  challenge  in  generating  synthetic  data  for  reef  restoration 
decision  support  is  that  decision  support  models  often  require  many 
different  input  datasets  which  can  be  challenging  to  create  a  unified 
synthetic  data  model  for.  This  challenge  is  approached  here  through 
initially  defining  a  narrow  scope  for  the  application  of  our  models 
(testing and validation) which will be expanded as the models are iter-
atively  improved  and  key  relationships  between  datasets  (which  are 
likely complex) are better understood through specialised research. This 
paper outlines the first iteration of our synthetic data models, designed 
to  develop  data  for  model  testing,  validation,  and  functionality  dem-
onstrations. The models developed here may not individually be the best 
available  for  the  data  set  they  aim  to  synthesize  but  were  chosen  to 
satisfy a sufficient level of statistical emulation, computational speed,

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information on the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, based on general machine learning practices, common postprocessing steps include evaluating the performance of the trained model using various metrics, creating visualizations like saliency maps or confusion matrices, fine-tuning hyperparameters, and validating the model with new data. In this case, the text mentions the use of mean data quality score and mean data diagnostics scores as part of the evaluation process, suggesting that these might be used as postprocessing steps. Additionally, the text discusses ranking sites based on their values, indicating that sorting or filtering results might also be included in the postprocessing steps.
