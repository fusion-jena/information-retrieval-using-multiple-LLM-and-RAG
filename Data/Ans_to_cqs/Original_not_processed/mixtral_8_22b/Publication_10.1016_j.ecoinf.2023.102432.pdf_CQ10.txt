Invasive species remain a challenging and costly problem (Crystal- 
Ornelas  et al., 2021; Hiatt et al., 2019), and  long-term monitoring  of 
invasions  can  provide  valuable  ecological  information  to  guide  man-
agement decisions (Blossey, 1999). Remote sensing may be the ideal tool 
to  fill  this  need  by  providing  accurate  and  affordable  repeat  imagery 
(Bradley, 2014). However, training datasets can be riddled with vari-
ability  or  errors  that  complicate  training  of  machine-learning  ap-
proaches. Here, we showed that a multiple-instance learning algorithm, 
which allows for variability or imprecision in the training dataset, can 
detect a highly problematic invasive plant species using multispectral 
airborne and satellite imagery. Using Brazilian peppertree in the Ever-
glades  National  Park,  we  showcased  that  an  invader  can  be  detected 
with >70% accuracy using NAIP, RapidEye, and Landsat 8 imagery. This

Random  Forest  is  a  common  machine  learning  approach  used  in 
remote sensing for classification. This approach requires a single pixel’s 
spectrum to be associated with a single metadata record, compared to 
MTMI-SMF which can take many pixels’ spectra and associate it with a 
single metadata record. Since training locations often did not fall near 
the center of a pixel (see example in Fig. 3 where the training location 
falls at the intersection of four NAIP pixels), a random pixel from the 
pixels  in  closest  proximity  of  the  training  location  was  selected  for 
analysis. This single pixel dataset was split into training and testing data 
using 5 K-fold cross-validations. MATLAB’s (MathWorks, Inc., Natick, 
Massachusetts) TreeBagger function was used to complete the classifi-
cation using 100 trees. Looping through the k-folds, the random forest 
algorithm was calculated using 80% of the data and classification results
