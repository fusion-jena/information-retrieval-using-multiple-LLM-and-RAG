We used a GoogLeNet architecture as it was the winner of the 2015
competition imageNet (Szegedy et al., 2015), an identiﬁcation chal-
lenge on 1000 diﬀerent classes. This CNN is composed of 22 layers. It
uses inception modules. Inception modules allow the network to use
convolutions of diﬀerent sizes (1*1, 3*3 and 5*5 pixels) and to weight
each of these convolutions. This network could thus account more or
less strongly for the context of each pixel, which increases the range of
possibilities to improve its performance during the training.

of 16 images to train our network. We ran this architecture on Caﬀe (Jia
et al., 2014). To focus on the impact of the training data, we used the
same CNN architecture for our training and test procedures.

2.3. Building the training datasets

Using the raw training dataset of 20 ﬁsh species (Table S1) we built
4 diﬀerent datasets to assess the inﬂuence of the dataset building on
classiﬁcation results (Table S2).

The ﬁrst training dataset T1 contained raw ﬁsh thumbnails (T0) and

their respective mirror images.

More precisely, we doubled the number of thumbnails per ﬁsh in-
dividual by ﬂipping each thumbnail with respect to the vertical axis.
Such a procedure homogenizes the proportion of left-oriented and
right-oriented individuals in the database and we hypothesize it could
improve the average identiﬁcation rate since ﬁsh individuals are seen in
all positions.

The model was trained using thumbnails of whole ﬁsh, part of ﬁsh species and
environment (T?). Raw outputs were post-processed applying two decision
rules: (r1) keeping most likely ﬁsh class if “environment” was the most likely
class, and (r2) considering “part of species X" equivalent to “species X".

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that the authors used the Cafe framework developed by Berkeley AI Research and community contributors. Therefore, it can be inferred that they did not use any cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform but rather deployed their model locally using the Cafe framework.
