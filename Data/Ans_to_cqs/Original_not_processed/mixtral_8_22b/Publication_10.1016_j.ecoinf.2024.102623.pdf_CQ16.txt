Primarily, this loss function fails to adequately address the issue of 
class  imbalance  within  datasets.  Two  key  aspects  of  class  imbalance 
need to be tackled here:

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete for machine learning models. However, common methods include monitoring metrics such as validation loss or accuracy during training and stopping when these values reach a plateau or no longer improve significantly. Other possible criteria could involve setting a maximum number of epochs or iterations, or using early stopping techniques based on changes in model performance.

Based on the table presented in the context, it appears that the authors evaluated various machine learning loss functions by comparing their mean Area Under Curve (AUC) performance across different configurations. This suggests that they may have trained each configuration until some convergence criterion was met before evaluating its performance. However, without additional details about the training process, it is impossible to definitively state what criteria were used to determine when training was complete.
