For our research reproducibility in Algorithm 1, the definitions
include T and ℰ, denoting the paths to the training and testing dataset
directories, respectively. The functions Dtrain and Dtest represent data
generators for training and testing datasets, where parameters such as α,
β, γ, and δ control aspects like rescaling and augmentation. The batch
size for training and testing is denoted by B, while Gtrain and Gtest
represent the respective data generators. The class weights computed for
addressing class imbalance are denoted by wc, and M stands for our
proposed model, encompassing its architecture and compilation pa-
rameters. The number of training epochs is represented by n, and P and
Q denote the steps per epoch for training and validation, respectively.
Predicted outputs and their class labels from the model are represented
by ̂y and ̂yc, while ytrue signifies the true class labels from the testing
dataset. In our model reproducibility in the testing phase in Algorithm 2,

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the data is divided into two main parts: one for training and another for testing and validation purposes. However, the exact ratio or percentage used for this division is not explicitly mentioned. It can be inferred that the majority of the data, likely more than half, is allocated for training, while the rest is reserved for testing and validation. This approach aligns with common practices in machine learning and deep learning, where the larger portion of available data is typically utilized for training models, while smaller portions are set aside for evaluating performance through testing and validation.
