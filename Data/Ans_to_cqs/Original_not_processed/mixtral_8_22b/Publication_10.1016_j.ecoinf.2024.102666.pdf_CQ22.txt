The root mean square error (RMSE) is defined as the square root of 
the arithmetic mean of the squared differences between the predicted 
and  true  values  for  each  group,  divided  by  the  number  of  groups,  n. 
RMSE  serves  as  a  metric  for  quantifying  the  discrepancies  between 
predicted  and  true  values  for  each  group.  A  smaller  RMSE  value  in-
dicates higher algorithmic accuracy, signifying that the predicted values 
are closer to the true values.

where, Yi  and Xi  are Rrs  (λ) obtained from model inversion and Rrs  (λ) 
calculated from measured spectra, respectively and n is the number of 
sampling points. 

The mean absolute error (MAE) is used to represent the average of 
the absolute error between the true value and the predicted value, the 
smaller the MAE value, the closer the predicted value is to the true value.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, two metrics are mentioned for evaluating the performance of the deep learning model: Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). These metrics are used to compare and rank the performance of different algorithms. However, it should be noted that these metrics are not specific to deep learning models only but can also be applied to other types of predictive models.

Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) measures the difference between the predicted and actual values, where lower values indicate better fit. It is calculated as the square root of the average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values.

Mean Absolute Error (MAE), on the other hand, calculates the average of the absolute errors between the predicted and actual values. Lower values of MAE indicate better performance of the model.

These metrics provide insights into how well the model performs in terms of prediction accuracy and help in selecting the most suitable algorithm or model for a particular task.
