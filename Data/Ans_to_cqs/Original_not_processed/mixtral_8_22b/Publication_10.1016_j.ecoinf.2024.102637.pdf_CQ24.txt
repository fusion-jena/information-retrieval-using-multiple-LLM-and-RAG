In view of this discovery, we re-examined the application strategies 
of deep learning, no longer pursuing model complexity but exploring the 
potential  of  shallow  networks.  Through  meticulous  algorithm  optimi-
sation  and  structural  design,  we  strive  to  maintain  the  model  perfor-
mance while reducing the computational complexity  and deployment 
costs,  achieving  a  balance  between  speed  and  accuracy.  The  specific 
contributions of this study are as follows:  

• We propose a lightweight SIAlex model that utilises AlexNet as the 
backbone,  fully  exploiting  the  performance  of  minimalist  models. 
Ensuring a good balance between speed and accuracy. 

• The  method  of  cascading  multiple  activation  functions  fully  in-
troduces  nonlinear  factors  such  that  the  model  approximates  the 
nonlinear  expression  function  of  the  learning  features  while  also 
improving the gradient propagation.

1. Introduction 

Combining  bird  voice  recognition  and  deep  learning  is  vital  for 
monitoring bird species for conservation. It is an essential indicator for 
monitoring  the  ecosystem  health  and  conducting  practical  ecological 
assessments  for  biodiversity  conservation  (Liu  et  al.,  2023).  Through 
population monitoring, scholars can understand the responses of local 
birds  to  environmental  changes  and  conservation  efforts.  Monitoring 
bird movement in real-time is also the first step in monitoring the bal-
ance of the ecosystem (Xie et al., 2022). Many professionals have begun 
to  conduct  long-term  observations  of  birds  to  protect  their  species. 
Therefore, training the collected data using appropriate network models 
and constructing an automatic bird recognition system are of profound 
significance.

First, a single convolution layer is merged with a single Batch Nor-
malisation  (BN)  layer.  When  training  the  model,  the  BN  layer  can 
accelerate  the  network  convergence  and  prevent  overfitting.  By  nor-
malising the BN layer, the problems of gradient disappearance and ex-
plosion can be effectively solved. The method has been applied to many 
advanced  network  models,  such  as  ResNet,  MobileNet,  Xception,  and 
ShuffleNet, which use BN technology to optimise model performance. 
However,  although  the  BN  layer  plays  an  active  role  in  the  training 
process, additional operations are added to the network forward infer-
ence,  which  affects the  performance of  the  model and  occupies  more 
memory or memory space. To solve this problem, the BN layer param-
eters can be merged into a convolution layer to improve the forward 
inference speed of the model. Through the above optimisation steps, we

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it mentions several optimization techniques used in developing a lightweight SIAlex model for bird voice recognition. These include merging a single convolution layer with a single batch normalization (BN) layer, accelerating network convergence, preventing overfitting, solving gradient disappearance and explosion issues, and improving forward inference speed by merging BN layer parameters into a convolution layer. While these methods do not directly address randomness management, they contribute to enhancing the overall performance and efficiency of the deep learning model.
