in the basin, based on 180 resident speciesâ€™ data. As species observation 
data,  we  use  data  from  a  public  authoritative  repository  of  big  data 
(GBIF)  improved  with  reliable  records  we  accurately  and  directly 
observed in the field.

After  the application of  the data pre-processing algorithm, we ob-
tained 17 datasets: one for ET, one for WS, one for C, 7 for T, and 7 for P. 
We  used  these  data  as  proxy  environmental  conditions  for  annual 
environmental snapshots in the years 1950, 1999, 2016, 2050, and 2100 
(under the RCP4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, for the last two). 

2.3. Species observation data

Big-data mining approaches based on Artificial Intelligence models can help forecast biodiversity changes before 
they happen. These approaches can predict macroscopic species distribution patterns and trends that can inform 
preventive measures to avoid the loss of ecosystem functions and services. They can, therefore, help study and 
mitigate climate change implications on biodiversity conservation in fragile ecosystems. Wetlands are particu-
larly fragile ecosystems where climate change poses severe risks and has dramatically reduced their size over the 
past  century,  with  profound  consequences  on  biodiversity  and  ecosystem  services.  Through  big-data  mining 
approaches,  we  can  predict  future  wetland  biodiversity  trends  in  the  context  of  climate  change.  This  paper 
proposes such predictive analysis for a specific wetland: The Massaciuccoli Lake basin in Tuscany, Italy. This

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that there were 17 datasets obtained after applying a data pre-processing algorithm. These datasets include one each for evapotranspiration (ET), wind speed (WS), and carbon dioxide concentration (C); seven datasets for temperature (T); and seven datasets for precipitation (P). These datasets were used as proxy environmental conditions for annual environmental snapshots in the years 1950, 1999, 2016, 2050, and 2100 under different climate change scenarios. Unfortunately, without more specific details, I cannot determine if any of these datasets correspond to well-known machine learning datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
