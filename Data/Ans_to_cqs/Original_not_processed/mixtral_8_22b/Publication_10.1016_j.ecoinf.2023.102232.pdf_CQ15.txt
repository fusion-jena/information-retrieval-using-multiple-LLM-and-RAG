The  entries  of  the  database  are  subsequently  ordered  from  the 
smaller to the higher sum of the residual values. This operation ends the 
first  step  of  the  LS  algorithm  and  leads  to  the  second  part,  hereafter 
defined  as  the  genetic  algorithm.  This  is  in  turn  based  on  an  iterative 
optimization, and its purpose is to partially optimize the results of the 
estimation and to better explore the space of the parameters. This part of 
the  process  is  analogous  to  the  previously  described  step:  the  first 
quarter  of  the  best  fit  parameter  values  stored  in  the  database  is 
considered as input for the process.

From each combination of values belonging to the first quarter of 
values stored in the Python dictionary, the GA generates four random 
combinations of initial values considered as input for the LS procedure 
previously described. Each best fit value stored in a single row of the 
dictionary is considered as an expected value of a Gaussian distribution, 
μ, while the associated variance is still considered as σ2  = (zμ)2. Each 
new combination of best fit values calculated during the iterations of the 
genetic algorithm is again stored in the database together with all the 
previously estimated sets of values. 

At the end of a genetic algorithm cycle, the rows of the database are 
again ordered according to the values of the sum of the residual. The 
genetic algorithm can be repeated an arbitrary number of times, but for 
simplicity we considered a nGAC = 2, that leads to a total number of nTGA 
= 2nGAC+1 ⋅ nLSF = 1536 LS fit evaluations.

The availability of computational tools is currently endorsing the use 
of Genetic Algorithms (GA), useful methods to optimize the exploration 
of  the  parameters'  space.  Applications  of  these  methods  in  ecological 
contexts  are  always  more  frequent  (Durgabai  et  al.,  2018),  mostly 
because GA can be combined with different algorithms, such as the Least 
Squares (LS) method (Song et al., 2012), the AutoRegressive Integrated 
Moving  Average  (ARIMA)  method  (Rathod  et  al.,  2017),  or  artificial 
neural networks (Shang and Zhu, 2018).

the set of associated parameters values. 

In this study, a total number of 20,000 iterations for each trace is 
considered, but in the end, only the values from the 101st to 20,000th 
iterations  are  saved.  The  choice  of  “burning”  the  first  100  sets  of 
parameter values estimated in each chain is related to the higher fluc-
tuation of the values during the first iterations. It is however supposed 
that the LS macro step via GA already provided a first optimization, so 
that after the first 100 iterations the MCMC-like algorithm is supposed to 
have reached a more stable convergence, providing final values with a 
lower uncertainty associated.

The text does not provide explicit information about the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. However, it mentions two optimization techniques employed in the data analysis process: the Least Squares (LS) method and Genetic Algorithms (GA).

The Least Squares (LS) method is a traditional approach used to find the line of best fit for a given dataset by minimizing the sum of squared differences between observed and predicted values. In this case, the LS algorithm is used as part of a larger process involving a genetic algorithm.

Genetic Algorithms (GA) are inspired by natural selection processes and are often used for optimization problems. They work by creating a population of candidate solutions, which evolve over time through mutation, crossover, and selection operations. In this study, GA is used to partially optimize the results of the estimation and to better explore the space of the parameters. Four random combinations of initial values are generated from the first quarter of the best fit parameter values stored in the database, serving as input for the LS procedure.

Although the mentioned optimization techniques do not directly correspond to those typically found in deep learning pipelines like SGD or Adam, they demonstrate how various optimization approaches can be integrated into complex data analysis tasks.
