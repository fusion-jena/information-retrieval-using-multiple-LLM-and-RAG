Parameter estimates from a point count and an automated recording unit (ARU) 
distance sampling (DS) model (using data analyzed using a convolutional neural 
network (CNN) with a score detection threshold of 0.95) fit to data collected on a 
population  of  northern  bobwhite  (Colinus  virginianus)  on  Di-Lane  Plantation 
WMA,  Burke  County,  Georgia  during  autumn  2016–2018.  Posterior  median 
(0.50) and lower (0.025) and upper (0.975) limits of 95% credible intervals are 
reported.

We then use data augmentation to estimate σARU by adding a number 
of known ‘non-detections’ with distance of NA to our dataset of detected 
or simulated calls, increasing our total number of observations M to 300 
per ARU. We used a data augmentation variable zi,j for each observation 
to indicate whether it was a true call or not, so that the total realized 
M
number of calls including false positive CNN detections (NFPi =
j=1zi,j) 
can be modelled in relation to our data augmentation parameter ψ, pi,j 
and the binary detection outcomes of each call (yi,j)(eq. 10–12).

Recordings were analyzed using a previously developed CNN model 
(Nolan  et  al., 2022)  trained on covey call  spectrogram data collected 
separately to this study from Di-Lane and other sites around Georgia and 
Alabama,  USA.  Our  covey  call  acoustic  CNN  is  trained  to  detect  and 
localize all covey calls per ARU during the recording period and note 
their associated time and peak power (dB). We chose to use a relatively 
conservative  score  threshold  echoing  that  of  other  similar  studies 
ˇ
Sirovi´c, 2021; Ruff et al., 2020), where only calls that 
(Rasmussen and 
received a score of 0.95 or higher were officially classified as a positive 
bobwhite detection. All CNN detections at a 0.95 score threshold from a 
random sample of five one-hour files from each year were then manually 
reviewed to evaluate model accuracy and to calculate a false positive 
rate “i.e. how many calls were incorrectly labelled as bobwhite”. Across
