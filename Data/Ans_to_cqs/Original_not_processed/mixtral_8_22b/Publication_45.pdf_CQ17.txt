Deep  learning  is  a  relatively  recent  development  in  ML.  Its 
main tool, the deep neural network (DNN), builds upon Artificial 
Neural Networks (ANNs) which were already conceived in the 
middle of the last century. Essentially, “deep learning” refers to a 
set of techniques that allow the training of larger (more neurons) 
and  deeper  (more  layers)  ANNs  (Nielsen,  2015).  These  high 
capacity  networks  became  possible  due  to  the  development  of 
improved  algorithms  for  optimizing  connection  weights  [e.g., 
stochastic  gradient  descent  (Rumelhart  et  al.,  1986)]  and  a 
steep  increase  in  available  computing  power  and  training  data 
(Goodfellow et al., 2016). While these improvements may seem 
only gradual, current DNNs not only outperform their simpler 
ANN  ancestors,  but  frequently  also  perform  better  than  other 
ML approaches in standardized tests of prediction accuracy (e.g.,

To  better  contextualize  the  performance  of  the  DNN, 
we  repeated  Experiments  1  and  2  using  other  widely  used 
classification algorithms, i.e., distributed random forest, gradient 
boosting  machine,  and  generalized  linear  model.  We  used  the 
H2O platform (H2O.ai, 2017), which provides a set of fast and 
scalable  learning  algorithms  and  is  integrated  within  the  R 
software and environment.

REsULTs

The hyper-parameters evaluated iteratively were network capacity 
(number of layers and neurons per layer), applied regularization 
techniques, as well as the used loss function and optimizer. The 
training of the individual candidate networks was stopped when 
the accuracy of the network on the test dataset did not increase 
further.  The  thus  determined  network  architecture  was  also 
used for Experiment 2 (Abadi et al., 2016). All experiments and 
predictions  were  conducted  using  the  TensorFlow  framework 
and  run  on  a  desktop  PC  with  an  Intel  QuadCore  CPU  (Intel 
i5-6600) and equipped with an NVidia GTX 1070 GPU.

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, it is mentioned that one of the hyper-parameters evaluated during the training process of the deep learning pipeline was the applied regularization techniques. However, the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting are not explicitly stated. Nevertheless, based on common practices in deep learning, some potential regularization methods that could have been employed include dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored or "dropped out" during training, which helps to prevent complex co-adaptations between neurons and reduce overfitting (Srivastava et al., 2014). On the other hand, L2 regularization involves adding a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages large weight values and encourages smaller ones, thereby reducing complexity and preventing overfitting. Other regularization methods such as early stopping, batch normalization, and data augmentation could also be considered depending on the specific requirements of the problem being addressed.
