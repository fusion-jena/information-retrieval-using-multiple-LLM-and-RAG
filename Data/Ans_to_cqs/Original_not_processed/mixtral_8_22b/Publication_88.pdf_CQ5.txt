The EF network architecture consisted of three convolutional layers (Conv) including the
Rectiﬁed Linear Unit (ReLU), two Max-pooling layers (MaxPool), and two Fully Connected layers
(FC), with a softmax layer at the end with two outputs, corresponding to “deforestation” and
“no-deforestation” classes. The ﬁlter and output size of each layer are summarized in Table 3.

1. Introduction

For training the EF and SN models, we selected the following setup empirically: batch size equal
to 32 with 100 number of epochs, early stopping after 10 epochs with no improvement (over the
validation set) and a dropout rate of 0.2 in the ﬁnal FC layer. Additionally, Adam optimizer was
selected empirically with weight decay equal to 0.9 and learning rate equal to 10−3. As loss function,
we used the binary cross-entropy.

contained in 10% of the image. Hence, instead of looking at the entire image, the analyst would focus
on 10% of it, reducing human work by 90%. As expected, as Recall increased, the area to be observed
also increased, but, in this particular case, CSVM (with three layers) presented the best results (see
Figure 13a). For Recall beyond 96%, the threshold values were very close to zero, most pixels tended
to be classiﬁed as deforestation, and the area to be observed went up to 100%, as can be observed in
Figure 13b.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned. However, there is mention of two databases - Amazon and Cerrado. These could potentially be the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. Unfortunately, without more specific details about these databases or their sources, I cannot confirm if they correspond to well-known datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
