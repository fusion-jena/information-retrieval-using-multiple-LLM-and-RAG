Given unlabelled input data consisting of N samples with F features, 
x ∈ ℝN×F,  the  probabilistic  encoder  of  a  VAE  maps  the  input  to  the 
posterior density p(z|x) over the latent variable, z ∈ ℝN×L. In practice, 
L << N and the encoder neural network approximates the true posterior 
density, p(z|x), with a multivariate Gaussian, qθ(z|x) ∼ 𝒩 (μθ, σ2
θ ). The 
decoder of a VAE reconstructs the input data from the latent variable 
and is given by the density function pφ(x|z). The encoder and decoder 
neural networks are parameterised by θ  and φ, respectively. The opti-
mization objective of a VAE consists of two competing terms and it can 
be shown to be (Kingma and Welling, 2014)

dataset  recorded  at  a  different  location  and  was  gradually  expanded 
until  reconstructions  were  sufficiently  good.  In  order  to  visualize  the 
latent  representation,  the  size  of  the  bottleneck  of  the  model  (latent 
dimension) was limited to two. Details of the network architecture are 
reported in Table 1.

3.2. Semi-supervised clustering 

Using a small subset of labelled data that optimizes a relevant loss 
could steer learning of representations that are more expressive for the 
downstream tasks under consideration. One approach to achieve this is 
to introduce auxiliary tasks  based on the labelled data, resulting  in a 
semi-supervised learning setup (Figueroa and Rivera, 2017).

5.6. Exploring the latent space 

Samples  generated  from  the  latent  space  of  the  semi-supervised 
model  are  shown  as  a  latent  space  cart-wheel  in  Fig.  5.  Traversing 
different  lines  in  the  latent  space  results  in  samples  that  smoothly 
transition between different spectra types. As a side note, we point that 
the two latent features do not appear to be entirely disentangled; this is 
manifested as dense islands and sparse spaces of spectra in the latent 
space. For our downstream clustering task, fully disentangled features 
are  not  required.  However,  one  could  introduce  an  additional  loss 
component that enforces orthogonality between the different latent di-
mensions to achieve improved disentanglement.

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention specific data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Instead, it focuses on the use of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) for dimensionality reduction and semi-supervised clustering. However, there is a brief reference to using a small subset of labeled data to improve the quality of learned representations. This suggests that some form of supervised learning may have been employed during training, but the exact nature of the labeling process is not specified. Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed description of the data annotation techniques used in this particular case.
