Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

from online shared videos that contain a wide range of species richness 
(from 1 to 106 wild bird species in the videos used in this study).

On the official YouTube platform, we entered the keyword in Japa-
nese  “Yacho”  (wild  birds)  on  15  June  2022  and  sorted  the  videos 
uploaded from the start of the YouTube service to the present day (at the 
time) in the order of the number of views. We attempted to set other 
keywords, including “Tori” (birds) and “bird watching” (this word was 
entered in Japanese Katakana script), but we could not efficiently search 
the videos displaying birds from these keywords (Table S1). The videos 
returned from those keywords did not display wild birds but rather pet 
birds, such as parakeets, those displayed in music videos, and those that 
focused on bird-watching equipment, such as cameras and binoculars. 
Therefore,  we  decided  to  use  the  keyword  “Yacho”  and  extracted  the 
videos that had been viewed >100 times as of 15 June 2022 (n = 449). 
There were too many videos that had been viewed <100 times to extract

number  of  subscribers  in  the  channel,  thumbnail  information,  bird 
species  that  appeared,  and  name(s)  of  target  place(s).  Because  the 
number of views increases with time, we recorded the number of views 
for the videos as of 16 July 2022.

3. Results 

We  recorded  322  wild  bird  species  across  the  videos,  including 
subspecies (Table S2). Those that could not be identified at the species 
level  were  six  species  at  the  family  level:  Corvidae  sp.,  Ardeidae  sp., 
Acrocephalidae sp., Anatidae sp., Scolopacidae sp., and Phylloscopidae 
sp. Random forest analysis with the feature selection algorithm identi-
fied  significant  explanatory  factors  for  the  number  of  views  for  the 
video, including the number of days since uploading, length of the video, 
the number of uploaded videos in each channel, the presence of objects 
and text within the thumbnail information, and the presence of six wild 
bird  species  including  Anas  crecca,  Troglodytes  troglodytes,  Otus  sunia, 
Cuculus poliocephalus, Streptopelia orientalis, Larvivora cyane (Fig. 1). The 
number  of  days  since  uploading  was  selected  as  the  most  important 
explanatory factor.
