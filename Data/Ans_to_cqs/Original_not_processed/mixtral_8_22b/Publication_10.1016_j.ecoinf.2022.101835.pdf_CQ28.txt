et al., 2016), and LightGBM 3.2.1 (Ke et al., 2017) libraries. In building a 
machine  learning  model,  the  structure  and  hyperparameters  of  the 
model must be determined, such as the number of decision trees and the 
depth of trees for RF models and the number of intermediate layers and 
nodes for ANN models. We optimized the structure and hyperparameters 
of the RF and ANN models using Optuna 2.10.0 (Akiba et al., 2019) with 
the  parameters  and  ranges  shown  in  Table  1  as  candidates.  For  the 
LightGBM models, we used Optuna's LightGBM Tuner (optuna.integra-
tion.lightgbm)  for hyperparameter  fitting.  The  performance of  the  al-
gorithms was evaluated by comparing the loss function (mean squared 
error (MSE)) of the optimized models. In addition, the mean absolute 
error (MAE) and the coefficient of determination (R2) were calculated 
for reference.

differences  were  not  significant.  The  optimized  ANN  models  did  not 
have any intermediate layers, and the model with the input layer fol-
lowed by the output layer was determined to be the best.

where AA_SHAPj  is the average of the absolute SHAP values for input 
variable j (i.e., the daily average temperature on day j), ni is the number 
of response values (4844 for the first flowering date models and 4814 for 
the full blossom date models), and SHAPi,j is the SHAP value for the jth 
input parameter of the ith response value.

2.3. Construction of machine learning models 

Three  machine  learning  algorithms,  RF,  ANN,  and  GBDT,  were 
selected to develop the estimation models. All algorithms included the 
daily average temperature for 365 consecutive days as the explanatory 
variables.  The  models  were  coded  in  Python  (version  3.8.12)  using
