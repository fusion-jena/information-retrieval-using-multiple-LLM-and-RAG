Insect forest risk assessment is important to effectively manage insect 
pests, as it promotes efficient identification of hazardous forest condi-
tions and development of strategies for their control by providing in-
formation on pest occurrence patterns (Choi et al., 2017; Mason, 1985; 
Park  et  al.,  2013).  There  are  various  approaches  to  hazard  rating  for 
various  insect  pests  in  forest  ecosystems.  Recently,  machine  learning 
methods  have  been  successfully  used  to  evaluate  the  risk  of  invasive

Pine wilt disease (PWD) is one of the most destructive diseases affecting pine trees, and South Korea is one of the 
most severely damaged countries in the world. Based on the information on PWD occurrence and their envi-
ronmental  characteristics  (i.e.,  geographical,  meteorological,  and  land-use)  in  South  Korea,  we  evaluated  the 
conditions  most  conducive  for  PWD  occurrence  and  developed  projection  models  using  machine  learning  al-
gorithms; random forest (RF) and maximum entropy (Maxent). Our results showed that PWD mainly occurred in 
areas like highly urbanized area; low elevations, at close proximity to roads. Also, both RF and Maxent models 
presented high prediction performance for PWD occurrence. Geographical factors (e.g., elevation and distance to 
roads) were major determinants of PWD occurrence and largely contributed to explaining variability and partial

Helpful Answer:
Regularization methods are techniques used to prevent overfitting in machine learning and deep learning pipelines. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise along with underlying patterns, which can lead to poor generalization to new data. Two common regularization methods mentioned in the given context are dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent overfitting by making the network more robust and reducing its reliance on any single feature or group of features. This method was not explicitly mentioned in the provided context but is widely used in deep learning pipelines.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of all weights in the network. By adding this penalty, the optimization process encourages smaller weights, leading to simpler models that are less likely to overfit. In the given context, Hirata et al. (2017) and Ikegami and Jenkins (2018) use Maxent, which incorporates L2 regularization to avoid overfitting.

Other regularization methods include L1 regularization, early stopping, and data augmentation, although these were not specifically mentioned in the provided context. It is essential to choose appropriate regularization methods based on the specific problem and dataset to achieve optimal performance and prevent overfitting.
