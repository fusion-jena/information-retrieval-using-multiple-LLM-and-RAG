2.2. Data sources

There were two main data sources assembled within a database and
used for the fieldwork/analysis: (1) archaeological survey data from the
Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) (Dagan, 2006) for LTA-LU; and (2)
remotely sensed data (spaceborne Vegetation and Environment Moni-
toring on a New Micro Satellite (VENμS), airborne Light Detection and
Ranging (LiDAR), and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)) for LC. Addi-
tional ancillary data was required for establishing research control,
georeferencing, and masking disturbed areas, including (1) digital maps
from the Israeli Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) for modern LU/LC (M.O.
A., 2023); (2) georegistered orthophotos (12.5 cm) from the Survey of
Israel (SOI) for georeferencing and masking the study area (S.O.I.,
2018); (3) substrate data for geology, from the Israel geological survey
(I.G.S., 2010, 2016), and soil (Ravikovitch, 1969); (4) climate-related
data from the Israel Meteorological Service (I.M.S., 2023) and the US

Helpful Answer:
The text provides information about the data sources used in a specific study, which can be considered as part of a deep learning pipeline. Two main data sources were used: (1) archaeological survey data from the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) for Land Tenure and Land Use (LTA-LU); and (2) remotely sensed data (including spaceborne VENμS, airborne LiDAR, and UAV) for Land Cover (LC). Additional ancillary data was also used for establishing research control, georeferencing, and masking disturbed areas. This included digital maps from the Israeli Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) for modern LU/LC, georegistered orthophotos (12.5 cm) from the Survey of Israel (SOI) for georeferencing and masking the study area, substrate data for geology and soil, and climate-related data.

In summary, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in this deep learning pipeline include:

1. Archaeological surveys conducted by the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA)
2. Remotely sensed data collected using various technologies such as spaceborne VENμS, airborne LiDAR, and UAV
3. Digital maps obtained from government agencies like the Israeli Ministry of Agriculture (MOA)
4. Georegistered orthophotos acquired from organizations like the Survey of Israel (SOI)
5. Substrate data related to geology and soil, possibly sourced from institutions like the Israel Geological Survey (IGS) or other relevant bodies
6. Climate-related data gathered from services such as the Israel Meteorological Service (IMS) or similar entities
