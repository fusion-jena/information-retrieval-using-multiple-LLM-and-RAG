Table  2  lists  nine  grid  search  ML  models  with  fivefold  cross- 
validation for four WQPs and hyperparameters. Model evaluation and 
hyperparameter selection use cross-validation resampling. The dataset is 
split  into  five  equal-sized  folds  using  fivefold  cross-validation.  Five 
times, one of each fold, the training and assessment process is validated. 
A  more  complete  model  performance  analysis  is  possible.  Averaging 
coefficient of determination (R2) or RMSE across five iterations with five 
folds  improves  model  performance  and  hyperparameter  tuning  effi-
ciency estimation. The Python library’s randint command picks integers 
within a range for hyperparameters like n_estimators and max_depth. We 
use  the  uniform  command  for  discrete  or  continuous  values  inside  a 
range,  like  the  min_samples_split  hyperparameter.  These  commands 
examined  multiple  hyperparameter  value  ranges  to  establish  model

This evaluation helps choose hyperparameters that reduce prediction 
errors and improve model precision. After testing many combinations, 
the best ones were found. During model overfitting, n_estimators, max_-
depth,  and  subsample  were  most  affected.  These  variables  govern  the 
model’s  complexity  and  generalization  to  prevent  overfitting  the 
training  set.  Decisions  were  based  on  whether  final  hyperparameter 
combinations could reduce overfitting and increase model functionality. 
Overfitting  is  common  with  boosting  models.  Hyperparameters  effec-
tively address these  difficulties. Initial hyperparameter  values  for col-
sample_bytree,  learning  rate,  max_depth,  and  n_estimators  were  varied. 
Collapse_by_tree, learning rate, max_depth, and n_estimators range from 0 to 
1, 1, 20, and 200.

Hyperparameter  tuning  plays  a  crucial role  in  optimizing  the  per-
formance of a model by improving its ability to predict observed and 
predicted ranges. The tuning process maximizes the models training and 
testing  performance.  It  will  control  overfitting  or  underfitting  issues 
(Elshawi et al., 2019). Though the process is complex and takes a long 
time,  many  optimizing  methods,  such  as  Manual  Tuning,  Bayesian 
Optimization,  and  random  grid  search  methods,  simplify  the  process 
(Yang  and  Shami,  2020).  Nevertheless,  choosing  which  optimizing 
method is best for specific data is challenging. Hyperparameter tuning of 
the decision tree model are usually configured with maximum depth and 
minimum number of samples required to split a node. For the RF model, 
extensive  experimentation  was  conducted  using  varying  numbers  of 
trees  for  the  optimal  fit.  The  gradient  boosting  model  is  tuned  with

A = N_estimators 
B = Learning_rate 
C = Max_depth 
D = Colsample_bytree 
E = Min_child_weight 
F = Sub_sample 
G = Random_state 
H = Min_samples_split 
I = Min_samples_leaf 
J = Max_features 
K = min_impurity_decrease 
L = min_weight_fraction_leaf 
M = loss 
N = bootstrap 
O = bootstrap_features 
P = max_samples 
Q = max_leaf_nodes 
R = l2_regularization 
S = max_bins 
T = min_child_samples 
U = reg_lambda 
V = reg_alpha 
W = num_leaves

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it discusses the use of fivefold cross-validation for model evaluation and hyperparameter selection. In this method, the dataset is divided into five equal-sized folds, and the training and assessment process is repeated five times, each time using a different fold as the test set. This approach allows for a more comprehensive model performance analysis and can help identify when training should be stopped. Common criteria for stopping training include reaching a predefined number of epochs, achieving a desired level of accuracy or loss on the validation set, or observing no further improvement in validation metrics after several epochs. Without additional information, it cannot be determined which specific criterion was used in this case.
