features; ReLU (The Rectified Linear Unit) refers to the activation function, which is used to perform nonlinear mapping of the output results of the convolutional 
layer; the pooling layer (this study uses max pooling) is used to reduce the dimension of the feature map; the fully connected layers are used to classify input images 
into labels.

CNN represent a cornerstone in the realm of deep learning (Zhou, 
2020),  setting  themselves  apart  from  traditional  machine  learning 
techniques  such  as  Support  Vector  Machines  (SVM),  Random  Forest 
(RF), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Unlike these methods, CNN excel 
in  processing  high-dimensional  imagery,  capturing  intricate  patterns 
and  abstract  features  crucial  for  sophisticated  interpretation  and  pre-
diction tasks (Gu et al., 2018; Pyo et al., 2020). This capability renders 
CNNs particularly valuable in environmental studies, enabling precise 
estimations of cyanobacteria levels and the identification and classifi-
cation of various algal species (Gu et al., 2018; Pyo et al., 2020; Yadav 
et al., 2020).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the primary method for collecting raw data in this deep learning pipeline involves the use of sensors for water quality monitoring. Specifically, the research employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyze spectral bands obtained from water quality monitoring sensors. These sensors likely collect data on various parameters related to water quality, such as temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, and nutrient levels. However, the exact types of sensors used and their specific applications are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Additionally, while the context does not discuss other potential sources of raw data like surveys or public datasets, they could also be relevant depending on the specific goals and requirements of the project. Therefore, it can be concluded that the main method for gathering raw data in this case is through water quality monitoring sensors, but other sources may also be considered based on individual needs and circumstances.
