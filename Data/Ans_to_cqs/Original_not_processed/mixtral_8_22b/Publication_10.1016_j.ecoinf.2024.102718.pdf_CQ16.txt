adaptability, the implementation employs various callbacks, including
learning rate reduction (ReduceLROnPlateau), model checkpointing
(ModelCheckpoint), and early stopping (EarlyStopping). This custom-
ized model is integrated into an ensemble model, which incorporates a
final dense layer with softmax activation to facilitate the classification
task. The training procedure is carried out using a generator-based
method, with a specific focus on assessing the model’s performance on
both the training and validation datasets by implementing established
callbacks.

4. Experimental setup

For our research reproducibility in Algorithm 1, the definitions
include T and ℰ, denoting the paths to the training and testing dataset
directories, respectively. The functions Dtrain and Dtest represent data
generators for training and testing datasets, where parameters such as α,
β, γ, and δ control aspects like rescaling and augmentation. The batch
size for training and testing is denoted by B, while Gtrain and Gtest
represent the respective data generators. The class weights computed for
addressing class imbalance are denoted by wc, and M stands for our
proposed model, encompassing its architecture and compilation pa-
rameters. The number of training epochs is represented by n, and P and
Q denote the steps per epoch for training and validation, respectively.
Predicted outputs and their class labels from the model are represented
by ̂y and ̂yc, while ytrue signifies the true class labels from the testing
dataset. In our model reproducibility in the testing phase in Algorithm 2,

Helpful Answer:
The training completion criteria mentioned in the provided context include the use of various callbacks such as ReduceLROnPlateau, ModelCheckpoint, and EarlyStopping. These callbacks help in modifying the learning rate dynamically based on the validation accuracy and preserving the best performing model iteration throughout the training phase. Specifically, the ReduceLROnPlateau callback reduces the learning rate when a metric has stopped improving, while the EarlyStopping callback stops the training process if a monitored metric has stopped improving after a certain number of epochs. Additionally, the ModelCheckpoint callback saves the best model based on a specified metric, typically validation accuracy or loss. Therefore, these callbacks collectively ensure that the training process is halted once the desired level of performance is achieved, preventing overfitting and unnecessary computational resources usage.
