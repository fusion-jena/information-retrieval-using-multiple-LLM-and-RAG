2.4. Validation of the accuracy of fire risk maps based on vegetation 
indices

of fire risk maps that exhibit enhanced efficacy in fire-sensitive forest 
ecosystems  can  be  achieved  by  utilizing  diverse  remote  sensing  data 
characterized by high spatial resolution, particularly Unmanned Aerial 
Vehicle (UAV) images incorporating multispectral bands. Additionally, 
employing  various  modeling  techniques  such  as  artificial  neural  net-
works, deep learning, and logistic regression can further contribute to 
refining these maps.

into four classes with different susceptibility classes, namely low, me-
dium,  high,  and  extreme,  using  Jenks'  natural  break  classification 
method  in  ArcGIS  10.6.  The  Jenks  Natural  Breaks  categorization  (or 
optimization) system is a data categorization methodology that aims to 
maximize  the  organization  of  a  given  set  of  values  into  distinct  and 
meaningful classes. A natural class refers to the class range considered 
the  most  ideal  and  is  observed  to  occur  “naturally”  within  a  given 
dataset. A class interval consists of elements exhibiting comparable at-
tributes, constituting an inherent grouping within a given dataset. The 
approach  employed  in  this  study  is  to  minimize  the  variance  within 
classes  while  simultaneously  maximizing  the  variance  across  types 
(Jenks, 1967; Liu and Duan, 2018). Numerous studies have employed 
natural break (Jenks) and quantile approaches to classify fire risk maps

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no information about the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in this research. The provided context only discusses the methodology of creating fire risk maps using Landsat 8 imagery and vegetation indices, along with some details about the study area and its environment. There is no mention of any specific software or programming languages used, nor any reference to a public code repository where the implementation could be found. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information regarding the availability of the deep learning pipeline's source code.
