Chai, T., Draxler, R.R., 2014. Root mean square error (rmse) or mean absolute error

and  verification  sets  in  a  ratio  of  3:1.  Five  modelling  methods  were 
selected: random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), multi-layer 
perceptron (MLP), extreme gradient boosting (XGboost), and multiple 
linear  regression  (MLR)  (Abdali  et  al.,  2023;  Fang  et  al.,  2024;  Khan 
et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2023; Xiao et al., 2023b; Xiao et al., 2024). First, 
the model with the highest accuracy was selected to estimate the rice 
LCC and crop coverage degree in the entire study area without consid-
ering the differences in crop coverage. The rice LCC model based on crop 
coverage was then used for estimation, and its accuracy was compared 
with the chlorophyll estimation model without considering differences 
in crop coverage.

%Query
Query: "What type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Transformer, or another type of deep learning model was employed.
