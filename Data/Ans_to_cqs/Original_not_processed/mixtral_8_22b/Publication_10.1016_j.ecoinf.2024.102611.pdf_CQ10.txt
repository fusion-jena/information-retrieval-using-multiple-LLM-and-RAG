leaf-based  plant  species  classification.  However,  medicinal  plants  are 
not the primary focus of this work, and also considered high-resolution 
images for classification tasks. In a recent study (Chulif et al., 2023), 
deep  learning  models  are  used  for  detecting  diseases  in  single  crop 
species by considering real-time field challenges during image acquisi-
tion.  In  a  different  work  (Barhate  et  al.,  2023),  VGG-16  and  dimen-
sionality reduction with ESPCA is adapted to classify thirty-two plant 
species  with  hyperparameter  tuned  and  batch  updated  stochastic 
gradient descent technique. Later, (Ganguly et al., 2022), utilized the 
ResNet-50  architecture  to  capture  the  leaf  feature  patterns  via  fusion 
learning  and  is  trained  on  three  benchmark  datasets  to  showcase  the 
effectiveness of the model. The aforementioned studies do not directly 
focus  on  the  classification  of  a  large  group  of  Indian  medicinal  plant
