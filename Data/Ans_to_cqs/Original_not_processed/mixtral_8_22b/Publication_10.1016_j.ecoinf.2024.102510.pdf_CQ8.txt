search  tests  various combinations of  the hyperparameters  identified in  manual  search and  trains the selected 
models to achieve the maximum possible accuracy through multiple iterations. Experimental analysis revealed 
that the Fine-tuned EfficientNetB0 model exhibited superior performance, achieving an accuracy of 99.12%. In 
contrast, the performance of the ResNet18 model was disappointing with an accuracy of 93.24%, while other 
models outperformed it.

The utilization of an imbalanced dataset for training a deep learning 
model may introduce inherent biases and limitations (Dong et al., 2018). 
It  is  important  to  acknowledge  that  the  dataset  used  may  not  fully 
capture  the  diverse  range  of  bird  populations  present  in  the  wild 
(Gregory and van Strien, 2010). This can result in a biased representa-
tion, potentially impacting the accuracy and generalization ability of the 
model. Factors such as geographical bias, limited sample sizes, or un-
derrepresentation of certain bird species can all contribute to this issue 
(Devenish-Nelson et al., 2019). Therefore, it is crucial to consider the 
limitations and potential biases of the training dataset when interpreting 
the results and making inferences about real-world bird species recog-
nition.  Additionally,  efforts  should  be  made  to  collect  more  compre-
hensive  and  diverse  datasets  that  better  reflect  the  true  variability  of

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The paper does not provide information regarding the availability of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. It only discusses the methodology, experiments, and results related to the study. To find the code repository, one would need to contact the authors directly or check their personal websites or profiles on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. However, based solely on the given context, I cannot determine where the code repository is located.
