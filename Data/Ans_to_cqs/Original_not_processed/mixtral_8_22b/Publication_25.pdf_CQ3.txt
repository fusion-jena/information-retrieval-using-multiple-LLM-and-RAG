solely using the hand-annotated data. This allows for a direct comparison of the contribution of
high-quality annotations when compared to the self-supervised model or the full model combining
both self-supervision and hand-annotation data.

combined with labeled data in a semi-supervised framework (sensu [14]), which may improve deep
learning on limited training data by providing neural networks the opportunity to learn generalized
features on a wider array of training examples, followed by retraining on a smaller number of high
quality annotations [16]. It is unknown whether moderate to low quality annotations can be used
to generate trees for initial model training, given the imperfect nature of existing unsupervised tree
delimitation approaches.

of thousands of noisy labels will yield improved performance, even though these labeled data are
imperfect due to the limitations of the generative algorithm [17].

Figure 1. A conceptual ﬁgure of the proposed semi-supervised pipeline. A Light Detection and
Ranging (LIDAR)-based unsupervised detection generates initial training data for a self-supervised
(red, green, blue (RGB) deep learning model. The model is then retrained based on a small number of
hand-annotated trees to create the full model.

2.1. Study Site and Field Data

We used data from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) site at the San Joaquin
Experimental Range in California to assess our proposed approach (Figure 2). The site contains an open
woodland of live oak (Quercus agrifolia), blue oak (Quercus douglasii), and foothill pine (Pinus sabiniana)
forest. The majority of the site is a single-story canopy with mixed understory of herbaceous vegetation.

The challenge for applying deep learning to natural systems is the need for large training datasets.
A lack of training data is a pervasive problem in remote sensing due to the cost of data collection
and annotation [13]. In addition, the spatial extent of training data often prohibits the ﬁeld-based
veriﬁcation of annotated objects. For tree detection, the high variation in tree crown appearance, due
to taxonomy, health status, and human management, increases the risk of overﬁtting when using small
amounts of training data [10]. One approach to addressing the data limitation in deep learning is
“self-supervised learning” (sensus [14]), which uses unsupervised methods to generate training data
that is used to train supervised models [15]. This approach has recently been applied to remote sensing
for hyperspectral image classiﬁcation [9]. Self-supervision, which only relies on unlabeled data, can be

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions two types of annotations: high-quality annotations and moderate to low-quality annotations. These could refer to various annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, or instance segmentation. Additionally, the study discusses using a combination of self-supervised learning and hand-annotated data, suggesting that both automated and manual annotation methods were employed.
