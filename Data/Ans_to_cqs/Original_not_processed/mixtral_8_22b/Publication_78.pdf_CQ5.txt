Similarly, in [8] hyper-spectral bottom index imagery is used for bottom-type classiﬁca-
tion in coral reef areas. The drawback of this technique is the need for an enormous number
of samples in the dataset for achieving higher accuracy. In [9], they proposed a method
of deep convolutional neural network VGG-19 for corresponding coral classiﬁcation that
needs a massive dataset for better accuracy.

3.1. Explanation of Steps

Initially, an image is taken with the help of an underwater drone. In the next step,
the image is segmentized and divided into small patches. Features are extracted from
each patch with the help of handcrafted descriptors and D-CNNs. A visual vocabulary

(VV) is created, as shown in Figure 4, this visual vocabulary is the features extracted
from these features, and the training features are passed to classiﬁer i.e., SVM, which
classiﬁes whether the VV-features are of bleached coral or healthy coral. We used different
handcrafted features as well as different D-CNN’s but AlexNet shows the highest accuracy.
We used different classiﬁers i.e., SVM, kNN, and decision tree, but SVM outperforms all
other classiﬁers.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The paper does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in their deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the authors have used three different datasets based on the performance tables presented in Tables 2 and 4. These datasets are referred to as the first dataset and the third dataset (Bleached, Healthy, and Dead (BHD) Dataset), respectively. Unfortunately, there is no information available about the second dataset. It should also be noted that the paper does not provide any details regarding the size or nature of these datasets. Therefore, it cannot be confirmed if any standard datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet were used in the study.
