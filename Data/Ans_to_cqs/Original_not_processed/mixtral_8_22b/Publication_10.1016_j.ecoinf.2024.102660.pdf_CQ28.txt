network by enhancing the UNet convolutional neural network. The Convolutional Block Attention Module was 
integrated into the encoding-decoding skip connections of the network, we also refined the convolutional blocks 
to better capture the distinctive semantic features associated with water sun glint. To mitigate overfitting, the 
residual structures were incorporated and the number of convolutional kernels within each block was reduced. 
The Res_AUNet network was trained and evaluated using the WSGD dataset, achieving metrics with an Accuracy 
of 98.02%, an F1-score of 83.67%, and an IOU of 74.73%. These results underscore the precision of our proposed 
method for water sun glint detection in UAV water images, offering valuable insights for effectively eliminating 
water sun glint and determining the optimal timing for UAV water image acquisition.

The feature extraction stage of the Res_AUNet network, as depicted 
in the left portion of Fig. 3(a), comprises five levels. Each level primarily 
incorporates  two  consecutive  convolutional  feature  extraction  opera-
tions. With the exception of level 5, each level employs max-pooling for 
downsample,  reducing  the  size  of  the  image  feature  map  to  half  its

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given information, it is not possible to determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. The text does not provide any details about the deployment environment or platform used for running the Res\_AUNet network. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
