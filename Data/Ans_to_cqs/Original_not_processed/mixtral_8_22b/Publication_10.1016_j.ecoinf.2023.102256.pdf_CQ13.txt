The baseline model comprised a simple CNN architecture that had 
two  convolutional layers (8  filters of  size 16 × 16,  with ReLU activa-
tions), followed by max pooling (4 × 4), a flattening operation, and two 
fully-connected layers (32 ReLU and 22 softmax units respectively) (see 
Fig. 2). Given only a spectrogram input, the baseline model produced a 
probability for each of the 22 species.

Different methods were explored and tested to enhance the neural 
network with contextual information. One straightforward approach to 
incorporate additional information into a deep learning classifier, while

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the type of optimizer employed during training. However, it can be inferred from the context that the authors experimented with different approaches to improve their baseline model, which was a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) consisting of two convolutional layers, max pooling, a flattening operation, and two fully connected layers. They aimed to incorporate additional contextual information without significantly increasing the complexity of the model or the number of parameters. In one of these experiments, they utilized a multi-branch CNN to maintain model simplicity while integrating more data. Unfortunately, no explicit mention of the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning model is present in the provided context.
