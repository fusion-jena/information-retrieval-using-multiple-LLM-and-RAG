Recurrent architectures are not the only means for capturing time 
dependencies effectively. In recent years, Transformer-based architec-
tures  (Vaswani  et  al.,  2017)  have  led  to  remarkable  successes  in 
numerous applications - besides natural language processing (Jaderberg 
et al., 2015; Meinhardt et al., 2022; Zhao et al., 2021), including vision 
tasks (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Since transformers are not conceived in 
a  sequential manner, they exhibit multiple advantages over  recurrent 
architectures, including a more direct gradient flow, a higher level of 
parallelizability  (Zeyer  et  al.,  2019)  and  allowing  for  effective  self- 
supervised pre-training schemes (Devlin et al., 2018). In our efforts to 
use  a  Transformer  version  for  video  prediction,  similar  to  Liu  et  al. 
(2020),  we  encountered  significant  memory  limitations  even  after 
decreasing the hidden channel dimension and resorting only to single

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it is not explicitly stated what specific data format is being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, there are some clues that can help infer possible data formats. The context mentions that the data used was provided as part of the EarthNet2021 Challenge and consists of 23,904 training datacubes located across Europe. This suggests that the data could be in the form of images or videos, as datacubes often refer to multidimensional arrays containing spatial and temporal information, which are commonly found in remote sensing data such as satellite imagery. Additionally, the context also references several papers related to video prediction tasks and convolutional LSTM networks, further supporting the idea that the data may be in the form of videos or sequences of images. Therefore, while it cannot be definitively determined from the given context alone, it is likely that the data used in the deep learning pipeline is in the form of images or videos.
