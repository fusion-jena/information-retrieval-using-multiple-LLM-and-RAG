The supervised learning workflow adheres to the steps outlined in 
Sections 2.3.1–2.3.5. However, as detailed in Section 2.3.2, we deviated 
by not generating 400 random points over the entire boundary. Instead, 
we used the vegetation types described by Gertenbach (1983) to guide 
the placement of our sampling plots, from which we then collected the 
training and validation points (Fig. A.2). The creation of several small 
sampling plots within each vegetation type, instead of using one large 
area, also helped speed up the sampling process. Performing the data 
collection  within  the  sampling  plots  ensured  that  we  had  training/ 
validation  points  that  were  representative  of  the  diverse  vegetation 
within each boundary. To determine the size of the sampling plots, we 
first calculated 5% of the total area covered by the boundary, divided 
that area by the number of vegetation types intersecting the boundary

and then proceeded to label the sampling plots based on vegetation type. 
However, if a vegetation type was too small to accommodate the entire 
sampling plot, we placed the largest area within that vegetation type, 
while  assigning  the  remaining  area  to  the  nearest  largest  vegetation 
type.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no information available regarding how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. The given context does not mention any specific methods such as grid search or random search for hyperparameter optimization. Therefore, it is not possible to provide an accurate response to this query based on the provided context.
