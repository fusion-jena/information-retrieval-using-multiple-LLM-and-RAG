The training data was acquired by sending query parameters through 
the  application  programming  interface  (API)  of  Xeno-Cano  which 
returned a JSON object containing recording metadata. The recordings 
were downloaded according to four query parameters: (i) audio quality, 
corresponding  to  the  highest  audio  quality  (i.e.  A  quality  level),  (ii) 
duration,  corresponding  to  recordings  lasting  from  20  to  60  s,  (iii) 
maximum number of recordings allowed per species, which was set to 
100 to avoid large imbalanced between the classes and ensure accept-
able  computing  power,  and  (iv)  geographic  coordinates  of  the  re-
cordings  that  surrounded  the  Equator  line  in  America.  Geographical 
coordinates were defined according to the latitude of the Tropics, with 
◦
26 ‘10.6”N and 
the Tropic of Cancer in the Northern Hemisphere at 23
26′ 10.6”S. 
the Tropic of Capricorn in the Southern Hemisphere at 23

The model was fine-tuned using the Adam optimizer initialized with 
a default learning rate of 0.0001 and a weight decay of 0. The experi-
ments were conducted in Pytorch on 8 x NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. 
Fine-tuning was performed on the entire model for 100 epochs, with one 
epoch  corresponding  to  500  episodic  tasks.  Estimation  of  the  energy 
consumption related to the training of the models was calculated using 
the Python package CodeCarbon (https://codecarbon.io/) (v2.3.2 with 
Python v3.8.0). This corresponds to the sum of CPU energy, GPU energy 
and  RAM  energy  in  kilowatt-hour  (kWh).  Two  episodic  tasks  were 
constructed from the training set with 5 way-1 shot and 5 way-5 shot 
tasks.  Latent  space  representations  were  finally  extracted  from  the 
backbone of the model to evaluate their capacity to improve the quality 
of clustering.

on the predictions of a model previously trained on labeled data. The 
resulting training dataset serves as a basis to build episodic tasks useful 
for fine-tuning a meta-learning algorithm without human supervision. 
That way, it is possible to (a) define an efficient way to train an UML 
algorithm for tackling the problems related to the shortage of data in 
many ecoacoustic studies, and (b) extract meaningful latent represen-
tations  from  the  algorithm  to  improve  the  quality  of  clustering, 
enhancing our capacity to obtain meaningful ecological information for 
rare or unknown species.

In  addition,  the  average  and  median  ROIs  values  found  for  the 
different numbers of classes in the clusters (excluding noise), as well as 
the total number of ROIs labeled as noise are specified in Appendix B. As 
an example, PN fine-tuned on 5 way-5 shot tasks resulted in 4192 ROIs 
over 8163 labeled as noise, for 23 out of 30 clusters found. This means 
that only 49% of the 8163 ROIs were included in the 23 clusters. 

5. Discussion 

In this study, UML algorithms have been explored for their capacity 
to tackle a recurring problem in ecoacoustics related to the lack of large 
labeled datasets for unknown or rare bird species. We proposed the MEC 
method  for  enabling  unsupervised  acoustic  feature  extraction  to 
improve  the  quality  of  clustering  of  unknown  or  rare  bird  sounds  in 
unlabeled datasets.

Helpful Answer:

From the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of a specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. However, we can infer some aspects about how the model was evaluated and monitored based on the available information.

Firstly, the model was fine-tuned using the Adam optimizer with a default learning rate of 0.0001 and a weight decay of 0. Fine-tuning was performed on the entire model for 100 epochs, with one epoch corresponding to 500 episodic tasks. This suggests that the model's performance might be tracked after each epoch or even after every few epochs to observe its improvement over time.

Secondly, two episodic tasks were constructed from the training set with 5 way-1 shot and 5 way-5 shot tasks. These tasks could potentially serve as evaluation metrics to assess the model's performance during training. By comparing the results obtained from these tasks before and after fine-tuning, researchers would gain insights into whether the model has improved or not.

Lastly, latent space representations were extracted from the backbone of the model to evaluate their capacity to improve the quality of clustering. This implies that the model's ability to generate meaningful latent representations was also considered when monitoring its performance.

However, without more detailed information regarding the implementation of the training process, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer on the exact strategy employed to monitor the model performance during training.
