structured and unstructured data, such as images and text [Jafarzadeh 
et  al., 2022]. The divergence extends  to computational requirements, 
where deep learning models typically demand more resources, including 
GPUs  (Graphics  Processing  Units)  or  TPUs  (Tensor  Processing  Units),

and involve lengthier training times compared to the computationally 
efficient XGBoost [Joshi et al., 2023]. Moreover, the interpretability of 
these models varies significantly. XGBoost stands out by offering feature 
importance scores and decision rules, contributing to a clearer under-
standing  of  its  decision-making  process.  Conversely,  deep  learning 
models  often  carry  the  label  of  “black  box”  due  to  their  complexity, 
making it challenging to interpret and comprehend how they arrive at 
specific predictions [Wu et al., 2021]. Additionally, the performance on 
small  datasets  is  another  distinctive  factor.  XGBoost  demonstrates 
effectiveness  even  with  limited  data  [Chen  and  Guestrin,  2016;  Jing 
et al., 2022], while deep learning models generally require substantial 
datasets to achieve optimal results [Wu et al., 2021; Khruschev et al., 
2022].

To  develop  a  model  for  Fv/Fm  parameter  estimation,  this  study 
employed  the  eXtreme  Gradient  Boosting  (XGBoost)  algorithm,  intro-
duced  by  Chen  and  Guestrin  (2016).  The  arguments  we  applied  to 
XGBoost are as follows: small dataset (two years collection), model ar-
chitecture  (decision  trees),  structured  data  (Fv/Fm  and  vegetation 
indices),  and  feature  importance  scores  (straightforward  and  easy  to 
understand). XGBoost and deep learning models, both classified under 
the  broader  category  of  ML,  exhibit  notable  distinctions  [Wu  et  al., 
2021]. In terms of model architecture, XGBoost adopts an ensemble of 
decision  trees  as  its  foundation,  providing  a  structure  particularly 
effective  for  handling  structured  data  [Chen  and  Guestrin,  2016].  In 
contrast,  deep  learning  models  leverage  artificial  neural  networks 
characterized by multiple layers, allowing them to accommodate both

either  a  larger  footprint  size,  as  seen  with  instruments  such  as  the 
TROPOspheric  Monitoring  Instrument  (SENTINEL-5P  TROPOMI),  The 
SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartog-
raphY (ENVISAT SCIAMACHY), Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment 2 
(GOME-2) or spatially and sparse disjointed registrations from satellites 
like Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) and Orbiting Car-
bon  Observatory-2  (OCO-2).  Nevertheless,  SIF  retrievals  can  identify 
unexpected  instrumental  issues  that  may  impact  other  retrieval  pro-
cesses, given their high sensitivity to additional offsets in radiances, as 
identified by Frankenberg et al. (2011). The cause, involving a thin ice 
layer  on  the  image-sensing  instrument,  has  been  recognized  by  Crisp 
et al., 2017and Sun et al. (2017).

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not directly discuss specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, I can provide some general information about these techniques.

Data annotation is the process of labeling raw data into meaningful categories so that machine learning algorithms can understand and learn from it. In the context of deep learning pipelines, common data annotation techniques include:

1. Bounding Box Annotation: This technique involves drawing boxes around objects within an image to help the model recognize and localize those objects. It is commonly used in object detection tasks.

2. Instance Segmentation: This technique goes beyond bounding boxes by precisely outlining each individual object in an image. It provides pixel-level accuracy and is useful when dealing with overlapping objects or complex scenes.

3. Semantic Segmentation: Unlike instance segmentation, semantic segmentation focuses on classifying every pixel in an image according to its meaning. For example, all pixels belonging to cars would be labeled as 'car', regardless of whether they belong to different car instances.

4. Landmark Annotation: Also known as key point annotation, this technique involves marking specific points on an object to capture its shape or pose. It is often used in facial recognition systems or human body tracking applications.
