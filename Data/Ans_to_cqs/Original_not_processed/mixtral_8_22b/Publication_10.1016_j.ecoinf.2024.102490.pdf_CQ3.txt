Among the ten climatic variables, Bio04 (Temperature Seasonality) 
and Bio14 (Precipitation of Driest Month) contributed the most to the 
prediction of climatic suitability for all the species; Bio17 (Precipitation 
of Driest Quarter) was shown as the third environmental variable as it 
was present in three of the four species (Table 4). The relative contri-
bution of Bio04 and Bio14 was >32% for all species, with Bio04 being 
the largest contributor.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, based on general knowledge about machine learning pipelines, these techniques can be applied during the preprocessing stage of the pipeline. Data annotation is crucial for training supervised machine learning models, including those using deep learning algorithms. Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangles around objects within images to identify their location, while instance segmentation goes further by outlining each object individually. Other common data annotation techniques include semantic segmentation, landmark annotation, and polygon annotation. These methods help create labeled datasets that enable machine learning models to learn patterns and make accurate predictions.
