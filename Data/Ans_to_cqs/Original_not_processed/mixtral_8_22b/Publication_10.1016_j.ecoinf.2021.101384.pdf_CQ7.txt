multi-resolution  decision  approach  is  usually  effective  in  these  cases 
(Magliozzi  et  al.,  2019).  Another  aspect  of  our  approach  is  that  the 
statistical analysis has a higher precision when vessel data are abundant, 
and the analysis resolution is suited to the study area. Thus, the user 
should provide statistically significant data and use the most appropriate 
spatial resolution for the analysis. These considerations relate to general 
issues  with FAIR  data and  big data processing: easy access  to a  large 
amount of data comes at the expense of a low guarantee of data quality 
and completeness. The precision of our workflow's output depends on (i) 
the  completeness  of  the  input  vessel  data,  (ii)  the  update  rate  of  the 
GRSF, (iii) the completeness of the OBIS data in the selected time range, 
and (iv) the suitability of the selected spatial resolution for the analysis. 
However, our first and second case studies have demonstrated that our

workflow  can  compensate  for  some  of  these  biases  –  through  data 
classification  and  spatio-temporal  aggregation  –  mainly  when  large 
input datasets are used. Generally, it is worth noting that all big data 
processing methods are approximate, but they can discover general and 
valuable knowledge if the approximation is tolerated within the appli-
cation context (Coro, 2020b).

At the time of writing, global-scale GFW data were downloadable for 
scientific purposes for the 2012–2016 period only. GFW distributes

vessel  data  aggregated  at  0.01
resolutions  with  fishing 
activity cells already classified through a machine learning model.

2.4. Open Science methodology and tools 

Our  workflow  implements  a  FAIR  approach  that  tests  FAIR  data 
principles’  practicability.  It  is  open-source  (Supplementary  material) 
and was integrated with the DataMiner Cloud computing platform of the 
D4Science e-Infrastructure (Coro et al., 2017), which allows accessing 
the mentioned knowledge sources on-the-fly during processing (Candela 
et al., 2016; Coro et al., 2015a). Data FAIRness is facilitated through the 
indexing of these resources in the D4Science catalogue (Assante et al., 
2019b), which can be accessed by all processes via the Catalogue Services 
for the Web (CSW) standard of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC, 
2020). Geospatial data are offered as standarised NetCDF files available 
on  a  distributed  ISO/OGC  compliant  Spatial  Data  Infrastructure

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention any specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training such as train, test, or validation sets. However, based on common practices in machine learning and deep learning, one could infer that the dataset might be divided into three subsets: training set, validation set, and testing set. Typically, the training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set is employed to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Lastly, the testing set serves to evaluate the final performance of the trained model.

Regarding the percentage distribution of the dataset among these subsets, there isn't a universally accepted rule. Common practice suggests using around 80% of the data for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing. Nonetheless, this division may vary depending on factors like the size of the dataset, its complexity, and the nature of the problem being addressed.
