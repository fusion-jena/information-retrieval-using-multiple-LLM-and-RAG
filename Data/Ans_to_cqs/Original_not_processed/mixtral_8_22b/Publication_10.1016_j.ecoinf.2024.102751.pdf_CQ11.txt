2.3. ALS data

ALS point clouds were downloaded through the official website of
the General Office of Geodesy and Cartography (GUGiK), the Geoportal
for Spatial Information Infrastructure (https://www.geoportal.gov.pl;
Table 1). The portal provides free spatial data. Geoportal complies with
the INSPIRE Directive, an initiative to make spatial data available in
Europe, which aims to create a harmonized spatial information system
in the European Union (Directive 2007/2/EC 2007). The parameters of
ALS data are shown in Table 1.

imagery collected on 2020-08-22 was used.

2.4. Satellite data

2.5. Developing predictive model

PlanetScope is a large constellation of nanosatellites capable of im-
aging the globe daily, offering more opportunities for cloud-free images.
The first groups of PlanetScope satellites were launched in 2015, and the
constellation currently consists of >180 satellites placed in helio-
synchronous orbits. The satellites have digital cameras that offer four
spectral bands: red, green, blue, and infrared, with a spatial resolution of
3.7 m at the nadir, where the nadir is defined as the point on the Earth’s
surface directly below the satellite. For end users, imagery is re-sampled

Query: "What is the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct answer to your query. However, it can be noted that some datasets mentioned in the context are accessible via certain platforms such as the General Office of Geodesy and Cartography (GUGiK)'s Geoportal for Spatial Information Infrastructure (<https://www.geoportal.gov.pl>) and PlanetScope's satellite imagery. These sources may contain relevant data for developing a deep learning pipeline, but they do not represent a complete deep learning pipeline themselves.
