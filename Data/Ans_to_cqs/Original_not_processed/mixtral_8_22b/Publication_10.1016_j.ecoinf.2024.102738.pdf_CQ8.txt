◦

The study area extends from 78
◦
30′ to 6

◦
58′ west longitude, and
06′ to 78
◦
02′ south latitude, covering 2904.96 km2, has elevations from
5
351 to 3684 m.a.s.l. and encompasses the Alto Mara˜n´on II and III inter-
basins, as well as the lower Utcubamba river basin, as shown in Fig. 1.
This area was chosen as a case study because it is currently the most
affected sector by the cultivation of rice, coffee, cocoa, and extensive
livestock farming in the aforementioned watersheds of the Amazonas
and Cajamarca regions,
located in the northwest Peru (Gobierno
Regional de Amazonas (GOREA) and Instituto de Investigaciones de la
Amazonía Peruana (IIAP), 2007; Gobierno Regional de Cajamarca
(GRC), 2010MIDAGRI, 2021).

Taking into account Congalton (1991) and Hay (1979), who suggest
at least 50 pixels per thematic class, we decided to implement an
alternative strategy. Instead of strictly distributing 196 training areas
among the 6 thematic classes, we chose to include pure training areas.
These well-identified areas should contain at least 50 pixels in total and
prominently represent the class of interest. This distribution was carried
out through simplified random sampling (Chuvieco, 2020), allowing us
to effectively capture variability within each class and improve the

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no information provided about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The given context only includes details about datasets, spectral indices, land use and land cover (LULC) classes, and the location of the study area. It does not mention any specific code repositories such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, without additional information, it is impossible to determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is located.
