When training a deep convolutional neural network, it is important to split the data
into a training set, a validation set, and a test set. The training set is used for optimizing the
parameters of the network, while the validation set is used for monitoring the performance
of the network during training and for comparing the performance of different networks
with, for example, different hyperparameters or network structures. The test set acts as a
ﬁnal evaluation of a network. To ensure a proper evaluation on both the validation set and
the test set, samples in each set must be independent and have similar class distributions.
The full data set can be split in various ways. The naïve approach is to randomly
sample images from the full data set. However, due to the images being captured in
close proximity and potentially having overlapping ﬁelds of views, information may leak
between the data sets when using the naïve approach. Another approach would be to

All networks were trained on the training set for 100 epochs, using the Adam opti-
mizer [27] with a learning rate of 0.001 and cross-entropy loss. The image batch size varied
from 1 to 32 images, depending on the input image resolution with larger batch sizes
for smaller image sizes. After each epoch, the network was evaluated on the validation
set. The epoch model with the highest accuracy on the validation set during training was
saved for further analysis. Before training the networks, the training set was balanced by
upsampling the images from the underrepresented classes through repetition to match the
number of images of the most represented class, “No species”.

The following three-step data augmentation procedure was applied to the images dur-
ing training before being processed by the network: (1) randomly ﬂip image horizontally,
(2) scale the contrast of each image channel by a random factor between 0.8 and 1.2, and (3)
randomly crop the image to a square with side lengths equal to the image height.

A preliminary test showed that the processing platform could evaluate images with
a resolution of 224 × 224 pixels in real time, using ResNet50-v2 [22]. MobileNet-v2 [23]
is a network structure designed with mobile devices in mind. In other words, it aims
for good performance with a low computational load. Both network structures are avail-
able in Keras [24] that is a high-level API based on Tensorﬂow [25], and they include
weights pre-trained on ImageNet [26], making them easy to evaluate in the case at hand.
Therefore, the two network structures ResNet50-v2 and MobileNet-v2 were explored for
image classiﬁcation.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, the data format used in this deep learning pipeline is images. This is evident from several mentions throughout the text, such as references to image resolutions, image channels, and cropping images. Additionally, the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), specifically ResNet50-v2 and MobileNet-v2, which are popular architectures for image classification tasks, further supports this conclusion. There is no mention of any other data formats like audio, video, or CSV files in the provided context.
