The second part corresponds to the spectral entropy index Hf , which measures the Shannon uniformity of the frequency spectrum. Hf  is calculated 
using the spectral probability mass function s(f), obtained by averaging the spectrogram on the time axis and normalizing it over the number of 
frequency bins Nf . Therefore,

The  index  is  calculated  as  the  multiplication  of  the  temporal  and  spectral  entropy  indices:  H = Ht⋅Hf .  Its  purpose  is  to  encode  the  acoustic 
complexity by entropy, assuming that it increases with species richness and the number of individuals. In this case, complexity is a synonym for 
heterogeneity, and many EAI are based on this same hypothesis.

B.5. Acoustic Entropy Index (H) 

The Entropy Index (H) was proposed by Sueur et al. (2008) as an indicator of heterogeneity and is based on estimating the Shannon uniformity over 

time and frequency. First, the temporal entropy index Ht  is computed by normalizing the signal envelope a(n) over time: 

Ht = (cid:0)

∑Nt

n=1

a(n)log2(a(n) )
log2(Nt)

∈ [0, 1]

(B.6) 

Each time instant Nt  has an associated amplitude value, normalized by dividing it by log2(Nt), corresponding to the maximum value of the Shannon 
index and depending on the number of amplitude samples (or categories in information theory). The main advantage of using a base two logarithm is 
its sensitivity to infrequent categories. Hence, low probability categories are influential in acoustic diversity. Furthermore, normalization provides a 
relative value that decreases bias from constant noise sources.

Helpful Answer:

The provided context does not directly address the query about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, some general strategies can be mentioned to manage randomness in such scenarios.

Random seeds play a crucial role in reproducibility when training machine learning models. To ensure consistent results across different runs or experiments, one common strategy is to set a fixed random seed value before starting any data preprocessing, model initialization, or training process. This ensures that the sequence of pseudo-random numbers generated remains the same each time the code is executed, leading to more reliable comparisons between different configurations or hyperparameters.

Another approach to managing randomness involves employing techniques like cross-validation or bootstrapping. Cross-validation involves splitting the dataset into multiple folds and iteratively training the model on different subsets while testing on the remaining fold. Bootstrapping, on the other hand, creates new datasets by randomly sampling instances with replacement from the original dataset. Both methods help reduce variance and improve the robustness of the trained models against random fluctuations in the input data.

Additionally, ensemble methods can also be used to mitigate the effects of randomness. Ensemble methods combine predictions from multiple models, often trained independently, to produce a final output. By aggregating the outputs of several models, these methods tend to provide better overall performance and stability compared to individual models.

Lastly, regularization techniques like dropout or weight decay can be applied during training to prevent overfitting and enhance the model's ability to generalize well even in the presence of noisy or random inputs. Dropout works by randomly deactivating neurons during training, effectively creating a different network architecture for each iteration, while weight decay adds a penalty term to the loss function to discourage large weights.
