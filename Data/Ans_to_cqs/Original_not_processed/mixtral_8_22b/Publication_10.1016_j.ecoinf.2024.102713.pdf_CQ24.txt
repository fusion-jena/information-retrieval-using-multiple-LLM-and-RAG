The relational schema of CASE’s database is shown in Fig. A.18. CASE is based on a concept of Task, i.e., a questionnaire that must be fulfilled by a 
User (i.e., an on-field operator). Each task is composed by a set of Questions, categorized in different types (e.g., multiple answers, date picker) each 
composed by a set of predefined Answers (one of which could be an open answer, defined by the user when selecting the Given answer). The 
dynamic aspect of CASE’s questionnaires lies in the association of each possible answer with a different one to be shown next. Thus, users fulfilling the 
same task may follow different paths of questions depending on the given answers. This enables a customized and efficient user experience, as detailed 
questions on a given topic may be asked only if such a topic has been mentioned by the user. Instances of tasks (i.e., Task on geo-object) are

4.2. Validation of the automatic SVP quantification 

Spontaneous  vegetation  is  usually  one  of  the  factors  that  attracts 
H. halys individuals (Venugopal et al., 2015a; Venugopal et al., 2015b); 
in this study, its quantification in the surroundings of a monitoring trap 
(i.e., the spontaneous vegetation percentage within a 200 m radius from 
the trap) is done both manually (via CASE, by the technician that installs

The integration with satellite images allows the calculation of the 
spontaneous  vegetation  percentage  (SVP)  in  the  close  surroundings  of  a 
trap.  Indeed,  spontaneous  vegetation  is  a  known  attraction  factor 
(Venugopal et al., 2015a; Venugopal et al., 2015b). This datum is also 
asked to the operator that deploys the trap; from here on, we indicate the 
latter  with  “SVP  (manual)”,  whereas  “SVP  (auto)”  refers  to  the  one 
calculated from satellite images. Manually determining the correct SVP 
value by sight is not trivial, due to the operator’s subjectivity and the 
often inconvenient observation point at the ground level. Satellite im-
ages offer a systematic and objective way to calculate it. Several tech-
niques are known in the literature to extract vegetation statistics from 
satellite  images,  the  most  known  being  the  Normalized  Difference 
Vegetation Index6 (NDVI) (Deering, 1978). In short, the index assigns to

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, several strategies can be employed. One common approach is using fixed seeds for reproducibility. By setting a specific seed value, the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers will be generated, ensuring consistent results across experiments. Another strategy involves averaging over multiple runs with different initializations or shuffling orders. This technique helps reduce variance and improve overall performance. Additionally, techniques like dropout regularization and batch normalization can introduce controlled noise during training, mitigating the impact of random initialization. However, these strategies do not directly address the issue of randomness in the provided context. Therefore, further information about the specific deep learning pipeline used in the case would be needed to provide a more accurate response.
