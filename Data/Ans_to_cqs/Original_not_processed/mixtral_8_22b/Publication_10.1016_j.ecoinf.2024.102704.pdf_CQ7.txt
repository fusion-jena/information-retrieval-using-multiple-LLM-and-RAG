2.4. Model training 

The  experiments  were  conducted  on  a  Windows  10-based  mobile 
laptop  equipped  with  an  Intel(R)  i7-11800H  CPU  and  a  GeForce 
RTX3080  GPU  with  16GB  of  video  memory.  The  PyCharm  software 
platform was utilised to carry out the experiments, employing Python 
3.8 and the Pytorch 1.9 deep learning framework for training purposes. 
The  details  of  the  specific  environmental  configurations  and  model 
training parameters are listed in Table 1. To enhance detection accuracy, 
this study established detection thresholds of IoU = 0.3 and score = 0.3, 
indicating that a bounding box with a likelihood of containing a fish of 
30% or higher was considered valid and thus retained.

(n), small (s), medium (m), large (l), and extra-large (x). These scales 
meet the requirements of various scenarios and tasks. As scale increases, 
so does the network depth and width of the model; therefore, ‘n’  rep-
resents the smallest and fastest scale, whereas ‘x’ is the largest and offers 
the  highest  accuracy.  Although  the  accuracy  improves  as  the  model 
depth increases, this also leads to changes in the number of parameters, 
amount  of  computation,  and  detection  speed,  with  correspondingly 
higher demands on the hardware configuration. To delve deeper into the 
underlying causes of enhancing model lightweight and inference speed, 
we utilised LigObNet, YOLOv5, YOLOv6, YOLOv7, and YOLOv8 to train 
across  four  scales:  n,  s,  m,  and  l.  As  Fig.  9  illustrates,  reducing  the 
number  of  parameters  in  the  various  models  does  not  enhance  the 
processing speed. The total parameter count, representing the combined

Helpful Answer:
Answer: The targeted fish species dataset was divided into training and validation sets in an 8:2 ratio using a random selection process. This means that 80% of the dataset was allocated for training the deep learning model, while the remaining 20% was reserved for validation during the training phase. No mention was made of any separate testing set, which would typically be used after training to evaluate the final performance of the model.
