Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

All  experiments  were  performed  on  a  personal  computer  with  a 
1060Ti GPU and an Ubuntu 20.04 operating system. Additionally, CUDA 
v10.1 was applied to train the model, which accelerated the processing 
speed; Python version 3.7 was also used. The other libraries used were 
NumPy  (v1.21.2),  PyTorch  (v1.6.0),  Pycocotools,  Cython,  Matplotlib, 
tqdm, yacs, and OpenCV. 

The wild  animals  were tracked  using the  Siamese  network,  which 
updated the connection weights of each network layer by learning the 
features of the training samples. This ensured that the tracking method 
produced  accurate  results(Kang  et  al.,  2019).  In  comparison  with 
traditional training methods, the few-shot learning method can rapidly
