5. Discussion 

In this study we developed a workflow which leveraged citizen sci-
ence data to extract further relevant records from social media posts in 
the  same  region.  The  workflow  functions  as  a  data  filter  enabling 
downsampling of an initially very large dataset into a human analysable 
subset - in our case containing 0.5% of the original posts. By massively 
reducing  data  volumes,  it  becomes  realistic  to  analyse  the  remaining 
data by hand to select true positives, with around one hour required for 
the  4000  or  so  candidate  posts  we  identified.  Our  workflow  thus  ad-
dresses  the  research  gap  identified  by  Burke  et  al.,  2022,  using  gen-
eralisable  methods  to  extract  target  data  from  various,  unverified 
sources to enrich data.

identified by both textual and visual analysis, we could achieve almost 
perfect  precision  (0.992),  at  the  cost  of  lower  recall.  Thirdly,  by 
combining the two approaches, we increased the extracted data volume 
by almost 14%, while still downsamping the original dataset by around 
99.5% and with a precision 0.636. Recall for the workflow overall is not 
known, since this would require manual analysis of over 600,000 posts. 
Our results thus go further than previous work by demonstrating how 
images  retrieved  using  text  and  image  metadata  can  be  combined  to 
achieve  very  high  precision,  or  merged  to  increase  recall  while  still 
filtering initial datasets very effectively. To better understand our results 
and their transferability to other species, we looked more closely at data 
quality.  Flickr  users  often  used  relevant  textual  descriptions  to  label 
their  red  kite  sightings  with  their  captured  images.  This  high  textual

quality  of  extracted  information  in  isolation  through  metrics  such  as 
precision and recall, but do not explore the added value of integrating 
data. These gaps lead to three research questions, which we address in 
what follows. The first two questions relate to the development of our 
workflow:  

1.  How can a generic workflow be developed which leverages expert 
contributions from citizen science data to extract content from social 
media posts related to a given species, which can easily be used in 
practical applications?  

2.  How can multiple modalities (e.g. text and images) be used to extract 
relevant information and does such a combination result in higher 
recall and/or precision? 

The third research question relates to the added value of our work-

flow in integrating data from different sources. 

3. What added value with respect to coverage, type, overlap and vol-
ume can we identify using a combination of citizen science and social 
media data?

In this paper we propose, implement and evaluate a workflow taking 
advantage of citizen science data documenting and recording sightings 
of birds, and more specifically red kites (Milvus milvus). Analysing social 
media data until recently has often used simple keyword-based methods 
to perform an initial filtering or search step, meaning that content tag-
ged in other ways was not found. However, improvements in content- 
based  classification  now  mean  that  it  is  also  possible  to  use  off-the- 
shelf,  pre-trained  algorithms  to  reliably  identify  predefined  classes 
such  as  presence  of  buildings,  people  or  birds  in  image  data  with 
reasonable accuracy. Our workflow uses these improvements, together 
with training data generated from citizen scientists, to identify further 
relevant sightings in a social media dataset using both textual metadata 
and  image  content.  Since  both  datasets  include  metadata  capturing

Helpful Answer:

In the provided context, the authors discuss a workflow designed to leverage citizen science data and extract relevant records from social media posts about a specific species, in this case, red kites. While the context doesn't explicitly mention the collection of raw data via surveys, sensors, or public datasets, it does imply that the researchers utilize existing citizen science data and social media data.

Citizen science data refers to scientific observations made by non-professional volunteers, typically collected through platforms like iNaturalist, eBird, or Zooniverse. In this case, the researchers likely sourced bird sighting data documented and recorded by citizen scientists.

For social media data, the researchers employed a method that combines textual metadata and image content to identify relevant sightings. They achieved this by utilizing off-the-shelf, pre-trained algorithms capable of identifying predefined classes, such as the presence of birds, in image data with reasonable accuracy.

To summarize, although the context does not directly state the use of traditional data collection methods like surveys, sensors, or public datasets, it implies that the researchers rely on citizen science data and social media data. They employ advanced techniques, including content-based classification and pre-trained algorithms, to process and analyze these data sources within their workflow.
