2.2. Unmanned aerial vehicle data processing 

Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data is processed using CATALYST 
PROFESSIONAL image processing software. The UAV data processing 
process is divided into six significant steps.  

i)  Camera parameter correction: this stage aids in identifying and 
correcting  image  distortions  caused  by  lens  curvature,  focal 
length, and perspective effects;  

ii)  Set up  connection points: A linked point is  a  spot that may  be 
visually recognized on overlapping areas between two or more 
images;  

iii)  Point fine-tuning: in this stage, the constraint points established 
in the previous step are improved to eliminate those with high 
error values (values more than 0.5) that were deleted from the 
computational model;  

iv)  Edit ground control points: Establish ground control points to edit 
the  dataset’s  georeferenced  to  the  WGS84/UTM  coordinate 
system;

aid managers in developing strategies to avoid forest fires and imple-
menting follow-up investigations.

findings requires careful consideration and evaluation within the spe-
cific context of each geographical region. Despite achieving high per-
formance,  our  study  was  constrained  by  limitations  in  resources  and 
time,  which  resulted  in  a  narrow  focus  on  specific  forest  samples.

Helpful Answer:
After model training, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the requirements of the project. Some common postprocessing steps include:

1. Model Evaluation: This involves calculating various metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, overall accuracy (OA), and Kappa coefficient to evaluate the performance of the trained model. These metrics help determine how well the model has learned to classify different land use/land cover classes or forest types. In the given context, Tables 7 and 8 show the results of these evaluations for LULC and forest type classification respectively.

2. Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix is a table used to visualize the performance of a machine learning algorithm. It shows the number of correct and incorrect predictions made by the model for each class. By analyzing the confusion matrix, one can identify patterns in misclassifications and improve the model accordingly.

3. Saliency Maps: Saliency maps highlight important features in input images that contribute significantly towards making accurate predictions. They provide insights into what parts of the image the model focuses on while making decisions. However, there is no mention of saliency maps in the provided context.

4. Data Visualization: Postprocessing also includes visualizing the output data in meaningful ways like generating heatmaps, scatter plots, etc. This helps in understanding the spatial distribution of classified objects and their relationships with other variables.

In summary, some common postprocessing steps after model training include model evaluation, creating confusion matrices, generating saliency maps, and data visualization. Each step serves a unique purpose and contributes towards improving the overall quality of the final output.
