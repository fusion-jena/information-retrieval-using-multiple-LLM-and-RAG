a  high  dimensional  feature  vector1.  Then,  the  Decoder 
semantically projects the features learned by the encoder 
onto the pixel space, generating a corresponding density 
distribution for the given image. This density map is used 
to  get  the  number  of  objects  by  simply  integrating  the 
density distribution over the region (see “Counting from 
density map” section) (Fig. 1).

Data preparation

Both data sets were split into training and testing images 
with  a  ratio  of  80  :  20,  respectively.  For  the  SSLs’  data 
set,  the  first  800  images  were  used  for  training,  and  the 
remaining  148  were  used  as  test  images  to  evaluate  the 
model’s  performance.  For  the  elephants’  data  set,  1649 
images  were  used  for  training,  while  452  images  were 
used for testing.

In  the  proposed  work,  the  down-sampling  (contract-
ing)  path  repeatedly  applies  a  block  comprised  of  two 
3 × 3  convolutions,  followed  by  batch-normalization, 
a  Rectified  Linear  Unit  (ReLU)  activation  and  a  2 × 2 
max-pooling  layer  of  stride  2.  The  number  of  feature 
map  channels  in  the  contracting  path  is  doubled  at 
each  down-sampling  block.  Similarly,  the  up-sampling 
(expansive)  path  replaces  the  max-pooling  layers  with 
up-sampling layers that apply nearest-neighbor interpo-
lation.  Analogous  to  the  contracting  path,  the  number 
of  feature  map  channels  is  halved  at  each  up-sampling 
block.  The  feature  maps  of  the  up-sampling  path  are 
concatenated  with  the  feature  maps  of  the  contracting 
path. Finally, the output layer results by applying a 1 × 1 
convolution.

Loss function

The  Model-K  architecture  is  a  regression  model  based 
on  VGG16  without  the  feature  extractor  on  top.  The 
output layer was flattened and given as input to 2 fully 
connected  (FC)  layers  with  linear  output.  The  regres-
sion  model  was  designed  to  predict  classwise  (five 
categories)  count.  To  compare  it  with  the  proposed 
solution,  we  modify  the  model  by  connecting  the  out-
put  layer  with  a  fully  connected  one  output  neuron. 
Model-K  was  initialized  with  pre-trained  Imagenet 
weights  and  then  trained  using  our  training  data  set 
with  a  Stochastic  Gradient  Descent  (SGD)  optimizer 
and  an  MSE  loss  function.  The  proposed  Model-2 
with  EfficientNet  feature  extractor  reached  an  RMSE 
value  of  1.88  and  0.60  for  the  SLL  and  elephants’  data 
sets,  respectively,  performing  better  than  the  Model-K 
with  an  RMSE  of  2.17  and  0.81  for  SSL  and  elephants’

EfficientNet-B5  feature  extractor  [27].  EfficientNet  is  a 
CNN  developed  by  Google,  characterized  by  high  accu-
racy  and  computational  efficiency.  Model-2  was  initial-
ized  by  pre-trained  weights  based  on  the  Imagenet  data 
set  [28].  All  the  parameters  were  optimized  using  the 
Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001.

Training

An  Nvidia  GeForce  RTX  2060  GPU  was  used  for  train-
ing,  with  a  batch  size  of  8.  Model-1  (without  feature 
extractor)  was  trained  for  7  h  and  Model-2  (with  a  fea-
ture  extractor)  for  17  h.  Based  on  the  model’s  perfor-
mance on the validation set, the early stopping technique 
was  applied  to  avoid  over-fitting.  Model-2,  which  used 

pre-trained  weights  and  thus  some  prior  relevant  infor-
mation, converged faster than Model-1 (Fig. 3).

Helpful Answer:
Based on the provided context, there isn't any explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, I can provide some general strategies often employed to manage randomness in deep learning models:

1. Fixed Random Seed: One common strategy is setting a fixed random seed value before running experiments or training models. This ensures reproducibility since the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers will be generated every time the code runs.

2. Multiple Runs: Another approach is to run the experiment multiple times with different random seeds and report average performance metrics. This helps mitigate the impact of random initialization and provides more robust estimates of model performance.

3. Data Shuffling: In many cases, shuffling the dataset before splitting it into training and validation/test sets can help reduce bias introduced by the order of samples.

4. Cross-Validation: Using techniques like k-fold cross-validation can also help minimize the effect of randomness by averaging model performance across different subsets of the data.

While these strategies aren't explicitly mentioned in the provided context, they are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to address randomness issues.
