Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

These may be inferred by combining more mechanistic models with the 
empirical laboratory experiments (e.g. Guarini et al., 2021). Given the 
availability of sensors and the fast development of technology, having 
big-data on valve gaping from a few sentinel organisms together with 
temperature  and  chlorophyll,  becomes  more  and  more  feasible  these 
days. Having such big-data should improve predictions on productivity, 
and be a major aid for aquaculture decision making, for multiple areas 
and species, especially in the context of ‘precision shellfish farming’. 

Funding

All  data  analysis  was  conducted  in  R  4.0.5  (R  Development  Core 
Team, 2021). Gaping data, expressed in proportion of aperture where 
0 is fully closed and 1 is fully opened, and recorded at 1 Hz (see Bertolini 
et al., 2021c), were averaged (mean) over 5 min in the Venice Lagoon 
and over 1 min in the Wadden Sea. This difference in averaging time was 
due to different lengths of deployment periods. Using 1 min averages 
would  make  the  Venice  files  too  large  to  easily  process,  while  in  the 
Wadden Sea this higher frequency was technical feasible. Daily curves of 
gaping for each sensor were then used as input in the analysis yielding 
1286 daily curves for the Venice Lagoon and 203 daily curves for the 
Wadden Sea.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (train, test, validation). However, it can be inferred that the data collected from the Venice Lagoon and the Wadden Sea were analyzed separately due to differences in averaging times caused by varying deployment period lengths. The study mentions using daily curves of gaping for each sensor as input in the analysis, resulting in 1286 daily curves for the Venice Lagoon and 203 daily curves for the Wadden Sea. It is possible that the datasets were divided into training, testing, and validation sets based on these daily curves or other factors related to the specific research objectives. Without further details, it cannot be determined exactly how the data was split for deep learning model training.
