Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Between Oct 2012 and Sept 2016, 2,786 users (including only the number of users which
had registered with the site and performed more than five annotations) listened to 127,451
unique clips and made 605,907 annotations. 14,339 of these clips were labelled as containing a
bat call, with 10,272 identified as containing search-phase echolocation calls. Due to the inher-
ent difficulty of identifying bat calls and the inexperience of some of our users, we observed a
large number of errors in the annotations provided. How to best merge different annotations
for multiple users is an open research question. Instead, we visually inspected a subset of the
annotations from our most active user and found that they produced high quality annotations.
This top user had viewed 46,508 unique sound clips and had labelled 3,364 clips as containing
bat search-phase echolocation calls (a representative sample is shown in Supplementary Infor-

and semantic segmentation. Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern rec-
ognition; 2014.

racy on the test set from Romania and Bulgaria compared to the expert curated ground truth.
This resulted in an average precision of 0.845 (computed from 455 out of 500 test files this user
had labelled). This is in contrast with the second most prolific annotator who had an average
precision of 0.67 (based on 311 out of 500 files).

many more unused annotations in the Bat Detective dataset that could potentially increase our
training set size. However, we found some variability in the quality of the citizen science user
annotations, as in other studies [61]. To make best use of these annotations, we need user
models for understanding which annotations and users are reliable [62, 63]. The Bat Detective
dataset also includes annotations of particular acoustic behaviours (feeding buzzes and social
calls), which in future can be used to train detection algorithms for different acoustic behav-
iours [e.g., 64].

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that between October 2012 and September 2016, 2,786 users listened to 127,451 unique clips and made 605,907 annotations. It can be inferred that the annotation technique used was audio clip labeling or tagging, where users labeled whether a given audio clip contained a bat call or not. Additionally, the text refers to a top user who had viewed 46,508 unique sound clips and had labeled 3,364 clips as containing bat search-phase echolocation calls. This further supports the assumption that the annotation technique used was audio clip labeling or tagging. Unfortunately, there is no mention of any visual annotation techniques such as bounding boxes or instance segmentation since the task involves analyzing audio data rather than images or videos.
