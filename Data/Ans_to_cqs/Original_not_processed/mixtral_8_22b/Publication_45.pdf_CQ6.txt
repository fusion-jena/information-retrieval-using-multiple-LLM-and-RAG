In the training phase of a DNN the connection weights (w in 
Figure 1) between neurons are iteratively updated by a training 
algorithm  to  minimize  the  prediction  error  over  the  training 
data  set  (see  Supplementary  Material  S2  for  more  details). 
In  order  to  gauge  the  accuracy  of  predictions  for  new  input 
data  (i.e.,  data  not  used  during  training),  the  available  data  is 
frequently split into a training data set (used for training), and 
a test data set. The details of the network architecture, such as 
the  size  of  the  network,  the  selection  of  specific  layer  types, 
and parameters of the training process strongly determine the 
prediction  accuracy  of  the  network  and  are  usually  problem 
specific. More information on deep learning is available in e.g.,

Deep  learning  is  a  relatively  recent  development  in  ML.  Its 
main tool, the deep neural network (DNN), builds upon Artificial 
Neural Networks (ANNs) which were already conceived in the 
middle of the last century. Essentially, “deep learning” refers to a 
set of techniques that allow the training of larger (more neurons) 
and  deeper  (more  layers)  ANNs  (Nielsen,  2015).  These  high 
capacity  networks  became  possible  due  to  the  development  of 
improved  algorithms  for  optimizing  connection  weights  [e.g., 
stochastic  gradient  descent  (Rumelhart  et  al.,  1986)]  and  a 
steep  increase  in  available  computing  power  and  training  data 
(Goodfellow et al., 2016). While these improvements may seem 
only gradual, current DNNs not only outperform their simpler 
ANN  ancestors,  but  frequently  also  perform  better  than  other 
ML approaches in standardized tests of prediction accuracy (e.g.,

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be applied to improve its performance and efficiency. Some common preprocessing steps include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing or correcting any inconsistencies, errors, or missing values in the dataset. It ensures that the model learns from accurate and reliable data.

2. Feature Scaling: Also known as normalization, this step scales numerical features to have similar magnitudes. Common methods include Min-Max scaling, where all feature values are scaled between 0 and 1, and Standardization, where each value is subtracted by the mean and divided by the standard deviation. Scaling helps prevent certain features from dominating others due to differences in scale.

3. One-Hot Encoding: When dealing with categorical variables, one-hot encoding converts them into binary vectors. Each category becomes a separate column, and a '1' indicates the presence of that category while '0' denotes absence. This allows the model to handle non-numerical inputs.

4. Dimensionality Reduction: Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduce the number of input features without losing significant information. This simplifies the model and reduces computation time.

5. Data Augmentation: To artificially expand the dataset, various transformations like rotation, flipping, zooming, etc., can be applied to existing images. This increases the diversity of training samples and improves the model's ability to generalize.

These preprocessing steps help prepare the data for efficient and effective training of deep learning models. However, it's important to note that not all steps might be necessary depending on the nature of the dataset and the specific requirements of the task.
