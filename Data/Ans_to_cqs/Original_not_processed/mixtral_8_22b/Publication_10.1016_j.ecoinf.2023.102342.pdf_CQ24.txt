Fig. 2. – Apriori workflow to generate frequent itemsets.  

1) First iteration: Each 1-itemset is considered a candidate. All 1-item-
sets whose occurrence satisfied the minimum parameters provided 
of support and confidence were taken ahead of the next iteration, and 
the others were pruned.

in Fig. 2. 

The  numerical  values  of  some  parameters  (Tan  et  al.,  2019)  were 
calculated and provided as measures of the association values to explain 
the data mining results. The support parameter measures the abundance 
or  frequency  (often  interpreted  as  important)  of  a  set  of  items  in  a 
database. The value of the support parameter is given by the ratio be-
tween  the  number  of  times  an  item  appears  and  the  total  number  of 
items. We refer to a set of molecules as a “set of frequent molecules” if 
support  exceeds  a  specified  minimum  threshold  we  can  identify.  In 
general, the threshold depends on the size of the dataset.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the provided context, there does not seem to be any direct information regarding strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to use fixed random seeds or deterministic algorithms to ensure reproducibility and consistency across experiments. This allows researchers to compare different methods and architectures more accurately. Additionally, techniques like cross-validation and ensemble methods can help mitigate the effects of randomness in training datasets and improve overall performance.
