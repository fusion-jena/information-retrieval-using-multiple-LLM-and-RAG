Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

mask. (3) Training set: grid with neighborhood features of six years (1986, 2005, 2008, 2010, and 2013). The features include the LU type, soil, topography, elevation, slope, aspect, distance to settlements, distance to roads, distance to rivers in this grid unit, and the 4 neighborhood grid units. (4) Constraint Factors: The statistical data and the quantity simulated by the backtracking of the Markov model are combined, and the numbers of different LU types in 2000 after modification by the simulation numbers are as follows (Table 1): 2.4.2. Deep Learning Module Probability maps (Figure 9): Water and settlements are constraint factors and can be determined by manual interpretation, and thus, no simulation is needed.  Figure 9.

DM in series. The deep learning method can model complex spatiotemporal dependencies, fit the drivers and mechanisms of the LUCC, derive the probability maps needed for the SM, and perform further LU simulations.  Figure 4. Deep learning module. A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is also known as an ANN. In addition to the input/output layer, it can have multiple hidden layers in between. The simplest MLP contains only one hidden layer, i.e., a total of three layers, and its structure is shown in Figure 5. The MLP has full connections between the layers. The bottom layer of the MLP is the input layer, the middle layer is the hidden layer, and the top layer is the output layer. Assuming that the input layer is denoted by the vector X, then the output of the hidden layer is f (W1X + b1), where W1 is the weight and b1 is the offset. The commonly used functions (f) include the sigmoid function, tanh function, ReLU function, among others. Remote Sens. 2020, 12, 3314

A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is also known as an ANN. In addition to the input/output layer,
it can have multiple hidden layers in between. The simplest MLP contains only one hidden layer,
i.e., a total of three layers, and its structure is shown in Figure 5. The MLP has full connections between
the layers. The bottom layer of the MLP is the input layer, the middle layer is the hidden layer, and the
top layer is the output layer. Assuming that the input layer is denoted by the vector X, then the output
of the hidden layer is f (W1X + b1), where W1 is the weight and b1 is the oï¬€set. The commonly used

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on which specific framework was used to build the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot determine whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other framework was utilized.
