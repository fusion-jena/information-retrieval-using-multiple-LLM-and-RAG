concentration of atmospheric CO. This model was compared with four 
statistical  models  (ARIMA,  SARIMA,  ETS,  and  HWETS),  one  machine 
learning model (SVR), and one deep learning model (SLSTM) in terms of 
its predictive performance. Model performance was evaluated using the 
MAPE and RMSE metrics. Table 3 presents the average values of these 
metrics for the aforementioned models. The MAPE values of the SGRU 
model were lower than those of the ARIMA, SARIMA, ETS, HWETS, SVR, 
and SLSTM models by 67.60%, 55.98%, 79.85%, 55.72%, 42.43%, and 
20.44%,  respectively,  indicating  that  the  accuracy  of  prediction  was 
significantly higher for the SGRU model than for the other models. As 
presented in Fig. 2, the CO values predicted by the SGRU model were 
close to the actual values. Fig. 3 shows scatter plots of the actual CO 
values and those predicted by the ARIMA, SARIMA, ETS, HWETS, SVR, 
SLSTM, and SGRU models. Compared with the other models, the deep

SVR is a machine learning method known for its superior accuracy 
compared  with  other  machine  learning  methods  and  its  ability  to 
simplify parameters, achieve global optimization, and handle nonlinear 
problems  (Chen  et  al., 2017;  Ji et  al.,  2021). In  this  study, the  expo-

hyperparameter-optimized  SVR  model.  Parameter  C  controls  error 
tolerance during training and determines the maximum deviation that 
the model permits for any individual training example. A higher C value 
allows for a larger error, which makes the model more likely to fit the 
training  data  but  also  increases  the  risk  of  overfitting.  Conversely,  a 
smaller  C  value  imposes  stricter  constraints  on  the  model,  thereby 
increasing  the  difficultly  of  fitting  the  training  data  but  potentially

Helpful Answer:
The performance of the deep learning model, specifically the SGRU model, is evaluated using two main metrics: Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). These metrics help assess the difference between predicted and actual values, providing insights into the accuracy of the model. Lower MAPE and RMSE values indicate better model performance. In comparison to other statistical and machine learning models such as ARIMA, SARIMA, ETS, HWETS, SVR, and SLSTM, the SGRU model demonstrated significantly higher accuracy based on the MAPE metric.
