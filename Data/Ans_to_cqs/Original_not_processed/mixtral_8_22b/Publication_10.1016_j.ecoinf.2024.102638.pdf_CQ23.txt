The dataset is then divided into training sets, which comprise 80% of 
the  data,  and  a  test  set  representing  the  remaining  20%,  in  order  to 
maximise model training while maintaining a sufficient amount of data 
for robust model validation (Adjuik and Davis, 2022; Fern´andez-L´opez 
et al., 2020). This division is done by random sampling to ensure that 
both subsets are representative of the overall dataset and minimise the 
risk  of  bias.  Randomisation  helps  to  preserve  the  distribution  of  key 
features  and  target  variables  across  both  training  and  test  sets, 
enhancing the generalisability of the model. We leverage the scikit-learn 
function GridSearchCV to meticulously fine-tune the hyperparameters of 
each model within the confines of the training set, aiming to enhance 
their predictive performance. A five-fold cross-validation is used and the 
negative mean square error is set as the target measure. Following this

hyperparameter optimisation process, the performance metrics detailed 
in Section 2.5 are meticulously evaluated using the designated test set. 
Subsequently, based on the performance metrics obtained, we discern 
and  select  the  most  effective  models  for  each  target  variable.  For  an 
illustrative overview of this model selection process, kindly refer to the 
visual representation provided in Fig. 4.

Table 4 includes details such as the name of the prediction model, its 
hyperparameters,  the  parameters  selected  during  the  5-fold  cross- 
validation,  and  the  hyperparameters  adjusted  according  to  the  selec-

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the dataset was divided into training and test sets, with 80% of the data allocated for training and the remaining 20% for testing. This division aimed to maximize model training while preserving enough data for robust model validation. The division was carried out through random sampling to guarantee that both subsets represented the entire dataset accurately and minimize the risk of bias. Randomization helped maintain the distribution of crucial features and target variables across both training and test sets, thereby enhancing the model's generalizability.

Secondly, the scikit-learn function GridSearchCV was employed to carefully tune the hyperparameters of each model within the training set. This step aimed to improve their predictive performance. Five-fold cross-validation was utilized, and negative mean square error served as the target measure. After completing the hyperparameter optimization process, the performance metrics outlined in Section 2.5 were thoroughly assessed using the designated test set. Based on these performance metrics, the most efficient models for each target variable were identified.

Lastly, Table 4 provides further information regarding the chosen prediction model, including its hyperparameters, parameters selected during the 5-fold cross-validation, and any adjustments made to the hyperparameters based on the selection criteria. These steps collectively contributed to ensuring the generalizability of the deep learning model.
