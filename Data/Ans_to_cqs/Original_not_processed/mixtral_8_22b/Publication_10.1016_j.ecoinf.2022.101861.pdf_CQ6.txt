sounds  that  satisfied  the  signal  parameters  introduced  and  saved  the 
output.

recorded (c. 6000 recording hours). Kaleidoscope Pro ability to detect 
the Band-tailed Nighthawk in a different area may be slightly different 
owing  to  geographical  song  variations  since  the  signal  parameters 
introduced  in  our  study  were  extracted  from  recordings  collected  at 
different sites of the state of Mato Grosso and based on a reduced sample 
size (eight recordings). The creation of more advanced classifiers using 
machine learning or convolutional neural networks might be useful in 
future  studies  aiming  to  reduce  the  number  of  sounds  misclassified

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps for training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it can be inferred that some form of data preparation was performed during the extraction process using Kaleidoscope software. This tool was used to extract sounds that met certain signal parameters, which could be considered a type of filtering or cleaning process. Additionally, the use of machine learning and convolutional neural networks is mentioned for future studies, suggesting that these techniques would require appropriate data preprocessing before being applied.
