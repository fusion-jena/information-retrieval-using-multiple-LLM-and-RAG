4.2. Ensemble models

To separate data into training and testing datasets, we used a spatial 
blocking technique, in which we divided our study area into 25 equally 
sized  blocks,  each  approximately  41  km  Ã— 41  km  in  size,  using  the 
blockCV package in the R programming language (Valavi et al., 2019). 
We determined the size of our spatial blocks using the spatialAutoRange 
function in the blockCV package, which returns a block size equal to the 
median  range  of  spatial  autocorrelation  in  independent  covariates 
(Valavi  et  al.,  2019).  This  attempts  to  ensure  data  within  a  block  is 
relatively independent of data outside of that block. We then divided 
these blocks among five folds in which the numbers of presences and 
background points were roughly equal. We used five folds because, due 
to the spatial arrangement of our presence data, using more would cause 
folds to have drastically differing numbers of presences and background
