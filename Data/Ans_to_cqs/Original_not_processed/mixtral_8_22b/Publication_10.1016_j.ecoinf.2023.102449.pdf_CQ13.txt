2.4. Model architecture 

The  encoder  and  decoder  are  deep  CNNs  setup  as  wide  residual 
networks (Fig. 1) (Zagoruyko and Komodakis, 2017). Residual networks 
(ResNets) describe a class of functions that allow for deeper architec-
tures and increased model complexity by learning a perturbation of the 
input  signal  at  each  layer  rather  than  a  transformation  as  in  conven-
tional  neural  architectures  (He  et  al.,  2015a).  The  perturbation  is 
implemented  using  skip  connections  in  residual  blocks  allowing  the 
input signal to persist through the network (He et al., 2015a). Each skip 
connection  increases  the  variance  between  the  input  and  output  at  a 
given  layer,  causing  an  exponential  growth  in  memory  usage  as  the

quency response that create a potential bias; we demonstrate how a simple linear transformation can be used to 
mitigate the effect of hardware variance on the learned representation under our approach. Our novel approach 
paves the way for development of a new class of deep neural networks that afford more interpretable learned 
ecoacoustic representations to advance both fundamental and applied science and support global conservation 
efforts.

The  encoder  uses  a  pre-processing  block  containing  a  convolution 
with a wide receptive field (5 × 5 kernel) and signal coarsening along 
the time axis (2 × 1 kernel) (Kahl et al., 2021). Coarsening follows the 
changes suggested in (He et al., 2018) and replicates later versions of 
BirdNet’s  down-sampling  strategy  by  recombining  the  concatenated 
output  of  2 × 2  maximum and  2  × 2 average  pooling using  a  1 × 1 
convolution.  After  convolution,  feature  representations  are  chunked 
along the time axis into T = 19 independent frames each corresponding 
to 3.072 s. Each frame is flattened and passed through a final linear layer 
to  output  T  d-dimensional  mean  μ  and  log  variance  logσ2  vectors  as 
parameters  for  the  Gaussian  variational  posterior.  A  latent  vector  for 
each frame in the time-series is sampled from the posterior using the 
reparameterisation trick. We set d = 128 for comparability with ecoa-

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning model. It primarily focuses on describing the architecture of the model, which consists of an encoder and decoder implemented as wide residual networks using deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model employs residual blocks with skip connections to increase the variance between the input and output at each layer. However, details regarding the optimization techniques, learning rates, batch sizes, or other relevant hyperparameters are not mentioned in the provided text.
