January 2023 and considered all studies currently available in the two
databases until 31 December 2022. We did not add any language filters/
restrictions to the search strategy developed so that scientific literature
with an abstract in English but a full text in other languages was
potentially included in the search. Except for conference proceedings,
we did not include grey literature (technical reports, dissertations)
because we wanted to limit our search to the most relevant and
advanced scientific applications on the topic, given the extensive liter-
ature already available.

data, such as machine learning techniques, or selecting/randomly
generating pseudo-absences, or incorporating uncertainties associated
with data collection within a Bayesian-framework, such as in some
PPMs. In contrast, if presence- “true” absence or count/abundance data
are available they preferentially may lead to the application of tradi-
tional statistical models such as regression and to a lesser extent, ma-
chine learning along with a few other approaches. If count data or
abundance estimates are based on well-designed dedicated surveys,
accounting for perception and availability bias, they could also be used
to predict abundances, or if certain assumptions are met, even project
them in different areas or periods. Also, the temporal and spatial extent
of the available data yields diverse results: when data include sufficient
temporal resolution, the choice of models and variables capable of
capturing seasonal, monthly, or even daily dynamics becomes viable,

surveys, they are abundant and have become increasingly available,
thereby constituting promising data sources. Simultaneously, they
exhibit poor quality, lack comprehensive metadata, and often originate
from various sources, necessitating careful consideration due to several
biases. These biases encompass uncertainty in species identification
(resulting from the absence of expert-collected data), improper design,
bias towards most accessible areas, low or unknown sample location
accuracy, incomplete or uneven spatial coverage of the true distribution
of a species, and the potential presence of spatial autocorrelation in
sample locations (Guisan et al., 2017). All these biases must be evalu-
ated and addressed, and a cautious interpretation of these data becomes
imperative (Barve et al., 2011).

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not directly address the handling of randomness in the deep learning pipeline, specifically regarding random seed values. However, it discusses aspects related to managing variability and uncertainty in Species Distribution Models (SDMs).

In general, there are several strategies employed to manage randomness in deep learning pipelines:

1. Fixed Random Seed: One common approach is setting a fixed random seed value before training the model. This ensures reproducibility by generating the same sequence of random numbers each time the code runs.

2. Cross-Validation: To assess the robustness of the model against variations in the dataset, cross-validation techniques like k-fold cross-validation can be applied. This involves splitting the dataset into multiple folds, where one fold is used for validation while the rest are used for training. This process is repeated for each fold, providing a more reliable estimate of the model performance.

3. Ensemble Methods: Another way to mitigate the impact of randomness is through ensemble methods. By combining predictions from multiple models trained using different initializations, this technique helps reduce variance and improve overall accuracy.

4. Regularization Techniques: Regularization methods like dropout and weight decay help prevent overfitting by introducing controlled noise during training. Dropout randomly drops out neurons during training, effectively creating an ensemble of smaller networks. Weight decay adds a penalty term to the loss function, discouraging large weights and promoting simpler models.

5. Data Augmentation: Artificially increasing the size of the dataset through transformations like rotation, scaling, and flipping can introduce additional variation and help the model generalize better.

While the provided context doesn't explicitly mention these strategies, understanding how to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines is crucial for developing accurate and reliable models.
