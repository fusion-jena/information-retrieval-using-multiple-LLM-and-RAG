2.2. Acoustic monitoring 

We  deployed  an  acoustic  recorder  (Song  Meter  SM2  recorder, 
Wildlife  Acoustics)  at  each  site.  The  Song  Meters  were  active  from  8 
June 2015 to 31 May 2016 and programmed to record (.wav format) the 
first 15 min of each hour. The sampling rate was 48 kHz, with 16 bits per 
sample resolution. The devices were checked weekly to download data 
and change batteries. A total of 32,023 15-min recordings (8006 h of 
recording) were collected (8044 at Station A, 8075 at Station B, 7782 at 
Station C, and 8122 at Station D).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not contain information about the postprocessing steps involved after a model training process. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based on the given context. However, some common postprocessing steps include calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, or area under the curve (AUC), creating confusion matrices to visualize the performance of the classifier, generating saliency maps to understand which features contribute most to the predictions, and performing cross-validation to ensure the robustness of the model.
