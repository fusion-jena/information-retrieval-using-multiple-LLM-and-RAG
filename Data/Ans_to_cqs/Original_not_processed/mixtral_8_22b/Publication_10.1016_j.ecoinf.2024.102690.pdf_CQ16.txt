stations. The average resistance value was represented by the artificial 
surface resistance value, which was set at 20, with a threshold of 20,000. 
For  Scenarios  B  and  C,  the  CWD  thresholds  were  determined  by 
considering  the  maximum  migration  distances  of  key  species  in  the

ecological leisure corridors, 6 along species migration corridors, and 2 
along  river  runoff  corridors  in  Scenario  C.  While  other  disturbance 
points were mostly found in the center of the mountain greenbelt, those 
in  the  southern  section  of  the  region  were  concentrated  around  river 
tributaries and watercourses.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears there is no information regarding the determination of completion for training or any specific criteria such as validation loss plateau. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based solely on this context.
