With regards to the difference between the results of the original, 
reduced,  and  augmented  datasets  applied  to  the  deep  learning 
model, we found that the original and augmented datasets are only 
under  a  few  specific  numbers  of  bands  and  data  formats  (e.g., 
VGG19 + 8band_256_8bit, VGG19 + 72band_256_8bit, ResNet50 +
8band_256_8bit, and ResNet50 + 36band_ 256_8bit). The classifica-
tion accuracy rate reached more than 50%, and there was no regu-
larity in the classification accuracy. However, the sampling action of 
reducing the data had a very obvious and consistent impact on the 
classification  accuracy,  especially  in  the  VGG19  model,  which  is 
more  similar  to  the  traditional  CNN  model.  This  representative 
sampling  action  resulted  in  incomplete  and  complete  feature 
extraction,  and  some  key  features  were  ignored.  Given  the  above 
reasons, it is recommended that sampling actions be avoided in the

built using the following steps:  

1.  Prepare  data:  Prepare  the  above  eight  categories  of  ground  truth 

images, and extract training samples.  

2.  Build  the  model:  Use  Keras  to  build  mathematical  functions  in 

TensorFlow.  

3.  Compilation: After the model built with mathematical functions, the 
shortest path is set in deep learning through code compilation.  
4.  Training:  The  fitting  action  (fit)  on  the  data  and  the  model  was 
performed  through  the  code,  and  deep  learning  parameters  were 
automatically adjusted according to the set number of epochs. In the 
process, the CPU and GPU were used to operate repeatedly as much 
as possible, and finally, the answer that conformed to the shortest 
path was found from each data.  

5.  Test: After Step (4), the feature weight and optimal solution in the 
model  were  obtained,  and  then  the  correct  rate  was  calculated 
through model evaluation.

VGG19 network architecture and adds a residual unit involving a short- 
circuit  mechanism,  which  can  overcome  the  issue  of  gradient  disap-
pearance and accuracy reduction in deep networks.

1.  Spectral segmentation and band selection

Most  research  on  quantitative  deep  learning  modeling  focused  on 
object detection and classification based on feature extraction (Hoeser 
et al., 2020; Hoeser and Kuenzer, 2020; Osco et al., 2020). Primarily, 
these  algorithms  autonomously  extract  meaningful  features  from  raw 
data, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering, notably in 
hyperspectral image analyses. They can capture low-level details as well

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model is primarily for object detection and classification based on feature extraction. These models autonomously extract meaningful features from raw data, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering, particularly in hyperspectral image analyses. They can capture low-level details as well. Specifically, the deep learning model aims to achieve more than 50% classification accuracy under certain conditions such as VGG19 + 8band\_256\_8bit, VGG19 + 72band\_256\_8bit, ResNet50 + 8band\_256\_8bit, and ResNet50 + 36band\_256\_8bit. However, there is no regularity in the classification accuracy. Additionally, the model uses the VGG19 network architecture and incorporates a residual unit involving a short-circuit mechanism to overcome issues like gradient disappearance and accuracy reduction in deep networks.
