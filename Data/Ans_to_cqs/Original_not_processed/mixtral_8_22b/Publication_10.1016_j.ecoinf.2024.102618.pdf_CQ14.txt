for the EfficientNetB3 model. Fast convergence is noticed in the modelâ€™s 
response  as  it  converges  at  the  fourth  epoch.  Figs.  4  and  5  show  the 
confusion  matrix  of  classification  of  plant  diseases  by  the  ensemble 
model and by EfficientNetB3 respectively. A confusion matrix shows the 
number of correct classifications for each class in its diagonal cells. It 
also shows the number of misclassifications in other cells than the di-
agonal.  It  can  be  seen  from  the  confusion  matrix  that  EfficientnetB3 
model misclassified class 19 with class 22 23 time. This classification 
error  is  removed  with  ensemble  modelling.  It  can  be  seen  from  the 
confusion matrix of the ensemble model that there is a small number of 
misclassifications compared to the EfficientNetB3 model. Figue 5 shows 
a small number of misclassification. It can be seen that the model biggest 
error  is  a  misclassifcations  of  class  7.  These  misclassifications  are

The  proposed  ensemble  model  was  able  to  achieve  99.89%  accuracy  on  the  New  PlantVillage  dataset. 
PlantVillage  is a challenging  dataset with  38 classes. Achieving  high  accuracies on  such a dataset  proves the 
ability of the system to generalize on unseen data or real-world scenarios. A comparison with the state-of-the-art 
is  made  with  other  available  models  from  the  literature.  A  section  about  this  is  added  to  show  the  superior 
performance of the proposed ensemble model in terms of accuracy and F1-score.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide information regarding how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. Therefore, I cannot determine whether they used methods like grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, or any other method.
