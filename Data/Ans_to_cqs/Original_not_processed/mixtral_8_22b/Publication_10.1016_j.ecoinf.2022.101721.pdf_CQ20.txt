identification  of  species.  To  try  to  overcome  this  problem,  species 
identification  based  on  machine  learning  was  introduced  (Jennings 
et al., 2008; Parsons and Jones, 2000; Zamora-Gutierrez et al., 2016).

in  predicting  means,  SDs  and  finally  population  sizes  based  on  the 
observed data (e.g. Bhattacharya, 1967), thus reducing manual labour to 
a minimum.

developers could expand on the code in supplement S1 to implement 
more  predictor  variables  and  write  a  custom  algorithm.  Finally,  the 
classification accuracy of software incorporating an informative prior in 
their algorithm should not be determined through training and testing 
data sets alone. The performance must also be evaluated through the 
number  of  correct  classifications  using  real  world  examples.  Current 
software attempting to ID bats are locked in a vacuum. Bats in the real 
world are not!

include all observations in statistical modeling, rather than excluding observations, an approach which can affect 
the reliability of studies. This study also, to a great extent, explains the poor performance of software attempting 
automated bat ID. Implementing Bayesian algorithms, and thereby allowing users to interact with the software, 
should significantly improve their performance.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models mentioned in the text. However, it is common practice in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence to use Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) for training deep learning models due to their ability to perform parallel computations efficiently. These specialized processors accelerate the training process by processing multiple calculations simultaneously, making them well suited for handling large datasets and complex neural networks. Therefore, while the exact hardware resources used for training the deep learning models discussed in the context are unknown, it is likely that they utilized either GPUs or TPUs.
