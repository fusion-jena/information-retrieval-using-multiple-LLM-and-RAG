Google Earth Engine  (GEE; Gorelick  et al.,  2017) is  a  cloud-based 
platform 
to  high-performance 
computing with high applicability in wildfire science (e.g. Parks et al., 
2018; Piao et al., 2022; Roteta et al., 2021) because it hosts a vast remote 
sensing  data  catalog  in  the  petabyte  scale,  including  European  Space 
Agency  (ESA)  and  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration 
(NASA) datasets over 40-years. These datasets can be readily processed 
at very large spatial scales using automatic parallel processing (Gorelick 
et al., 2017), taking advantage of advanced image processing techniques 
and machine learning (ML) algorithms (Amani et al., 2020). However, 
JavaScript, Python or R application programming interface (API) and 
the associated interactive development environment (IDE) in GEE still 
requires a high-level technical expertise.

2.3. Additional geospatial data 

The core search tool in FIREMAP is based on historical wildfire pe-
rimeters  (2008–2023)  of  the  RDA  module  of  EFFIS,  which  is  a  main 
component  of  the  CEMS.  This  high-quality  database  is  the  main 
harmonized data source of wildfires in the European Union (Turco et al., 
2019). EFFIS BA mapping relies on active fire detection products from 
the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and the Moderate 
Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and a semi-automatic 
classification  of  MODIS  red-NIR  (spatial  resolution  of  250  m)  and 
SWIR (500 m) bands. Since 2018, the RDA incorporates S2 data to map 
BA smaller than 30 ha and refining the fire scars initially mapped from 
MODIS data. The EFFIS database is currently updated twice every day,

does not assume a specific distribution of the response variable, and is 
largely  computationally-efficient  in  GEE  (Belgiu  and  Dr˘agut¸,  2016; 
Breiman, 2001; Lary et al., 2016; Quintano et al., 2023; Roteta et al., 
2021). The default RF hyperparameters in the GEE implementation were 
preserved,  except  for  the  number  of  trees,  which  was  set  to  500  to 
improve  computational  efficiency  without  losing  precision  in  the  BA 
estimates as determined by recursive validation of the BA classification 
algorithm over independent wildfires (see Section 3.1). We calculated 
the mean decrease in the Gini Index (dGI) to assess RF variable impor-
tance on classification accuracy.
