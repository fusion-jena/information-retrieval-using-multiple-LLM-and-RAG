3.1.1. Backbone network 

The YOLOv5s model, a standout in computer vision, excels in various 
applications with its convolutional layer backbone, adept at extracting 
high-level image features. This backbone, based on CSPDarknet53 and 
shown in Fig. 2(a), improves upon Darknet53 from YOLOv3 (Redmon 
and Farhadi, 2018) to ensure efficient information processing. This led 
to the reengineering of the YOLOv5s backbone (Fig. 2(b)), enhancing its 
efficiency and reducing computational demands. The modified model is 
both  versatile  and  lightweight,  blending  the  precision  of  computer 
vision with ecological research needs. Subsequent subsections detail the

extraction capabilities. Table 3 presents a comparative analysis of the 
first layer’s operations among the Focus Layer, Stem Block 1, and Stem 
Block 2, highlighting the differences in parameters, GFLOPs, and input- 
output transformations.

respectively. The extent of each MBBlock is determined by the number 
of layers, t, while the overall network size is determined by the number 
of MBBlocks and the size of the input tensor. The structure of Mobile-
NetV2 includes a stem layer, consisting of a 3 × 3 convolutional layer 
followed by batch normalization and ReLU activation, and a head layer, 
consisting of a global average pooling operation followed by a 1 × 1 
convolutional  layer  and  softmax  activation  function.  To  produce  the 
WildARe-YOLO model, the MBBlocks replace two levels of C3-X inside

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of which specific framework was used to build the deep learning models such as YOLOv5s or WildARe-YOLO. However, it can be inferred that popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch could have been used due to their widespread adoption in building and deploying deep learning models. It would require additional resources or documentation to confirm the exact framework used.
