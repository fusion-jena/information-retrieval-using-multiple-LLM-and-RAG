4.2. Ecological sensitivity 

The cumulative contribution rate of PCA was used as the weight of 
the  evaluation  factors,  and  the  weights  of  each  factor  are  listed  in 
Table 6. LUCC and NDVI had the highest proportion, with values of 0.25 
and  0.22,  respectively.  The  ecological  sensitivity  results  showed  that 
most areas of the WRB were moderately and relatively highly sensitive. 
Moderately sensitive areas covered 70,699 km2, accounting for 37% of 
the WRB, while areas that are more sensitive covered 50,121 km2, ac-
counting for 52% (Fig. 5). Highly sensitive areas were rarely distributed 
and were scattered in areas with relatively high sensitivity. Relatively 
sensitive plaques were most prevalent in the northern foothills of the 
Qinling Mountains, Liupan Mountains, and Huanglong Mountains, east 
of the Luohe River. In terms of land use type, grasslands and forests were 
the most sensitive areas.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no information about the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model such as accuracy, precision, or recall. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based on the available information.
