to three dental variables and two climate variables. In the second run, 
we allowed dental queries to involve disjunctions, and climate queries to 
contain up to three variables, but tightened the requirement of accuracy 
gain.  Specifically,  under  this  constraint,  a  candidate  query  can  be 
extended by automatically adding the next variable only if the accuracy, 
as measured by the Jaccard coefficient, increases by a least 0.1. The goal 
is to obtain interpretable, not overly complex (long) queries. This can be 
achieved either explicitly, by limiting the number of variables and the 
operators  used  in  the  queries,  as  in  the  first  run,  or  implicitly,  by 
allowing increased complexity only if it brings substantial improvement 
in terms of accuracy, as in the second run. 

4.3. Selecting individual redescriptions for further analyses

The method requires manually setting several parameters, described 
in more details in the user guide.7 In particular, about half a dozen pa-
rameters allow to set thresholds on the size of the support of the output 
redescriptions and to control the length and complexity of their queries. 
We required that at least 1% of localities satisfy both queries (Min-
SuppIn) and that at least 30% of localities satisfy neither of the queries 
(MinSuppOut). In other words, the intersection of the supports of the 
two  queries  (the  support  of  the  redescription)  and  their  union  were 
required to contain at least 1% and at most 70% of all localities. This is 
an inclusive choice, not overly restrictive, that aims at capturing local 
patterns. Increasing the upper threshold further would jeopardize the 
local aspect of the analysis, and would lead to something more akin to 
non-linear regression. For a redescription to be informative, its support

Redescription mining, on which we focus here, combines partition-
ing  techniques, such as  clustering, and  modelling techniques, such as 
regression.  It  identifies  multiple  local  models  on  subsets  of  data,  and 
automatically  generates  sets  of  limiting  conditions  and  the  corre-
sponding split of the data. This is where redescription mining departs 
from most classical analysis methods that identify global models and do 
not yield explicit and interpretable limiting conditions.

we  tailored  for  biogeographic  analyses.  See  (Galbrun  and  Miettinen, 
2017) for more details about the method. Fig. 3 (bottom) schematically 
illustrates and summarizes the main concepts of redescription mining.

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, there isn't any direct mention of specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some general insights into handling data imbalance can still be derived from the information provided.

One approach mentioned indirectly is controlling the size of the support of the output redescriptions using various parameters. By requiring that at least 1% of localities satisfy both queries and at most 70% of localities satisfy neither of the queries, the authors aim to capture local patterns without being too restrictive. This could potentially help mitigate issues related to class imbalances in datasets.

Additionally, the concept of redescription mining itself might offer some insight into addressing data bias. Redescription mining combines partitioning techniques like clustering with modeling techniques like regression. It focuses on identifying multiple local models within subsets of data rather than finding global models. This allows for generating explicit and interpretable limiting conditions, which may aid in dealing with data bias.

However, since the context does not directly discuss techniques specifically aimed at addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, it cannot provide a comprehensive list of relevant strategies. Some commonly used techniques include stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, among others. These methods can help ensure balanced representation across different classes in the dataset, thus reducing potential bias.
