commission errors (UA 79%), considerable omissions were observed due
to misclassification mainly into scrub (13 point), followed by Molina
grassland (8 points) and modified bog (8 points) (Table 5a), resulting in
lower PA (51%).

a) Step-1: Comparing LWHabmod and GMEPmod (actual accuracies)
b) Step-2: Applying decision rules based on the peat depth, particularly
those affecting wetland/bog classes, to modify GMEPmod data labels.
c) Step-3: Applying decision rules (in addition to Step-2) based on the
Phase-1 Habitat map, and particularly those impacting on the clas-
sification of grassland, heathland, and scrub classes, to modify the
GMEPmod data labels.

These exercises were repeated for the broad habitat classes by

modifying the GMEPBHmod labels through Step-2 and Step-3.

2.6.2. Accuracy assessment for Pembrokeshire County

We undertook a dedicated survey of vegetated semi-natural habitats,
in Pembrokeshire in 2022 (Fig. 2) using the EarthTrack mobile appli-
cation developed through Living Wales (https://earthtrack.aber.ac.uk/)

%Query
Query: "What criteria are used to determine when training is complete (e.g., validation loss plateau)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not explicitly mention any specific criteria for determining when training is complete or if validation loss plateau is considered. However, it can be generally understood that machine learning models often use metrics such as validation loss, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., to evaluate their performance during training. A common practice is to monitor these metrics after each epoch or iteration and stop training when they reach a satisfactory level or start to plateau, indicating no further improvement. In this case, without more detailed information about the training process, we cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete.
