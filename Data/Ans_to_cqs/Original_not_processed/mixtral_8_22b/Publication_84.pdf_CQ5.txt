This is the ﬁrst study to our knowledge to investigate the pheno-
logical features in improving the performance of deep learning. As re-
vealed in our results, we have seen great potential in developing phe-
nological knowledge based deep learning methods. Recent literature
has documented the applications and beneﬁts of deep learning, a new
branch of machine learning, in various ﬁelds (LeCun et al., 2015).
However, it is still a controversial topic whether deep learning is more
suitable than traditional machine learning methods for Landsat image
classiﬁcation (Heydari and Mountrakis, 2018; Li et al., 2016). Never-
theless, this study aims to evaluate the hypotheses that applying phe-
nological knowledge as input data of deep learning can improve the
performance in the detection of invasive S. alterniﬂora. A comparison
experiment between SAE and SVM with six diﬀerent types of Landsat
images was conducted (see Table 2). The best performance was

(e.g. Heydari and Mountrakis, 2018; Ishii et al., 2015; Li et al., 2016)
have been reported on classiﬁcation of remote sensing images at
moderate spatial resolution with deep learning. For example, deep
learning method (Stacked AutoEncoder, SAE) and traditional machine
learning methods (e.g. Support Vector Machine, SVM) were compared
to map African land-cover (Li et al., 2016). It was reported that SAE
achieved a higher classiﬁcation accuracy than SVM. However, in one of
the latest developments, Heydari and Mountrakis (2018) conducted an
experiment on land cover classiﬁcation using the deep learning method
(SAE) with 26 Landsat images. Surprisingly, the results indicated that
the classiﬁcation accuracy of deep learning was not as good as tradi-
tional machine learning methods, e.g. SVM. Therefore, it is still a well-
worthy topic to investigate which kind of methods is better, deep

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the study focuses on detecting invasive Spartina alterniflora using Landsat satellite images. Additionally, there are references to previous research comparing Stacked AutoEncoders (SAEs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for African land-cover mapping using unspecified datasets. In summary, while no specific dataset names like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet are mentioned, the study uses Landsat satellite images for their deep learning application.
