of 98.54% and mAP of 0.97 on the Arabica coffee leaf repository,
demonstrating its effectiveness in localizing and categorizing coffee
plant leaf disorders (Nawaz et al., 2024). B. Dey et al. proposed assessing
the performance of seven deep learning algorithms for automated
identification of medicinal plant species from leaf images, revealing
DenseNet201 as the most effective model with 99.64% accuracy and
98.31% precision in utilizing public data, and 97% accuracy in a blend
of public and field data scenarios (Dey et al., 2024). G. Dai et al. pro-
posed the DFN-PSAN model for plant disease classification in natural
field environments, utilizing the YOLOv5 Backbone and Neck network
with pyramidal squeezed attention (PSA). This model achieved an
average accuracy and F1-score exceeding 95.27% across three plant
disease datasets, with the PSA attention mechanism reducing 26% of
model parameters, offering competitive performance among existing

Initially, we assess our modified BEiT model’s performance against
existing deep learning and base ViT models under both noise-added and
noise-free situations. The results obtained from the PlantVillage are
presented dataset in Tables 6 and 7, The results reveal that the proposed
BEiT (12 M) achieves an outstanding accuracy of 97.33% with the least
loss. It outperforms in AUC, CK, precision, recall, and F1 scores in both
noisy and noiseless conditions. Similarly, the Dhan-Shomadhan dataset
in Tables 8 and 9, the low parameterized BEiT (12 M) model maintains
its lead he highest accuracy (96.22% and 97.50%) and least loss (0.131
and 0.121). It achieves reliable metrics in AUC (0.962), CK (0.88),
precision (0.97), recall (0.96), and F1 score (0.96). Other models also
perform well but continually fall below BEiT (12 M)’s specifications
across both noisy and noiseless situations. These results underline BEiT
(12 M)’s better performance and reliability in leaf disease classification

3.1. Data acquisition

To completely validate the network presented in this study, two
types of public datasets are being utilized. The first is the Plant Village
(Hughes and Salathe, 2016) dataset, which is used to pre-train the net-
work’s weights. The second is the Dhan-Shomadhan dataset (Hossain,
2023), which is applied to train the final model for diagnosing rice leaf
diseases in the field.
