To  determine  risk  probabilities  across  Türkiye  and  to  reduce  the 
uncertainty among models, we constructed a final ensemble conflict risk 
model by weight averaging the ten different algorithms as implemented 
in the biomod2 package (Thuiller, 2014). By combining predictions from 
several  different  modeling  approaches,  ensemble  models  have  been 
shown  to  produce  more  robust  results  when  compared  to  individual 
models  (Buonincontri  et  al.,  2023;  Erickson  and  Smith,  2023).  We 
averaged  predictions  across  three  replicated  runs  for  each  model and 
selected model runs with a TSS > 0.5 for generating the ensemble model. 
We classified the predicted risk probabilities generated by the ensemble 
model  into  5  classes:  no-risk  areas  (< 0.2),  low-risk  areas  (0.2–0.4), 
moderate-risk areas (0.4–0.6), high-risk areas (0.6–0.8) and extreme risk 
areas (> 0.8).

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information on specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions several machine learning algorithms used for predicting risk probabilities, including Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline, Generalized Boosted Model, Classification Tree Analyses, Flexible Discriminant Analysis, and Surface Response Envelope. To reduce uncertainty among models, an ensemble conflict risk model was constructed using weight averaging of these algorithms. This approach has been shown to produce more robust results compared to individual models. The predicted risk probabilities were then classified into five categories based on their values. While this process does not directly address data bias, it is important to note that proper handling of imbalanced datasets can be crucial in achieving accurate predictions. Techniques such as stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection can help mitigate data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
