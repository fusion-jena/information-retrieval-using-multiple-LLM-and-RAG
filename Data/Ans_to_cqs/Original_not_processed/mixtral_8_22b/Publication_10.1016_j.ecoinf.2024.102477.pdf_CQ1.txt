Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the context that various sources could potentially be used for gathering such data. These may include surveys, sensors, or publicly available datasets. For instance, Lawin et al. (2017) discuss exhaled carbon monoxide as a non-invasive biomarker of short-term exposure to outdoor air pollution, which suggests the use of medical devices or sensors for data collection. Similarly, Ji et al. (2021) utilize Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data for estimating forest above ground biomass, indicating the use of remote sensing technology for data acquisition. Furthermore, Singh et al. (2023) provide a comprehensive review of machine learning applications in various fields, including solar power generation, where data might be collected through solar panels or other relevant equipment. Lastly, Groenen (2018) mentions multivariate time series forecasting, implying the possibility of utilizing historical records or databases containing temporal information. Therefore, while the exact methodologies employed for data collection remain unspecified within this context, potential approaches encompass surveys, sensors, and public datasets.
