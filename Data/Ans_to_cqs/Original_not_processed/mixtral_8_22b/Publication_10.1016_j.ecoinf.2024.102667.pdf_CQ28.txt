remote sensing data.

2.2.3. Other data 

The land use/cover dataset for China featured a spatial resolution of 
1 km × 1 km and was acquired from RESDC. The dataset encompasses 
land use/cover information spanning the years 1980, 1990, 1995, 2000, 
2005, 2010, 2015, and 2018. It covers six major land use/cover cate-
gories and twenty-six subcategories. Through a combination of manual 
and automated interpretation and on-site data validation, the primary 
land use/cover categories achieved an accuracy of over 93%, while the 
secondary  land  use/cover  categories  had  an  accuracy  exceeding  90% 
(Ning et al., 2018). In our research, the reclassified land use/cover types 
were categorized into six classes: cultivated land, forestland, grassland, 
construction land, water area, and unused land. The boundary datasets 
for  ecological  engineering  are  sourced  from  the  National  Ecological 
Science Data Center (http://www.nesdc.org.cn/).

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no mention of any specific platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform being used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which platform was used based on the provided information.
