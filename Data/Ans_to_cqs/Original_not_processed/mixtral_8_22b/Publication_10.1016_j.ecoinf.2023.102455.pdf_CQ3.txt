The last step in configuring the model involves feeding in predictors 
that  the  advanced  deep  learning  algorithm  feeds  by  the  decomposed 
components  resulting  from  the  previous  steps.  The  primary  model  is 
CNN-BiGRU  with  three  comparative  ML  methods  (KELM,  RVFL  and 
CNN-BiRNN),  which  provide  four  complementary  models  including 
MVMD-CNN-BiGRU,  MVMD-RVFL,  MVMD-KELM  and  MVMD-CNN- 
BiRNN.  These  models  are  used  to  create  the  multi-temporal  fore-
casting model of daily streamflow (Qflow). Setting hyperparameters and 
their structural architecture is the most important aspect of executing 
ML-based  predictive  models  (Jamei  et  al.,  2023b).  Based  on  recent 
research, the main approaches to tuning parameters are algorithms of 
metaheuristic optimization, schemes of cross-validation schemes (Nes-
ted/rolling  basis  cross-validation)  (Huyghues-Beaufond  et  al.,  2020),

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't any information about data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline within the given context. Therefore, it's not possible to provide an accurate response based solely on this information. However, some common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and landmark annotation. Each technique serves different purposes depending on the specific application or use case. For example, bounding boxes are often used for object detection tasks, while semantic segmentation can be employed for image classification problems. Instance segmentation combines both object detection and semantic segmentation, allowing individual objects within an image to be identified and classified separately. Polygon annotation is useful when dealing with irregular shapes or outlines, whereas key point annotations help identify specific points of interest within images. Landmark annotation focuses on facial features recognition.
