The model is constructed using the EfficientNet B0 network (Tan and 
Le, 2019) which had been trained for generic image classification. The 
EfficientNet feature extraction layers are frozen (transfer learning) with 
only the weights of the final dense classification layers updated during 
training.  Training  was  conducted  within  the  Google  Collaboratory 
‘Colab’  platform  (Bisong,  2019),  using  the  Tesla  K80  GPU,  accessed 
through  cloud  computing.  An  Adam  optimizer  was  used  to  control 
gradient descent during training (Kingma and Ba, 2014), with parame-
ters set to: learning rate of 0.001, decay factor of 0.75 and a step size of

(Fig.  1),  considering  its  performance  in  the  new  environment  with 
limited re-training. Starting with a pre-trained model (EfficientNet B0, 
Tan and Le, 2019), we freeze the networks original feature extractor. We 
then train fully connected layers, which operate on the output of the 
EfficientNet  B0  network,  to  classify  the  PAM  data  frames  into  the 
specified sound source classes. Audio data is input to the network in a 
novel  spectrogram representation (White  et  al.,  2022). Networks  pre- 
trained on image data have been proven to perform well on classifica-
tion  tasks  using  spectrograms  as  image  input,  transformed  from  raw 
audio data (Allen et al., 2021; Shiu et al., 2020; Stowell, 2022). In this 
work  we fine-tune the  parameters  of the fully connected layers  itera-
tively  on  small  batches  of  training  data  acquired  from  a  new  region. 
Through  an  experimental  approach  to  retraining  we  demonstrate  the

way  ML  allows  the  automation  of  tasks  previously  considered  as 
requiring  manual  processing  (Stowell,  2022).  For  instance,  marine 
mammal  calls  have  been  classified  with  a  wealth  of  ML  algorithms 
including  support  vector  machines  (Jarvis  et  al.,  2008;  Roch  et  al., 
2008), generalised linear models, hidden Markov models (Brown et al., 
2010;  Pace  et  al.,  2012;  Roch  et  al.,  2011)  and  classification  and 
regression tree analysis (Oswald et al., 2003). These advances have led 
to a rise in the number of published trained CNN models available for 
researchers  to  download  and  use  as  tools.  The  performance  of  these 
CNNs has been found to rival human performance at signal recognition 
(LeCun et al., 2015). CNNs can learn to discriminate spectro-temporal 
information  directly  from  a  labelled  spectrogram,  used  as  an  image 
input. The success of CNNs within the marine bioacoustic field has been

is fine-tuned on training sets of differing sizes, from the unseen site, to understand the adaptability of a network 
to new marine acoustic environments. Fine-tuning with a small sample of site-specific data significantly improves 
the performance of the CNN in the new environment, across all classes. We demonstrate an improved perfor-
mance in area-under-curve (AUC) score of 0.30, across four classes by fine-training with only 50 spectrograms 
per class, with a 5% improvement in accuracy between 50 frames and 500 frames. This work shows that only a 
small  amount  of  site-specific  data  is  needed  to  retrain  a  CNN,  enabling  researchers  to  harness  the  power  of 
existing pre-trained models for their own datasets. The marine bioacoustic domain will benefit from a larger pool 
of global data for training large deep learning models, but we illustrate in this work that domain adaptation can 
be improved with limited site-specific exemplars.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific dataset used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the model uses the EfficientNet B0 network, which was originally trained for generic image classification. It also states that audio data is input to the network in a novel spectrogram representation. Therefore, it can be inferred that the dataset used in the deep learning pipeline likely consists of images or spectrogram representations of audio data. Additionally, the text mentions that networks pre-trained on image data have been shown to perform well on classification tasks using spectrograms as image input. This suggests that the dataset may include both image and audio data. However, without more specific information, it cannot be determined exactly what datasets were used in the deep learning pipeline.
