Y.-P. Huang, H. Basanta: Recognition of Endemic Bird Species Using Deep Learning Models

IV. EXPERIMENTAL SETTINGS
To extract the relevant features of birds, we randomly split
the endemic bird data into 3,132 images for training and
760 images for testing. To allow the deep networks to con-
verge and improve the ability of the model to generalize
adeptly, we augmented the training dataset 10 times, resulting
in a total of 31,320 images. Then, 25,056 (80%) images were
used for training and 6,264 (20%) were used for validation.
The Inception-ResNet-v2 model was trained using the mini-
batch gradient descent algorithm with the batch size set to
32 and the learning rate maintained at 0.0001. The Adam
optimizer was used to ﬁne-tune the model with the following
parameters:

• Exponential decay rate of ﬁrst-moment estimation

of 0.9.

acquired while learning the 27 endemic bird species should be
used to solve related tasks pertaining to the 29 endemic bird
species. Otherwise, considerable time would be spent every
time a new dataset of birds is used. Therefore, to implement
the entire process, we adopted a deep-learning-based model
(Inception-ResNet-v2) to train and learn the features of 27
endemic bird species (source domain). Then, the learned fea-
tures were transferred to a second target network to train the
newly added dataset on endemic bird species (target domain).
Thus, the problem was deﬁned as follows: for a given source
domain DS and learning task LT and target domain DT
and learning task TL, the transfer learning technique helps
improve the learning of the target predictive function fT (·)
in DT using the knowledge acquired from DS and LT , where
DS (cid:54)= DT or LT (cid:54)= TL [25], [26]. Transfer learning method
enables to utilize knowledge from previously learned tasks

which constitute a large part of their diet. Thus, birds provide
regeneration and resilience to ecosystems to sustain their
biodiversity. Thus, it is essential to identify endemic birds
that are prone to invasion by ecologically similar species that
may eventually cause niche domination or the extirpation of
species already existing on the island.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, the provided context does not contain information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. It only discusses the experimental settings, including the splitting of the dataset, the use of the Inception-ResNet-v2 model, the training parameters, and the application of transfer learning techniques. However, there is no mention of how the trained model was deployed, such as through model serialization or platform selection.
