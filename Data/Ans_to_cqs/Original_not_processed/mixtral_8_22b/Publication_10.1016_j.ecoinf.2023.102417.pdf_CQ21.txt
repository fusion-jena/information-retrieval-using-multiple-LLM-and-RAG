function to ignore a certain class. These annotations are made manually, 
using special software, and consume large amounts of time. For model 
development  there  are  many  well  established  collections  of  image 
datasets for the training and evaluation of the models, such as ImageNet

Neural  networks  can  be  trained  in  a  supervised,  semi-supervised 
(Chen  et  al.,  2021;  Zhao  et  al.,  2020)  or  unsupervised  (Harb  and 
Kn¨obelreiter, 2021; Ji et al., 2019) way. When it comes to supervised 
learning (Deng et al., 2009; Minaee et al., 2021), the models are typi-
cally  trained with a  huge amount of  training data. This  training  data 
consist of input and target image pairs, where the input image describes 
the image that is supposed to be classified and the target image describes 
the  corresponding  classes  (labels).  For  semantic  image  segmentation, 
the  target  image  consists  of  a  fully  labeled  image,  which  means  that 
every single pixel of the training image is assigned to a certain class. In 
some cases, parts of the image that have no influence on the specific task 
can  be  ignore  by  the  model  (overexposed,  underexposed  or  blurred 
parts, unimportant parts etc.). This can be done by adjusting the loss

model allowed to benefit from unlabeled data during the training pro-
cess,  which  helped  us  to  reduce  the  time  needed  for  manual  data 
labelling.  In  addition,  existing  Joint  Energy-Based  models  have  the 
problem that the training is very unstable due to an exploding genera-
tive loss (Grathwohl et al., 2020), whereas the training of JESS was very 
stable.  In  contrast  to  the  basic  model,  the  JEM  image  classification 
additionally allows out of distribution detection as well as better cali-
bration of the model. In this respect, the JEM image classification works 
better than our model. The big improvement for our application was, 
that  JESS  can  be  very  useful  to  perform  a  domain  adaption  between 
similar biocrust datasets and therefore increase the transferability of the 
segmentation models.

we  trained  the  model  to  reach  a  high  classification  accuracy  on  our 
labeled biocrust images as well as adapt our model to an unknown data 
subset. The training was performed on randomly cropped images of size 
512  × 512  with  a  learning  rate  of  0.0001  and  an  Adam  optimizer 
(Kingma and Ba, 2017). Again, the training was performed using a cross 
validation  on  the  training  data  set  with  80%  training  data  and  20% 
validation  data.  A  detailed  workflow  regarding  the  methodology  is 
shown in Fig. 3. In order to avoid overfitting the data was augmented 
using  varius  spatial  and  color  transformations  and  the  training  was 
stopped after 100 epochs.

Helpful Answer:
After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be taken to evaluate the performance of the model and visualize its predictions. Some common postprocessing steps include:

1. Saliency maps: Saliency maps are used to highlight the regions of an input image that contribute most significantly to the final prediction of the model. They help identify which features of the input image were important for the model's decision making process.
2. Metrics calculation: Various metrics can be calculated to quantify the performance of the model. Commonly used metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC). These metrics provide insights into how well the model performs in terms of correctly identifying positive and negative instances.
3. Confusion matrix: A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification algorithm. It shows the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives produced by the model. This information helps understand the strengths and weaknesses of the model and identify areas for improvement.

In the given context, the authors do not explicitly mention any postprocessing steps they took after training their model. However, based on the information available, we can infer that they likely calculated some form of evaluation metric to assess the performance of their model. Additionally, since they discuss the use of saliency maps earlier in the paper, it is possible that they also generated these maps to gain further insight into their model's behavior.
