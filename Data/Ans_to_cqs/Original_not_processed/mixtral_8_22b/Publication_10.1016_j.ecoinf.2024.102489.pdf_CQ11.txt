%Query
Query: "What is the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any direct reference or link to a deep learning pipeline data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact data repository link of the deep learning pipeline based solely on this context.
