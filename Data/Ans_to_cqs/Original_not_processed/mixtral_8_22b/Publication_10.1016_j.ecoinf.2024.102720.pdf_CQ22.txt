After the reliability and validity analysis, the fitness of the model fit
was tested using the data. To test the fitness of the model, we chose the
most commonly used model fit metrics where χ2/df represents the chi-
square value after considering the model complexity of 2.975, GFI
represents the goodness-of-fit index of 0.944, RMSEA represents the
approximate root-mean-square error of 0.089, the RMR indicates root
mean square deviation from 0.002, CFI indicates comparative goodness-
of-fit index of 0.913, NFI represents a normal goodness-of-fit index of
0.915, TLI indicates a standardized fit coefficient of 0.912, and IFI
represents a growth fit index of 0.929. All statistics exceeded the critical
value of 0.9 (Steiger and Vancouver, 1990) and met the criteria for
model fit with a high degree of goodness of fit, thus indicating an overall
fit of the SEM to the data.

We observed (Table 6) that the model provided in this study matches

4.3.1. SEM reliability and fitness testing

The CFA was used to test the validity of the model construct. The
Cronbach alpha coefficient value was used to test the reliability of the
CFA for constructing SEM. The Cronbach alpha coefficient value in this
study was 0.737, and this is higher than the critical reliability of 0.6
(Cronbach, 1954), thus suggesting that the CFA possesses a considerable
level of reliability. And the CFA validity of SEA was measured by Bar-
tlett’s sphere (KMO) test, the KMO test coefficient in this study was
0.645 (greater than the critical value of 0.5), and the p-value was 0.000
(lower than the critical value of 0.005) (Wishart and Bartlett, 1932).

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, it appears that the text discusses the use of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) for analyzing the drivers of per capita carbon emissions factors (CEFs). However, there is no information about the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model such as accuracy, precision, or recall. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to the query based on the given context.
