structures with an increasing number of output channels, encouraging 
the network to learn complex representations. To enhance the network's 
capacity  for  capturing  fine-grained  features  and  context,  Spatial  and 
Channel Attention (SCA) modules are integrated into the architecture. 
These modules act as mechanisms for focusing on relevant spatial re-
gions  and  channel-wise  information,  respectively.  These  attention 
mechanisms are integrated at multiple stages in the network to enrich 
the feature representations. The decoder upscales the feature maps and 
fuses  information  from  the  encoder  using  skip  connections.  Each 
decoder block consists of a transposed convolutional layer to increase 
spatial  resolution,  followed  by  batch  normalization  and  ReLU  activa-
tion.  The  final  stage  of  the  network  involves  upsampling  the  feature 
maps, followed by a convolutional layer with 4 × 4 filters to produce the

A quantitative analysis of this dataset is given in Table 5, confirming 
our  model's  effectiveness.  Our  method  has  achieved  a  UIQM  score  of 
3.26 and an NIQE score of 5.39, followed by the Funie-GAN in terms of 
UIQM with a score of 3.21 and Fusion in terms of NIQE with a score of 
5.40. While measuring the UCIQE score, IBLA achieved a score of 0.626, 
although their resultant images are just color deviations from the orig-
inal images. However, since UCIQE measures a linear combination of 
chroma, saturation, and contrast, a higher value can be expected just by 
having a change in colors (even if they are not desirable).

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions several techniques such as Fusion, IBLA, U-Transformer, Funie-GAN, Water-Net, UWCNN, and Ours, which could potentially involve various ways of gathering raw data like surveys, sensors, or utilizing public datasets. For instance, Fusion might use image fusion techniques combining different sensor inputs, while others may rely on publicly available underwater image datasets. Without explicit mention, we cannot definitively state the exact methods employed for each technique.

Based on the context, it appears that the focus is more on comparing the performance of these methods rather than discussing how they collect raw data. Therefore, further research would be required to determine the specific data collection methods used in each case.
