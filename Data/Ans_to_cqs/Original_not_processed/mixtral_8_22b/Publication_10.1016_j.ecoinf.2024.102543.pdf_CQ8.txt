Høye, T.T.,

The  YOLOv8  algorithm  offers  a  range  of  network  structures, 
including  YOLOv8n,  YOLOv8s,  YOLOv8m,  YOLOv8l,  and  YOLOv8x. 
While they differ in width and depth, they follow the same principles 
and can be chosen according to specific needs. The deeper the structure, 
the higher the precision, but the slower the training and inference speed. 
YOLOv8n was chosen as the base structure to prioritize speed without 
compromising  accuracy,  with  further  enhancements  to  improve 
performance. 

Adding the P2 feature level to the YOLOv8 architecture makes the 
network  deeper  because  an  additional  layer  is  added  to  the  overall 
network structure. The YOLOv8 architecture already includes a series of 
convolutional  layers  and  a  neck  section  that  combines  features  from

This study approached the problem of detecting and counting NBSB 
through  images  and  videos  acquired with  drones.  The state-of-the-art 
methods  nowadays  are  based  on  deep  learning  algorithms,  and  we 
have developed an improved YOLOv8 model with architecture modifi-
cations  that  have  allowed  a  good  compromise  between  accuracy  and 
speed of processing after it has been trained. We tested the model with a 
public image dataset of NBSB in soybean fields and added a novel one 
with more images. The results have shown that the system can truly help 
automate this task, which will allow better pest management control, 
and it can be extended to other pests and crops in the future. Fig. 1 brings 
general schematics of the proposal, where the model receives images or 
videos from real field conditions and produces detection and counting of 
NBSB. 

This research addresses those main issues with the following high-

lights as contributions:

It is worth noting, however, that increasing the network depth also 
comes with some potential downsides, such as increased computational 
complexity and a greater risk of overfitting the model to the training 
data. So, adding the P2 layer to the YOLOv8 architecture is a tradeoff 
that needs to be carefully balanced with other considerations, such as 
model size and performance requirements. In this sense, we proposed in 
this work a modification in the C2f layer due to its importance in the 
general architecture of YOLOv8, in the sense of making it lighter and 
counterbalancing  the  increase  obtained  with  the  addition  of  the  P2 
feature level layer. In our work, we call this new layer C2f2.
