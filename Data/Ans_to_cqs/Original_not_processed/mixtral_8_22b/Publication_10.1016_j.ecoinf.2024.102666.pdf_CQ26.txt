artificial neural networks (ANN) (Men et al., 2022). The efficacy of these 
algorithms exhibits considerable variation across diverse aquatic envi-
ronments. For instance, the Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of 
Spectral  Hypercubes  (FLAASH)  model,  originally  developed  for  land 
pixels,  has  proven  effective  in  AC  for  aquatic  environments  utilizing 
Sentinel-2  and  SPOT-6  imagery  (Rotta  et  al.,  2016;  Li  et  al.,  2023a, 
2023b, 2023c, 2023d). Additionally, the FLAASH algorithm mitigates 
the  spatial  proximity  effect  by  employing  an  internal  pixel  averaging 
technique, which is essential for attaining high-quality AC (Wang et al., 
2021).  In  investigations  of  lacustrine  environments  using  Advanced 
Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) AVNIR-2 data, the efficacy of AC al-
gorithms  predicated  on  the  single  scattering  approximation  has  been 
significantly enhanced (Matsui and Kageyama, 2022). The Atmospheric

MSI is the sole data source that incorporates three bands in the red-edge 
range. This characteristic holds significant importance for monitoring 
the  water  quality  of  lakes.  Currently,  the  inversion  of  water  quality 
parameters typically involves the use of visible and near-infrared bands. 
For instance, chlorophyll inversion commonly employs a ratio algorithm 
using  the  blue  and  green  bands  (Yepez  et  al.,  2024),  while  CDOM 
inversion typically utilizes the blue and violet bands (Cao et al., 2024). 
Suspended particle inversion often employs a three-band model, incor-
porating near-infrared bands (Heng et al., 2017). Therefore, a compar-
ative analysis was conducted across four bands. In this study, the MSI 
and OLCI sensors were selected for comparative analysis in four visible

Helpful Answer:
During the preprocessing stage of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed to address data bias. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting is a method used to ensure that each subset of data created from the original dataset maintains the same proportions of target classes as the original dataset. This technique helps prevent imbalanced datasets and ensures that all subsets have representative samples from each class.

Oversampling is another approach used to balance datasets with unequal distributions of classes. It involves duplicating examples from the minority class or creating synthetic examples based on existing ones. By increasing the number of instances belonging to the underrepresented class, oversampling aims to reduce the impact of class imbalance on model performance.

Undersampling, conversely, focuses on reducing the size of the majority class by randomly removing some of its instances. This technique attempts to achieve balanced class representation without introducing artificial data into the training set. However, it may lead to loss of valuable information if too many examples are removed.

Lastly, diverse data collection refers to gathering data from various sources and ensuring that they cover different aspects of the problem domain. Collecting diverse data helps improve generalization capabilities and reduces potential biases introduced by relying solely on one type of data source.

In summary, addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline involves implementing strategies such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Each technique serves a unique purpose in maintaining balanced class representations and minimizing potential biases within the dataset.
