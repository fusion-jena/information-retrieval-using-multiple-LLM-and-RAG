Recently,  Artificial  Intelligence  (AI)  has  been  brought  to  some 
commercial camera traps, such as the Trail-Guard by Resolve, although 
literature around effectiveness for this is lacking. The use of AI “at the 
edge” may be able to overcome some of the issues of traditional camera 
traps, such as a large number of empty images being kept for analysis 
and  later  discarded.  More  specifically,  machine  learning,  especially 
based  on deep  learning techniques, is  being explored by  the research 
community to reduce as much as possible the amount of useless data 
being  collected.  For  example,  Schindler  and  Steinhage  (2021)  use  a 
combination  of  Mask  R-CNN  with  Flow-Guided  Feature  Aggregation 
(Zhu et al., 2017) to optimize instance segmentation of animal species in 
video clips. Their study is applied to data obtained by camera traps with 
PIR,  capturing  at  dusk  and  night,  in  Bavaria,  four  classes  of  animals

7.1.3. Bespoke neural networks for species sets 

While we selected a suitable neural network for species identifica-
tion, we spent little research so far to train this network to sets of user- 
selected  or  prevalent  species  in  the  region  where  the  camera  trap  is 
deployed.  Training  for  a  bespoke  set  of  species  is  both  possible  and 
desirable. Further research is needed to identify and automate a process 
that,  given  a  set  of  species  of  interest,  outputs  a  robust  and  reliable 
neural network model with suitable weights. 

7.1.4. Low power neural networks in hardware

7.1.4. Low power neural networks in hardware 

It is desirable to reduce the power consumption of the DynAIkonTrap 
to make deployment in remote locations easier and less expensive. An 
implementation by Si et al. (2020) of a Multilayer Perceptron model on 
an Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) was shown to run in a similar 
time frame to a software-based approach, but at a clock speed lower by a 
factor of 144. The authors portray this as the ability to achieve a lower 
power consumption or improve performance by a factor of 144. Results 
published by Intel (2016) indicate a Convolutional Neural Network can 
be  run  on  an  FPGA  with  twice  the  efficiency  of  a  software/CPU 
implementation.

Helpful Answer:
In the field of deep learning, preventing overfitting is crucial to ensure that models generalize well to unseen data. Regularization methods play a significant role in achieving this goal. Two commonly used regularization methods are Dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a technique introduced by Srivastava et al. (2014) to prevent complex co-adaptations between neurons during training. It works by randomly setting a fraction of input units to 0 at each update during training time, which helps to make the training process noisy and more robust. This prevents overfitting by making sure that any one feature cannot dominate the prediction.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of all parameters. By adding this penalty, it encourages smaller parameter values, effectively reducing the complexity of the learned model. This leads to better generalization and reduces the risk of overfitting.

Other regularization methods include early stopping, which stops the training process before convergence when validation error starts increasing; and data augmentation, which artificially increases the size of the dataset by applying transformations like rotation, scaling, or flipping to existing samples.

These regularization methods have been widely adopted in various applications of deep learning, including computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. They help strike a balance between underfitting and overfitting, ensuring that models learn meaningful patterns without memorizing noise or irrelevant features.
