Tesla K80 GPU for 5 epochs. To align these unsupervised classiﬁcations
with the ImageNet pretraining weights, we normalized the RGB chan-
nels by subtracting the ImageNet mean from each channel. We then
retrained the network using the hand-annotated data for 40 epochs. For
more details of this approach see Weinstein et al. (2019). Data aug-
mentation of random ﬂips and translations was tested and found to
have little eﬀect on the ﬁnal score.

Collecting a suﬃcient number of training samples will often be a
bottleneck in developing supervised methods in airborne imagery. It is
therefore useful to test the number of local training samples needed to
achieve maximum performance. We performed a sensitivity study by
training models using diﬀerent proportions of training data. We se-
lected 5%, 25%, 50% and 75% of the total hand-annotations to com-
pare to the full dataset for the within-site results for each site. We reran
this experiment ﬁve times to account for the random subsampling of
annotations. In addition, we ran the evaluation plots for the pretraining
model only (i.e. 0% hand-annotated data) to assess whether the addi-
tion of hand-annotated data improved the within-site pretraining.

3. Results

beyond the NEON sites may be useful for many applied problems. It is
currently unknown to what extent features learned from the 0.1 m re-
solution data used here can be applied to lower resolution satellite data
(Karlson et al., 2014) or higher resolution UAV data (Brieger et al.,
2019). Cross resolution training has not been fully explored in en-
vironmental remote sensing, but Li et al. (2018) recently showed that
deep learning networks can learn scale invariant land classiﬁcations
that can be matched among data sources. Given the ability to collect
virtually unlimited pretraining data using our data generation ap-
proach, NEON sites can be seen as an ideal training sources for RGB tree
models that could then be applied to other data types.

Fig. 1. Conceptual workﬂow of proposed approach for airborne de-
tection of individual tree crowns. Pretraining data is generated by
overlaying predicted trees from a LiDAR-based unsupervised algorithm
on to RGB imagery. These RGB images are used to pretrain a deep
learning neural network. The resulting model is retrained based on
RGB hand-annotations.

Query: "What are the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Fliping, Roating, Scaling)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Data augmentation techniques such as random flips and translations were tested in the deep learning pipeline. However, it was found that these techniques had little effect on the final score. Therefore, no specific data augmentation technique was explicitly mentioned as being applied in the deep learning pipeline.
