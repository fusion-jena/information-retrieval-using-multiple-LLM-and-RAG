2.2. Model fine-tuning 

To  fine-tune  the  base  model  with  Gulf  of  Mexico  data  the  feature 
extractor remains frozen. Models are trained with the same parameters 
as the base model but we use a cyclical learning rate of 0.0004 and is set 
to run for 50 epochs, with early stopping set to deploy if the validation 
loss does not improve within 10 epochs. A dropout rate of 0.2 is used 
during  fine-tuning,  and  DropConnect  is  employed.  Drop  out  layers 
randomly  discard  the  output  of  the  hidden  nodes  during  training, 
DropConnect randomly discards the input of the hidden layer (Sun et al., 
2022).

monic buzzing tonal call (see Supplementary fig. 1). This buzzing call 
occurs at high frequencies, occupying a similar spatial region within the 
spectrogram as the biological click class. Model predictions across the 
test set are mixed with respect to this signal type. After 500 frames of 
fine-tuning the model still found difficulty detecting high SNR signals, 
illustrated by the results of Day D (Supplementary fig. 1). The random 
pooling used to curate each training set allows for the possibility that 
scarce or novel signals are not included, resulting in a large degree of 
error between model runs with small batch sizes. CNNs are robust to 
signal fluctuations but for unique and complex signal types found within 
the new environment it is critical that efforts are taken to label a pool of 
frames representative of the specific signal under various local condi-
tions,  for  optimum  model  performance.  Knowledge  of  the  long-term

tuning  with  500  frames  of  ambient  noise  we  can  achieve  similar  re-

class. Performance metrics indicate that by using ambient noise data to 
fine-tune the base model we optimise the learned feature representation 
to the local environment, improving performance across all classes after 
only 50 frames per class (2.5 min of data).

Helpful Answer:
The text provides information about fine-tuning a base model with Gulf of Mexico data, employing several techniques to enhance its performance. However, it doesn't explicitly mention any strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing the random seed value. Nevertheless, some general approaches can be suggested based on common practices in deep learning:

1. Fixing the Random Seed Value: One way to manage randomness is to fix the random seed value before running experiments. By setting a fixed seed, one ensures that the results obtained from different runs will be consistent and reproducible.

2. Using Ensemble Methods: Another strategy to mitigate the effects of randomness is to use ensemble methods. These involve combining multiple models, often trained with different initializations or subsets of data, to produce more stable and accurate predictions.

3. Employing Regularization Techniques: Regularization techniques like Dropout and DropConnect help prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize. They introduce randomness into the network by dropping connections or neurons during training, which can also help reduce sensitivity to initialization values.

While these strategies may not directly address the issue of handling randomness due to the random seed value, they contribute to building more robust and reliable deep learning pipelines.
