Further research could increase the performance and variety of species identified by our CNN-model. For 
instance, the model could be improved by increasing the number of samples and variety of atmospheric and sea 
conditions in the training datasets, by building hierarchical training datasets with different behaviour across 
different species67, by using more spectral bands and temporal information68, and by artificially increasing the 
spatial resolution of the images through rendering69. In addition, as it is a fast and scalable method, it can even be 
transferred to very high spatial resolution images (<10 cm) captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for the 
automatic identification of specific individuals70.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide explicit details about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some indications that suggest potential strategies used or recommended for improving the model's robustness and applicability. These include:

1. Increasing the number of samples and variety of atmospheric and sea conditions in the training datasets: This approach aims to expose the model to diverse scenarios, making it more adaptable to real-world situations. By incorporating various environmental factors into the training data, the model becomes better equipped to handle unseen cases during deployment.

2. Building hierarchical training datasets with different behavior across different species: Creating a structured dataset that reflects the inherent differences between species can help improve the model's ability to distinguish among them accurately. This strategy allows the model to learn unique features associated with each species, thereby enhancing its discriminative power.

3. Using more spectral bands and temporal information: Including additional spectral bands and time-series data in the input can enrich the feature space available to the model. This enables the model to capture more complex patterns and relationships within the data, potentially leading to better overall performance.

4. Artificially increasing the spatial resolution of the images through rendering: Enhancing the spatial resolution of the input images can provide the model with finer details, which may be crucial for accurate species identification. This technique can also help mitigate the effects of low-resolution imagery, ensuring consistent performance across varying image qualities.

While these approaches do not directly correspond to traditional methods such as cross-validation or stratified splitting, they contribute to the development of a more versatile and reliable deep learning model. Nonetheless, without further clarification, it remains uncertain whether these techniques have been explicitly employed to address concerns related to overfitting, bias, or other issues affecting the model's generalizability.
