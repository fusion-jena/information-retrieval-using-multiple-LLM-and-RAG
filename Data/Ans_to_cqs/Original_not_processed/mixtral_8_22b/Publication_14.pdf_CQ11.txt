%Query
Query: "What is the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The data repository link of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. However, there are two possible links that might be relevant. One is the link to the DeepMeerkat executable for Mac and Windows, which is available with cloud systems. Unfortunately, the exact URL or repository name is not provided. Another potential link is the one associated with the DOI (<https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1213328>), which could lead to a data repository like Zenodo. Without additional information, it is difficult to determine if either of these links corresponds to the requested deep learning pipeline data repository.
