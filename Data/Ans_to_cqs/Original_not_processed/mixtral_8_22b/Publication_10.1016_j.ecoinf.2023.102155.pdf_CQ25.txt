Following  the  tools  we  previously  developed  in  Guilbault  et  al. 
(2021),  we  present  in  this  paper  extensions  that  accommodate  for 
necessary practical model accomodation: bias correction and lasso-type 
penalties. Observer bias correction allows for one to overcome prefer-
ential sampling that arise from opportunistic surveys. Lasso control for 
model complexity and multicollinearity which is particuarly useful with 
low sample size. First, we compare via simulations different measures of 
performance in classification and predicted distribution for the new al-
gorithms  based  on  mixture  modelling  (EM  algorithm)  and  machine 
learning (semi supervised learning) developed to the simple approach of 
fitting  individual  PPMs  to  the  points  with  known  species  labels  only, 
while also incorporating lasso penalization and bias correction. We test 
their performances in the context of low species abundance, the pres-

the ppmlasso package.;  

• sp.scale: the spatial resolution for the quadrature grid in km—as defined in the ppmlasso package;  
• cov.bias: The column number of the variable chosen as a proxy for the observer bias in quadsenv. The default value is set to NULL;  
• kVal: the value to factor out of the observer bias proxy cov.bias. The default value is set to NULL;  
• n.fits: the number of models to fit through the regularization path—as defined in the ppmlasso package. The default value is set to 50. 

To run the ppmlassoMixEngine, we can use the following lines:

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the main focus is not directly related to a specific deep learning model or its purpose such as classification, segmentation, or detection. Instead, the text discusses various aspects of ecological modeling using techniques like mixture modeling (EM algorithm) and machine learning (semi-supervised learning). It mentions the development of algorithms that incorporate lasso penalties and bias correction, specifically addressing issues like observer bias and multicollinearity.

However, there is no explicit mention of a deep learning model being used for any of these purposes. Therefore, without additional context, it is not possible to determine the exact purpose of a deep learning model within this framework.
