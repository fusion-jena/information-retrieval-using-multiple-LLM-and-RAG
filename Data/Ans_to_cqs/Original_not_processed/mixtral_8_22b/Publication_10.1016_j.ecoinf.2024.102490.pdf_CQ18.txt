For model creation, 80% of the data was used as the training set, with 
the  remaining  20%  (the  evaluation  set)  used  to  assess  model  perfor-
mance. This procedure was necessary for thoroughly assessing the pre-
cision of our models. To evaluate the accuracy of our models, we used 
two metrics: the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating 
characteristics (ROC) and the true skill statistics (TSS) (Allouche et al., 
2006; Wani et al., 2022). To  ensure the robustness of our results, we 
applied committee averaging and weighted mean approaches to create 
separate ensemble models for each climate scenario and period. When 
selecting the final ensemble models, special attention was given to those 
with a TSS score of ≥0.7.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involved using 80% of the data as the training set and the remaining 20% as the evaluation set. The evaluation set was used to assess the performance of the models. Two metrics were employed to evaluate the accuracy of the models: the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and the true skill statistics (TSS). Additionally, committee averaging and weighted mean approaches were applied to create separate ensemble models for each climate scenario and period. Special attention was given to selecting the final ensemble models with a TSS score of ≥0.7 to ensure the robustness of the results.
