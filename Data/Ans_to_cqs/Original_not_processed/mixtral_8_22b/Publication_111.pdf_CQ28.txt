+is paper aims to predict the SST and the SWH for the
Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency dataset.
+e proposed work is motivated by comparing the statistical,
machine learning, and deep learning models to understand
the performance gap of these models. +e results of this
work should provide scientiﬁc evidence on which model ﬁts
better the marine data. To anticipate the marine features
eﬃciently, the employed deep learning model combines the
gated recurrent units (GRU) with the regular neural net-
work. In the proposed architecture, the GRU layer is pre-
ceded by an input layer and followed by a fully connected
layer. As a result, the predicted values can be produced from
the output layer. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst use of a
GRU model architecture for forecasting SST and SWH.
Besides, four diﬀerent ML models have been utilized in the
current study, namely, Linear Regression (LR), Decision
Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random

5.1. Experimental Setup. +e experiments were performed
on a computer running 64-bit Linux OS with two 2.3 GHz
Intel 8-core processors. All of the utilized predictive
models were implemented in the Python programming
language version 3.8.5. Moreover, deep learning model
(i.e., GRU-DNN) implementation is performed using

Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience

+e discussion of the existing methods shows that there
is no comparison of the diﬀerent methods (i.e., machine
learning, deep learning, and statistical models) in terms of
prediction accuracy. +us, there is a need to study the
performance gap of these methods for predicting marine
data.

4. Methodology

In this work, we proposed a set of predictive models which
are based on three diﬀerent approaches (i.e., machine
learning, deep learning, and statistical). +e proposed ge-
neric framework is composed of three stages: data gathering,
preprocessing, and machine learning model deployment.
+is system makes use of the Korea Hydrographic and
Oceanographic Agency dataset (available at: https://www.
khoa.go.kr/eng/). +e data collection stage targets collecting
vital marine features via installed sea sensors. +e obtained
data is preprocessed and ﬁne-tuned for the purpose of

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The information only states that all predictive models were implemented in the Python programming language version 3.8.5. Therefore, it cannot be determined from the given context which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
