Therefore, having a batch size of 20 and performing typically up to 1500 epochs for training the

network, we used almost 30,000 diﬀerent augmented images of size 256 × 256.

2.4. Artiﬁcial Neural Network Architecture

The problem of forest damage identiﬁcation is a semantic segmentation problem. Eﬀorts to solve
such problems have recently made signiﬁcant progress due to artiﬁcial neural networks of complex
architecture, which are closely related to a general term referred to as deep learning [55–57].

Semantic segmentation is a pixel-wise classiﬁcation problem aimed at determining the class of
the particular pixel of the image it belongs to. It is usually handled by means of convolutional neural
networks (CNNs). As was noted in the introduction, one of such CNNs is U-Net, which is of an
encoder-decoder architecture [58].

science and forestry, the deep learning approach has high potential and is only at the beginning of its
development [37,38]. In the case of the problem in recognition of forest disturbances, there are only a
few works discovering peculiarities of solving problems using deep learning methods [39–41].

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is for semantic segmentation. Semantic segmentation is a pixel-wise classification problem aimed at determining the class of the particular pixel of the image it belongs to. This task is typically handled by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and in this case, the authors use U-Net, which is a CNN with an encoder-decoder architecture. The goal here is to identify forest damages, making it a semantic segmentation problem.
