Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

3.4. Sampling Method

The SPOT6 satellite data for our ﬁve study areas were preprocessed to be fed into the
different Deep Learning architectures and the XGBoost model. First, the data were split
into three mutually exclusive parts: a learning set, a validation set and a test set totally
independent of the two previous ones.

Four of the ﬁve areas were used for learning and validation. The last, isolated scene
was then used as the test set. It contained all the classes for the two nomenclatures, the ﬁve
LC classes, and the 12 LU classes. In addition, this image contained all the environments
representing the New Caledonian landscape: urban, mining, mountainous and forest
environment with variations from the coastline to the inland mountain areas. It is on this
entire scene that the ﬁnal confusion matrix and quality metrics were computed.

between 12 land type classes for the classiﬁcation, as described in the nomenclature in
Table 4. Table 8 presents the results of the LU classiﬁcation on the test area and Table A2, in
the Appendix, presents the results of the LU classiﬁcation on the four training areas.

For the LU detection task, all deep learning techniques except AlexNet outperformed
XGBoost. Differences were signiﬁcant, with up to 15 percent points in OA. As in the
previous section, the best performing “single-pixel” architecture is DenseNet and the best
“semantic labeling” network is DeepLab. Interestingly, DenseNet reached the best PA,
although DeepLab dominated the remaining metrics.

For the remainder of this study, the best performing “single-pixel” and “semantic
labeling” were selected. There was little difference between the architectures, so the
architectures with the best F1-score for the LU classiﬁcation were chosen arbitrarily.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given information, there is no mention of where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, it cannot be determined which platform (Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, etc.) hosts the dataset.
