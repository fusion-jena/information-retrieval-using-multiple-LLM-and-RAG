higher  MS is needed to better capture the index response to wildfire. 
Compared to the default parameters, the overall accuracy and kappa of 
optimized  parameters  can  improve  by  up  to  8.4%  and  36.8%, 
respectively.

Model Proportion for best fitting. Runge et al. (2022) optimized the LTR

MS defines the maximum number of segments used for fitting. RT 
(cid:0) 1 in this study) defines the threshold of the fast recovery event. 
(unit: yr
A  simple  disturbance-recovery  pattern  usually  consists  of  four  phases 
(stable-decrease-recovery-stable).  In  that  case,  an  MS  value  of  4  is 
appropriate to describe the temporal pattern and reduce the impact of 
noise in the time series. In a complex recovery situation, more segments 
may be required. RT has a value between 0 and 1. A higher value makes 
the model less likely to miss a fast recovery while more likely to cause a 
false positive error.

XGBoost  offer  a  quantitative  measure  of  the  influence  of  each  input 
feature on the model's predictive accuracy. Specifically, Random Forest 
determines  feature  importance  by  assessing  the  reduction  in  the  Gini 
impurity each time the feature is used for splitting across all trees in the 
ensemble.  XGBoost  computes  feature  importance  based  on  the  gain, 
which indicates the improvement in accuracy brought by a feature to the 
branches which it is on.

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide explicit information about the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions two machine learning algorithms - Random Forest and XGBoost - both known for their ability to evaluate feature importance. This implies that these models might have been used to track the significance of different features during training, thus indirectly monitoring the model's performance.

Random Forest determines feature importance by measuring the decrease in impurity (like Gini Impurity) when a particular feature is chosen for splitting data into branches. On the other hand, XGBoost calculates feature importance using 'gain,' which measures how much a feature improves prediction accuracy at its respective branch. Therefore, these methods could potentially help understand the contribution of individual features towards improving the model's predictive power during training.
