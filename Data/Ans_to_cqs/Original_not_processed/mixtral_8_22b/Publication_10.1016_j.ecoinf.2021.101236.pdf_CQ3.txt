overall process mostly followed current best practices in deep learning

diversify  the  training  data,  and  the  3-s  window  length  enables  the 
implementation of this data augmentation method.

When  training  on  weakly  labeled  samples  of  varying  lengths,  the 
biggest challenge is to extract segments of audio recordings that contain 
the target signal. Typically, the focal data (i.e., the recording) we used 
for  training  included  a  variable  number  of  calls  or  songs  of  a  single 
species. While the metadata provided information on which species was 
recorded,  information on  the exact  location of the  bird signals  in the 
recording was not provided. Therefore, we developed a simple detector 
based  on  signal  strength  to  extract  segments  containing  vocalizations 
from  the  recordings.  Since  focal  recordings  are  of  high  quality  (high 
SNR), this method is very reliable. During the 2016 BirdCLEF edition, 
(Sprengel et al., 2016) established a method of signal-strength estima-
tion to determine the presence of a bird sound in a spectrogram using 
morphological  features  to  distinguish  salient  audio  segments  from

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide explicit details about specific data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it mentions that the biggest challenge when dealing with weakly labeled samples of varying lengths is to extract segments of audio recordings that contain the target signal. To address this issue, a simple detector based on signal strength was developed to extract segments containing vocalizations from the recordings. This approach relies on morphological features to distinguish salient audio segments from background noise. In summary, while the document doesn't explicitly mention traditional data annotation techniques like bounding boxes or instance segmentation, it describes a method for identifying relevant sections within audio files by analyzing their signal strengths and morphological characteristics.
