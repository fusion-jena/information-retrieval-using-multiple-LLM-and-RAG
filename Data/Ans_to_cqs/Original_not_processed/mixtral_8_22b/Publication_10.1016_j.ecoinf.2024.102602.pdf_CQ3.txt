annotation  tool  that  saves  annotations  as  XML  files  in  PASCAL  VOC 
format. It was conducted by the same author (ASC), with expertise in 
both ecology and computer sciences, and previous experience in data 
annotation and labelling and species identification, thereby minimizing 
any bias or else maintaining any potential bias as systematic. 

2.5. Model implementation 

We first selected the CNNs architectures to be implemented (Section 
2.5.1). After that, we trained, validated, and tuned the CNNs using the 5- 
fold cross validation method, along with other performance improve-
ment  strategies  (Sections  2.5.2  and  2.5.3).  Then,  we  evaluated  the 
model’s  performance  by  applying  commonly  adopted  classification 
metrics (Section 2.5.4). Lastly, we tested the transferability and gener-
alization capacity of both classification and object detection CNNs when 
applied using social media images (Section 2.5.5).

2.5.1. Model selection and parametrization 

For  the  classification  task,  before  the  implementation  of  deep 
learning models, all images were resized to the same resolution (227×
197  pixels)  by  considering  the  mean  dimensions  of  the  set,  and  then 
normalized to the [0,1] range (Na and Fox, 2020). Then, six open source 
CNNs  were  selected:  VGG16  (Simonyan  and  Zisserman,  2015), 
ResNet50,  ResNet101  (He  et  al.,  2016),  Inception-v3  (Szegedy  et  al., 
2016), DenseNet201 (Huang et al., 2017) and EfficientNetB0 (Tan and 
Le,  2019).  These  algorithms  were  selected  because  of  their  ease  for 
transfer  learning and  high  performance  on  similar classification  tasks 
(Arun  and  Viknesh,  2022;  Vallabhajosyula  et  al.,  2022).  For  model 
optimization, we used the Adam optimizer algorithm (Kingma and Ba, 
2015), a batch size of 10 and 100 epochs. The learning rates were chosen

with other plant species. Moreover, there are no other plant species in 
Portugal (our study area) with the same features as C. selloana. Both of 
these particularities may be the source of the high results observed in 
this study.

images

of data for some contexts, particularly if the aim is informing manage-
ment activities. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that the quality and 
resolution of publicly available images will enable precise identification 
of the species. Incorporating other forms of online data, such as textual 
information (e.g., tags, captions, comments) may further improve the 
generalization of deep learning tools for invasive alien species detection, 
mapping, and monitoring (Jeawak et al., 2018; Tateosian et al., 2023; 
Terry et al., 2020). Lastly, the spatial concentration bias of social media 
images, particularly the prevalence of photo captures in some areas at 
the  expense  of  other  areas  (e.g.,  due  to  accessibility  limitations, 
appealing attributes, among others; Di Minin et al., 2015), may also lead 
to limitations in the detection of invasive plants (and other species or 
natural assets).

Helpful Answer:
The paper does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that an annotation tool was employed to save annotations as XML files in PASCAL VOC format. This suggests that the authors might have used bounding box annotation, which is a common technique used in object detection tasks. Bounding boxes are rectangular regions drawn around objects within an image to identify their location and classify them accordingly. The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) challenge dataset uses this type of annotation, where each bounding box contains information about its coordinates, width, height, and associated label. Therefore, based on these details, it can be inferred that the authors likely utilized bounding box annotation for their deep learning pipeline.
