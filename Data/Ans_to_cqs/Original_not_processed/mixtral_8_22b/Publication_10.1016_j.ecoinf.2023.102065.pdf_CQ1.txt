ence data available for training were limited, so we sought to explore 
different network sizes in conjunction with pre-training with additional 
acoustic reference data from outside of our audio domain, followed by 
fine-tuning with ROI data from our study site.

Many 2D CNNs use well-labeled training and validation data from 
the study domain intended to optimize weights in existing image-based 
architectures (e.g., ResNet, VGGish, MobileNet), i.e., transfer learning. 
These data are usually hard to acquire and thus have low sample sizes. 
This often leads to the use of larger labeled data from outside the study 
domain.  Recent  BirdCLEF  competitions  use  weakly-labeled  audio

like other “crowdsource” data collection platforms, such as Zooniverse 
(Cox et al., 2015). However, we found the Arbimon pattern-matching 
routine was extremely inefficient at acquiring species present ROI data 
in the context of our sound data, target species, and available volunteers 
with  expertise  to  run  matches  with  templates  (Snyder  et  al.,  2022). 
Modern  CNN  classifiers  require  large  quantities  of  labeled  reference 
data, and they generally perform best when trained with labeled data 
from  within  the  study  domain,  rather  than  using  external  data  with 
different  sensor  characteristics,  vocalization  dialects,  and  environ-
mental conditions. Further research is thus needed in automating the 
reference  data  collection  step,  particularly  with  cloud-based  crowd-
sourcing platforms that would permit applications to scale.

Helpful Answer:
The papers cited provide several examples of how raw data can be collected for deep learning pipelines in ecology and ornithology. In general, there are three main sources of raw data: surveys, sensors, and public datasets.

Surveys involve human observers who collect data through direct observation or recording of bird sounds. For example, Priyadarshani et al. (2018) used automated birdsong recognition in complex acoustic environments to identify different bird species. Similarly, Quinn et al. (2022) used soundscapes to reveal temporal and geographic patterns in ecoacoustic data. These studies demonstrate the importance of human expertise in identifying and labeling bird sounds accurately.

Sensors are another source of raw data for deep learning pipelines. For instance, Roca et al. (2022) used passive acoustic monitoring devices to record bird sounds continuously over time. This approach allows researchers to capture a more comprehensive dataset of bird sounds without relying solely on human observations. Additionally, sensors can be deployed in remote locations where human access may be difficult or impossible.

Public datasets are also valuable resources for deep learning pipelines. Many publicly available datasets contain large amounts of labeled data that can be used to train machine learning models. For example, Pouyanfar et al. (2018) conducted a survey on deep learning algorithms, techniques, and applications, including those related to ecology and ornithology. Public datasets can help overcome some of the challenges associated with collecting raw data, such as limited availability of expert knowledge or equipment.

However, it is important to note that not all public datasets are suitable for every application. As mentioned earlier, modern CNN classifiers typically perform best when trained with labeled data from within the study domain. Therefore, researchers must carefully consider whether a particular dataset is appropriate for their specific needs before incorporating it into their deep learning pipeline.

In summary, various methods are employed for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, including surveys, sensors, and public datasets. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages, depending on the specific requirements of the project. Researchers should carefully evaluate each option based on factors such as cost, feasibility, accuracy, and relevance to ensure optimal results.
