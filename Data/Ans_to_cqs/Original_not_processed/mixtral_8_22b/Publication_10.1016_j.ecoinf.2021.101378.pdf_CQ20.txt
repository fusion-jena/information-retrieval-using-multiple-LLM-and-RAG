Pine wilt disease (PWD) is one of the most destructive diseases affecting pine trees, and South Korea is one of the 
most severely damaged countries in the world. Based on the information on PWD occurrence and their envi-
ronmental  characteristics  (i.e.,  geographical,  meteorological,  and  land-use)  in  South  Korea,  we  evaluated  the 
conditions  most  conducive  for  PWD  occurrence  and  developed  projection  models  using  machine  learning  al-
gorithms; random forest (RF) and maximum entropy (Maxent). Our results showed that PWD mainly occurred in 
areas like highly urbanized area; low elevations, at close proximity to roads. Also, both RF and Maxent models 
presented high prediction performance for PWD occurrence. Geographical factors (e.g., elevation and distance to 
roads) were major determinants of PWD occurrence and largely contributed to explaining variability and partial

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to determine which specific hardware resources were used for training the deep learning model. The text mentions various machine learning techniques such as artificial neural networks, random forests, and maximum entropy modeling but does not provide any details about the hardware resources employed during the training process. Therefore, it is impossible to definitively state whether GPUs, TPUs, or other types of hardware resources were utilized.
