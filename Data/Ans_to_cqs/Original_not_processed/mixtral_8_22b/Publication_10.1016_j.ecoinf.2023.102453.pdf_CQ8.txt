extending  the  possibility  for  a  wide  coverage.  The  improvements  in 
Explainable  Artificial  Intelligence  techniques  can  make  it  easy  to  un-
derstand and interpret the deep learning models' predictions, and also to 
evaluate  and  improve  the  models.  The  large-scale  inferences  from  a 
study could see an interplay between the low power edge devices and 
virtually unlimited storage and compute resources with cloud technol-
ogies. By incorporating the processing on the camera trap, it is possible 
to obtain timely information from large scale ecological studies, even at 
the global scale. With further improvements in the battery technologies, 
deep learning model optimizations, and better hardware, it would soon 
become easier and common for ecological studies to utilize customized 
camera  trap  devices  with  on-board  classification,  visualization,  and 
communications.

Neural architecture search (NAS) was used for developing the Effi-
cientNetV2B0 model, and for the optimization of parameter efficiency 
and  training  speed  (Tan  and  Le,  2021).  The  model  performance  was 
improved  using  progressive  learning  to  adapt  regularization  to  the 
image size (Tan and Le, 2021). EfficientNetV2 is a family of models (B0 
to B7), and B0 is the smallest variant in the family (Keras, n.d), with the 
other  models  progressively  increasing  in  performance  going  up  to 
EfficientNetV2B7.

In future work, we will investigate model optimization techniques 
for deploying the deep learning models to even smaller microcontroller 
devices. Such low power devices can further economize the batteries and 
run autonomously to provide near real-time ecological insights from the 
field.  We  would  also  research  other  model  fine-tuning  techniques  to 
improve the model performance by investigating model pre-training on 
large datasets from ecological studies.

Technique

The  transfer  learning  for  the  TensorFlow  models  used  the  three 
possibilities,  feature  extraction,  fine  tuning  with  some  layers  trained, 
and  fine  tuning  with  all  layers  trained.  The  results  have  shown  an 
improvement in the classification performance with all layers trained. 
However, it is important to note that with feature extraction most of the 
pre-trained learning is preserved and used on newer tasks. The feature 
extraction was also seen as achieving high accuracy especially for small 
datasets with a reduced training time (Simoes et al., 2023; Willi et al., 
2019).  A  performance  improvement  of  MobileNetV2  model  was  re-
ported  with  the  model  fine-tuning  (Cunha  et  al.,  2021).  Similarly, 
depending on how many layers are trained in fine tuning, this can affect 
the  model  performance,  with  fine  tuning  of  more  layers  resulting  in 
learning of more features from the new dataset. In comparison to other

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no explicit mention of where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available in the given context. It does not specify whether the code is hosted on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or elsewhere. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer based solely on the provided text.
