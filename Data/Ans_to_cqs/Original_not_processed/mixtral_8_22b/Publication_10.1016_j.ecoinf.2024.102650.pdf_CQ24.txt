①  A text-topic polynomial distribution θ is generated via sampling 

from the Dirichlet prior distribution parameter α.  

②  A topic Z corresponding to the Nth word of text M is generated via 

sampling from the text-topic polynomial distribution θ.  

③  A topic-word polynomial distribution φ is generated via sampling 

from the Dirichlet prior distribution parameter β.  

④  An Nth word of text M is generated via sampling from the topic- 

word polynomial distribution φ.

where P(D) represents perplexity, D represents the test set in the corpus, 
M represents the number of texts, Nd  represents the number of words in 
text  d,  wd  represents  the  words  in  text  d,  and  p(wd) represents  the 
probability of the occurrence of the word wd  in text d. Sk  represents the 
intensity of the kth topic, and p(θkd) represents the probability of topic k 
appearing in text d. We used Python’s pyLDAvis Library to cluster and 
visualize  topics  in  tweets  involving  contaminated  sites.  The  pyLDAvis 
interface  displays  the  ranking  of  keywords  related  to  each  topic,  for 
which relevance was determined by λ  and could be adjusted between 
0 and 1. The setting λ = 1 indicates ranking themes by frequency, and 
the setting λ = 0 indicates ranking themes based on uniqueness.

LDA—  proposed  by  Blei  et  al.  (2003)—is  a  topic  model  for  text 
generation based on natural language processing. The basic idea is that 
any text (in this study, microblog tweets) is composed of multiple topics 
with a polynomial distribution and each topic is composed of multiple 
words  with  a  polynomial  distribution.  By  analyzing  the  polynomial 
distribution of words for each topic, similar topics are aggregated into a 
topic category, and topic classification of the text is achieved (Tautorat 
et al., 2023). The advantage of LDA is its unsupervised nature, which 
means that the input corpus does not require labeled data, making it an 
ideal technique for topic modeling when labeled topics are not available 
and the quantity of input texts is large (Palanichamy et al., 2021; Sun 
and Yin, 2017).

thicker  the  line,  the  more  instances  of  co-occurrence  between  theme 
words  and  vice  versa.  As  relatively  low-frequency  keywords  are 
considered  ineffective  in  topic  detection,  previous  studies  (Dai  et  al., 
2020;  Liu  et  al.,  2023b)  typically  set  word  frequency  thresholds  to 
reduce network complexity and improve computational efficiency. Our 
study followed this approach. In word co-occurrence networks, closely 
connected  topic  words  can  be  viewed  as  communities  related  to 
contaminated sites. Modularity is a metric used to evaluate community 
division  quality  (Garg  and  Kumar,  2018);  its  calculation  formula  is 
shown in Eq. 3:

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not directly address the query about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide some general strategies often employed to manage randomness in such scenarios.

Randomness in deep learning pipelines often arises due to factors like random initialization of weights, shuffling of training data, or using dropout layers for regularization. To ensure reproducibility and consistency across experiments, several strategies can be adopted:

1. Fixed Random Seeds: One common strategy is to fix the random seed values for various libraries involved in the pipeline, including NumPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc. This ensures that the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers is generated every time the code runs, leading to consistent results.

2. Deterministic Algorithms: Some algorithms have deterministic versions that do not rely on randomness. For instance, certain implementations of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) use deterministic weight initialization methods instead of random ones. Using these alternatives can help reduce variability in outcomes.

3. Data Shuffle Control: Controlling the way data is shuffled before being fed into the model can also impact the final results. Enforcing a specific order or disabling shuffling altogether might be necessary depending on the application requirements.

4. Model Architecture Choices: Selecting models without inherently random components, such as avoiding dropout layers or batch normalization, can further minimize randomness in the pipeline.

5. Repeat Experiments: Running multiple trials with different seeds and averaging the results can provide insights into the overall performance and robustness of the model.
