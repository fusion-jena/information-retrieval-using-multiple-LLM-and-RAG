Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

WT-HMM using varying dataset sizes over 10 runs.

Furthermore,  the  comparison  between  recording  months  provides 
valuable insights into the tradeoffs  associated with dataset size  selec-
tion. The superior performance of the WT-HMM in the 8 to 20-h dataset 
size  range  for  both  months  suggests  the  most  suitable  range  for 
achieving  high  accuracy.  This  finding  resonates  with  studies  empha-
sizing the importance of selecting appropriate sample sizes for effective 
model training (Kahl et al., 2021).

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about which specific framework was used to build the deep learning model mentioned in the text. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether TensorFlow, PyTorch or any other framework was utilized based solely on this context. Further research would be required to find out more details regarding the implementation of the deep learning model discussed here.
