differed  between  the  Euro-Siberian  and  Irano-Turanian  regions,  as 
damages to livestock and beehives and road accidents were significantly 
higher in the Euro-Siberian region (Table 1).

Modeling  was  performed  by  generating  1000  random  pseudo- 
absence points and splitting the collected data into training (80%) and 
testing (20%) datasets (Huang et al., 2023; Pant et al., 2021; Salinas- 
Ramos et al., 2021). To avoid sampling bias, pseudo-absence points were 
generated  three  times  for  each  model  and  cross-validated  per  model 
using bootstrapping (Carvalho et al., 2021). We evaluated and compared 
the performance and accuracy of each model using AUC (area under the 
receiver operating curve) and TSS (true skill statistic) (Araújo and New, 
2007).  True  skill  statistics  value  changes  between  (cid:0) 1  and  + 1,  with 
positive values indicating a perfect fit, while AUC values range from 0.5 
to 1, with higher values indicating improved accuracy and predictive 
power (Fielding and Bell, 1997).

loaded  from  the  GeoData  application  of  the  General  Directorate  of 
Nature Conservation and National Parks of Türkiye (MOAF, 2019). The 
following categories of protected areas were extracted and used in our 
modeling  approach:  national  parks;  nature  conservation  areas;  special 
environment  protection  areas;  wildlife  enhancement  areas  (equivalent  to 
wildlife  refuges  or  reserves);  locally  important  wetlands;  nationally 
important wetlands; Ramsar wetlands; and preservation (protected) forests. 
Finally,  we  generated  distance  layers  for  all  our  variables  using  the 
Euclidean Distance tool in ArcGIS (ESRI Inc., USA).

Helpful Answer:
The performance and accuracy of each model are evaluated and compared using two main metrics: AUC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve) and TSS (True Skill Statistic). The true skill statistics value ranges between -1 and +1, where positive values indicate a perfect fit. On the other hand, AUC values range from 0.5 to 1, with higher values indicating better accuracy and predictive power. These metrics help assess how well the models perform in predicting the desired outcomes based on the input data.
