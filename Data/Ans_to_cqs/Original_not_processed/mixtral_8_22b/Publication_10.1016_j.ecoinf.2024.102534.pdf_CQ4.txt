Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, some common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, and translation. These techniques help increase the amount of training data available for a machine learning model by creating modified versions of existing images or datasets. This can improve the performance and generalizability of the model. It is important to note that the choice of data augmentation technique depends on the nature of the dataset and the problem being solved.

Unhelpful Answer:
I am sorry, but the given context does not provide any information on the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it is impossible to determine which techniques were applied.
