The target objects were tracked and identified in a scene with high 
dynamic density and low training data. YOLOv7 was determined as the 
baseline model to balance the limited computational power and speed of 
the airborne computer, as mentioned above. Formulated by Wang et al. 
(2021), this model can achieve this objective by integrating Extended 
Efficient  Layer  Aggregation  Network  (E-ELAN)  (Gao  et  al.,  2021), 
cascade-based modeling (DollÂ´ar et al., 2021) model scaling, and model 
reparameterization (Vasu et al., 2023). Among the YOLO family mem-
bers,  YOLOv7  (Wang  et  al.,  2023)  is  characterized  with  faster  target 
detection and a three-module structure (the input module, the backbone 
module,  and  the  header  network),  as  explicated  in  Fig.  4.  The  input 
module fits the image-related data to the backbone network size. The 
backbone  module,  similar  to  other  network  structures,  extracts  deep

As shown in Table 2, the MOTA of the SORT model was much lower 
than that of the Deep SORT model using FENs. In addition, the number 
of IDs allocated by the SORT model exceeded the number of IDs allo-
cated  by  the  Deep  SORT  model.  This  indicates  that  the  FEN  network 
extracts more and richer target information features in the process of

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves using the Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) metric for evaluation. Specifically, the MOTA of the Sort model was compared to that of the Deep Sort model using Feature Extraction Networks (FENs). It was observed that the MOTA of the Sort model was significantly lower than that of the Deep Sort model using FENs. Additionally, the number of Identification (ID) allocations made by the Sort model exceeded those made by the Deep Sort model, indicating that the FEN network extracted more and richer target information features during the tracking process. Therefore, it appears that the use of FENs in conjunction with the Deep Sort algorithm was employed to enhance the model's ability to accurately detect and identify targets within complex scenes containing high dynamic densities and low training data. Furthermore, future work aims to optimize the detection model and implement migration learning during training to further improve detection accuracy.
