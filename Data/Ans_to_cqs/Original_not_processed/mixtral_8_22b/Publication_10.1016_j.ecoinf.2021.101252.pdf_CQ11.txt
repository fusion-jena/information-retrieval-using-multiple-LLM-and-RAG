hyperparameters  (i.e.,  ‘AutoML’;  He  et  al.,  2021).  This  represents  an 
important  advantage  for  non-experts  in  deep  learning,  as  it  does  not 
require  the  manual  assembly  of  the  models  and  definition  of  their 
hyperparameters. The AutoML procedure starts by generating a set of 
candidate models with architectures and hyperparameters (e.g. number 
of layers; learning rate) selected at random from a prespecified range of 
values (see Fig. 2). Each candidate model is trained using a small subset 
of the data (data partition At; Fig. 2) during a small number of epochs. 
After  training,  the  performance  of  the  candidate  models  is  compared 
using a left-out validation data set (Av; Fig. 2). The selected candidate 
model (usually the best performing among candidates) is then trained on 
the full training data (Bt; Fig. 2). In this step it is required to identify an 
optimal number of training epochs, to avoid under- or overfitting of the

same data using the absolute distance of spectra. They found that this 
distance  metric  achieved  a  good  accuracy  in  distinguishing  between 
A. mellifera and B. oleae (an ‘easy’ classification case) but was unable to 
distinguish between the latter species and L. aristella (a ‘difficult’ clas-
sification case). Given the use of different data partition strategies and 
performance metrics, the performances measured for our InceptionTime 
model  are  not  fully  comparable  to  those  obtained  by  Potamitis  et  al. 
(2015).  However,  the  deep  learning  approach  correctly  distinguished 
between all test instances of A. mellifera and B. oleae (AUC = 1) and was 
able to provide good classification performance for the more difficult 
classification case (AUC of 0.88), suggesting its superior classification 
ability.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no information about the specific data repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in these studies. It would be necessary to refer to the original sources cited in the text to find out if they have made their datasets publicly available through repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
