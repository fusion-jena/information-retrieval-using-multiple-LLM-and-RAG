2) Deep Learning: We chose CNNs [28] because of the
impressive results obtained in classiﬁcation challenges such
as ImageNet [29]. The main strength of this approach comes
from its ability to learn discriminant visual features directly
from the raw pixels of the images without falling into the
trap of the curse of dimensionality [30]. This is achieved by
stacking multiple convolutional layers, which are the core
building blocks of a CNN. A convolutional layer basically
takes images as input and produces as output feature maps
that correspond to different convolution kernels, while looking
for different visual patterns.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model described here is image classification. This can be determined from the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are commonly used for image recognition tasks, including image classification. Additionally, the mention of impressive results obtained in the ImageNet challenge further supports this conclusion, as ImageNet is a large dataset specifically designed for image classification tasks. Furthermore, the description of stacking multiple convolutional layers, which look for different visual patterns, also aligns with the goal of identifying and categorizing objects within images.
