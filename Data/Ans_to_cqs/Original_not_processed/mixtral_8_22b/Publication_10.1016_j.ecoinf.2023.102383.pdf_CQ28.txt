Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

As shown on the top of Fig. 8, a feature map extractor based on FPN 
and  ResNet152  extracted  five  feature  maps  from  the  original  UAV 
thermal image, and they each has different resolutions, including 256 ×
320, 128 × 160, 64 × 80, 32 × 40, and 16 × 20. The region proposal 
network  can  utilize  the  five  feature  maps  to  generate  four  RoIs  with 
different sizes, which are respectively colored by purple, red, green and 
yellow from left to right in the middle-right of Fig. 8. The size of the 
purple RoI is the largest, and the model assigns a feature map with the 
resolution of 32 × 40 to it. On the contrary, the red RoI is the smallest, 
and the model selects the feature map with highest spatial resolution for 
it.  Similarly,  the  green  and  yellow  RoIs  are  assigned  corresponding 
feature maps according to their respective sizes. The selection of large 
feature maps means the number of parameters is increasing and needs

%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The paper does not provide information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, it cannot be determined if platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud were used.
