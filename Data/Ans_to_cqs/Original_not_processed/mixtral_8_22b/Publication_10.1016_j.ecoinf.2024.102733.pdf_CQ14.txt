Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Various combinations of Pmean and Pstd values, along with typical
hyperparameters of neural networks such as learning rate, batch size,
and weight decay, were tested and explored. These values were assigned
using random generators to ensure a more comprehensive evaluation of
the model's performance. The parameter ranges considered are as fol-
lows: learning rate = [0.00001, 0.001], batch size = [64, 8192], weight
decay = [0, 0.59], Pmean = [ (cid:0) 4, 1.8], and Pstd = [0.5, 1.68].

Various parameter values, including learning rate (i.e., 0.0001, 0.001,
0.01, and 0.1), batch size (i.e., 32, 64, 128, 256, and 512), and latent
dimension (i.e., 128, 256, 512, 2048), have been explored and

During the training of the MLP, Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba,
2015) is used, as well as the scheduler which adjusts the learning rate
when the network reaches a plateau. For the training, various parameter
values and different regularization techniques were explored, with the
option of using either Cross-Entropy or Focal Loss (Lin et al., 2017). In
detail, the learning rate was set to 0.00001 and 0.0001, batch sizes of 8,
16, 32, and 64 were tested, and weight decay was varied between
0.0001 and 0.001 with a dropout of 0.1. Additionally, Focal Loss (Lin
et al., 2017) introduce additional parameters to investigate: α and γ. The
former serves as a balancing factor, either as a fixed value for all classes
or as the inverse of each class frequency. The latter regulates the impact
of the scaling factor; specifically, when set to zero, Focal Loss is equiv-
alent to Cross-Entropy Loss. We experimented with α set as the inverse of

Helpful Answer:
The hyperparameters of the model are optimized by testing various combinations of their values using random generators. This approach ensures a more comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance. Specifically, the authors explore and evaluate different values for learning rate, batch size, and latent dimension. They also use the Adam optimizer during the training of the MLP and employ a scheduler that adjusts the learning rate when the network reaches a plateau. Furthermore, they test various regularization techniques, such as Cross-Entropy or Focal Loss, and experiment with additional parameters like α and γ introduced by Focal Loss.
