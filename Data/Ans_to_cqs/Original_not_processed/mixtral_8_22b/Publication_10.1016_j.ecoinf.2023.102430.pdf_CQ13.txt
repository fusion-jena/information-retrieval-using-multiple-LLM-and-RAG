AN  was  implemented  in  MATLAB  (www.mathworks.com).  For 
training,  we  used  the  stochastic  gradient  descent  with  momentum 
optimizer with default settings except for the initial learning rate (which 
we set to 0.001) and the maximum number of epochs (which we set to 15 
after  preliminary  tests).  The  ‘classical’  machine-learning  algorithms 
(AB, GB, HB, and LD) were run in Python (www.python.org) using the 
scikit-learn toolbox (Pedregosa et al., 2011). We left hyperparameters at 
scikit-learn  default  values,  except  for  the  learning  rate  of  GB  and  HB 
(which we set to 0.15) and the tolerance threshold value for LD (set to 1

2.2. Algorithms 

We used five machine-learning algorithms based on three different 
principles: a pre-trained convolutional neural network (AlexNet); three 
boosting-based  classifiers  (AdaBoost  Adaptive  Boosting,  Gradient 
Boosting,  and  Histogram-based  Gradient  Boosting);  and  a  linear 
discriminant  model.  Here,  we  briefly  describe  the  characteristics  of 
these algorithms and the inputs that they require; further details can be 
found in the references provided below. 

The  architecture  of  AlexNet  (‘AN’  hereafter),  which  includes  five 
convolutional  layers  and  three  fully-connected  layers,  has  60  million

Helpful Answer:
For training the deep learning model, the authors used the stochastic gradient descent with momentum optimizer with default settings. However, two specific hyperparameters were adjusted: the initial learning rate was set to 0.001, and the maximum number of epochs was set to 15 after some preliminary tests. These adjustments were made to improve the performance of the model during training.
