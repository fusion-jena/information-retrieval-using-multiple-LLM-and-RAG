As a machine learning model capable of using diverse information 
for  data  represented  as  a  graph,  the  Graph  Neural  Network  (GNN) 

presents  a  potential  solution  (Zhou  et  al.,  2020).  Recently,  the  GNN 
model has been increasingly applied in various fields of ecology, such as 
studies on air quality prediction (Dun et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2021) and 
water quality prediction (Li et al., 2024). By representing the swimming 
behavior of C. elegans as a UBN, a kind of graph, the GNN could incor-
porate information, such as distinguishing the head and tail or the di-
rection  of  movement.  Furthermore,  the  GNN  can  be  combined  with 
LSTM, leading to the possibility of constructing a hybrid model (Con-
cepcion et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2020). This hybrid model could provide 
a basis for the design of a biomonitoring system, offering expectations 
for improved performance and utility.
