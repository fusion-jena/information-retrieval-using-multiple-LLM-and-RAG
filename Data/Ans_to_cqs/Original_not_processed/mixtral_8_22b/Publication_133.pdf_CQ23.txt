In our case, it is the proportion of expert-labeled “Glycaspis”
(respectively “Psyllaephagus” or “Thaumastocoris”) objects that
were also labeled “Glycaspis” (respectively “Psyllaephagus” or
“Thaumastocoris”) by the deep learning model. Recall is deﬁned
as the number of true positives divided by the sum of true
positives and false negatives. Precision (Eq. 3) is the fraction
of correctly classiﬁed objects among all classiﬁed objects. It is
deﬁned as the number of true positives divided by the sum of true
positives and false positives:

the loss function, and modifying their parameters according
to the loss function’s gradient. Thus,
the loss declines in
each training round (aka epoch), and the model’s annotation
accuracy increases (Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure 1).
As the number of parameters of a typical deep learning
model
is large, overﬁtting is a major concern. A common
(partial) remedy is the use of validation data, which are set-
aside while training, yet their annotations by the models are
the training
monitored. The validation data help to limit
duration, thereby reducing the risk of overﬁtting. In this study
we used 30 epochs per training task, based on our validation
runs (Figure 2).

State of the Art: Machine Learning for
Insect Ecoinformatics
Ecologists strive to document and interpret the abundance
and distribution of organisms. Field observations are a major
means to this end, and the observational data that have
accumulated over the decades form a solid basis for our
view of ecosystems. In recent years, technological advances
enabled the solidiﬁcation of observational ecology into a
new scientiﬁc branch, ecoinformatics, which applies big-data
methods to ecological questions (Rosenheim and Gratton, 2017).
Ecoinformatics focuses on curating and mining large databases,
collected over long time periods across multiple locations (see
the GBIF Home Page1). The available data vary in format and
reliability (Gueta and Carmel, 2016) as they originate from
multiple sources, such as long-term ecological monitoring (Lister
and Garcia, 2018), citizen science projects (Hallmann et al., 2017),
or museum catalogs (Short et al., 2018).

data points describe the performance attained by a model that
accepts all identiﬁcations, as its Tcs is minimal (0). Such a plot
can guide users in adjusting model parameters to their needs. If
fewer detections are accepted (low recall), precision increases.

Tables 3, 4 illustrate the types of recall (Table 3) and precision
(Table 4) errors made by the model when the conﬁdence
threshold was set to 0.7. The model rarely confused between our
three focal species (gray areas in Tables 3, 4). It made some false
positive predictions, particularly for the class “Psyllaephagus”
(bold text in Table 4, not tagged by the expert but predicted
by the model). Most of the missed predictions, however, were
false negatives (bold text in Table 3, tagged by the expert but not
identiﬁed by the model).

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the model was trained using diverse datasets consisting of various insect species, including Glycaspis, Psyllaephagus, and Thaumastocoris. This diversity helped prevent the model from being biased towards any specific type of insect, thus improving its ability to generalize well to unseen data. Secondly, the concept of validation data was employed during the training process. Validation data refers to a subset of the entire dataset that is withheld from the training phase and used solely for evaluation purposes. By continuously monitoring the model's performance on the validation data, it was possible to detect signs of overfitting early on and take appropriate actions to mitigate it. Lastly, the study utilized 30 epochs per training task, which was determined through extensive validation runs. An epoch represents one complete pass through the entire dataset, allowing the model to learn from every sample. Using a sufficient number of epochs ensured that the model had enough exposure to the dataset, further enhancing its capacity to generalize effectively.
