does not assume a specific distribution of the response variable, and is 
largely  computationally-efficient  in  GEE  (Belgiu  and  Dr˘agut¸,  2016; 
Breiman, 2001; Lary et al., 2016; Quintano et al., 2023; Roteta et al., 
2021). The default RF hyperparameters in the GEE implementation were 
preserved,  except  for  the  number  of  trees,  which  was  set  to  500  to 
improve  computational  efficiency  without  losing  precision  in  the  BA 
estimates as determined by recursive validation of the BA classification 
algorithm over independent wildfires (see Section 3.1). We calculated 
the mean decrease in the Gini Index (dGI) to assess RF variable impor-
tance on classification accuracy.

Query: "What are the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model (e.g., learning rate, optimizer)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the Random Forest algorithm was employed with its default hyperparameters in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) implementation, except for the number of trees, which was set to 500. Unfortunately, there is no information about the learning rate or optimizer since these terms are typically associated with neural networks rather than decision tree algorithms like Random Forest. Therefore, based on the given context, we cannot determine the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
