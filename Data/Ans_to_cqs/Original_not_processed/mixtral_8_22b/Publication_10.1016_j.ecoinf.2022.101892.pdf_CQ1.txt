In  addition  to  calculating  MAE  values,  we  also  compared  the 
inference-time to determine the most computationally efficient model. 
We set the batch to 400 to achieve 100% GPU utilization of each model 
and to measure the maximum queries per second (QPS) achieved under 
real-world conditions (Ding et al., 2021). All models were tested under 
the same experiment setting and the same GPU to make comparisons 
between them fair. To do so, we first expand the dataset by a factor of 
five (from 8002 to 40,010 images). Then, we fed batches of 50 images 
into the model to warm up the hardware, before recording the inference- 
time of batches of 100 to quantify QPS.

3. Results

different VGG nets, such as VGG-11, VGG-16, and VGG-19. VGG-16 has 
been applied in many researches and it is often used to extract features in 
the age estimation tasks Pan et al. (2018). In this study, we replaced the 
last three Fully-Connected (FC) layers of the original VGG model with 
one FC layer to reduce parameters. And we adopt Batch Normalization 
(BN) (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015) to accelerate the training of networks. 
For this study, we selected VGG-11-BN and VGG-16-BN to extract the 
features from panda facial images.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, there are some indirect references that can be considered. For instance, W\"agele et al. (2022) discuss a multisensor station for automated biodiversity monitoring, which suggests the use of sensor technology for data collection. Additionally, Hu (1987) mentions studying the age and population composition of the giant panda by judging droppings in the wild, indicating field research or observation techniques. Lastly, Jalal et al. (2020) focus on fish detection and species classification in underwater environments using deep learning with temporal information, implying the use of video footage or imagery collected through underwater cameras or other devices. Therefore, based on these sources, one could infer that various methods like sensors, field observations, and publicly available datasets might be employed for gathering raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
