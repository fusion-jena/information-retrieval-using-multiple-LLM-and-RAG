2023; Yuan et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2023c). The model’s initial learning 
rate was set to 0.01, further refined via iterative testing. The number of 
iterations was 150, with a batch size of 4, downsampling multiplier set 
at 8, and utilized SGD optimizer, ReLu activation function, and Dice loss 
function.

robustness, with higher scores indicating better performance.

The  model  developed  here  demonstrates  the  capability  to  extract 
fine-scale variations in vegetation across drylands using readily avail-
able  remote  sensing  data,  enabling  large-scale  assessments  over 
extended periods. Enhancing the model’s accuracy can be achieved by 
integrating  various  optimization  algorithms,  including  the  Genghis 
Khan Shark Optimizer, Gazelle Optimization Algorithm, and Dandelion 
Optimizer (Agushaka et al., 2023; Hu et al., 2023a, 2023b), to optimize 
the framework’s parameters. Moreover, the incorporation of ensemble 
methods such as the Bagging algorithm, Boosting algorithm, and stacked 
generalization can enhance the model’s precision further (Friedman and 
Popescu, 2008; Wu and Wang, 2023; Zhao et al., 2023a). Given that this 
study solely relied on satellite imagery, limited to identifying vegetation 
at a generic level, future investigations should consider employing high-

when the groundwater depth surpasses (cid:0) 3 m, there is a notable decline 
in the probability of high FVC to 50%. These findings underscore the 
significance  of  considering  appropriate  groundwater  depths  for  tree 
planting  densities  in  reforestation  endeavors.  Amidst  the  backdrop  of 
global warming, drylands remain at risk of expansion due to increasing 
aridity (Li et al., 2021). Warming has shifted the timing and magnitude 
of  groundwater  recharge,  as  warming  persists,  water  storage  can  be 
depleted (Amanambu et al., 2020; Condon et al., 2020; Hao et al., 2010). 
Furthermore,  urbanization  and  increasing  human  activities  such  as 
irrigation have resulted in a notable decline in groundwater levels and 
thereby led to significant ecosystem degradation across many arid areas 
(Chen et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2023). The intricate 
relationship between vegetation distribution and multiple determinants,

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it appears that the model underwent 150 iterations during its training phase. This suggests that one criterion used to determine when training is complete could be reaching a predefined number of iterations or epochs. However, the text does not explicitly mention other specific criteria such as validation loss plateau, so we cannot definitively state whether these were also used. It's important to note that different models may use different criteria to determine when training is complete, depending on their specific requirements and objectives. Some common criteria include achieving a certain level of accuracy, minimizing the validation loss, or reaching a point where additional training no longer improves the model's performance. Without more detailed information about the specific model and its training process, it's difficult to provide a more precise answer.
