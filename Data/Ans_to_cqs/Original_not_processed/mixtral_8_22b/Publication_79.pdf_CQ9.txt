%Query
Query: "Where is the data repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The context only provides details about various studies and research papers related to deep learning techniques for vegetation species discrimination, semantic segmentation of endangered tree species, and hierarchical mapping of Brazilian Savanna physiognomies using deep learning methods. However, it does not mention any specific data repositories or platforms like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. To find this information, one would need additional resources or search within the mentioned publications themselves.
