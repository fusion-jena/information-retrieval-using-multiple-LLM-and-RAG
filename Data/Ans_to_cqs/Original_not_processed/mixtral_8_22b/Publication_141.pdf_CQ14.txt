Fig. 3. Morphological characters of the training set used by the classiﬁer in CNN models at species, genus, and subfamily level of taxonomic identiﬁcation. Gradient-weighted
Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) generated heat maps with the relevant characters for each of the three models (red = most important region for classiﬁcation). The
percentages indicate proportion of the respective morphological trait used for successful classiﬁcation in the training set. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this

cies level (Table 2). The network performed surprisingly well con-
sidering the ImageNet dataset does not contain any similar object
(e.g., does not contain non-biting midges). As expected, the results
further improved when ﬁne-tuning was applied in the second
training phase, where the whole network was trained allowing
the model to learn additional features speciﬁc to our dataset.

factors: network architecture, protocol type of image acquisition
(Martineau et al., 2017), and robustness of input matrix (number
of entities and replicates). Our choice to use a ResNet-50 network
architecture, in combination with transfer learning, data augmen-
tation, and dropout proved appropriate for the current number of
taxa in our demonstration dataset. ResNet-50 network architecture
represents a midsize solution in the ResNet palette (18, 34, 50, 101,
152 layers) that combines both representation power and lower
complexity that allows relatively fast training of the models. How-
ever, the protocol for image acquisition inﬂuences the complexity
of features, which will be processed by CNNs. Controlled object
position during the collection of images can also govern the level
of feature variability. Our dataset was constructed under the lab-
based protocol of image acquisition with fully controlled position
of the larvae (ventral point of view). This was not the case in pre-

(Fig. 3). This is likely due to the number of entities in the model,
where the lower number of groups used during classiﬁcation
(number of genera and subfamilies) is not a demanding task for
the network, requiring simple classifying features that all speci-
mens within the particular genera or subfamily have in common.
For our demonstration, this was the mentum and postoccipital
margin, structures that had the highest variability in shape across
the different taxa groups.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, it does mention that the authors chose to use a ResNet-50 network architecture, which suggests they may have experimented with various architectures before selecting one. Additionally, the text discusses using transfer learning, data augmentation, and dropout techniques, indicating some form of optimization process took place. Unfortunately, without more specific details about the optimization methods employed, such as whether grid search, random search, or another method was used, we cannot definitively state how the hyperparameters were optimized.
