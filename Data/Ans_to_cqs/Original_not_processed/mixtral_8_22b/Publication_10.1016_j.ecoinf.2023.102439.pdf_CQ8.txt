2.3.2. LST retrieval 

LST is a valuable source of data that provides insights into the cli-
matic, environmental, and physical characteristics of the Earth’s surface 
(Çolak and Sunar, 2020; Jimenez-Munoz et al., 2009; Tang et al., 2021). 
It can be estimated from satellite data or direct ground-truth measure-
ments. In this study, we derived the LST dataset from infrared radiations 
measured on channels 31 and 32 using the MODIS-TERRA sensor. The 
data  was  obtained  from  the  MOD11A2  product,  which  offers  8-day 
temporal  and  1  km  spatial  resolutions  covering  2005–2018.  It  is 
important to note that LST can only be accurately measured under clear- 
sky conditions. To calculate LST from MODIS Terra MOD11A2, we uti-
lised an equation provided below by Artis and Carnahan in 1982 (Artis 
and Carnahan, 1982).

Similarly, researchers employed a multifaceted approach in a study 
on  groundwater  level  prediction.  Combining  wavelet  transformation 
with  machine  learning  techniques  significantly  enhanced  prediction 
accuracy  across  various  learning  methods  (Samani  et  al.,  2023). 
Seyedmohammadi  et  al.  (2023)  exemplified  this  trend  by  adopting 
various methodologies, including classification and regression trees, k- 
nearest neighbours, support vector machines, and an innovative hybrid 
model  that  merged  support  vector  machines  with  the  firefly  meta- 
heuristic  algorithm.  Their  investigation  aimed  to  assess  the  influence 
of soil properties on pistachio yield prediction and sustainable resource 
management, culminating in the validation of the novel hybrid model’s 
exceptional effectiveness. Moreover, Chen and Yao (2023) employed a 
synergistic approach, utilising both a Markov Chain Model and a cellular

Query: "Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the code repository is available on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
