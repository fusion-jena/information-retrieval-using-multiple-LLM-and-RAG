This is a multi-layered neural network model that receives successive OL data streams
and uses the unsupervised GRELMA algorithm as a basic building block in which the
outputs of each level are used as inputs to the next one (Sun, Zhang, Zhang, & Hu, 2017).
An autoencoder is an ANN used for unsupervised learning of eﬃcient coding. The aim
of an autoencoder is to learn a representation (encoding) for a set of data, but with the
output layer having the same number of nodes as the input layer, and with the
purpose of reconstructing its own inputs (instead of predicting target value Y given
inputs X). The algorithm is described below (Sun et al., 2017):

The implementation of this proposed framework was based on the DELE philosophy.
An important aspect of the framework is the usage of ELM which has proven to be
capable, of solving a multidimensional and complex IT problem. The Deep ELM simulates
the functioning of biological brain cells in a most realistic mode. This creates the potential
for a fully automated conﬁguration of the model with high accuracy classiﬁcation. An inno-
vative aspect of this work is the development of this model using Online Sequential Multi-
layer algorithm plus a Graph Regularized Extreme Learning Machine Autoencoder that
aims to optimize the choice of the input layer weights and bias. This has been done in
order to achieve a higher level of generalization. This method combines two highly
eﬀective machine learning algorithms, for solving a multidimensional and complex
machine hearing problem. Another interesting point is the performance of feature extrac-

Before introducing our proposed algorithm, it would be essential to discuss the existing basic
theoretical framework. The question of whether a small Neural Network architecture can
learn a lot, even from huge training data sets, was answered in the aﬃrmative by ELM. An
ELM (Cambria & Guang-Bin, 2013) is a Single-Hidden Layer Feed Forward Neural Network
(SLFFNN) with N hidden neurons, randomly selected input weights and random values of
bias in the hidden layer, while the weights at its output are calculated with a single multipli-
cation of vector matrices. SLFFNNs are used in ELMs because of their ability to approach any
continuous function and to classify any discontinuous areas. An ELM can accurately learn N
samples, and its learning speed can be even thousands of times greater than the speed of
conventional Back Propagation Feed Forward Neural Networks (BP_FFNN).

As it has been proven, ELMs are an important approach for handling and analysing Big
Data as they require the minimum training time relative to the corresponding engineering
learning algorithms. Moreover ELMs do not require ﬁne manipulations to determine their
operating parameters and ﬁnally they can determine the appropriate output weights
towards the most eﬀective resolution of a problem. What is most important, they have
in contrast to corresponding methods which adjust their

performance based solely on their training data set. It is obvious that the emerging use of
ELM in Big Data analysis as well as DELE creates serious prerequisites for complex systems’
development by low-cost machines.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the implementation of the proposed framework was based on the DELE philosophy. DELE stands for Dynamic Ensemble Learning Environment, which is a software platform designed for developing and deploying ensemble learning models. While DELE itself is not a deep learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch, it could potentially utilize these frameworks within its environment. Therefore, without further context, we cannot definitively state which frameworks were used to build the deep learning model.
