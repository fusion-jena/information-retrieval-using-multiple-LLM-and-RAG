findings requires careful consideration and evaluation within the spe-
cific context of each geographical region. Despite achieving high per-
formance,  our  study  was  constrained  by  limitations  in  resources  and 
time,  which  resulted  in  a  narrow  focus  on  specific  forest  samples.

%Query
Query: "What criteria are used to determine when training is complete (e.g., validation loss plateau)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The context does not provide information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the XGBoost model. However, common criteria used to determine when training is complete include reaching a minimum error threshold, validation loss plateau, maximum number of iterations, or early stopping based on performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, overall accuracy (OA), or Kappa coefficient. In this case, it appears that the authors have evaluated their model using these metrics, but they do not specify how they determined when training was complete. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based on the given context.
