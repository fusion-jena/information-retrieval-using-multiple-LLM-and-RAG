identity and projection shortcuts) have been introduced for residual learning. Recently, these networks have been introduced into the field of remote sensing. Our tree species classification strategy takes advantage of recent CNNs for patch-wise classification. We formulated the tree species classification as a supervised image classification problem to identify 18 tree species (17 dominant trees species and a class of “Others”). For this purpose, we adopted AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet50 implemented in Caffe for individual tree Forests 2019, 10, 1047

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available from the given context to provide the exact data repository link of the deep learning pipeline used for tree species identification. However, it can be noted that the study uses popular deep learning architectures such as AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet50, which are widely accessible through various platforms like GitHub or their respective original publications.

The table presented in the context provides the classification accuracy results obtained using these models. It appears that the authors utilized a dataset containing patches of images representing different tree species to train and evaluate these deep learning models. Nevertheless, without further details about the specific implementation or any reference to a particular data repository, I cannot provide the requested link.
