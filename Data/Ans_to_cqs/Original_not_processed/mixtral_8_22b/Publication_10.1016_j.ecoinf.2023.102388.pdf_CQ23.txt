Strengthening the ability of trained models to generalize effectively 
poses  a  significant  challenge  within  the  domain  of  deep  learning. 
Indeed, generalization refers to the variation in a model’s performance 
when applied to data it has been trained on, as opposed to data it en-
counters for the first time during testing. This issue is of fundamental 
importance and has far-reaching implications for applications employ-
ing  deep  neural  networks.  In  particular,  this  challenge  becomes

• No-overfitting. In this setting, the optimization algorithm of CNNs is 
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), with a learning rate of 0.0001 
and a weight decay of 0.5. The batch size is set to 32, the number of 
training epochs to 200 and finally the batch-norm and dropout (0.5) 
are used to reduce the overfitting level.  

• Overfitting.  We  use  the  same  hyperparameters  setting  as  the  no- 
overfitting  but  we  remove  the  use  of  batch-norm,  weight  decay 
and dropout techniques to ensure that the model overfits.

prominent  in  demanding  tasks  like  the  re-identification  of  marine 
mammals in underwater environments. 

The  challenge  of  generalization  often  arises  as  a  consequence  of 
network overfitting during the training phase. In simplified terms, the 
network’s  weight  parameters  are  adjusted to  optimize  their  fit  to  the 
provided training examples, thus effectively “memorizing” the training 
data. However, when applied to new and unseen data during testing, the 
network’s  response  exhibits  a  more  balanced  consideration  of  the 
diverse training examples. This discrepancy frequently leads to dimin-
ished performance on the test dataset and might persist even after the 
network  has undergone  prolonged training over  numerous epochs.  In 
recent  years,  significant  research  endeavors  have  been  dedicated  to 
mitigating overfitting challenges to enhance model generalization.

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimization algorithm was employed with a learning rate of 0.0001 and a weight decay of 0.5. These settings help prevent the model from becoming too complex and fitting the noise in the training data, which can lead to poor generalization. Secondly, the batch size was set to 32, allowing the model to learn from a diverse range of samples in each iteration. Thirdly, the number of training epochs was limited to 200, preventing the model from overfitting by continuing to train beyond the point where it starts to memorize the training data instead of learning general patterns. Lastly, batch normalization and dropout techniques were utilized to further reduce overfitting. Batch normalization standardizes the inputs to each layer, making the model more robust to changes in the input distribution, while dropout randomly drops out neurons during training, forcing the model to rely on multiple features rather than just one or two dominant ones. Together, these measures contribute to improving the model's ability to generalize effectively to new, unseen data.
