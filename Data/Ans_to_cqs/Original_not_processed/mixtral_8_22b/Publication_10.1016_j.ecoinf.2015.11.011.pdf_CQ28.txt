For the 2009 NAIP imagery, we used all four bands (R, G, B and IR)
and per-pixel NDVI, and for historical imagery we used the image
brightness and the six GLCM texture measures. We ﬁrst used multi-
resolution segmentation with a large scale parameter to mask forest
and prairie from each other, and then multi-threshold segmentation
on various bands to classify within those areas (Gärtner et al., 2014).
Using ArcGIS's ‘classify’ tool for raster symbology, we examined

2011; Livingston, 2014; Thysell and Carey, 2001). Our sites were chosen
to represent several different latitudes and distances from the coast
where densiﬁcation was known to occur: Iaqua Buttes, Bald Hills, Willow
Creek, and Blake Mountain (Fig. 2, Table 1). Analysis polygons within

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not contain any details about which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, it is impossible to determine whether they used AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or another service.
