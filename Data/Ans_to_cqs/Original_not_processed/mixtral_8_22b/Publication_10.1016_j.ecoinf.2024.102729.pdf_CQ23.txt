study,  the  dataset  was  randomly  divided  into  two  subsets,  the  first  one  was  used  as  a  training 

dataset  to  learn  the  optimal  model  structure  and  the  second  as  a  validation  dataset  to  test  its 

performance;  75%  of  the  data  were  devoted  to  model  training  and  25%  to  testing.  Given  the 

well-documented robustness of RF algorithms to randomly receive training data from subsets and 

establish models with high predictive capacity, we opted for random (instead of cluster) sampling 

with  one  major  condition  to  maintain  the  covariance  structure  among  the  predictor  variables 

relatively intact between the training and testing datasets.

Helpful Answer:
The study mentioned in the given context does not provide explicit details about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model. However, it does mention using a dataset that was randomly divided into two subsets, with 75% of the data devoted to model training and 25% to testing. This suggests that some form of cross-validation or holdout method might have been employed to assess the model's performance on unseen data. Additionally, the use of random sampling instead of cluster sampling indicates an attempt to maintain the covariance structure among the predictor variables relatively intact between the training and testing datasets. While these practices are common in ensuring the generalizability of machine learning models, without further context, it cannot be confirmed if other measures such as diverse datasets or stratified splitting were also implemented.
