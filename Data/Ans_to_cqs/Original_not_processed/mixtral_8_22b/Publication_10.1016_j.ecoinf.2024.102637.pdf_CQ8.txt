In view of this discovery, we re-examined the application strategies 
of deep learning, no longer pursuing model complexity but exploring the 
potential  of  shallow  networks.  Through  meticulous  algorithm  optimi-
sation  and  structural  design,  we  strive  to  maintain  the  model  perfor-
mance while reducing the computational complexity  and deployment 
costs,  achieving  a  balance  between  speed  and  accuracy.  The  specific 
contributions of this study are as follows:  

• We propose a lightweight SIAlex model that utilises AlexNet as the 
backbone,  fully  exploiting  the  performance  of  minimalist  models. 
Ensuring a good balance between speed and accuracy. 

• The  method  of  cascading  multiple  activation  functions  fully  in-
troduces  nonlinear  factors  such  that  the  model  approximates  the 
nonlinear  expression  function  of  the  learning  features  while  also 
improving the gradient propagation.

The combination of deep learning and bird sound recognition is widely employed in bird species conservation 
monitoring.  A  complex  network  structure  is  not  conducive  for  deploying  bird  sound  recognition  devices, 
resulting in problems such as long inference time and low efficiency. Using AlexNet as the backbone model, we 
explore the potential of shallow and straightforward models without complex connection techniques or attention 
mechanisms, named SIAlex, to recognise and classify 20 bird sound datasets, which are simultaneously validated 
on  a  10  class  UrbanSound8k  dataset.  Using  the  structural  re-parameterization  method,  the  number  of  model 
layers  is  reduced,  computational  efficiency  is  improved,  and  the  inference  time  is  significantly  reduced, 
achieving a decoupling of training and inference time in the structure. To increase the nonlinearity of the model,

complexity. This helps solve the problems of model training time and 
computing  resources.  Shazzadul  Islam  et  al.  (Islam  et  al.,  2019)  used 
VGG-16  to  extract  features  from  bird  images  and  then  used  support 
vector machines for classification, achieving an accuracy of 89%. The 
ResNet network (He et al., 2016) optimises the network through residual 
modules by introducing skip connections between the traditional con-
volutional layers. This enables the network to learn and retain low-level 
feature  information  better,  thereby  avoiding  gradient  vanishing  and 
representation bottlenecks. Sankupellay et al. (Sankupellay and Kono-
valov,  2018)  used  ResNet-50  to  automatically  recognise  the  spectro-
grams of 46 bird songs with an accuracy of 60%–72%.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It could be hosted on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket, but without further information, it cannot be determined exactly where the code repository resides.
