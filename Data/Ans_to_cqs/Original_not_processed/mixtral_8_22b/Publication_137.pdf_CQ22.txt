2. Model training: We process data with a deep neural
network and adjust the training epoch, batch size, and
volume size to output a classiﬁer for prediction.
3. Result output: The point cloud test set is segmented,
and we can obtain the ﬁnal segmentation results. The
output ﬁles include point cloud geometric partition
graphs, SPGs, and segmentation results.

Results and Discussion

overall accuracy (OA) as metrics. We adjusted three
parameters (voxel size is the voxelization subsampling
size, the regularization strength inﬂuences the coarseness
of the minimal partition, and batch size means the batch
number of point cloud samples in training). We used the
hold-out method to distinguish the test set and the training
set at a ratio of 3:7 for preprocessing the original data. We
further adjust the parameters of networks to explore the

inﬂuence of parameters on experimental results, and we
discuss the selection of the frame parameters.

Selection of the Frame Parameters

We investigated the effects of several parameters in our
framework, such as the regularization strength, voxel size
for the minimal partition, and training batch size. In

training, we set the learning decay rate to 0.7 so that the
learning rate gradually decays as the training progresses.
Table 1 shows the experimental results in which we ﬁxed
the voxel size and batch size and adjusted the regulariza-
tion strength, from which we can be told that result is better
while regularization strength is 0.2.

We segment point clouds based on contextual infor-
mation by classifying the superpoint’s embedding vector
and its surroundings in the GCN. The approach builds with
gated graph neural networks and edge-conditioned convo-
lutions (ECCs). A GRU is a kind of RNN and is used as the
input gate because it can learn to ignore contextual infor-
mation and pay more attention to special features if the
class state is highly certain. An ECC is an operation on
graph-structured data that can process the value of con-
tinuous attributes with the MLP and dynamically generate
ﬁlter weights conditioned on the edge labels. The MLP
consists of 4 layers (widths 32, 128, 64, 32) with ReLUs.
We used Adam in the training, and batch normalization is
used in the networks as well as ReLUs (Ioffe & Szegedy,
2015).

Helpful Answer:
The overall accuracy (OA) is used as a metric to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this study. This metric measures how often the model's predictions match the actual values in the dataset. Other common evaluation metrics for deep learning models include precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the curve (AUC), but these were not mentioned in the given context.
