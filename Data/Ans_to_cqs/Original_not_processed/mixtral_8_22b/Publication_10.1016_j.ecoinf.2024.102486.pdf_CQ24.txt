Algorithm 2. Hidden State Projection Kernel. 

In Algorithm 2, a locally stored variable (using registers or shared 
memory) is distinguished from the version stored in global memory by 
the subscripts LM, and GM, respectively. By  storing variables  such as 
seeds for random number generation locally, we avoid needing to up-
date the value in global memory (which has a high read/write latency) 
every time we wish to generate a random number.

et al., 2022) are likely to reduce overall compute time by allowing each 
thread  to  produce  a  sample  independently.  However,  as  these  algo-
rithms are only asymptotically unbiased, they may not be optimal for 
applications  that  require  resampling  from  highly  skewed  probability 
distributions, as these will necessitate many iterations to produce suf-
ficiently unbiased samples, increasing compute time.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
One strategy to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, specifically regarding random seed values, is to store seeds for random number generation locally instead of updating them in global memory every time a random number is generated. This approach is mentioned in Algorithm 2, referred to as the Hidden State Projection Kernel, which distinguishes between locally stored variables and those stored in global memory using subscripts LM and GM, respectively. Storing variables like seeds locally reduces the need to update their values in global memory, which typically has a higher read/write latency. This method can potentially decrease overall compute time, especially when generating multiple random numbers during the training process.
