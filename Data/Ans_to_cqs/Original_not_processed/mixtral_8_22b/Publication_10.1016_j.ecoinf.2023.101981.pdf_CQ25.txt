4. Discussion

Future  studies  that  aim  to  decrease  the  error  rate  of  algorithms 
developed  using  Kaleidoscope  may  create  advanced  recognizers  after 
manually labeling the events. Likewise, more research should evaluate 
the feasibility of using more sophisticated methods for automated cattle 
detection,  such  as  convolutional  neural  networks  or  deep  learning 

(Gupta et al., 2021; Stowell et al., 2019). Indeed, the development of 
supervised machine learning algorithms has already proven to be very 
effective for ungulate detection (Avots et al., 2022).

is the FFT window size. We opted for a larger FFT window size, which 
should  improve  the  resolution  at  lower  frequencies  on  which  cows 
vocalize. Finally, while Karmiris et al. (2021) used the same settings for 
detecting  the  three  ungulate  species  (e.g.,  their  minimum  frequency 
introduced  for  detecting  cow  vocalization  was  much  higher,  500  Hz, 
than the mean minimum frequency measured in our dataset, approxi-
mately 250 Hz), we fitted cow-specific parameters in the model, which 
could also partly explain why our model detected a much larger number 
of cow vocalizations.

Our  study  provides  strong  evidence  on  the  effectiveness  of  using 
automated  signal  recognition  software  for  detecting  ungulates  (see 
Avots et al., 2022). The method we followed required manual validation 
of the ROIs detected by Kaleidoscope Pro, which is time consuming and 
could  be  a  clear  limitation  for  further  research.  However,  we  only 
reviewed ROIs within clusters with a high probability of containing cow 
vocalization, which reduced the number of ROIs to be reviewed by up to 
98.9%. Furthermore, Kaleidoscope Pro was able to automatically detect 
74.5% of cow calls within the validation dataset, which was a recall rate 
that was nearly four times higher than previously published for cattle 
detection research when using the same software (19.1%, Karmiris et al., 
2021) and was also higher than the results of an algorithm developed to 
detect  goat  /  sheep  calls  (21.2%,  Karmiris  et  al.,  2021)  and  three

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in this context is not explicitly stated. However, based on the information given, it can be inferred that the model is designed for object detection, specifically for detecting cow vocalizations. This is supported by the mention of using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Deep Learning methods for automated cattle detection, and the use of Kaleidoscope Pro software for automatic detection of cow calls. Additionally, the text mentions the need for manual validation of Regions of Interest (ROIs) detected by Kaleidoscope Pro, suggesting that the model generates potential areas where cow vocalizations might occur, which then require human verification. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model serves the purpose of detecting cow vocalizations in audio data.
