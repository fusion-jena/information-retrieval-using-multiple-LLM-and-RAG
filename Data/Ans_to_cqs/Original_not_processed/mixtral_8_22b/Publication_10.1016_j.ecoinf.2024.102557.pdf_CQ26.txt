analytical  methods and  modeling tools  are needed to  deal with  these 
challenges (Tan et al., 2006). Over the past years, the field of artificial 
intelligence and machine learning has enabled significant advances in

resolution at the landscape scale. To achieve this, we use predictive models based on machine learning algo-
rithms and a fungal database resulting from the sampling of more than 100 permanent sampling plots over 20 
years. We estimate that current and future productivity patterns differ among species, under different climate 
change scenarios and bioclimatic regions. Our results suggest that optimal productivity areas may be shifted to 
higher  elevations,  making  those  species  with  higher  productivity  at  higher  elevations  the  most  affected  by 
climate change. This would mean that some species with high socioeconomic value, such as Lactarius deliciosus 
and Boletus edulis, could be negatively affected in their total productivity in the study area. This study highlights 
the need to anticipate the potential effects of climate change on fungal productivity and in particular on high

Helpful Answer:
The papers cited do not directly discuss specific techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, they provide insights into various aspects of applying machine learning and deep learning in ecology and biodiversity research. Some general approaches to handling data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes or features within each set. Oversampling is a technique where samples from minority classes are duplicated to balance the class distribution, while undersampling removes samples from majority classes to achieve the same goal. Diverse data collection aims to gather data from multiple sources or environments to reduce bias caused by limited sampling locations or conditions.

While these techniques can help mitigate data bias, it is essential to consider domain-specific factors when selecting appropriate strategies. For instance, in ecological studies, spatial autocorrelation and temporal dependencies might require specialized preprocessing techniques to ensure unbiased model performance. Additionally, careful consideration should be given to ethical implications, such as ensuring fair representation of all relevant species or ecosystems.
