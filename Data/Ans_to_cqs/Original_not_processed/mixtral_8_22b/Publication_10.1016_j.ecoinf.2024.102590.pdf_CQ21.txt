The supervised learning workflow adheres to the steps outlined in 
Sections 2.3.1–2.3.5. However, as detailed in Section 2.3.2, we deviated 
by not generating 400 random points over the entire boundary. Instead, 
we used the vegetation types described by Gertenbach (1983) to guide 
the placement of our sampling plots, from which we then collected the 
training and validation points (Fig. A.2). The creation of several small 
sampling plots within each vegetation type, instead of using one large 
area, also helped speed up the sampling process. Performing the data 
collection  within  the  sampling  plots  ensured  that  we  had  training/ 
validation  points  that  were  representative  of  the  diverse  vegetation 
within each boundary. To determine the size of the sampling plots, we 
first calculated 5% of the total area covered by the boundary, divided 
that area by the number of vegetation types intersecting the boundary

2.3.1. Data upload and script preparation 

To perform a land cover (LC) classification, GEE requires two initial 
inputs:  an  aerial  image  and  the  boundary  of  the  area  of  interest.  We 
uploaded the subplot boundary and the aerial images of each subplot as 
GEE  assets.  Once  the  assets  were  imported  into  our  JavaScript-based 
program,  the  training/validation  datasets  could  be  created.  Since  we 
were interested in extracting the woody cover, we divided our training 
point features into two cover classes: ‘non-woody’ (LC property = 1) and 
‘woody’  (LC  property  = 2).  Woody  cover  was  considered  to  be  all 
vegetation  with  woody  stems  (i.e.,  excluding  grasses  and  forbs), 
including  trees  that  were  shrubby  (i.e.,  multi-stemmed)  and  short  in

To develop the supervised learning workflow to classify the woody 
cover from the B&W aerial images we used GEE and applied the OBIA 
methodology.  The  classification  workflow  to  obtain  the  OBIA  woody 
cover classification is divided into five steps: (1) data upload and script 
preparation  (Section  2.3.1),  (2)  training/validation  dataset  (Section 
2.3.2), (3) image segmentation (2.3.3), (4) woody cover classification 
(Section 2.3.4), and (5) accuracy, export, and land cover count (Section 
2.3.5). An example of the GEE script is included in the Supplementary 
material.

Helpful Answer:
After the model training, there are several postprocessing steps involved in the supervised learning workflow. These steps are outlined in Sections 2.3.1-2.3.5. Specifically, Section 2.3.5 details the accuracy, export, and land cover count processes.

Accuracy assessment is crucial to evaluate the performance of the trained model. This involves calculating metrics such as overall accuracy, producer's accuracy, and user's accuracy. These metrics can be found in Table 3 for each photo job. Additionally, a confusion matrix can be generated to visualize the performance of the model.

Exporting the results is another important step in the postprocessing phase. In this case, the classified woody cover map was exported as a GeoTIFF file. This allows for further analysis and integration with other geospatial data.

Finally, land cover counts were performed on the classified woody cover map. This involved counting the number of pixels belonging to each land cover class within the study area. This information can provide valuable insights into the distribution and abundance of different land cover types.
