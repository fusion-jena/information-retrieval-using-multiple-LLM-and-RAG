train a Siamese network using fewer samples, resulting in high accuracy. 
As the training dataset contained an insufficient number of samples, we 
used  the  few-shot  learning  method  to  train  the  network.  Herein,  the 
classification task was defined as the N-way K-shot problem, where the 
training  set  contained  N  different  categories  with  each  category 
comprising K labeled samples. Two categories were defined during the 
training  of  the  tracking  tasks:  target  and  non-target.  Based  on  the 
training pairs assigned to the labels, experiments were performed using 
two-way one-shot learning(Cheng et al., 2021).

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information regarding the use of specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is common practice in deep learning models to employ these techniques to improve generalization performance and avoid overfitting. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent complex co-adaptations on training data. On the other hand, L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function based on the sum of squares of weights, encouraging smaller weight values and reducing model complexity. Other popular regularization methods include early stopping, data augmentation, and batch normalization. While the given context does not mention any of these methods explicitly, they could still be employed within the described deep learning pipeline to address potential overfitting issues.
