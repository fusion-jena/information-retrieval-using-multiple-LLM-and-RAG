On the same dataset, Wang et al. (Wang et al., 2020a) developed an 
encoder–decoder  based  deep-learning  model  to  estimate  seagrass 
coverage and achieved an mIoU of 90.66%. Perez et al. (Perez et al., 
2020) mapped seagrass distribution by applying a deep capsule network 
(DCN) and a deep CNN from the ‘WorldView-2’ satellite images at three 
different coastal locations in Florida. They showed that DCN and CNN 
models  performed  similarly.  They  also  demonstrated  that  these  two 
models performed significantly better than linear regression and support 
vector  machine-based  models.  Also,  in  2020,  Antoni  Burguera  (Bur-
guera,  2020)  mapped  Posidonia  oceanica  seagrass  by  developing  two 
neural networks (NNs); a convolutional layer based NN model achieved 
a precision of 97%, a recall of 95.4% and an accuracy of 95.5% on their 
dataset.  Burguera  (Long  et  al.,  2015)  visualised  the  patches  of

(of 94.5%) using the deep learning–based CNN model. Martin-Abadal 
et  al.  (Martin-Abadal  et  al.,  2018)  estimated  seagrass  meadows  by 
applying  an  encoder  decoder-based  model  (VGG16FCN8).  They  ach-
ieved a precision of 96.57% and an accuracy of 96.81% on their dataset. 
Meanwhile,  Weidmann et  al.  (Weidmann et  al., 2019) found  that the 
deep  learning–based  DeepLabv3+ model  achieves  the  highest  perfor-
mance  (with  a  mean  intersection  over  union  (mIoU)  of  87.78%) 
compared  to  the  fully  convolutional  networks,  dilated  convolution 
networks (dilNets) and U-Net on the ‘LookingForSeagrass’ dataset.

Recently,  attention  has  focused  on  machine  learning  and  deep- 
learning algorithms to achieve these goals. Deep learning is a branch 
of machine learning and uses algorithms inspired by the function and 
structure of neural networks in the human brain (LeCun et al., 2015). An 
important  part  of  machine  learning  is  feature  engineering,  which  in-
creases  accuracy  and  requires  expertise  in  the  specific  domain  of  the 
problem. The deep learning approaches can perform feature engineering 
independently  by  itself  (Goodfellow  et  al.,  2016;  Jalali  et  al.,  2022). 
Deep-learning are providing state-of-the-art performances of computer 
vision tasks such as classification, detection or segmentation (Kamilaris 
and Prenafeta-Boldu, 2018; Pouyanfar et al., 2018).

A deep-learning model trained using a dataset from one location does 
not  generalise  to  other  locations  owing  to  the  data  distribution  shift 
problem. Some researchers have mitigated the issue of data distribution 
shifts in different locations. For example, Islam et al. (Islam et al., 2019), 
developed a domain adaptation model by utilising a generative adver-
sarial network that aligns marginal data distribution between the target 

and source domains.

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not directly address the strategy for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing the impact of random seed values. However, it discusses various aspects related to deep learning applications in mapping seagrass coverage and distribution.

Randomness in deep learning pipelines often arises due to factors like initializing weights randomly, shuffling training datasets, dropout regularization techniques, etc. To manage this randomness, several strategies can be employed:

1. Fixed Random Seeds: One common approach is setting fixed random seeds during development and testing phases. This ensures consistency across multiple runs, making results reproducible and comparable.

2. Multiple Runs with Different Seeds: Another method involves running experiments multiple times with different random seeds. Averaging the performance metrics from these runs provides a more robust evaluation of the model's effectiveness.

3. Cross-Validation: Using cross-validation techniques helps reduce variability caused by random splits of the dataset into training and validation sets. K-fold cross-validation is commonly used where the original sample is randomly partitioned into k equal sized subsamples.

4. Ensemble Methods: Combining predictions from multiple models trained with different random seeds can improve overall performance and stability. Techniques include bagging, boosting, stacking, etc.

While these strategies help manage randomness, they do not eliminate its presence entirely. It's important to acknowledge that some degree of randomness is inherent in many deep learning processes.
