Individual  mangrove  trees,  low  shrubs,  and  other  classes  were 
labelled  manually  on  the  BEV  images,  and  the  BEV  images  with 
bounding  box  labels  were  used  to  train  the  Faster  R-CNN  detector. 
During the detector operation, the Faster R-CNN network with a Resnet- 
101 backend was trained for 20,000 iterations using Stochastic Gradient 
Descent (with momentum), with a learning rate of 0.003, momentum of 
0.9,  and  a  batch  size  of  1.  The  network  was  initialised  with  weights 
developed from training based on the MS COCO dataset.  

(2)  Individual Tree Detection and Segmentation.

Yin  and  Wang  (2019)  used  traditional  MCWS  and  RG  algorithms  to 
segment  individual  mangrove  trees  based  on  a  LiDAR-derived  CHM. 
When  the  traditional  algorithm  was  applied  to  relatively  dense 
mangrove  plots,  individual-tree  segmentation  results  were  relatively 
poor, with an accuracy of <35%. Deep learning (DL), an emerging data 
mining technology, is widely used in image object detection and seg-
mentation research (Hussain and Badola, 2010). Jin et al. (2018) used 
three-dimensional  (3D)  convolutional  neural  networks  (CNNs)  to 
segment  individual  plants  in  maize  plots  using  ground-based  LiDAR 
data. DL achieved good results, with R, P, and F values above 0.9 for the 
three experimental sites with different planting densities. Wang et al. 
(2019a) used the R-CNN method for individual rubber tree segmentation 
based on ground-based light detection and ranging data. Segmentation

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide information about specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some common practices include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility or employing techniques like cross-validation and ensemble methods to reduce the impact of randomness on model performance.

Based on the given context, it can be observed that deep learning techniques have been utilized for various applications, including individual tree crown segmentation directly from UAV-borne LiDAR data using the PointNet of deep learning (Chen et al., 2021) and monitoring landscape changes using drones (Do et al., 2022). In these studies, the Faster R-CNN network with a Resnet-101 backend was trained for 20,000 iterations using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with a learning rate of 0.003, momentum of 0.9, and a batch size of 1 (Do et al., 2022). Although no explicit mention of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline is made, it can be assumed that standard practices, such as setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, might have been followed during the implementation of these models.
