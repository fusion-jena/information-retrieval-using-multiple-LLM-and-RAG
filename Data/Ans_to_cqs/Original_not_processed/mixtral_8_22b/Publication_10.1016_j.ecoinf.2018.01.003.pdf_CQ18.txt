the short time series of an EF calculation is considered a small sample
test object, we will choose the fast learning and weak generalization
Gaussian kernel function to address the nonlinear relationships among
the variables and to simplify the diﬃculty of modeling using relatively
few parameters. All the advantages previously mentioned enable the
SVM method to eﬀectively overcome the high-dimensional problem
(Chapelle et al., 2002; Chapelle and Vapnik, 2000; Dong et al., 2003).
Given a training dataset of EF, D = {(x1, y1)…(xi, yi), xϵRn, yϵR}, where i
is the number of samples, the EF is a function of the impact indexes as
follows:

work (Leng et al., 2017; Pouteau et al., 2011; Quej et al., 2017; Vapnik,
1995). Therefore, in this paper, the comparison between the BPNN
model which is widely used in the neural network and the SVM model
which can make up for the shortage of the neural network is conducted
to seek a more suitable prediction model for the EF by taking the ad-
vantages of both.

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it discusses the use of Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) models for Ecological Footprint (EF) calculations. Typically, when working with these types of models, strategies such as cross-validation or monitoring metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score are employed to evaluate their performance during training. Cross-validation involves splitting the data into multiple folds and iteratively fitting the model on different subsets while evaluating its performance on the remaining subset. This helps prevent overfitting and provides a better understanding of how well the model might perform on unseen data. Monitoring metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score help assess the model's effectiveness in making correct predictions and handling false positives/negatives. Without further information from the given context, one cannot definitively state the exact strategy used to monitor the model performance during training.
