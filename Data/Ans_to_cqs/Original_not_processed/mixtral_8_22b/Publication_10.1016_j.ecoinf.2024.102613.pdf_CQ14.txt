Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no mention or indication of how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. The context discusses various aspects of a smart farming system, including categories like farm management information systems, precision agriculture, agricultural automation and robotics, and different data analytics techniques such as machine learning, deep learning, statistical-based models, mathematical models, and geospatial analysis. However, it does not provide any specific details about the optimization of hyperparameters for these models. Therefore, without additional information, we cannot determine which method was used to optimize the hyperparameters of the model.
