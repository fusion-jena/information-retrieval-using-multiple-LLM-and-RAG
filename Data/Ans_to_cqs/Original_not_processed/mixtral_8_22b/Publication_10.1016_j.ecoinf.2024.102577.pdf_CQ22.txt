3.2. Performance of the models and forecast distribution 

The  mean  accuracies  and  standard  deviations  of  the  5  × 10-fold 
cross-validations  for  each  method  and  species  are  shown  in  Table  4. 
Random Forest is the method that achieves the highest accuracy for all 
the analysed species (0.718 for SKJ, 0.728 for YFT, 0.589 for BET and 
0.842 for FAL). Consequently, this is the method that has been used to 
build the prediction models. 

A  model  has  been  trained  for  each  species,  by  using  the  selected 
variables in Table 3. Then, for each model, the probabilities of finding 
high and low catches and absences of each species in the study area have 
been predicted by using the corresponding predictors given in Table 3. 
The results of the validation of the trained models are shown in Table 5,

most  to  the  characterisation  of  the  four  species  studied  are  silicate, 
phosphate,  and  nitrate  concentrations  at  different  depths.  A  common 
predictor for the three tropical tunas is the oxygen concentration inte-
grated  at  the  first  50  m.  In  addition,  surface  oxygen  concentration  is 
selected for SKJ, whereas for YFT oxygen concentration just below the 
surface (10 m) is selected. By contrast, for BET oxygen concentration in 
deeper layers (down to 175 m) is highlighted. Trophic variables related 
to food availability and energy transfer efficiency, such as chlorophyll 
concentration integrated at 20 m and 50 m are selected for YFT and SKJ. 
Similarly, chlorophyll fronts are selected in the case of SKJ. In the case of 
the oceanographic processes that have been analysed, thermocline (also 
related  with  the  water  temperature  influence)  intensity  has  been 
selected for SKJ and YFT, but not for BET. For the silky shark, the mixed

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide information on the specific evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the deep learning model. However, it mentions that Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy for all analyzed species. Therefore, we can infer that one of the metrics used to evaluate the model's performance was accuracy. Other commonly used evaluation metrics for deep learning models include precision, recall, F1 score, and Area Under Curve (AUC), among others. Without additional information, it cannot be determined if these or other metrics were also employed.
