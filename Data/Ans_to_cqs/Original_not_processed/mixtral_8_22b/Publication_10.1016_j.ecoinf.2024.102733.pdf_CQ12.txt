Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

The MLP employed consists of four fully connected layers with the
size of 256, 128, 64, and 12, each comprising a linear layer followed by
PRelu as non-linearity. Only the third layer differs, as it is provided with
Batch Normalization (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015). During optimization,
Batch Normalization was also applied to other layers as well, but the
network performance was not as good. The network gets the input of size
512 consisting of learned features extracted from the diffusion model
and the last layer has 12 neurons. The maximum neuron value from this
layer is then used for predicting the event class, as each neuron corre-
sponds to one of the events. The values of the 12 neurons are then
compared to the real event ground truth through a loss, which serves to
update the model parameters and perform the training.

Once the latent representations were extracted from the Autoencoder
model, an MLP was trained for the classification of fish events.
Throughout the training of MLP, Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba,
2015) with the learning rate modified by a scheduler when the network
reaches a plateau was used. The MLP was trained for several epochs with
various parameter configurations and regularization techniques,
including both Cross-Entropy and Focal Loss, in line with the proposed
method. As regularization techniques, weight decay, batch normaliza-
tion (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015), and dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014)
were explored. In particular, batch normalization (Ioffe and Szegedy,
2015) was tested on each layer of the network separately and on all
layers simultaneously, with the best results achieved when applied to
the third layer. Dropout has been applied to the input layer, the hidden
layers, and all layers, yielding various results in combination with other

This suggests that features learned from raw trajectories (especially
through unsupervised pre-training) can be preferable to hand-crafted
features.

2.2. Diffusion models

Diffusion models, a type of generative deep learning model, have
demonstrated potential across a range of computer vision tasks,
encompassing image generation (Liu et al., 2023), denoising (Saharia
et al., 2022), and segmentation (Gu et al., 2024). Later on, these models
have been extended to tackle discriminative tasks such as image clas-
sification (Yang and Wang, 2023), object detection (Chen et al., 2023),
and anomaly detection in videos (Tur et al., 2023a; Tur et al., 2023b),
showing very promising results.

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, two types of deep learning models are mentioned: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Autoencoder. However, there is no explicit mention of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers.

The main focus of the text is on the use of an MLP for the classification of fish events. This MLP consists of four fully connected layers with sizes 256, 128, 64, and 12. Each layer includes a linear layer followed by PRelu as non-linearity, except for the third layer, which is provided with Batch Normalization. The network receives an input of size 512, consisting of learned features extracted from a diffusion model, and its final layer contains 12 neurons. The maximum neuron value from this layer is used for predicting the event class.

Additionally, the context mentions using an Autoencoder model to extract latent representations before feeding them into the MLP for classification. However, the specific architecture of the Autoencoder is not detailed.

Therefore, based on the provided information, the primary deep learning models used in the described pipeline are the MLP and Autoencoder. There is no clear indication of the use of CNN, RNN, or Transformer models.
