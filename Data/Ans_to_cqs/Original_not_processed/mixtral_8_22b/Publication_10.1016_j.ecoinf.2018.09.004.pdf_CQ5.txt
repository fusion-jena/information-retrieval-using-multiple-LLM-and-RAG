explicit or expanded database is being used.

The ﬁnal step is to train and test the machine learning algorithms in
this dataset for 5-class classiﬁcation. Stratiﬁed cross-validation was
used, and evaluated with Precision, Recall and F-measure. This dataset
is not balanced as can be seen in Table 1. Cymodocea is the dominant
class that constitutes the 75% of the dataset. Thus, Accuracy may not be
a suitable measure, because it measures how many correct predictions
were made overall, and if we predict all the test examples as cymo-
docea, then Accuracy would be close to 75% without even predicting
another class. This is clearly a problem because many machine learning
algorithms are designed to maximize overall Accuracy, with the ex-
ception of the tree-based algorithms. So, we resort to the F-measure; the
algorithms are ranked based on it.

By determining which variables are most important we can simplify
the analysis of a dataset, better understand the physical concepts of it,
and exclude the ones that confuse the model achieving better accuracy
and learning/testing speed.

There exist several ways to determine variable importance, e.g.
Decision Trees, Random Forests, Chi-square, and Regression. We deal
with tree-based variable importance, like (Arthur et al., 2010) did. It

environmental drivers, expressed as water temperature, salinity, nu-
trients,
transparency; ecosystem components, as bathymetry and
bottom substrate; and the human inﬂuence, described by the distance to
cities, ports and river outﬂows have not been previously reported. In
this work we attempt to explore the nonlinear dynamics among the
environment-ecosystem-human gradient and their impact on seagrass
presence and distribution in the Mediterranean Sea. To achieve this, we
utilized the power of machine learning algorithms when applied to
large and diverse datasets maintained by international organizations, as
Copernicus, EMODnet and UNEP. The importance of such work, and
others of similar context could be vital, as there is a real need for un-
derstanding better coastal benthic processes and human interaction,
especially for the Mediterranean Sea, where seagrass loss correlates
with the rapid shoreline urbanization and remedial and restoration

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that large and diverse datasets from international organizations such as Copernicus, EMODnet, and UNEP were utilized. These datasets likely contain environmental data related to water temperature, salinity, nutrients, transparency, bathymetry, bottom substrate, and distances to cities, ports, and river outflows. The goal was to explore the nonlinear dynamics between environment, ecosystem, and human influence on seagrass presence and distribution in the Mediterranean Sea. Therefore, these datasets might include various types of geospatial and ecological data relevant to marine environments.
