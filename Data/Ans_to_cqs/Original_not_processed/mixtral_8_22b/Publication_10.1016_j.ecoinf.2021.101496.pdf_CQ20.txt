Furthermore, the GLM approach applied on the dataset also achieved 
significant  results  (Table  5),  although  only  slightly  better  than  LM. 
Artificial R-squared = 0.81 on training data reached the same level as by 
LM; nevertheless, lower mean absolute deviance of testing data = 1.79

value gained by SPAD-502Plus (Fig. 6). Furthermore, modelling of the 
SPAD  value  was  performed  by  a)  a  simple  linear  model  (LM),  b)  a 
generalized linear model with a gamma distribution (GLM), and c) an 
artificial neural network (ANN). The dataset contained 89 valid records 
(outliers were removed according to the empirical rule), while one re-
cord represented the mean value of the total 10 spot measurements on 
one  leaf.  For  the  purpose  of  SPAD  value  modelling,  the  dataset  was 
divided  into  a  “training  dataset”  containing  60  randomly  selected  re-
cords and a “testing dataset” that contained the remaining 29 records. 
All three models were then fitted using the “training dataset” and further 
validated using the “testing dataset”.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of which hardware resources were used for training the deep learning model. However, we can infer from Table 1 that the Raspberry Pi 3B+ was used for developing the Rasp2SPAD prototype. This device has an ARM Broadcom Quad-Core BCM2837B0 processor running at 1.4 GHz and 1GB of RAM. It does not have any dedicated GPU or TPU for accelerating machine learning tasks. Therefore, it can be assumed that the deep learning model was trained using this CPU and RAM configuration.
