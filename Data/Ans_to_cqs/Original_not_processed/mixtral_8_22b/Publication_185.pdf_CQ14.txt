that  it  is  feasible  to  use  a  small  amount  of  data  to  train  deep  learning  models,  which  could  have  wide 
applicability in the image recognition field.

factor  of  10  every  69  iterations  and  training  was  stopped  after  6900  iterations.  The  number  of 
units in the third fully connected layer (fc3) was changed according to the number of classes of 
training data. We set the batch size to 69 and momentum to 0.9 and applied L2 weight decay with 
penalty multiplier set to 5 × 10-4, dropout ratio set to 0.5, CPU mode

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, such as using methods like grid search or random search. However, some details regarding certain hyperparameter values can be found. For instance, the batch size was set to 69, the momentum was set to 0.9, and the penalty multiplier for L2 weight decay was set to 5 × 10^-4. Additionally, the dropout ratio was set to 0.5, and the model was trained in CPU mode. Unfortunately, without further context, we cannot determine if these hyperparameters were chosen through optimization techniques like grid search or random search.
