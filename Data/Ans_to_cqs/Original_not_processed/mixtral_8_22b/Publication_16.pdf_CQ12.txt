MATERIALS AND METHODS 

In  this  section  the  dataset  used  in  the  study  is  presented 
along with the modelling approach taken and the evaluation 
metrics used to evaluate the trained model. The section also 
discusses data pre-processing using the Librosa library. Keras 
and TensorFlow 2.2 are utilised as the backend and an Nvidia 
2070 super GPU with 8GB of memory is utilised to accelerate 
model training. In addition, the proposed inferencing pipeline 
is discussed along with the associated technologies.

The  trained  model  is  hosted  using  TensorFlow  2.2  and 
served  through  a  public  facing  website  developed  by  the 
authors 2 .  CUDA  11  and  cuDNN  7.6.5  enables  the  GPU 
accelerated learning aspect of the pipeline. A Samsung S10 is 
used  to  record  garden  birds  and  automatically  upload  the 
acquired audio to the platform using the Simple Mail Transfer 
Protocol (SMTP) for classification. Figure 6 shows the end-
to-end inferencing pipeline starting with the sensor and ending 
with the public facing conservationAI site as shown in Figure 
7.  Due  to  the  use  of  standard  protocols,  the  system  can 
interface  with  a  variety  of  sensors  for  real-time  inference. 
Where in field communication is unavailable, audio files can 
be batch uploaded through the website for offline inferencing.

Inferencing

CNN  approaches  require  a  large  corpus  of  high-quality 
annotated  data  that  can  be  used  to  train  the  network.  Given 
that there is limited availability of publicly available data that 
satisfy this requirement there are currently no viable models 
capable of classifying within species animal types.  Another 
major challenge to overcome is the deployment and automated 
inference  of  acoustic  sensors.  Individually,  sensors  may 
generate  reasonable  amounts  of  data,  but  collectively  the 
amount  of  data  that  needs  to  be  processed  will  increase 
exponentially based on the number of sensors deployed. The 
first challenge relates directly to how the data is obtained. The 
second  is  the  cost  of  compute  needed  to  process  the  data. 
Deploying  trained  models  on  edge  devices  for  real-time 
inferencing will take some consideration which has not been 
sufficiently  reported  in  the  literature.  Centralising  inference

The  acquired  audio  files  are  transmitted  over  4G  using 
SMTP. The audio file is segmented into 15 second windows. 
Each of the sample windows are passed to the feature extractor 
function where MFCC is used to return the extracted features 
for the classifier. The predicted vector is processed and logged 
to the site for review.

EVALUATION AND DISCUSSION 

In this section the classification results are presented using 
the  evaluation  metrics  outlined  previously.  The  deployment 
and inferencing of the trained model in test environment are 
also presented to ascertain the effectiveness of the end-to-end 
pipeline.

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given information, it is not explicitly stated what specific type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline. However, it does mention that Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approaches are required for a large corpus of high-quality annotated data. This suggests that a CNN might be utilized in their pipeline, although it could also mean they considered using one due to its requirements. Unfortunately, without more explicit details about the architecture or methodology employed, we cannot definitively determine if a CNN, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Transformer, or another type of deep learning model was used in the pipeline.
