dataset  contains  638  images,  divided  into  seven  categories,  with  510 
images for training and  128 for testing. The trash-ICRA19 dataset in-
cludes 1144 images across three categories, with 915 images for training 
and 229 for testing. The VisDrone dataset is selected as part of the Tiny 
Target Dataset and comprises 1610 images categorized into 12 classes. 
The training set consists of 1288 images, while the test set contains 332 
images. NWPU VHR-10 and HRSID are small target datasets for remote 
sensing. The NWPU VHR-10 dataset includes 800 images with ten cat-
egories, and the training and test sets consist of 640 and 160 images, 
respectively. The HRSID dataset contains 5604 images in one category, 
and the training and test sets comprise 4483 and 1121 images, respec-
tively. By testing YWnet on these diverse datasets, we aimed to assess its 
performance in various scenarios, including marine environments and 
detecting tiny target objects in remote sensing.

To extract the input information, the SRC3 block employs a parallel 
analysis  of  the  input  feature  map  using  two  convolution  kernels.  In 
contrast to the C3 block, the SRC3 block incorporates two convolution 
kernels prior to the input of the bottleneck block. One of the kernels is 
responsible  for  halving  the  dimension  of  the  feature  map,  while  the 
other  maintains  the  dimension  unchanged.  This  approach  allows  for 
more  comprehensive  processing  of  the  input  features,  enabling  the 
model  to  capture  both  high-level  semantic  information  and  preserve 
relevant details during the feature extraction process. The convolution 
kernel size utilized is 3 × 3, which leads to a broader receptive field of 
information and richer characteristics compared to the 1 × 1 convolu-
tion kernel. The output semantic information can be augmented by the 
action of two convolution kernels. The information output from the first

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no explicit mention or reference to any specific data repository links related to the deep learning pipeline discussed. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct answer to this query. It would require additional information or resources to accurately determine the relevant data repository link.

Based on the context, it appears that several datasets were used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model called YWnet. These datasets include the trash-ICRA19 dataset, the VisDrone dataset, the NWPU VHR-10 dataset, and the HRSID dataset. However, the context does not provide any information about where these datasets can be accessed or downloaded.

It is important to note that when sharing research findings, researchers often publish their code and datasets on platforms such as GitHub, Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. However, without further information or access to the original research paper or documentation, it is impossible to determine if the authors have shared their deep learning pipeline or datasets on any of these platforms.

Therefore, I recommend searching for the original research paper or contacting the authors directly to obtain more information about the availability of the deep learning pipeline and associated datasets.
