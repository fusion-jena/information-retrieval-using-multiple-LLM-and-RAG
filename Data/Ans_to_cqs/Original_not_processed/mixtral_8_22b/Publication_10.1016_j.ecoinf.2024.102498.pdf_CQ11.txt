An alternative approach to enhancing the accuracy of LULC maps is 
to leverage deep learning techniques. These techniques operate patch- 
wise,  where  each  patch  incorporates  sophisticated  features  extracted 
from satellite imagery. This enables them to recognize intricate patterns 
effectively.  Particularly,  Convolutional  Neural  Networks  (CNNs)  are 
highly  effective  for  LULC  classification.  These  models  automatically

Despite the powerful capabilities of the GEE, which provides a wide 
range of functionalities for spatial data analysis, processing, and inter-
pretation, this research encountered multiple limitations when using it 
for  classification.  These  limitations  include  computational  time  con-
straints, data processing  volume, and the combination of various fea-
tures  within  the  platform.  In  cases  where  the  study  area  is  vast,  the 
model training process requires many sample points to ensure training 
data  completeness.  When  dealing  with  complex  LULC  schemes,  using 
high-resolution  imagery  and  combining  various  spectral  features  and 
indices  becomes  essential.  Moreover,  in  such  complex  scenarios, 
adjusting the parameters of ML models is also necessary. It is not always 
possible to handle a USGS 24 classification process for a large area with a 
high-capacity model by employing a high volume of sample data. For
