Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Deep   learning   might   ultimately   be   leveraged   in   many   ways   for   many   diﬀerent   types   of
NHCs.   Here,   we   focus   on   the   digitized   portion   (currently   1.2   million   specimens)   of   the
United States National Herbarium. Our analyses, focused on the detection of specimens
previously treated with mercury and the discrimination of superﬁcially similar plant families,
are complementary to those recently published on species identiﬁcation (Carranza-Rojas et
al. 2017) and further demonstrate how CNNs might be used to learn more from NHCs.

Question: %INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the provided pieces of context to answer the query in less than 400 words. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

%Query
Query: "What is the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The article does not provide information about the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not have the necessary information to provide an accurate response.
