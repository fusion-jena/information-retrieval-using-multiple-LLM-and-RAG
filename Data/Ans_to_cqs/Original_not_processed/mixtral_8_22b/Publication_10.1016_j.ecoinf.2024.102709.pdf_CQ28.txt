split  data  with  the  highest  mAP50  (0.987)  for  the  prediction  of  our 
model.

To determine the ideal training–test split for our model, we used k- 
fold  cross-validation  (k  = 5,  epochs  = 500,  imagesize  = 640).  The 
epochs provide the number of repetitions for training, and the image size 
is  expressed in  pixels. k-fold  cross-validation  (Rodriguez et  al., 2010) 
was used to determine the best training test set for the model. Hereby, 
the data are split into k different training–test sets. The model was not 
trained on the entire dataset but on each training split. The result was an 
investigation of the best data split. Functions of the Python library scikit- 
learn  (scikit-learn  developers,  2023)  were  used  to  split  the  data  and 
investigate the results of each trained model. In addition, YOLO training 
losses and mAP50 values of each model were investigated. The split with 
the  highest  mAP50  value  indicates  the  highest  number  of  correctly 
predicted labels for the model trained on a specific split. We used the

Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, it cannot be determined from the provided context whether the model was deployed on platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform.
