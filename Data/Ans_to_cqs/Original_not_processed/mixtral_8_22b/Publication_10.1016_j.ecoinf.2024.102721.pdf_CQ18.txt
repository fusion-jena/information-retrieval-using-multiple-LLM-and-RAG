Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

|N|!

[f(S ∪ i) (cid:0)

f(S) ]

(14)

Where Φi is the SHAP value of feature i. The larger the SHAP value,
the greater contribution of the feature to the prediction; S is the set of
features; (S ⊆ N\i)denotes the subset that excludes feature i; N is the set
of all features; f is the prediction function of the model; f(S) is the pre-
diction result of the model on the set of features S; |S| denotes the
number of elements in set S.

2.3.3. LSTM model

The LSTM model is a type of machine learning model that is derived
from recurrent neural networks (RNN). Its special memory unit effec-
tively addresses the issue of gradient vanishing and explosion in RNN for
long-term sequences. The structure of the model is illustrated in Fig. 3.
The LSTM memory unit comprises a forget gate, input gate, output gate,
and hidden layer. Signals are transmitted between different units
through three control gates in the hidden layer, determining which in-
formation should be stored, read, and written. Because of the precise
control of information by gate structures, LSTM can effectively learn in
long time sequences and is well-suited for time series prediction.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of a specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does discuss the use of Bayesian Optimization, which is often employed to optimize hyperparameters in machine learning models like the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model mentioned here. This technique could potentially be utilized to improve the model's performance during training. Additionally, the paper mentions using SHAP values, which help explain the importance of each feature in the model's predictions. These values might also aid in monitoring the model's performance during training indirectly, but this isn't explicitly stated in the provided context.
