time window. These carefully curated datasets were then used for the 
model training process. This process involved an iterative approach to 
extract the weights assigned to the fully connected layers of the model, 
thus enabling the identification and analysis of evolving patterns in the 
weights associated with each specific influencing factor. 

Fig. 3. Monthly- and seasonal-scale drought propagation times for four land cover types. (a) Cropland (b) Forest land (c) Grassland (d) Unused land (e) seasonal 
scale. The width of each violin plot indicates the probability of drought propagation occurring at the corresponding SPEI scale, and the SPEI scale corresponding to 
the maximum probability of propagation in each month, which is the time of drought propagation in that month, is marked by a solid black line.

However, the study also uncovered a nonlinear relationship between 
the reduction in agricultural drought severity and the required extension 
in  drought  propagation  time.  As  the  severity  of  agricultural  drought 
decreases,  the necessary increase in  drought propagation time grows, 
albeit not in a directly proportional manner. For example, in cropland, to 
lessen  agricultural  drought  severity  from  extreme  to  mild,  the  mean 
drought propagation times were calculated at 4.08, 4.42, 5, and 5.75 
months,  necessitating  additional  durations  of  0.34,  0.58,  and  0.75 
months  for  each  level  of  severity  reduction.  Consequently,  these  in-
terventions call for a strategic approach, which involves balancing the 
resource  expenditure  needed  to  extend  drought  propagation  time 
against the benefits derived from reduced agricultural drought severity. 
An  analysis  of  the  probabilities  for  meteorological-to-agricultural

contrast, Grassland and Unutilized land exhibit more extreme drought 
propagation times, primarily between two months and 12 months. In 
addition,  the  few  instances  of  prediction  inaccuracy  with  the  models 
used in this study were concentrated when the actual drought propa-
gation time was 6, 8, or 9 months.

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide explicit information on the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, based on common machine learning practices, some possible criteria include reaching a certain number of epochs, achieving a desired accuracy or loss value, or observing no further improvement in validation loss over several epochs (validation loss plateau). Without specific details about the training process mentioned in the context, it cannot be definitively stated what criteria were used to determine completion.
