Halgamuge et al. (2020) focused on utilizing deep learning to esti-
mate the best optimizer selection methods for wildfire event predictions 
in Australia. They developed an algorithm to collect the data automat-
ically and analyzed six different optimizer models using deep learning 
technology. They concluded that this approach could predict a natural 
disaster, including wildfire events, by investigating historical environ-
mental  conditions  before  and  after  wildfires  occurred  using  the  deep 
learning methodology. Dowdy (2020) focused on demonstrating a sea-
sonal prediction system for wildfire event prediction in Australia. This 
measured  spatio-temporal  variations  and  seasonality  across  several 
datasets  and  utilized  this  methodology  to  predict  wildfire  events, 
focusing on the seasonal predictions using the 2019–2020 wildfire sea-
son  as  an  example  and  measuring  long-term  predictions.  Coen  et  al.

An example of the calculation of NDVI scores is shown in Eqs. (2) and 
(3). A healthy plant could reflect 60% near-infrared light and only 5% 
visible red light, as shown in Eq. (2). However, unhealthy vegetation in 
Eq. (3), such as leaf litter, dried bushes and fallen tree bark, reflects a 
higher volume of visible red light (35%) with a similar or lower volume 
of near-infrared light (60%). 

NDVI =

NIR(cid:0) R
NIR+R

=

0.60 (cid:0) 0.05
0.60 + 0.05

= 0.846,

NDVI =

NIR(cid:0) R
NIR+R

=

0.60 (cid:0) 0.35
0.60 + 0.35

= 0.263,

2.1.4. Descriptive analysis 

In terms of the interpretations of NDVI, the green colour indicates 
high mean NDVI values, while red indicates low mean NDVI scores. It is 
important  to  note  that  dark  red  colours  are  associated  with  negative 
NDVI values, which are returned only when over water (for example, a 
passing river or even a small pool of water on the forest floor). However, 
no significant water structures, such as rivers, lakes, or reserves exists in 
the study area. Since an image was extracted for each month of each 
year, it is possible to compare the density and magnitude of each colour 
across different annual seasons, to assess the health of forest during hot 
and dry months of the year.

To consider the model uncertainty, the models given in Fig. 15 are 
considered  as  the  set  of  models,  Ψ  of  Section  2.2.2.  Then  the  BMA 
approach is implemented. Each model’s prior probability is set to 0.2 to 
give equal chances a priori. The resulting posterior model probabilities, 
P(m| D), and Bayes factors to compare the models are given in Fig. 15. 
Bayes factors can also be interpreted as the improvement in the proba-
bility of occurrence for a given model. This analysis provides insights 
into  which  model  is  most  impactful  in  predicting wildfire  occurrence 
probabilities  and  provides  evidence  on  if  forest  vulnerability  is  the 
dominant  predictor.  The  results  indicate  forest  vulnerability  as  the 
dominant predictor, as this model is 2.5 times more likely to occur based 
on the posterior odds. The model that includes forest vulnerability with 
mean  wind  speed  is  the  second  most  likely, with  2.3  times  improved

Helpful Answer:
The papers referenced do not provide specific information about the evaluation metrics used to measure the performance of their deep learning models. Halgamuge et al. (2020) mentioned developing an algorithm to automatically collect data and analyzing six different optimizer models using deep learning technology but did not specify any particular metric for evaluating these models. Similarly, Dowdy (2020) discussed a seasonal prediction system for wildfire event prediction in Australia without mentioning any specific evaluation metrics. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding the exact metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models in these studies.
