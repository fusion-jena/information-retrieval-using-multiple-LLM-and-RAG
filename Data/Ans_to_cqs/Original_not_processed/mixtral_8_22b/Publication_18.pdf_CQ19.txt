Preliminaries on CNN models for image classification and object detection in images.  Deep 
Neural Networks (DNNs) are a subset of machine learning algorithms able to learn from a training dataset to 
make predictions on new examples called testset. They are built using a hierarchical architecture of increasing 
sophistication, each level of this hierarchy is called layer. One of their main particularities is their capacity to 
extract the existent features from data automatically without the need of external hand crafted features. Under the 
supervised learning paradigm, DNNs provide a powerful framework when trained on a large number of labelled 
samples.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a specialized type of neural networks capable of extracting spatial 
patterns from images. Their architecture is built by staking three main types of layers: (1) convolutional layer, 
which is used to extract features at different levels of the hierarchy, (2) pooling layer, which is essentially a reduc-
tion operation used to increase the abstraction level of the extracted features and (3) fully connected layer, which 
is used as a classifier at the end of the pipeline.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The papers cited do not explicitly mention the specific deep learning frameworks used to build the deep learning models. However, it can be assumed that popular frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch were likely used due to their widespread adoption in the research community. These frameworks offer high-level APIs for building and training deep learning models, making them accessible to researchers and practitioners alike. Additionally, they support GPU acceleration, allowing for faster training times and enabling the development of more complex models. Ultimately, while we cannot definitively state which framework was used in these studies, it is reasonable to infer that one of the commonly used ones was employed.
