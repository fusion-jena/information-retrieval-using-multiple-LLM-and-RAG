5.2. Deep GVI learning 

In  GreenCam,  we  measure  photo  GVI  by  SegFormer  (Xie  et  al., 
2021),  a  state-of-the-art  Transformer-based  model  for  semantic  seg-
mentation. As shown in Fig. 12, SegFormer follows the encoder-decoder 
structure, which combines a Transformer-based encoder (i.e., MiT) with 
a  lightweight  decoder  (i.e.,  ALL-MLP)  that  is  composed  entirely  of 
multilayer perceptron (MLP) blocks.

SegFormer offers a set of MiT encoders (marked by MiT-B0, up to 
MiT-B5) with increasing model sizes. To strike a balance between per-
formance  and  efficiency,  and  to  facilitate  model  deployment  on 
resource-constrained  mobile  devices,  we  choose  the  MiT-B1  as  the 
encoder of GVI learning. We train the model on a server with an NVIDIA 
GeForce GTX 3090 GPU (24 GB memory). The weights pretrained on 
ImageNet-1 K dataset are used to initialize the encoder and decoder. In 
training, we use the AdamW optimizer with the momentum parameter 
(cid:0) 8  to prevent division by zero.

We employ a cosine annealing schedule and set the initial learning rate 
to 0.0001. The model is trained on the UGE-D dataset for 100 epochs 
with the batch size of eight. We supervise SegFormer's training with the 
Cross-Entropy loss function, which is formulated as:

The  MiT  encoder  of  SegFormer  is  designed  as  a  hierarchically 
transformer structure, which can generates the high-resolution coarse 
features  and  the  low-resolution  fine-grained  features.  The  MiT  trans-
former  blocks  use  the  sequence  reduction  process  in  self-attention 
layers,  which  can  reduce  the  computational  burden  by  a  constant 
ratio.  In  addition,  each  transformer  block  directly  places  a  Mix-FNN 
component  (zoomed in  at  the  right bottom  part of  Fig. 12),  along its 
feed-forward path and right before its output. With the Mix-FNN policy, 
SegFormer  does  not  need  to  train  positional  encoding  and  then,  can 
work with better generalization ability. The ALL-MLP decoder of Seg-
former consists entirely of MLP components, which are arranged in four 
main steps. With introducing few additional parameters, the ALL-MLP 
decoder  is  simple  but  effective,  because  its  input  (i.e.,  the  MiT  en-

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily uses images as the data format. This is evident from the mention of using SegFormer, a state-of-the-art Transformer-based model for semantic segmentation, which is typically applied to images. Furthermore, the context mentions the use of ImageNet-1K dataset for initialization, which is a large-scale image database. Additionally, the Cross-Entropy loss function mentioned is commonly used in image classification tasks. Therefore, it can be concluded that the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is images. However, without explicit information about other potential data formats such as audio or video, it cannot be definitively stated that these formats are not also utilized in some capacity within the overall system.
