Where Bi is band 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8 A, 11, and 12. The explanatory 
variables were selected using regsubsets in the R package leaps (Lumley 
and  Lumley,  2013).  The  best  model  was  selected,  by  setting  the 
maximum  number  of  explanatory  variables  (spectral  bands)  to  incor-
porate  in  the  model  to  9  (nvmx  = 9).  Based  on  the  adjusted  R2,  we 
selected the B2, B5 and B6 as predictors for Betul forest. Adding more 
independent variables did only have a marginal effect on the adjusted 
R2. An AGBD map with a cell size of 100 m was constructed by applying 
the AGBD model to all 100 m pixels in the resampled Sentinel-2 image. 
Mean values were calculated for each 1 km grid cell in the GEDI L4B 
dataset based on the cell values in the 100 m-resolution AGBD map. Only 
1  km-cells  that  were  entirely  located  on  forestland  according  to  the

Query: "How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, it mentions that the explanatory variables were selected using'regsubsets' in the R package 'leaps'. This suggests that some form of feature selection or variable reduction technique might have been employed during the modeling process. Unfortunately, without further details, it cannot be confirmed whether techniques such as grid search or random search were utilized specifically for hyperparameter optimization.
