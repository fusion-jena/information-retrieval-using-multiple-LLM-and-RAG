Results

We  calibrated  models  for  classification  challenges  using  different  numbers  of  training 
steps, and considered two factors to find optima for training TensorFlow (Khalighifar et al. 
2019): correct identification rate and processing time. As a result, for all challenges except 
Challenge 3, we chose 4000 training steps as an optimum number. For Challenge 3, given 
the number of species (41 species), 8000 training steps proved to be the optimum number. 
The details of results associated with each classification task are as follows:

Challenge 1

We  created  a  confusion  matrix  to  depict  TensorFlow’s  initial  results  with  20  species 
(Fig. 3). The overall correct identification rate was 94.3%. We achieved 100% correct iden-
tification rate for 11, and 90% or above for 17, species. The lowest identification rates were 
for closely-related species Platymantis isarog and P. montanus, with 70 and 75% correct

Across broader taxonomic scales and phylogenetic relationships (e.g., Chan and Brown 
2017), other means (biogeographic realm, ectomorph type, classification, etc.) of restrict-
ing/limiting  candidate  species  pools  may  prove  useful  for  ‘fine-tuning’  of  TensorFlow’s 
automation of species recognition. Additional caveats for future consideration include (1) 
single notes per species and (2) sample sizes, which will be limited for rare species, those 
that occur at naturally low abundances, or taxa characterized by reduced detection proba-
bilities due to cryptic microhabitat preferences, narrow activity patterns, or seasonally-lim-
ited  reproductive  cycles  (Wells  2010).  Avenues  for  future  development  of  these  methods 
in  our  immediate  plans  include  application  to  additional  taxonomic  groups  (e.g.,  insects, 
birds), and automation of call detection from environmental sound samples as a precursor 
step to automated species identification.

to 98.7%. In addition, our model was able to flag species new to the reference library, indi-
cating potential to recognize novel species in the field. This suggests that our model could 
provide a powerful framework for automated species identification and new species discov-
ery in hard-to-access regions, as well as those with high rates of undiscovered biodiversity.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the provided context, it appears that the authors used a manual approach to determine the optimal number of training steps for their TensorFlow models. They experimented with different numbers of training steps and evaluated the performance based on two factors: correct identification rate and processing time. After testing various configurations, they found that 4000 training steps worked best for most challenges, while 8000 training steps were required for one specific challenge involving 41 species. However, there is no explicit mention of any standard optimization techniques such as grid search or random search being employed in this process. Therefore, it can be concluded that the authors did not use these common hyperparameter tuning strategies but rather relied on trial and error to arrive at the optimal configuration.
