applied.  All  input  images  were  preprocessed  by  mean  centering  the 
image with ImageNet values and then rescaled between 0 and 1. Since 
our dataset was balanced, both networks were trained with a learning 
rate of 0.03, cross-entropy loss as a loss function optimized by Adam 
optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014). Table 2 summarizes the parameter 
used for training each model.

ments.  Since  all  networks  used  present  different  architectural  setups, 
different training procedures have been discussed. Each category of a 
CNN  (i.e.  PConv  networks,  Pix2Pix  networks  and  classification  net-
works)  consisted  of  multiple  trained  models  so  the  same  training

The original implementation of PConv network required a two-phase 
training process (Liu et al., 2018). This is because the generated holes 
presented  a  problem  for  batch  normalization  layer  when  computing 
mean  and  variance  of  the  hole  pixels.  In  this  study,  all  models  were 
trained in a single process while freezing the batch normalization layer 
in the encoder part as the network used pre-trained weights with a small 
batch size of 1. The models were optimized using Adam optimizer with a 
learning rate of 0.0002 while using relu activation for encoder part and 
leakyRelu  activation  for  the  decoder  part  of  the  network.  All  models 
were  trained  for  50  epochs.  For  each  training  epoch,  a  model  was 
evaluated using the validation set and was saved as the best model based 
on a validation loss.

3.3.3. Classification 

Pretrained classification models such as VGG16 have demonstrated 
to perform well on various plant species identification tasks (Pang and 
Lim,  2019).  To  train  our  classification  model,  we  adapted  the  vgg16 
network  pre-trained  on  ImageNet  dataset  (Simonyan  and  Zisserman, 
2014). The fully connected layers of the networks were replaced with a 
global max-pooling layer, a dropout layer with a dropout ratio of 0.5 as a 
network regularizer and single hidden layer with a total of 256 units for 
a larger image sized model(512 × 512) and 128 units for a smaller image 
size model (256 × 256). Both networks were trained for 20 epochs with 
a  batch  size  of 32  and  various data augmentation  techniques such as 
height and width shift, flipping, zooming and brightness changes were

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into sets like train, test, or validation. However, it can be inferred that some form of splitting has taken place due to mentions of evaluating models using a validation set during training. Typically, datasets are divided into three subsets: training, testing, and validation. The training set is used to fit the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final performance of the model. Common practices include random sampling or stratified sampling to maintain class balance across splits. Without more specific details, it cannot be determined exactly how the data was split in this case.
