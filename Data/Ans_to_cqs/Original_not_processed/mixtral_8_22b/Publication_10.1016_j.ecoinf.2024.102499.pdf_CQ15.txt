Our  deep-learning  models  used  NASnet  architecture  (Zoph  et  al., 
2017) with a Faster-rcnn backbone (Ren et al., 2015) implemented in 
Tensorflow2. The parameters of the model can be found on TensorFlow 
model zoo1 under the name “faster_rcnn_nas”. All images were resized to 
1333 × 800 pixels to match with the pre-training data (COCO dataset 
(Lin et al., 2014)) used to prepare the first layers of our model and save 
computing time during the training phase). We used a learning rate of 
0.008 with a cosine learning rate decay. For each K-fold, the model was 
trained on its own version of Trainingclips  through 200,000 iterations, 
with a batch size of 16 images per iteration. The training was completed 
in 96 h  per model using a GPU-cluster equipped with 4 RTX8000. In 
order  to  evaluate  the  performance  of  our  deep-learning  models,  we 
computed the recall, precision, and F-measure for each model. Briefly, a

clips (refer to Methods for details). Our training data included 8 shark 
species and 19 non-shark species commonly associated with sharks on 
baited underwater videos to add diversity in the training. After trans-
forming video clips into still images at a rate of 1 frame per second, we 
annotated  sharks  and  the  19  non-shark  species  present  in  the  frames 
with bounding boxes. This resulted in 26,947 fish annotations (Table 1). 
Given  that  the  Faster  RCNN  architecture  automatically  generates 
negative samples (Ren et al., 2015), there was no need to annotate any. 
It  is  known  that  classic  deep  architectures  need  numerous  image 
sample  per  class  to  work  correctly  (Lecun  et  al.,  2015;  Villon  et  al., 
2022). Hence, shark species that were infrequently captured in our clips 
(Carcharhinus  albimarginatus,  Galeocerdo  cuvier,  Nebrius  ferrugineus, 
Negaprion  acutidens)  were  excluded  from  the  testing  phase.  However,

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that a learning rate of 0.008 was used with a cosine learning rate decay. These are both common strategies employed when using optimization algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. Therefore, while it cannot be definitively stated which optimization algorithm was used, it can be inferred that either SGD or Adam could have been utilized due to the mention of these optimization strategies.
