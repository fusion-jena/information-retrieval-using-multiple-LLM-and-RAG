measures the amount of error made by the model. The X-axis represents 
the number of epochs, which are the iterations of the training process. 
The  Y-axis  represents  the  values  of  accuracy  or  loss,  which  are  the 
metrics of the model’s performance.

help of mathematical functions. The search process is categorized into 
two phases. The first phase is known as global search or exploration, in 
which  the  algorithm  tries  to  explore  different  regions  within  a  given 
search range. This movement is random to ensure that the entire search 
space is covered thoroughly. The second phase is known as local search 
or exploitation, where the goal is to find promising solutions or a set of 
solutions from the area discovered during the first phase. Achieving a 
balance between these two phases is crucial in designing optimization

epochs increases, the accuracy curve shows that the model’s classifica-
tion performance improves. Fig. 6 shows two-line graphs, one for ac-
curacy and one for loss, that compare the training and validation results 
over  epochs.  The  data  points  on  the  graphs  are  based  on  the  mathe-
matical calculations that the proposed model performs on the data. The 
data points are connected by lines to show the trend and pattern of the 
model’s  performance.  The  data  points  and  lines  are  color-coded  to 
indicate whether they belong to the training or validation results. The 
blue color represents the training results, while the orange color rep-
resents the validation results. The graphs also have labels and axes to 
indicate  what  they  are  measuring  and  how  they  are  scaled.  The  left 
graph  is  labeled  “Accuracy”  and  measures  the  percentage  of  correct 
predictions made by the model. The right graph is labeled “Loss”  and

Helpful Answer:
After the model training, there are several postprocessing steps that can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the task. Some common postprocessing steps include:

1. Evaluation metrics: Calculating evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curves, etc., to assess the performance of the model. These metrics help in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the model and provide insights into its generalization capabilities.
2. Confusion matrix: Creating a confusion matrix to visualize the performance of the model. A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the predictions made by the model against the actual classes. It provides information about true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
3. Saliency maps: Generating saliency maps to understand the importance of each input feature towards the final prediction. Saliency maps highlight the areas of the input image that contribute most significantly to the output decision. They can be used to debug the model and improve its interpretability.
4. Model ensembling: Combining multiple models to create an ensemble that outperforms individual models. Ensemble methods such as bagging, boosting, stacking, etc., can be employed to achieve this.
5. Hyperparameter tuning: Fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the model using techniques such as grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, etc., to optimize its performance further.
