Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't enough information to determine what specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model mentioned in the paper by L. Tuoku et al. The materials and methods section only provides details about the study area but does not discuss any methodologies or techniques used to validate or improve the performance of their deep learning model. Therefore, it cannot be determined if they used a diverse dataset, cross-validation, stratified splitting, or other techniques to ensure the generalizability of their model.
