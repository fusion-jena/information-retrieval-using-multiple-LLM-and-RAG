Following  the  tools  we  previously  developed  in  Guilbault  et  al. 
(2021),  we  present  in  this  paper  extensions  that  accommodate  for 
necessary practical model accomodation: bias correction and lasso-type 
penalties. Observer bias correction allows for one to overcome prefer-
ential sampling that arise from opportunistic surveys. Lasso control for 
model complexity and multicollinearity which is particuarly useful with 
low sample size. First, we compare via simulations different measures of 
performance in classification and predicted distribution for the new al-
gorithms  based  on  mixture  modelling  (EM  algorithm)  and  machine 
learning (semi supervised learning) developed to the simple approach of 
fitting  individual  PPMs  to  the  points  with  known  species  labels  only, 
while also incorporating lasso penalization and bias correction. We test 
their performances in the context of low species abundance, the pres-

Figs.  3  to  6  show  the  predicted  intensity  maps  with  80%  hidden 
observations for the different combinations of lasso regularization and 
bias correction. The results for 20% and 50% hidden observations are 
shown in Appendix A.1.2. The following intensity prediction maps do 
not  display  all  methods  tested  previously.  We  focus  on  the  best  per-
forming methods across the performance measures (knn, LoopT) as well

Helpful Answer:
The given text does not provide information about a specific deep learning model being used in the pipeline. Instead, it discusses various aspects such as observer bias correction, lasso-type penalties, mixture modeling using EM algorithms, semi-supervised learning, and fitting individual point process models (PPMs). None of these techniques directly correspond to any particular deep learning architecture like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or Transformers. Therefore, without additional context, I cannot determine what type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline.
