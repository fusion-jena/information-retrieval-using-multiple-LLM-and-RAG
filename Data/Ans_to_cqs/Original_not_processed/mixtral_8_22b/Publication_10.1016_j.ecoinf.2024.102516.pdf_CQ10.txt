2.4. Network setup for investigations 

For extracting plant species cover information for our investigations, 
we  use  the  same  setup  as  described  in  K¨orschens  et  al.  (2021b)  with 
slight differences. During all three phases, we use a ResNet50 (He et al., 
2016),  which  is  initialized  with  ImageNet  (Russakovsky  et  al.,  2015) 
weights from Keras (Chollet et al., 2015) before phase 1 and phase 2, as 
well as the AdamW optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014; Loshchilov and 
Hutter, 2017). During each phase, we use the ResNet in conjunction with 
a  Feature  Pyramid  Network  (FPN)  (Lin  et  al.,  2017)  to  increase  the 
network output resolution. Phase-specific parameters are listed in the

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The article does not provide any direct reference or link to the code repository of the deep learning pipeline used for their research. Therefore, it is not possible to provide the exact code repository link based solely on this abstract and excerpt. To find the relevant code repository, one would need additional resources such as searching through the authors' personal websites, affiliated institutions, or other publications by the same authors.
