Answer:::
The provided text states that the performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the following metrics:

* **Accuracy:**  This metric represents the percentage of correctly classified instances.
* **Precision:** This metric measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made by the model.
* **Recall:** This metric indicates the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances.
* **F1-Score:** This metric is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of both.
