Answer:::
The provided text focuses on regression models and lists several performance metrics used for evaluating them, but it doesn't mention metrics typically used for evaluating deep learning models like accuracy, precision, or recall. 

The metrics listed are:

* **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
* **Mean Square Error (MSE)**
* **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**
* **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**
* **Mean Absolute Scale Error (MASE)**
* **Coefficient of determination (R2)** 


These metrics are suitable for assessing the accuracy of predictions in regression tasks.
