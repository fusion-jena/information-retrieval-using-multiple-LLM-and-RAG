Answer:::
The text provides the following metrics for evaluating the deep learning model:

* **Top-k accuracy:** This metric measures the percentage of times the correct match is ranked within the top k positions.  k can be 1, 5, or 10. 
* **Average Precision (AP):**  Calculated from the precision-recall curve, AP summarizes the overall accuracy of the model. It is the area under the precision-recall curve.
* **Precision-Recall curve:** This curve visualizes the trade-off between precision (the proportion of correctly identified positive instances out of all instances predicted as positive) and recall (the proportion of correctly identified positive instances out of all actual positive instances).
