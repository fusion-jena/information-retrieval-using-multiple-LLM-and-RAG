Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning for land cover classification using satellite imagery.  It doesn't explicitly detail the methods used for collecting the raw data itself. 

However, we can infer that the primary data source is **satellite imagery**.  

The text mentions:

* "The satellite"
* "satellite imagery accumulates"
* "training a deep learning model based on the results of previous steps" 


Therefore, it's highly likely that the raw data in this deep learning pipeline is collected through satellite observations.
