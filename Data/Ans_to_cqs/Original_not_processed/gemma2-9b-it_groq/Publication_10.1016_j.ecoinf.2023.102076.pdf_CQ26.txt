Answer:::
The provided text mentions several techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, particularly in the context of imbalanced datasets:

* **Stratified splitting:** This technique is used to ensure that the training and testing sets have a similar distribution of target classes. The text states that stratification of training data improved the recall of relevant texts in classification tasks 2 and 3.

* **Oversampling:** This involves duplicating instances of the minority class in the training data to balance the class distribution. The text suggests that oversampling can help alleviate the issue of imbalanced datasets.

* **Undersampling:** This technique involves removing instances from the majority class to balance the class distribution. While not explicitly mentioned in the text, undersampling is another common technique for addressing data imbalance.

* **Diverse data collection:** The text highlights the importance of collecting diverse data to avoid bias. It suggests annotating a randomly selected sample of collected data according to relevancy criteria, although this approach may be less suitable for cases where relevant examples are scarce. 



The text focuses primarily on the impact of data imbalance on classification performance and the use of stratified splitting as a mitigation strategy.
