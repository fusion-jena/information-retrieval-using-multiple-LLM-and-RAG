Answer:::

The provided text focuses on hyperparameter optimization and doesn't delve into strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.  

However, I can tell you that randomness is inherent in many parts of deep learning, including:

* **Initialization:**  Weights and biases in neural networks are often initialized randomly.

* **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):** This common optimization algorithm uses random mini-batches of data to update model parameters.
* **Dropout:** A regularization technique that randomly "drops out" (ignores) neurons during training, adding noise and preventing overfitting.

To mitigate the effects of randomness and ensure reproducibility, practitioners often use:

* **Random Seed Setting:**  Fixing a random seed value at the beginning of the training process ensures that the same random numbers are generated each time, leading to consistent results.

* **Data Shuffling:** Randomly shuffling the training data before each epoch helps prevent the model from learning patterns specific to the original data order.
