Answer:::
The provided text describes the model training process but doesn't specify the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete.  

It mentions that the algorithm was trained for 3000 iterations with validation checks every 300 iterations. It also states that TensorBoard was used to study the performance of the runs. 

However, it doesn't explicitly say if training stopped based on validation loss plateau, a specific accuracy target, or other criteria.
