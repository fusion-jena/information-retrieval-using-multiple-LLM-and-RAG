Answer:::
The provided text describes how the data was split for a specific deep learning project, but it doesn't explicitly state general criteria used for data splitting in deep learning. 

However, we can infer some information:

* **Source and Target Domains:** The data was split into source and target domains for transfer learning. The source domain likely contains a larger dataset used to pre-train a model, while the target domain is the smaller dataset the model will be fine-tuned on.
* **Camera Trap Data:** For camera trap image datasets (SS and LSM), the data was split while preserving "capture events." A capture event consists of multiple images taken consecutively, and all images within an event were kept together in the same training or test set to avoid issues with model generalization.
* **SS Dataset Splitting:**  The SS dataset was split into training sets (S_2, S_5, S_8, S_10, S_20) of varying sizes (2000 to 20,000 samples) and validation/test sets (S_V and S_T).

**General Data Splitting Criteria in Deep Learning:**

While the specific criteria aren't stated, common practices in deep learning often involve:

* **Train Set:** The largest portion of the data, used to train the model.
* **Validation Set:** A smaller portion used to evaluate the model's performance during training and tune hyperparameters.
* **Test Set:** A separate, unseen portion used to evaluate the final model performance.

The exact proportions of these sets can vary depending on the dataset size and project requirements.
