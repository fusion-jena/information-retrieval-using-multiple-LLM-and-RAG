Answer:::

The text describes a four-phase process for validating the deep learning model.  

Here's what it says about ensuring generalizability:

* **Phase III: Evaluation using recent surveys:** A separate dataset of 57 images with man-made objects and 5000 images without them was used to test the model's performance on unseen data. This helps assess if the model generalizes well to new images.

* **Phase IV: Validation by field experts using the most recent surveys:** The model was further validated by field experts using an independent dataset. This step involves human evaluation, providing an additional layer of assurance regarding the model's real-world applicability.

The text doesn't explicitly mention techniques like cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the use of a diverse dataset during the training phase.
