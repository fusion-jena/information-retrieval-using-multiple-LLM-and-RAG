Answer:::

The provided text focuses on embedding layers and model training specifics, but doesn't delve into strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. 

However,  it does mention using a fixed `random seed` value (though not explicitly stating it as a strategy).  

Generally, to address randomness in deep learning, practitioners employ these strategies:

* **Setting a Fixed Random Seed:** This ensures reproducibility by initializing random number generators with the same value. This makes experiments and results more consistent.

* **Data Shuffling:** Randomly shuffling the training data before each epoch helps prevent the model from learning patterns specific to a particular data order.

* **Dropout:** This regularization technique randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during training. This prevents overfitting and introduces stochasticity into the network.

* **Batch Normalization:** This technique normalizes the activations within each layer, reducing the internal covariate shift and stabilizing training.
