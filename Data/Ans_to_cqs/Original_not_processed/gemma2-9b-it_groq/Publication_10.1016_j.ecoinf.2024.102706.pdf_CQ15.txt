Answer: 

The provided text focuses on comparing the performance of different machine learning algorithms (Linear Regression, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Light Gradient Boosting Machine) for predicting canopy cover. It doesn't delve into the optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines. 

Therefore, I cannot answer your query about optimization techniques applied in deep learning from this context.
