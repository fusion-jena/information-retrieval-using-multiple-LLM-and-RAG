The provided text describes the training process of a model for classifying insect specimens. It details the hardware used, the dataset, and the adversarial training method employed. 

However, it doesn't mention any post-processing steps performed after the model training, such as:

* **Saliency maps:**  These highlight the regions of an input image that are most influential in the model's prediction.
* **Metrics calculation:**  Various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC are used to evaluate the model's performance.
* **Confusion matrix:** This visualizes the performance of a classification model by showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what post-processing steps are involved.
