Answer:::

The provided text focuses on mathematical models of ecological systems and doesn't discuss deep learning or strategies for handling randomness within deep learning pipelines.  

To answer your query about randomness in deep learning, here are some common strategies:

* **Setting a Random Seed:**  Deep learning models often use random initialization for weights and random shuffling of data during training. Setting a random seed ensures that these random processes are reproducible. If you set a seed, you'll get the same results every time you run the code.

* **Dropout:** This technique randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during each training step. This prevents overfitting and introduces stochasticity into the model.

* **Batch Normalization:** This technique normalizes the activations of neurons within each mini-batch during training. This helps stabilize training and reduce the impact of internal covariate shift.

* **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):** This optimization algorithm uses a random subset (batch) of the training data to calculate the gradient at each step. This introduces randomness and helps explore the parameter space more effectively.
