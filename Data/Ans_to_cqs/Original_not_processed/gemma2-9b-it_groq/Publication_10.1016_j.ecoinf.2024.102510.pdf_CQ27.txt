Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the performance evaluation and hyperparameter optimization of various deep learning models for a specific task (likely image classification).  

It doesn't offer details about the model deployment process, including:

* **Model serialization:** How the trained model was saved for later use.
* **Platform selection:** The hardware or software environment where the model would run (e.g., cloud, edge device).
* **Deployment specifics:**  Methods for integrating the model into an application or system. 


Therefore, I cannot answer your query based on the given context.
