Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the creation of a new dataset for Green View Index (GVI) extraction called UGE-D and the use of the SegFormer model for GVI learning.  

It mentions existing datasets like COCO-Stuff, Cityscapes, and AED20K, but doesn't delve into the specific annotation techniques used for these datasets. 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what data annotation techniques are used in the deep learning pipeline for these datasets.
