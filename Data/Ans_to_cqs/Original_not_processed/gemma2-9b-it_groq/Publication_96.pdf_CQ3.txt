The provided text describes the process of collecting spectral training samples of burned and non-burned areas.  It mentions that these samples are "well distributed in space" but doesn't specify the exact data annotation techniques used to create these samples. 


Therefore, based on the information given, I cannot say for sure what data annotation techniques were used (e.g., bounding box annotation, instance segmentation).
