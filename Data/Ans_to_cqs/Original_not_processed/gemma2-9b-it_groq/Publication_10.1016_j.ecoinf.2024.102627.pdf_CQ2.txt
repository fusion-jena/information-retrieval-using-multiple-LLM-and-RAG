Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning for species assemblage prediction and doesn't explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the pipeline. 

However, it does state:

*  "...from citizen science observations on one hand, and from remote sensing characterization of environmental heterogeneity on the other hand..."

This suggests that the data likely includes:

* **Image data:**  Citizen science observations could involve photographs of species or their habitats.
* **Remote sensing data:** This typically involves geospatial data like satellite imagery or aerial photographs, which are often in raster or vector formats.

It's also possible that **CSV (Comma Separated Values)** or other tabular formats are used to store environmental variables or species occurrence data. 


Without further information from the cited sources, it's impossible to definitively list all the data formats used.
