Answer:::
The provided text does not describe the purpose of a deep learning model. It focuses on ecological niche modeling, which uses machine learning algorithms (like random forests and MaxEnt) to predict species distributions based on environmental factors. 

While deep learning is a type of machine learning, the text doesn't mention its specific use in this context.
