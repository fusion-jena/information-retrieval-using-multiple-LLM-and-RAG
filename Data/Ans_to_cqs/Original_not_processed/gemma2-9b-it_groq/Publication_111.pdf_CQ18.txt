Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor model performance during training is the use of a validation group. 

The training data is split into training and validation groups. The model's performance is tracked on the validation group. If the performance on the validation group starts to degrade for a number of epochs, the early stopping strategy is triggered, and training is ceased.
