Answer:::
The provided text describes the performance of different machine learning models for predicting canopy cover but doesn't explicitly state the strategy used to monitor model performance *during* training. 

It does mention:

* **Hyperparameter tuning:**  The text refers to using grid search to optimize hyperparameters for each model. This process likely involves evaluating performance on a validation set during each iteration of the grid search.
* **Performance metrics:**  The text reports R2, RMSE, rRMSE, and MAE for both training and testing datasets. These metrics were likely used to assess model performance at various stages of training.


Without further information, it's impossible to definitively say what specific strategy was used to monitor performance during training.
