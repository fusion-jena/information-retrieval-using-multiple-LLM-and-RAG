Answer:::
The provided text states that the proposed approach uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).  

It mentions:

* "The proposed approach evolves a near-optimal CNN."
* "The hyperparameters with the current results are saved until better accuracy is achieved. The termination criterion of the proposed approach is the maximum number of iterations to be executed. After the completion of the iterations, the proposed approach provides us with the best hyperparameters, thus evolving the near-optimal CNN."
