Answer:::

The provided text focuses on machine learning algorithms (not deep learning) and doesn't mention specific techniques like stratified splitting or the use of a diverse dataset to ensure model generalizability. 

However, it does state the following:

* **Data Split:** 30% of each taxon's data was used for testing, while 70% was used for training.
* **Cross-Validation:** 10-fold cross-validation was performed on all models.
* **Bootstrapping:** 10-fold bootstrapping was used to provide unbiased predictive accuracy.

These techniques aim to improve the model's ability to generalize to unseen data by:

* **Cross-validation:** Evaluating the model on different subsets of the data to reduce overfitting.
* **Bootstrapping:** Creating multiple resampled datasets to assess the model's robustness and variability.



While these methods contribute to generalizability, the text doesn't explicitly address the use of a diverse dataset or stratified splitting.
