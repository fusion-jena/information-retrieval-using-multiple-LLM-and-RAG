Answer:::

The provided text focuses on Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and doesn't discuss techniques for addressing data bias during the preprocessing stage of a deep learning pipeline. 

However, I can provide information on the techniques you mentioned:

* **Stratified splitting:** This technique ensures that the training, validation, and test sets have a similar distribution of target variable classes as the original dataset. This helps prevent bias towards certain classes during model training.

* **Oversampling:** This involves duplicating instances from underrepresented classes to balance the dataset. Techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) can create synthetic samples for the minority class.

* **Undersampling:** This involves removing instances from the majority class to balance the dataset.

* **Diverse data collection:** This involves actively seeking out data from different sources and demographics to ensure the dataset is representative of the real world and minimizes biases.
