The provided text focuses on the challenges and techniques related to training deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and doesn't delve into addressing data bias during preprocessing. 

While the text mentions data augmentation as a technique to increase the robustness and generalization capacity of CNNs, it doesn't explicitly discuss methods for handling data bias. 

Techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection are indeed used to mitigate data bias during preprocessing, but they are not covered in this context.
