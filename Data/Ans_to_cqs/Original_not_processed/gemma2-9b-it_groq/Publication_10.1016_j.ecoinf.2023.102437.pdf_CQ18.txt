Answer:::
The provided text describes a method for training and evaluating machine learning models for time series prediction, specifically focusing on the NINO3.4 index. 

It details a process of progressive training and forecasting, where the training dataset size (`|Dm|`) increases with the starting time (`tm`) of the prediction.  The performance is monitored by:

* **Comparing predictions to validation data:** The model's prediction (`̂ym+ma`) at a given time (`tm+ma`) is compared to the actual value (`ym+ma`) from the validation data.
* **Calculating prediction error:** The difference between the predicted and actual values (`̂ym+ma - ym+ma`) is calculated at different starting times (`tm`).

This approach ensures a form of cross-validation for each forecast, as each prediction is made using information only available at the start of the prediction period. 


The text doesn't explicitly mention specific metrics used to quantify model performance (e.g., mean squared error, accuracy) beyond the prediction error calculation.
