Answer:::
The text states that Keras Tuner, which provides Random Search, Hyperband, and Bayesian Optimization algorithms, was used for hyperparameter optimization. 

Specifically, the authors used Hyperband and Bayesian Optimization for this task, as they are considered superior to other search algorithms available in Keras Tuner.
