Answer:::
The provided text does not specify the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete.  It mentions that development sets were used to evaluate classification performance during experiments, implying that performance on the development set was likely monitored. 

However, it doesn't state whether training stopped when performance on the development set plateaued, reached a specific target, or was stopped based on a predefined number of epochs.
