Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the methodology of training a deep learning model for classifying paddy rice using Landsat images. It details aspects like data preprocessing, model architecture (SAE), and parameter tuning. 

However, it doesn't explicitly describe the post-processing steps involved after model training, such as:

* **Saliency maps:**  These are not mentioned.
* **Metrics calculation:** While the text mentions "classification performance assessment," it doesn't specify the exact metrics used (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
* **Confusion matrix:**  The text doesn't discuss the creation or use of a confusion matrix for evaluating classification results. 


Therefore, based on the given information, I cannot answer what post-processing steps are used.
