Answer:::
The provided text states that the best model was selected based on the validation loss curve metrics.  It  specifically says: "Using the two independent validation dataset for each study site, result metrics were calculated... The best model, based on the validation loss curve metrics, which means that the model selected was the one trained until epoch 6 (from the 50 epochs trained)."


Therefore, the criteria used to determine when training was complete was a **validation loss plateau**.  The authors chose the model trained until epoch 6 because it performed best according to the validation loss curve.
