The provided text focuses on the use of image data in a deep learning pipeline.  

Specifically, it mentions:

* **Multi-band images:** Images containing data from multiple spectral bands (e.g., 8-band, 36-band, 72-band).
* **Image units:**  256x256 pixel sections extracted from larger images.
* **Data format conversion:**  Converting multi-band images into single-band images using Python's Rasterio module. 


The text does not mention the use of any other data formats like audio, video, or CSV.
