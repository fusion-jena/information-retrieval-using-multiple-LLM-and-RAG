Answer:::
The provided text describes the model selection process and performance evaluation but doesn't explicitly state the criteria used to determine when training is complete. 

It mentions that the selected model is trained on the full training data (Bt) for "up to 30 epochs".  An epoch corresponds to one complete pass of the training dataset through the network.  

Therefore, we can infer that training is considered complete after 30 epochs, or potentially sooner if other stopping criteria are met (which are not described in the text).
