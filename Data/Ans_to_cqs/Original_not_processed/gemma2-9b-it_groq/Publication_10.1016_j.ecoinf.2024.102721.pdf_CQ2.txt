Answer: 

The provided text focuses on the application of LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models for forecasting ecological water demand in an arid oasis.  While it mentions using NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), it doesn't explicitly state the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. 

However, given that NDVI is derived from satellite imagery, it's highly likely that the pipeline involves:

* **Image data:**  Satellite imagery is used to calculate NDVI.

It's also possible that other data formats are used, such as:

* **Time series data:**  Data on precipitation, temperature, or groundwater levels could be used as input to the LSTM model. This data could be stored in CSV or similar formats. 


Without further information from the paper, it's impossible to definitively list all the data formats used.
