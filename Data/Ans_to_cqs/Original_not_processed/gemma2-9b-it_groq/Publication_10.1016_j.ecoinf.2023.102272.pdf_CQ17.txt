Answer:::
The provided text does not specify the exact regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.  While it mentions  "hidden_dropout" and "visible_dropout" as parameters for the neural network models, it doesn't explicitly state whether these are used for regularization. 

To determine the specific regularization techniques employed, you would need to consult the original research paper (Capinha et al., 2021) or the code implementing the deep learning models.
