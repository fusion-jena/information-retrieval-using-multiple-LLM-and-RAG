Answer:::
The provided text states that the model uses the AdamW optimizer with a momentum parameter (β1, β2) set to (0.9, 0.999) and ε set to 10<sup>-6</sup>. 

The initial learning rate is set to 0.0001 and a cosine annealing schedule is employed during training.  The batch size is eight and the model is trained for 100 epochs.
