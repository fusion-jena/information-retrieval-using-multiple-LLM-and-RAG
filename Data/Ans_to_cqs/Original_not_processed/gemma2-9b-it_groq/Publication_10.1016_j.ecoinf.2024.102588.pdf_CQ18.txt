Answer:::
The provided text describes the use of several techniques to monitor model performance during training. 

For the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, the learning rate was initially set to 0.001 but was automatically adjusted to find the optimal value. This suggests the use of an adaptive learning rate strategy, likely a method like Adam or RMSprop, which dynamically adjusts the learning rate based on the model's performance.

Additionally, the text mentions the use of "early stopping." This technique monitors the model's performance on a validation set (separate from the training data) and stops training when the validation accuracy plateaus or starts to decrease. This prevents overfitting, where the model learns the training data too well and performs poorly on unseen data. 


The text also mentions the use of the "NSE" (Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency) and "RMSE" (Root Mean Squared Error) metrics for evaluating the performance of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. These metrics are commonly used to assess the accuracy of regression models.
