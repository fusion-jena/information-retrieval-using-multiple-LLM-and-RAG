Answer:::
The provided text describes a specific instance of data splitting using 5-fold cross-validation.  

In this case, the dataset was divided into five subsets. Each subset was used once as the validation set, while the remaining four subsets were used for training. This process was repeated five times, with each subset serving as the validation set in a different round.

While this text focuses on a particular method, it doesn't explicitly state the general criteria used for splitting data in deep learning. 

Generally, data is split into three main sets:

* **Training set:** Used to train the deep learning model. The model learns patterns and relationships within this data.
* **Validation set:** Used to evaluate the model's performance during training. This helps in tuning hyperparameters and preventing overfitting.
* **Test set:** Used for a final evaluation of the trained model's performance on unseen data. This provides an estimate of how well the model will generalize to new examples. 

The typical split ratios are 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. However, these ratios can be adjusted depending on the size and nature of the dataset.
