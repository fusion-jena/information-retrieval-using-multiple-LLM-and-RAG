Answer:::
The provided text describes the process of developing and refining the IFM-LCONS model but doesn't specify the exact method used for optimizing hyperparameters.  It mentions that parameters were refined through "several hundred independent simulations, varying the parameter values to optimize the model." 

However, it doesn't explicitly state whether techniques like grid search or random search were employed for this optimization.
