Answer:::
The provided text states that the dataset was split into training and validation sets using a 70/30 ratio. 

Specifically, 70% of the data was randomly selected for training the classification model, while the remaining 30% was reserved for validation.  

The text also mentions that the `train_test_split` function from the scikit-learn library was used for this purpose. This function ensures that the data is shuffled randomly before the split, guaranteeing a balanced representation of both classes (control and pesticide-exposed) in both the training and validation sets.
