Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning for marine ecology and doesn't delve into the specifics of handling randomness within the deep learning pipeline. 

However, I can offer some general information about strategies used to manage randomness in deep learning:

* **Random Seed Initialization:**  Deep learning models often initialize their weights randomly. Setting a fixed random seed ensures that the same random weights are used each time a model is trained, making the results reproducible.

* **Data Augmentation:** Randomly applying transformations to training data (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) introduces variation and helps the model generalize better to unseen data.

* **Dropout:** This technique randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during each training step. This prevents overfitting by forcing the network to learn more robust features.

* **Batch Normalization:** This technique normalizes the activations of each layer, reducing the internal covariate shift and stabilizing training.

* **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):** This optimization algorithm uses a random subset (batch) of the training data to update model weights in each iteration. The randomness introduced by batch sampling helps prevent getting stuck in local minima.
