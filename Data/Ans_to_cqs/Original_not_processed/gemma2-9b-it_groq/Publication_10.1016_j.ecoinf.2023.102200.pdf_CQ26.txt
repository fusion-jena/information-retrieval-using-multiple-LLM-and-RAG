Answer:::

The provided text focuses on applications of deep learning in various fields like medical imaging, remote sensing, and forestry. It doesn't delve into specific techniques for addressing data bias during the preprocessing stage of a deep learning pipeline. 

However, based on general knowledge of machine learning, here are some common techniques used to address data bias:

* **Stratified Splitting:** This involves dividing the dataset into training, validation, and test sets while ensuring that the proportion of different classes (or features) is maintained in each set. This helps prevent the model from being biased towards a particular class during training.

* **Oversampling:** This technique increases the number of samples belonging to underrepresented classes by duplicating existing samples or generating synthetic samples.

* **Undersampling:** This involves reducing the number of samples belonging to overrepresented classes to balance the dataset.

* **Diverse Data Collection:**  The most effective way to mitigate bias is to collect data from a diverse range of sources and ensure it represents the real-world distribution of the target phenomenon.

It's important to note that addressing data bias is an ongoing challenge in machine learning, and the best approach often involves a combination of these techniques.
