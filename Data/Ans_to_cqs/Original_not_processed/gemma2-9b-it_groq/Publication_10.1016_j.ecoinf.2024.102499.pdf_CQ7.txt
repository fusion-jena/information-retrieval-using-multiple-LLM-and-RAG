Answer:::
The provided text describes a 5-fold cross-validation strategy.  

For each fold:

* **Training:** 80% of the dataset (called "Videoclips") is randomly selected for training the model.
* **Testing:** The remaining 20% of the "Videoclips" dataset is used for testing the model's performance. 

The text emphasizes that splitting the data based on videos rather than individual images is crucial to avoid overfitting due to the high similarity between images from the same video. 


It does not mention a separate validation set.
