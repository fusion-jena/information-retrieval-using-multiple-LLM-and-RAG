Answer:::

The provided text focuses on machine learning models for water quality prediction and doesn't delve into deep learning pipeline preprocessing techniques for addressing data bias.  

Therefore, I cannot answer your query about specific techniques used to address data bias during deep learning preprocessing (e.g., stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, diverse data collection) based on the given context.
