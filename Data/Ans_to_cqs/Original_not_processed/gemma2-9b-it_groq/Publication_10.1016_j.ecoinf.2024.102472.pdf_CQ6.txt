Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the specifics of training a Multilayer Perceptron (MLPNN) for carbon stock estimation and doesn't delve into general preprocessing steps for deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.
* **Feature Scaling:**  Transforming features to a similar scale (e.g., normalization or standardization) to prevent features with larger magnitudes from dominating the learning process.
* **Encoding Categorical Variables:** Converting categorical data into numerical representations that the model can understand (e.g., one-hot encoding).
* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones to potentially improve model performance.

Remember that the specific preprocessing steps will depend on the nature of the data and the chosen deep learning model.
