Answer:::

The provided text describes the development and validation of a backpropagation artificial neural network model for predicting TSI (Trophic State Index) using aCDOM(254) and Fn(355) as input variables. 

While it mentions the use of 64 water samples for model calibration and the remaining samples for validation, it does not specify details about  data splitting techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting.  

Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot definitively say what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model beyond the specific dataset used.
