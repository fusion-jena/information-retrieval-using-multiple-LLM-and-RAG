Answer:::
The provided text states that the data was split into a training set (80% of the data) and a test set (20% of the data).  

It explains that this split ensures the models are trained on one portion of the data and tested on a separate, previously unseen portion, allowing for the assessment of their ability to generalize to new, unseen data accurately. 

The text does not mention a validation set.
