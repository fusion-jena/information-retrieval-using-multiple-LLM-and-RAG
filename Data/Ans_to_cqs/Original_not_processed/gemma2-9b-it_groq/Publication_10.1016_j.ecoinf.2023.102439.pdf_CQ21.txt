Answer:::
The provided text describes the model training process and performance evaluation metrics but doesn't detail specific post-processing steps like saliency maps, confusion matrices, or other visualizations. 

It does mention the following evaluation metrics:

* **Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE)**
* **Mean Square Error (MSE)**
* **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**
* **Correlation coefficient (R)**

These metrics are used to assess the accuracy and predictive capability of the model by comparing predicted EVI values with actual observed values.
