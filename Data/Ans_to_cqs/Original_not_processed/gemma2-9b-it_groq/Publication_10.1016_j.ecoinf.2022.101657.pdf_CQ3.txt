Answer:::
The provided text mentions the use of **Mask R-CNN** with **Flow-Guided Feature Aggregation** for instance segmentation of animal species in video clips captured by camera traps. 

Specifically, Schindler and Steinhage (2021) utilize this combination to optimize instance segmentation.  Instance segmentation involves identifying and outlining individual instances of objects within an image. 

While the text doesn't explicitly list other data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it's reasonable to infer that **bounding box annotation** is likely employed as well. Bounding box annotation involves drawing a rectangular box around each instance of an object in an image, providing a simpler form of object localization compared to instance segmentation.
