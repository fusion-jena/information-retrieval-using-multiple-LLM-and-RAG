The provided text focuses on the training process and the analysis of the trained model's accuracy. It describes the use of data augmentation, the network architecture, and the optimization techniques employed. 

However, it doesn't delve into any post-processing steps performed after the model training, such as:

* **Saliency maps:**  These are visualizations that highlight the regions of an input image that are most influential in the model's decision.
* **Metrics calculation:**  Various metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC are commonly calculated to evaluate the model's performance.
* **Confusion matrix:** This matrix provides a detailed breakdown of the model's predictions, showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives for each class. 



Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what post-processing steps are involved.
