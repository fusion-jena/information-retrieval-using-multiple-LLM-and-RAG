The provided text describes the model training process and its evaluation using an average precision metric. It mentions that around 200 scans were annotated by hand based on the predicted bounding boxes.  

However, it doesn't explicitly detail the post-processing steps involved after model training, such as:

* **Saliency maps:**  These are not discussed in the context.
* **Metrics calculation:** While average precision is mentioned, other potential metrics (e.g., recall, F1-score) are not specified.
* **Confusion matrix:**  There's no mention of a confusion matrix being used for evaluation. 


Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively say what post-processing steps were used.
