Answer:::
The provided text does not specify the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It only mentions the use of "Machine Learning (ML) techniques" and "Random Forests (RF) analyses".  

While Random Forests are a type of machine learning algorithm, they are not considered deep learning models. Deep learning models typically involve artificial neural networks with multiple layers, such as CNNs, RNNs, or Transformers.
