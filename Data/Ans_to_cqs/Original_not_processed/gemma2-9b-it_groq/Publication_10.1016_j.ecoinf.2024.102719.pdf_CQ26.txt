Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the bias-variance tradeoff in machine learning models, particularly in the context of river health prediction. It doesn't delve into specific techniques for addressing data bias during the preprocessing stage of a deep learning pipeline. 

However, based on general machine learning practices, here are some common techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing:

* **Stratified Splitting:** This technique ensures that the training, validation, and test sets have a similar distribution of target variable classes as the original dataset. This helps prevent bias towards certain classes during model training.

* **Oversampling:** This involves duplicating instances from underrepresented classes to balance the class distribution in the dataset.

* **Undersampling:** This involves removing instances from overrepresented classes to balance the class distribution.

* **Diverse Data Collection:**  This involves actively seeking out and including data from a wide range of sources and perspectives to minimize bias introduced by a limited or homogenous dataset.

* **Reweighing:** Assigning different weights to instances based on their class distribution can help mitigate the impact of imbalanced datasets.


Remember, addressing data bias is an ongoing process that requires careful consideration and evaluation throughout the machine learning pipeline.
