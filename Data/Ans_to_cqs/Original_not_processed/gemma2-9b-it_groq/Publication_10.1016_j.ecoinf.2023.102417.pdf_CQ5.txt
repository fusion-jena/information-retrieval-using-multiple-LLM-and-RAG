Answer:::
The text mentions the use of two main datasets:

1. **ImageNet:** This is a large, well-established collection of image datasets used for training and evaluating image classification models. The Unet model used in the study was pre-trained on ImageNet.

2. **A labeled dataset of biocrust imagery:** This dataset was created specifically for the study and used to fine-tune the pre-trained Unet model for semantic segmentation of biocrusts.  The text doesn't provide details about the size or source of this dataset.
