Answer:::
The provided text suggests that deep learning models, specifically CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks), would be most effective for mapping land cover, particularly woody cover, in Kruger National Park (KNP). 

The authors propose using deep learning methods to analyze aerial images of KNP taken every two years. This implies the purpose of the deep learning model is **land cover classification**, specifically focusing on identifying areas of woody vegetation.
