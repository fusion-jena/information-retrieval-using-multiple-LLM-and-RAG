Answer:::
The text describes a specific data splitting strategy called k-fold block cross-validation. 

Here's how it works:

1. **Spatial Blocks:** The region of interest is divided into a grid of 5x5 geospatial blocks.

2. **K-Folds:** The data is then split into 5 folds (k=5), ensuring each fold contains a roughly equal number of presence observations.

3. **Training and Validation:** For each fold, 80% of the presence observations are used for training, and the remaining 20% are used for validation.

4. **Model Evaluation:** The model is trained on each fold and its performance is evaluated on the corresponding validation set. The results are averaged across all folds.

5. **Best Model Selection:** The model with the highest mean AUC (Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve) across all species is selected as the best performing model.
