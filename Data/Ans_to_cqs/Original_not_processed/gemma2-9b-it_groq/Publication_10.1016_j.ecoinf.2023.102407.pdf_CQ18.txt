Answer:::
The provided text describes the SDP-EPL method for training student models using a teacher model and pseudo-labeling.  It details the steps involved in the process but doesn't explicitly state a strategy for monitoring model performance *during* training. 

The text does mention evaluating the performance of the final trained student models using AUC and TSS metrics. It also discusses how the number of pseudo-labeled data points (K) affects the performance of the student model.
