Answer:::
The text describes measures taken to avoid bias during the training and testing process, but it doesn't mention specific data preprocessing techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. 

The text states that to avoid bias:

* For herbarium datasets H255 and H1K, sheets of the same species collected by the same collector were not included in both training and testing sets.
* For the CR dataset, images of different leaves from each specimen were placed in either training or testing sets, but not both.
* For the PlantCLEF (PC) dataset, the same separation was applied at the observation level. 


These methods aim to prevent the model from learning patterns specific to certain collectors or specimens, leading to more realistic and unbiased evaluation.
