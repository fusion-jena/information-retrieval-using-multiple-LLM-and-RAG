Answer:::

The provided text focuses on describing different deep learning models and their performance metrics, including accuracy and training time. It also touches upon the concept of fine-tuning pre-trained models. 

However, it does not offer information about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the models, such as:

* **Diverse dataset:**  Whether the training dataset represented a wide range of data points and covered potential variations in the data.
* **Cross-validation:**  Techniques like k-fold cross-validation used to evaluate the model's performance on different subsets of the data, providing a more robust estimate of generalization ability.
* **Stratified splitting:**  Methods for ensuring that the training and testing sets have a similar distribution of target classes, preventing bias towards certain classes. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
