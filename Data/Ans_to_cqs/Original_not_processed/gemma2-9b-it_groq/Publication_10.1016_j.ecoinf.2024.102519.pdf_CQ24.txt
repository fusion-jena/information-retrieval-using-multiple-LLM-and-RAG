Answer:::
The provided text focuses on Genetic Algorithms (GA) and their application in ecological informatics, particularly in source location identification. It doesn't offer information about strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines. 


To answer your query about deep learning, here are some common strategies:

* **Setting a Random Seed:**  This ensures that the same "random" numbers are generated every time you run your code, making your results reproducible.

* **Dropout:**  A regularization technique where randomly selected neurons are "dropped out" (ignored) during each training step. This prevents overfitting and introduces some randomness into the network.
* **Batch Normalization:**  Normalizes the activations of each layer, reducing the internal covariate shift and stabilizing training. This can indirectly help mitigate the effects of randomness in the data.
* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increases the size and diversity of your training data by applying random transformations (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) to existing images or samples.
