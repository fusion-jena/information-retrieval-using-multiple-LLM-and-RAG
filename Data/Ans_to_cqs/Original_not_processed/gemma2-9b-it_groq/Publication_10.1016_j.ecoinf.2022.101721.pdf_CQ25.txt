Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the development and testing of a bat call detection and classification method using convolutional neural networks. 

Therefore, the purpose of the deep learning model is **classification**. 

The model is trained to distinguish between different bat species based on the unique characteristics of their echolocation calls.
