Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the performance of a simple artificial neural network (ANN) rather than a deep learning model.  

The text mentions the following metrics for evaluating the ANN's performance:

* **Mean deviance:** This measures the average difference between the predicted SPAD values and the actual SPAD values. A lower mean deviance indicates better performance.
* **95% Confidence Interval (CI):** This provides a range within which the true mean deviance is likely to fall. 
* **R-squared:** This metric indicates the proportion of variance in the SPAD values that is explained by the model. A higher R-squared value suggests a better fit.
* **Mean absolute difference (test data):** This measures the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual SPAD values on the testing dataset.


The text does not discuss deep learning specific metrics like accuracy, precision, or recall.
