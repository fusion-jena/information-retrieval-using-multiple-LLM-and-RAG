Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the development and structure of an artificial neural network (ANN) for predicting mosquito abundances. It mentions using mean square error (MSE) as a metric to evaluate the model's performance.  

While the text doesn't explicitly list other common deep learning metrics like accuracy, precision, or recall, it's important to note that MSE is a common metric for regression tasks, which this model seems to be.
