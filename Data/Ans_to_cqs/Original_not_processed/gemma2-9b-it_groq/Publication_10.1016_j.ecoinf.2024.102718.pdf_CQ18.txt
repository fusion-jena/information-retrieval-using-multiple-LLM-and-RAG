Answer:::
The provided text states that metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC, model size, and analysis time are meticulously recorded during the training phase.  

Additionally, the text mentions the use of callbacks like ReduceLROnPlateau, ModelCheckpoint, and EarlyStopping. These callbacks dynamically adjust the learning rate based on validation accuracy and can save the best-performing model checkpoint.
