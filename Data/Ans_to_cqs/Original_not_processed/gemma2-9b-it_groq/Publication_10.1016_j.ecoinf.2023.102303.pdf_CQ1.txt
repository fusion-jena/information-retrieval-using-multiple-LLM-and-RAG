Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the development of deep learning models for fish detection in turbid waters and doesn't specify the methods used for collecting the raw data.  

It mentions the "FishInTurbidWater dataset" which was collected and weakly labeled by the authors. However, it doesn't describe the data collection process itself (e.g., surveys, sensors, public datasets).
