Answer: The provided text focuses on the challenges of using deep learning for tree detection in remote sensing due to limited training data and the variability of tree appearances. It discusses techniques like self-supervised learning and semi-supervised learning to address the data scarcity issue. 

However, the text doesn't delve into specific preprocessing techniques for addressing data bias, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.
