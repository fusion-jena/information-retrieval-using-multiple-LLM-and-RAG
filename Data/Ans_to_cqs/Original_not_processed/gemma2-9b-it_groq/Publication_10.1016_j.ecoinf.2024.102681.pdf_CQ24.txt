Answer:::

The provided text focuses on drought assessment and prediction using deep learning, particularly a hybrid CNN-LSTM model. It doesn't delve into strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. 

However, generally,  randomness in deep learning is often managed through techniques like:

* **Setting a random seed:**  This initializes the random number generator, ensuring reproducibility of results. Different runs with the same seed will produce identical outputs.

* **Dropout:**  Randomly "dropping out" (ignoring) a percentage of neurons during training. This prevents overfitting by forcing the network to learn more robust features.

* **Batch normalization:**  Normalizing the activations of each layer, reducing internal covariate shift and stabilizing training.

* **Data augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training dataset by applying random transformations (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) to existing data.


Keep in mind that these are common practices, and the specific strategies employed can vary depending on the task and the deep learning framework used.
