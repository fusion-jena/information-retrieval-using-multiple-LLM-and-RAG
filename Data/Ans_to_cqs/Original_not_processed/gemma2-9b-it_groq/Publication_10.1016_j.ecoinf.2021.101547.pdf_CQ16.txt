Answer:::
The provided text describes the training process of a deep learning network, particularly focusing on the ResNet-50 architecture, but it doesn't specify the criteria used to determine when training is complete. 

The text mentions concepts like mini-batch training, epochs, loss scores, and validation, but it doesn't elaborate on how these factors are used to signal the end of training.  

Possible criteria for determining training completion, not mentioned in the text, include:

* **Validation loss plateau:**  As training progresses, the model's performance on a separate validation dataset is monitored. If the validation loss stops decreasing and plateaus, it might indicate that the model has stopped learning effectively and further training might lead to overfitting.
* **Maximum number of epochs:**  A predefined limit on the number of training epochs can be set. Training stops after this limit is reached.
* **Achieving a target accuracy:**  If a desired level of accuracy on the validation set is specified, training can stop when this target is met.
