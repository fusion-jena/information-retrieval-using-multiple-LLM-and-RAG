Answer:::
The text states that an early stopping method was used to prevent overfitting.  The specific criteria for determining when training is complete is the patience parameter, which is set at 10 epochs for all training phases.  

Essentially, training continues until the model's performance on a validation set doesn't improve for 10 consecutive epochs.  At that point, training stops, and the model weights from the best performing epoch are saved.
