Answer:::

The provided text describes the model selection process and performance evaluation but doesn't explicitly mention specific techniques used to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. 

The text does state that:

* **Nine algorithms were evaluated using AUC-ROC and Cohen's KAPPA metrics.** This suggests some level of model comparison and selection based on performance across different algorithms.
* **Cross-validation was employed.** This is a common technique to assess model performance on unseen data and improve generalization.

However, details about the specific cross-validation strategy (e.g., k-fold cross-validation, leave-one-out cross-validation) or the dataset splitting methods (e.g., stratified splitting) are not provided. 


Therefore, while cross-validation was likely used, the exact measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model remain unclear based on the given information.
