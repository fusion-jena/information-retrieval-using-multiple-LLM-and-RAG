Answer:::
The text describes a feedback mechanism called active learning to optimize the system and monitor performance. 

Here's how it works:

1. **Periodic Image Forwarding:** At certain intervals, the system selects images and sends them to humans for annotation.

2. **Iterative Training:** The annotated images are then used to train a classifier. This process is repeated iteratively.

3. **Test Set Evaluation:**  A retained test set of manually annotated images is used to evaluate the system's performance.
