Answer:::
The provided text focuses on a specific deep learning model for bee image classification and doesn't explicitly detail the criteria used to split the data into training, testing, and validation sets. 

However, common practices in deep learning model development suggest the following general criteria:

* **Training Set:** This is the largest portion of the data (typically 70-80%) used to train the model. The model learns patterns and relationships within this dataset.

* **Validation Set:** A smaller portion of the data (around 10-15%) is reserved for validation. This set is used during training to monitor the model's performance on unseen data and make adjustments to hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate) to prevent overfitting.

* **Test Set:**  The remaining data (around 10-15%) is held out completely until the end of training. The test set provides an unbiased evaluation of the final model's performance on data it has never encountered before.

The specific split ratios can vary depending on the size and nature of the dataset.
