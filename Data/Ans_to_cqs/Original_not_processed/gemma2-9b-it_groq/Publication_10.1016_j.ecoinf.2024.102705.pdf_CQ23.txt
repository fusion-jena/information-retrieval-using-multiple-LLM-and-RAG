Answer:::

The provided text doesn't specify the exact measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. 

While it mentions that the method demonstrates superior performance across a diverse range of environments, it doesn't elaborate on the specific techniques used during training and evaluation, such as:

* **Diverse dataset:**  It states the model was trained on a large dataset, but doesn't detail its composition or diversity.
* **Cross-validation:**  There's no mention of cross-validation techniques used to assess the model's performance on unseen data.
* **Stratified splitting:**  The text doesn't describe any stratified splitting methods employed for data partitioning. 


Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively say what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
