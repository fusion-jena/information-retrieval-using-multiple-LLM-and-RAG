Answer:::
The deep learning model described in the Lassalle et al. (2022) paper is used for **individual tree crown delineation**.  

This means the model is designed to identify and outline the boundaries of individual mangrove tree crowns within very-high-resolution satellite imagery.  

This type of task falls under **segmentation**, a category of computer vision where the goal is to partition an image into meaningful segments or objects. In this case, the objects are individual mangrove tree crowns.
