Answer:::

The provided text describes the methodology used in the study but doesn't specify the exact measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. 

It mentions using a dataset of 2207 SOCS (Soil Organic Carbon Stocks) at depths from 0 to 20 cm from 2010 to 2014.  However, it doesn't elaborate on:

* **Dataset Diversity:** Whether the dataset represents a diverse range of environmental conditions and soil types.
* **Cross-Validation:**  If techniques like k-fold cross-validation were employed to assess the model's performance on unseen data.
* **Stratified Splitting:** Whether the dataset was split into training and testing sets in a stratified manner to maintain the distribution of key variables.


Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively say what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
