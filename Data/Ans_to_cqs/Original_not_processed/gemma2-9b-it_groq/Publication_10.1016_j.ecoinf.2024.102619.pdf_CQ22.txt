Answer:::
The provided text lists several metrics used to evaluate the deep learning model's performance.  These include:

* **Accuracy:**  The proportion of images the model classifies correctly.
* **Recall (Sensitivity):** The proportion of images of each class that were correctly classified.
* **Precision:** The accuracy of the predictions; it measures the proportion of images assigned to a correct class.
* **F1 Score:**  A harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of performance. 


The text also mentions that these metrics are scored between 0 and 1, with 1 representing optimal performance.
