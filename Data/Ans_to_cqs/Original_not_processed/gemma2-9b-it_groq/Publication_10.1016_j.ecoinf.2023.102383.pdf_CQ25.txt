Answer:::
The provided text describes a deep learning model used for **object detection**. 

Object detection models are designed to identify and locate specific objects within an image. They achieve this by:

1. **Extracting feature maps:** Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as the backbone, the model analyzes the image and creates feature maps that highlight important visual features.

2. **Generating region proposals:** A region proposal network identifies potential regions within the image that might contain objects.

3. **Classifying and localizing objects:**  The model classifies each region proposal as containing an object or not and refines the region's boundaries to accurately represent the object's location (bounding box).
