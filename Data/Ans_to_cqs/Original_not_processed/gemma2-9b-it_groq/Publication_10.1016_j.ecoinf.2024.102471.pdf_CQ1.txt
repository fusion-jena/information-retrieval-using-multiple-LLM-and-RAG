Answer:::

The provided text focuses on deep learning applications in bird species identification and doesn't explicitly detail data collection methods used in the broader deep learning pipeline. 

However, based on general knowledge and the context given, we can infer some possibilities:

* **Public Datasets:** The text mentions using datasets like the one from the Central Poultry Development Organization (CPDO) for bird vocalization recognition. This suggests public datasets are a common source of raw data for training deep learning models.
* **Sensors:**  Given the focus on audio data (bird calls), it's likely that sensors like microphones are used to capture raw audio recordings. 
* **Surveys:** While not directly mentioned, surveys involving human observation and recording of bird species and their calls could contribute to the creation of labeled datasets used for training. 


It's important to note that this is not an exhaustive list, and the specific methods used for data collection vary greatly depending on the application and the type of data being collected.
