Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the drying of Lake Urmia and doesn't contain information about preprocessing steps for deep learning models.  

To answer your query about preprocessing steps for deep learning, here are some common ones:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values (imputation or removal), removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1 or -1 to 1) can improve model performance. Common methods include min-max scaling and z-score normalization.

* **Feature Scaling:**  Similar to normalization, this adjusts the scale of features to prevent features with larger magnitudes from dominating the learning process.

* **Encoding Categorical Features:**  Convert categorical variables (e.g., colors, categories) into numerical representations that the model can understand. Techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding are used.

* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones can sometimes improve model performance. This involves domain knowledge and understanding the data.

* **Data Splitting:** Dividing the data into training, validation, and test sets is crucial for evaluating model performance and preventing overfitting.
