The provided text focuses on the architecture and structure of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for specific applications (stained/unstained and clubmoss/spikemoss classification). It doesn't delve into the preprocessing steps involved in training deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Normalization:** Scaling pixel values to a specific range (e.g., 0 to 1) to improve model training stability and convergence.
* **Scaling:**  Similar to normalization, but often involves subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of the data.
* **Cleaning:** Removing noise, outliers, or irrelevant information from the data. This can involve techniques like removing blank pixels, handling missing values, or filtering out artifacts.
* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training dataset by applying transformations like rotations, flips, crops, and color adjustments. This helps improve model robustness and generalization.
