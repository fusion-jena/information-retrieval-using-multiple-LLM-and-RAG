Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the application of machine learning models, particularly neural networks, in a specific context (likely water quality analysis). While it mentions data splitting techniques like K-fold and stratified sampling for model training and validation, it doesn't delve into the specific preprocessing steps applied to the data before training. 

However, based on general machine learning practices, here are some common preprocessing steps used before training a deep learning model:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values (imputation or removal), identifying and removing outliers, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1 or -1 to 1) can improve model performance.

* **Standardization:**  Transforming data to have zero mean and unit variance. This is often used for algorithms sensitive to feature scales.

* **Encoding Categorical Features:** Converting categorical variables (e.g., text labels) into numerical representations that the model can understand (e.g., one-hot encoding, label encoding).

* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones to potentially improve model accuracy.

The specific preprocessing steps used would depend on the nature of the data and the chosen deep learning model.
