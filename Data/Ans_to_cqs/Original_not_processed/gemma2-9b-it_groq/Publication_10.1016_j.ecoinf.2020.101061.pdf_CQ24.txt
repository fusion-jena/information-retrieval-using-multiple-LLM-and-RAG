Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning for tree crown detection and doesn't delve into specific strategies for handling randomness within the deep learning pipeline. 

It does mention:

* **Random subsampling of annotations:**  During the sensitivity study, different proportions of training data (5%, 25%, 50%, 75%) were randomly selected to evaluate the model's performance. This introduces randomness in the training data selection.
* **Multiple runs for sensitivity study:** The experiment with varying training data proportions was repeated five times to account for the randomness introduced by the subsampling.

However, the text doesn't explicitly discuss techniques like setting random seeds for reproducibility or strategies for mitigating randomness in other stages of the pipeline (e.g., weight initialization, dropout).
