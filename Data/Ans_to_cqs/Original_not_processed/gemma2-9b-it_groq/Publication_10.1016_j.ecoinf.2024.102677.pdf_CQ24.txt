Answer:::

The provided text describes the dataset splitting and model training process but doesn't explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. 

However, it does state that the dataset was randomly divided into training, validation, and testing sets. This implies the use of a random seed to ensure reproducibility. 

Randomness is often introduced in deep learning through:

* **Data shuffling:** Randomly ordering data samples during training to prevent the model from learning patterns based on the data's original sequence.
* **Weight initialization:** Assigning random initial values to the model's weights.
* **Dropout:** Randomly "dropping out" (ignoring) a percentage of neurons during training to prevent overfitting.

To mitigate the impact of randomness and ensure reproducibility, practitioners often set a random seed value at the beginning of their code. This ensures that the same random numbers are generated each time the code is run, leading to consistent results.
