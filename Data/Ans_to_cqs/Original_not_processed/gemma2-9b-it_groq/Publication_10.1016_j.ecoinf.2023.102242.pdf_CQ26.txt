Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the challenges of training data quantity and representativeness for deep learning classification models, particularly in the context of high-resolution remote sensing data. 

While it mentions the importance of representative training samples to avoid misclassification, it doesn't delve into specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing.  

Therefore, I cannot answer your query about techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection based on the given context.
