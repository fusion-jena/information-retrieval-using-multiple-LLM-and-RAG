Answer:::
The provided text mentions the following metrics for evaluating the performance of the deep learning model:

* **Overall accuracy:** This metric quantifies the overall correctness of the model's predictions. 
* **Kappa coefficient:** This metric is specifically highlighted as a comprehensive measure for evaluating detection accuracy, especially for binary classification tasks like distinguishing between burned and unburned pixels.

The text also discusses the concept of **user's accuracy** and **producer's accuracy**, which are related to the precision and recall of the model, respectively. However, it doesn't explicitly state these terms as metrics used for evaluation.
