Answer:::
The provided text focuses on land cover classification using remote sensing imagery and machine learning algorithms.  It mentions the use of Landsat-8 satellite data, which is typically in image format. 

While the text discusses incorporating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in future studies, it doesn't specify the exact data formats they would use. 

Based on common practices in deep learning, it's likely that CNNs and DNNs would process the Landsat-8 imagery directly, which would be in a raster format.
