Answer:::
The provided text describes the process of training a deep learning model for point cloud segmentation but doesn't mention specific techniques used to ensure the model's generalizability.  It does state that a hold-out method was used to split the data into a training set (70%) and a test set (30%). 

However, it doesn't elaborate on whether the dataset itself was diverse or if techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting were employed.
