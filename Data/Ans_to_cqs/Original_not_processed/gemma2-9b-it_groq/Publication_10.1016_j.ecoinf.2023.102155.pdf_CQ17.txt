Answer:::
The provided text focuses on penalized regression techniques like lasso, ridge, and elastic net used in traditional machine learning, not deep learning.  

While these methods share the goal of preventing overfitting, they are not directly applicable to deep learning pipelines. 

Deep learning commonly uses regularization techniques such as:

* **Dropout:** Randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during training, forcing the network to learn more robust features.
* **L2 Regularization (Weight Decay):** Adds a penalty to the sum of squared weights in the network. This discourages the weights from becoming too large, preventing overfitting.
* **L1 Regularization (Lasso):**  Similar to L2 but uses the sum of absolute values of the weights. This can lead to some weights becoming exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection.
