Answer:::
The provided text describes the use of a validation set to monitor model performance during training. 

The dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets in an 8:1:1 ratio. The training set was used to adjust the model's parameters, while the **validation set's performance (measured by R value)** was used to evaluate the model and fine-tune its hyperparameters. 


This process ensures that the model is not simply memorizing the training data but is also generalizing well to unseen data.
