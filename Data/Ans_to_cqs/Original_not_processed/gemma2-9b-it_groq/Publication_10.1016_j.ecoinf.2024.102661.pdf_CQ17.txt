Answer:::
The provided text mentions L2 regularization as a method used to prevent overfitting in the TPEBO-LSTM model. 

It states: "L2 regularization parameter: Adjusting this helps control overfitting by penalizing large weights. The search range for this parameter is set between 1e-2 and 1e-10, in line with benchmarks from similar studies."

The text does not mention other regularization methods like dropout.
