Answer:::
The provided text describes the training process and architecture of deep learning models but doesn't specify the exact preprocessing steps taken before training. 

However, it does mention data augmentation techniques used during training:

* **Image scaling:** Resizing images to a standard size.
* **Horizontal and vertical flip:** Mirroring images horizontally and vertically to increase dataset size and robustness.
* **Perspective distortion:**  Simulating changes in viewpoint to make the model more generalizable.
* **Adding color jitter:** Randomly adjusting brightness, contrast, and saturation to introduce variations in image appearance. 


It's common for deep learning models to undergo additional preprocessing steps before training, such as:

* **Normalization:** Scaling pixel values to a specific range (e.g., 0 to 1) to improve training stability.
* **Mean subtraction:** Subtracting the mean pixel value from each image to center the data distribution.
* **Cleaning:** Removing noise, artifacts, or irrelevant information from images. 



The specific preprocessing steps used would depend on the dataset and the chosen deep learning model.
