Answer:::
The provided text describes several hyperparameters used in the deep learning model:

* **Optimizer:** Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2015)
* **Learning rate:** Initially set at 0.001, reduced by a factor of 0.1 every five epochs when the validation loss remains constant. Minimum learning rate is 1 × 10<sup>-5</sup>.
* **Batch size:** Fixed at 16.
* **Weight decay:** 1 × 10<sup>-5</sup>.
* **Hyperparameter λ in Eq. (4):** Set to 0.8.
* **Mk in Eq. (5):** Defined as 2k+1 (k = 1, 2, …K).
* **β in Eq. (6):** Set to 0.4.
