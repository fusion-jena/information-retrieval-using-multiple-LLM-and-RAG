Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning for bird species identification and doesn't delve into specific strategies for handling randomness within the deep learning pipeline. 

However,  randomness is inherent in many aspects of deep learning, such as:

* **Initialization:**  Weights and biases in neural networks are often initialized randomly.

* **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):** This common optimization algorithm uses random mini-batches of data to update model parameters.
* **Dropout:** A regularization technique that randomly "drops out" neurons during training to prevent overfitting.

To mitigate the impact of randomness and ensure reproducibility, practitioners often employ the following strategies:

* **Setting a Fixed Random Seed:**  Specifying a seed value for the random number generator ensures that the same random numbers are generated in each run, leading to consistent results.

* **Using Deterministic Training Loops:** Carefully controlling the order of operations and data processing within the training loop can reduce the influence of randomness.
* **Ensemble Methods:** Training multiple models with different random initializations and averaging their predictions can reduce the variance introduced by randomness.
