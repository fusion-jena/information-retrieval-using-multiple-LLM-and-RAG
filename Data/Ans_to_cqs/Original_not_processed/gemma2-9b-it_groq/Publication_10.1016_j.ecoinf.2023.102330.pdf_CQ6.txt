Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the application of a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) for detecting Northern Bobwhite covey calls and doesn't delve into the specific preprocessing steps involved in training the model. 

However, common preprocessing steps for training deep learning models generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves removing noise, irrelevant information, or corrupted data points from the dataset. For acoustic data, this might mean filtering out background noise or removing segments with silence.

* **Normalization:** Scaling the input data to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1) can improve model performance. This ensures that features with different scales don't disproportionately influence the learning process.

* **Feature Engineering:**  Transforming raw data into more meaningful features can enhance model accuracy. For acoustic data, this could involve extracting features like Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) which capture the spectral characteristics of sound.

* **Segmentation:**  Dividing the audio data into smaller, manageable segments can be beneficial for training. This allows the model to focus on individual sound units (e.g., covey calls) rather than the entire audio file.


Keep in mind that the specific preprocessing steps will depend on the characteristics of the dataset and the chosen deep learning model.
