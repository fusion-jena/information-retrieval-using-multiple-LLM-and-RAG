Answer:::
The provided text focuses on ecological informatics, specifically modeling water content in post-mining landscapes. It doesn't discuss machine learning training criteria like validation loss plateau.  

To answer your query about training completion criteria, here are some common ones:

* **Validation Loss Plateau:**  As the model trains, its performance on a separate validation dataset is monitored. Training stops when the validation loss stops improving significantly, indicating the model might be overfitting (performing well on training data but poorly on unseen data).
* **Maximum Epochs:** A predetermined number of training epochs (passes through the entire dataset) is set. Training stops after reaching this limit.
* **Early Stopping:**  A variation of plateau detection, where training stops if validation loss doesn't improve for a specified number of epochs.
* **Desired Performance Metric:** Training might stop when a target performance level (e.g., accuracy, F1-score) is achieved on the validation set.
