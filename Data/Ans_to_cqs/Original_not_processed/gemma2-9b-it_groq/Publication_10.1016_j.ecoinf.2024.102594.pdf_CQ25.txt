Answer:::
The provided text describes a deep learning model called MRS_DeepLabV3+ that combines the results of two other models: DeepLabV3+ and MRS. 

DeepLabV3+ is a **semantic segmentation** algorithm. Semantic segmentation is a type of deep learning model that assigns a class label to each pixel in an image. 

MRS_DeepLabV3+ uses the segmentation results from DeepLabV3+ and integrates them with classification results from MRS.
