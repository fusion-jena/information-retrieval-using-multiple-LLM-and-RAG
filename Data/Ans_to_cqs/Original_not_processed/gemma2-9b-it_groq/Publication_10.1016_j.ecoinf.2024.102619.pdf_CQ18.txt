Answer:::
The provided text does not describe the specific strategy used to monitor model performance during training. 

It does mention the following:

* **Mean cross-validation (CV) accuracy:** This metric is reported for each classifier, indicating its average performance across multiple folds of the dataset.
* **Final training accuracy:** This metric represents the model's performance on the entire training dataset after the training process is complete.

However, it doesn't explain how these metrics were calculated, how often they were monitored during training, or if any other performance indicators were used.
