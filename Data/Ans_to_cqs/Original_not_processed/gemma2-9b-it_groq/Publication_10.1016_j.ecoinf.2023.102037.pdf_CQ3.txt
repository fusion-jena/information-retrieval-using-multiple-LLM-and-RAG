Answer:::
The provided text does not specify the exact data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipelines described. 

While it mentions datasets like "Pest24" with 25,378 annotated images and the use of object detection, insect vs. non-insect separation, and multi-class insect classification, it doesn't detail the specific annotation methods employed for these tasks. 

Possible techniques that could have been used include:

* **Bounding box annotation:** Drawing boxes around individual pests in the images.
* **Instance segmentation:**  Creating a segmentation mask for each individual pest, outlining its precise shape.
* **Classification labels:** Assigning each image a label indicating the species of pest present. 


To determine the precise annotation techniques used, you would need to consult the original research papers or documentation for the specific datasets and models mentioned.
