Answer:::
The provided text focuses on describing the architecture and characteristics of different deep learning models (ResNet-50, InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2) but doesn't explicitly state the overall purpose of the deep learning models used in the study. 

However, based on the information given:

*  The text mentions "evaluation of model performance was based on the accuracy metric" and "multi-class classification tasks." 

This strongly suggests that the deep learning models are being used for **image classification**.
