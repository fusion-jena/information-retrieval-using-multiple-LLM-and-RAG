Answer:::

The provided text focuses on various deep learning applications and model architectures but doesn't delve into specific strategies for handling randomness within the deep learning pipeline. 

However, I can offer some general information on how randomness is managed in deep learning:

* **Random Seed Initialization:**  Deep learning models often initialize weights randomly. Using a fixed random seed ensures that the same random weights are generated every time a model is trained, making the results reproducible.

* **Dropout:** This regularization technique randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during each training step. This prevents overfitting and introduces some randomness into the training process.

* **Batch Normalization:** This technique normalizes the activations of neurons within each mini-batch, helping to stabilize training and reduce the impact of random variations in the data.

* **Data Augmentation:**  Randomly applying transformations (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) to training data introduces variations and helps the model generalize better to unseen data.

To get more specific information about randomness handling in a particular deep learning framework or model, you would need to consult the documentation or research papers related to that specific implementation.
