Answer: 

The provided text focuses on the applications of deep learning in ecology and doesn't delve into specific data preprocessing techniques for addressing bias.  

However, based on general knowledge of deep learning, here are some common techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing:

* **Stratified Splitting:** This technique ensures that the training, validation, and test sets have a similar distribution of target variable classes as the original dataset. This helps prevent overrepresentation or underrepresentation of certain classes during training.

* **Oversampling:** This involves duplicating instances from underrepresented classes to balance the dataset. Techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) can create synthetic instances for better representation.

* **Undersampling:** This involves removing instances from overrepresented classes to balance the dataset.

* **Diverse Data Collection:**  This is a preventative measure that aims to collect data from a wide range of sources and representative samples to minimize inherent biases in the initial dataset.
