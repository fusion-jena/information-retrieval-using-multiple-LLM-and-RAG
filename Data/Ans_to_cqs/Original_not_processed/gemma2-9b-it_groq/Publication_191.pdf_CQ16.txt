Answer:::
The provided text states that the learning rate is decreased by a factor of 10 when the validation set accuracy stops improving. It also mentions that training is stopped after 100K iterations. 

Therefore, training is considered complete when:

1. **Validation accuracy plateaus:** The model stops showing improvement on the validation set.
2. **100K iterations are reached:**  Training is terminated after a fixed number of iterations, regardless of validation accuracy.
