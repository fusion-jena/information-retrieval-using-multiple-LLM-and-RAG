Answer:::
The text mentions the following metrics for evaluating the performance of the deep learning models:

* **Nashâ€“Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE)**:  Measures the relative magnitude of the residual variance, indicating how well the model's estimates fit the observed data. 
* **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**:  A measure of the average difference between the model's predictions and the actual values.
* **Percentage bias (PBIAS)**:  Indicates the tendency of the model to overestimate or underestimate the values. 


The text does not mention accuracy, precision, or recall.
