Answer:::
The provided text doesn't specify the exact optimization methods used for hyperparameter tuning in the proposed model.  

While it mentions that traditional image enhancement pipelines rely on engineers adjusting hyperparameters based on experience, the text focuses on using a compact non-local network (NLPP) to automate this process. 

It suggests that the NLPP is more efficient than manual tuning but doesn't delve into the specific algorithms used to optimize the network's hyperparameters.
