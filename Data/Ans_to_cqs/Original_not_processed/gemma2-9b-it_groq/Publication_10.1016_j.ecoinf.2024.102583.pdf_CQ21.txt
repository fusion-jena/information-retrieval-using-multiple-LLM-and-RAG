Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the effectiveness of various machine learning algorithms for landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) and doesn't delve into specific post-processing steps after model training. 

However, based on common practices in machine learning, here are some post-processing steps typically involved:

* **Metrics Calculation:**  Performance of the trained model is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC (Area Under the Curve). These metrics quantify the model's ability to correctly classify landslide-prone and non-prone areas.

* **Confusion Matrix:** A confusion matrix is a visual representation that summarizes the performance of a classification model by showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

* **Saliency Maps:** Saliency maps highlight the input features that contribute most to the model's prediction for a specific instance. This helps understand which factors are driving the model's decision and can provide insights into landslide susceptibility.

* **Threshold Optimization:**  For binary classification problems (landslide vs. no landslide), the model output often needs to be thresholded to create a binary classification map.  The optimal threshold is determined to balance sensitivity (detecting landslides) and specificity (avoiding false alarms).

* **Visualization:**  The final landslide susceptibility map is often visualized using color gradients to represent the probability of landslide occurrence. This allows for easy interpretation and communication of the results.



Keep in mind that the specific post-processing steps may vary depending on the chosen machine learning algorithm, the nature of the data, and the goals of the landslide susceptibility analysis.
