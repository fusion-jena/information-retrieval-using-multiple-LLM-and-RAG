Answer: The provided text describes an experiment using deep learning models for image classification.  

It states: "The softMax layer finally exponentially normalizes the input that it gets from (fc8), thereby producing a distribution of values across the 38 classes that add up to 1. These values can be interpreted as the confidences of the network that a given input image is represented by the corresponding classes." 


This indicates the deep learning model is used to classify images into 38 different classes.
