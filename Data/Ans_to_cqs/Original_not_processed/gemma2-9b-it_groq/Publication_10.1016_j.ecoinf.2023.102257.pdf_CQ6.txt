Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the evaluation of a pre-trained ML model for wildlife tagging and doesn't delve into the specific preprocessing steps involved in training a deep learning model. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1) can improve model performance.

* **Feature Engineering:**  Creating new features from existing ones can enhance the model's ability to learn patterns.

* **Encoding Categorical Data:** Converting categorical variables into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding) is often necessary for deep learning algorithms.

* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training data by applying transformations like rotations, flips, and crops can improve generalization. 


Remember that the specific preprocessing steps will vary depending on the nature of the data and the chosen deep learning model.
