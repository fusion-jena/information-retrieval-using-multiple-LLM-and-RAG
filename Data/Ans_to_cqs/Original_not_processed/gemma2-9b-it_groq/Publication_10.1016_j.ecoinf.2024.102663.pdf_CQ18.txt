Answer:::
The provided text does not describe the specific strategy used to monitor model performance during training. 

It does, however, list various performance metrics used to evaluate the trained models, including:

* Variance
* R2 score
* Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
* MAE/R2 ratio 


These metrics likely played a role in assessing the models' performance, but the exact method of monitoring during training is not detailed.
