Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the training of hybrid machine learning models (XGBoost and LightGBM) using Bayesian optimization and TDO, not deep learning models. Therefore, it doesn't describe preprocessing steps specific to deep learning. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.
* **Feature Scaling:**  Transforming features to a similar scale to prevent features with larger magnitudes from dominating the learning process. Common techniques include standardization (z-score normalization) and min-max scaling.
* **Encoding Categorical Features:** Converting categorical variables into numerical representations that deep learning models can understand. One-hot encoding is a common method.
* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a specific range, often between 0 and 1, to improve model stability and convergence.
* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training data by applying transformations to existing data points (e.g., rotations, flips, crops for images).


Keep in mind that the specific preprocessing steps will depend on the nature of the data and the deep learning model being used.
