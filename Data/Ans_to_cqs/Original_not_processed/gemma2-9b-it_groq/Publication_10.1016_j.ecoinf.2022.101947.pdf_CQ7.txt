Answer:::
The provided text focuses on validating a deep learning algorithm for Amur tiger footprint classification and doesn't explicitly detail the criteria used to split the data for training, testing, and validation. 

However, it does mention "holdback trials" and "test/training set size" combinations. This suggests a common practice in machine learning:

* **Holdback Trials:**  A technique where a portion of the data is held back (the "holdback set") and used to evaluate the model's performance after training. This helps assess how well the model generalizes to unseen data.

* **Test/Training Set Size:**  The data is typically divided into two main sets:

    * **Training Set:** Used to train the deep learning model. The model learns patterns and relationships within this data.
    * **Test Set:** Held separate from the training data and used to evaluate the final performance of the trained model. This provides an unbiased estimate of how well the model will perform on new, unseen data.

The text describes experimenting with different ratios of test to training data (e.g., 32:12, 20:24) to find the optimal combination for accurate population estimation. 


It's likely that a validation set was also used alongside the training and test sets. A validation set is a subset of the training data used during the training process to monitor performance and fine-tune hyperparameters (settings that control the learning process).
