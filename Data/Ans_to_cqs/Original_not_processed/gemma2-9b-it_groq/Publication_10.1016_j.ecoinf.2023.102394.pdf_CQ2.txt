Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning in soil carbon mapping and ecological informatics. It doesn't specify the exact data formats used in the deep learning pipelines for these applications. 

However, based on the context and common practices in deep learning, we can infer that the data formats likely include:

* **Geospatial data:** This could involve raster data (e.g., satellite imagery, elevation maps) or vector data (e.g., soil boundaries, land cover polygons) representing soil properties, topography, and land use.
* **Climate data:**  Datasets like TerraClimate (mentioned in the references) provide high-resolution climate variables (temperature, precipitation, etc.) that are likely used as input features.
* **Soil property data:**  This could be tabular data (CSV format) containing soil characteristics like texture, organic matter content, and pH.

It's also possible that other data formats, such as time series data or sensor readings, are incorporated depending on the specific deep learning models and applications.
