The provided text focuses on the model training process, particularly the use of transfer learning, pre-trained weights, and Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning.  

It doesn't describe any post-processing steps performed after model training, such as:

* **Saliency maps:**  Visualizing which parts of the input data are most influential in the model's decision.
* **Metrics calculation:**  Quantifying the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc. (although it does present these metrics in the tables).
* **Confusion matrix:**  A table showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, providing a detailed view of classification performance. 



Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what post-processing steps were used.
