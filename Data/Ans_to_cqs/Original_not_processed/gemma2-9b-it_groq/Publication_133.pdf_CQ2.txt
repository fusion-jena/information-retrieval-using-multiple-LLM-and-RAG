Answer:::
The text states that the project uses "trap images".  It also mentions "associated programming code". 

Therefore, the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are likely:

* **Image:** This is explicitly mentioned as the primary data source.
* **Code:**  The programming code is likely used to process the images, train the deep learning model, and analyze the results.
