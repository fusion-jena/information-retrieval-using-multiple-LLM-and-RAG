Answer:::
The provided text describes a survey of weed datasets. It mentions that the datasets were collected through a systematic search of major databases like Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and arXiv. 

The search used keywords related to "weed dataset", "weed database", "agriculture", "machine vision", and "computer vision".  The Python library "scholarly" was used to automate the retrieval of publication records from Google Scholar. 


The text doesn't explicitly mention other methods for collecting raw data, such as sensors or direct data collection.
