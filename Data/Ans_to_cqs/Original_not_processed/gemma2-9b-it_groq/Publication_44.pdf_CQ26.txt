Answer:::
The provided text focuses on image segmentation techniques and the architecture of deep learning models like DeepLab and VGG16. It doesn't discuss techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing.  

To answer your question about data bias mitigation techniques, here are some common methods:

* **Stratified Splitting:**  Dividing your dataset into training, validation, and test sets while proportionally maintaining the class distribution present in the original data. This helps ensure that each subset represents the overall data balance.

* **Oversampling:** Increasing the number of instances in underrepresented classes. This can be done by duplicating existing samples, generating synthetic samples, or using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).

* **Undersampling:** Reducing the number of instances in overrepresented classes. This can involve randomly removing samples or using techniques like cluster centroids to select representative samples.

* **Diverse Data Collection:**  Actively seeking out and incorporating data from a wider range of sources and perspectives to minimize biases introduced by a limited or homogeneous dataset.
