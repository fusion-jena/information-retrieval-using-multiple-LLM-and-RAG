Answer:::
The provided text describes the development and application of a deep learning model for **regression**. 

Specifically, the model aims to predict the Total Suspended Solids (TSI) concentration in water samples based on two input features: aCDOM(254) and Fn(355).  

The text mentions using the model for calibration and validation, assessing its performance through metrics like the coefficient of determination (R2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE). These are standard evaluation measures for regression models.
