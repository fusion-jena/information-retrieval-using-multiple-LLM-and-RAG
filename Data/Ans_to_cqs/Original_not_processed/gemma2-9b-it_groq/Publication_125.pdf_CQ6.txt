The provided text focuses on a specific deep learning model for satellite image classification and doesn't detail the general preprocessing steps for training deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps generally include:

* **Normalization:** Scaling pixel values to a specific range (e.g., 0 to 1) to improve model training stability.
* **Scaling:**  Similar to normalization, but the scaling factor might be different depending on the data distribution.
* **Cleaning:** Removing noise, outliers, or irrelevant data points from the dataset. This can involve techniques like removing missing values, handling duplicates, or identifying and removing corrupted data. 

There might be other preprocessing steps specific to the type of data used (e.g., image resizing, color space conversion for images).
