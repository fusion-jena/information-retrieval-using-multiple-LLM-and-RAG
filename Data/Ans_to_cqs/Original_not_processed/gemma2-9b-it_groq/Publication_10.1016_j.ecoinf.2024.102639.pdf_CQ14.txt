Answer:::
The provided text describes the optimization of hyperparameters for both SVM and PCA-SVM models. 

For **SVM**, the regularization parameter ('C') and kernel type (linear) are optimized using a combination of **grid search** and **cross-validation**. This approach systematically explores a range of values for these hyperparameters and evaluates their performance using cross-validation to find the combination that minimizes the cross-validation error.

When using **non-linear SVMs**, the kernel coefficient ('gamma') is also optimized via **grid search**.

The text doesn't specify the optimization method used for the number of components in PCA for PCA-SVM.
