Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the challenges and solutions related to training deep learning models for bird song recognition, particularly concerning the need for labeled reference data.  

While it doesn't explicitly detail the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, we can infer some possibilities based on the context:

* **Sensors:** The text mentions "sensor characteristics" influencing model performance, suggesting that acoustic sensors are used to record bird songs.
* **Public Datasets:** The authors refer to "BirdCLEF competitions" which utilize "weakly-labeled audio" likely sourced from public datasets.
* **Crowdsourcing Platforms:** The text discusses the use of "crowdsource" data collection platforms like Zooniverse for acquiring labeled data. This implies that raw audio recordings might be collected through these platforms as well.

It's important to note that the text primarily focuses on the data labeling and training aspects of deep learning for bird song recognition, not the initial data acquisition methods.
