Answer:::
The provided text describes the training process of an artificial neural network (MLPNN) but doesn't explicitly state the criteria used to determine when training is complete. 

However, it does mention:

* **Iterative error back-propagation:** The training process involves adjusting connection weights based on the error between the network's output and the expected values.
* **Target minimal error:** Training continues until a target minimum error is reached.
* **Training iterations:** The network is trained for a fixed number of iterations (500 in this case).

Based on this information, we can infer that training is likely considered complete when:

1. **The error reaches a target minimum:** This suggests that the network has learned to make accurate predictions.
2. **The predefined number of training iterations is reached:** Even if the error hasn't reached the target minimum, training might stop after a certain number of iterations to prevent overfitting.


It's also possible that **validation loss plateau** is used as an additional criterion, although the text doesn't explicitly mention it.
