Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning for fish biomass estimation in aquaculture and doesn't delve into the specific preprocessing steps involved in training such models. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

* **Normalization:** Scaling the features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1) can improve model performance.

* **Scaling:** Similar to normalization, scaling adjusts the range of features to prevent certain features from dominating the learning process.

* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones can sometimes enhance model accuracy.

* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training data by applying transformations (e.g., rotations, flips) can improve generalization. 


It's important to note that the specific preprocessing steps used will depend on the nature of the data and the chosen deep learning model.
