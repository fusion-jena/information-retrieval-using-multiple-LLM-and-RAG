Answer:::

The provided text describes using a leave-one-out cross-validation approach for evaluation.  

In this method, the data is split in a way that each data point (image in this case) is used as a test set exactly once.  The remaining data is used for training the model. This process is repeated for each data point, effectively using all data points for both training and testing. 

The text doesn't explicitly mention separate train, test, and validation sets being used for training the model.
