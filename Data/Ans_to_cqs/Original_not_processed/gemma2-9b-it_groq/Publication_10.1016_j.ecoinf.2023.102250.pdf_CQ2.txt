Answer:::
The provided text focuses on a specific deep learning application for birdsong classification and doesn't explicitly mention the data formats used in the broader pipeline. 

However, we can infer the following:

* **Spectrograms:** The text discusses "transformed spectrograms" used as input for the CNN models, indicating that audio data is processed into spectrograms for analysis. 
* **Images:** The text mentions generating images and using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), suggesting that image data is also involved.

Therefore, based on the context, we can infer that the deep learning pipeline likely uses **audio data (processed into spectrograms)** and **image data**.
