Answer:::
The provided text describes a dataset split into training and testing sets, but it doesn't specify the criteria used for splitting the data for deep learning model training (train, test, and validation).  It mentions two approaches:

1. **Biased Dataset:** 70% of the data is randomly selected for training, and 30% for testing. This distribution isn't perfectly balanced across all species due to varying numbers of images per species.

2. **Unbiased Dataset:**  All images of a given specimen are either used for training or testing, ensuring that no single specimen is split between the two sets.

The text focuses on the potential bias introduced by the biased dataset split and doesn't delve into the specifics of a typical deep learning training pipeline that would include a validation set.
