Answer:::
The provided text does not specify the exact method used for hyperparameter optimization. 

It mentions that "certain components, such as the dynamic gating mechanism, may still require fine-tuning" and suggests "the development of automatic parameter optimization techniques can help mitigate this issue." 

However, it doesn't describe any specific techniques used in the current model development.
