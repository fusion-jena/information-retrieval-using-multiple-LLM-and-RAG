Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the fine-tuning of a pre-trained deep learning model for wildlife detection in aerial imagery. It doesn't delve into the specific preprocessing steps involved before training the model initially. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves removing irrelevant or corrupted data points, handling missing values, and addressing outliers.
* **Normalization:** Scaling pixel values to a specific range (e.g., 0 to 1) can improve model performance and stability.
* **Augmentation:** Techniques like rotation, flipping, and cropping can be applied to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset.
* **Resizing:** Images are often resized to a standard resolution suitable for the chosen model architecture.

Specific preprocessing techniques will vary depending on the dataset and the deep learning model being used.
