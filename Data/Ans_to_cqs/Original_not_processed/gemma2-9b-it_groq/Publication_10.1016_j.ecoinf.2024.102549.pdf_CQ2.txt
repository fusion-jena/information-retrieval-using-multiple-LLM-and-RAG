Answer:::
Based on the provided text, the deep learning pipeline in this study uses **image** data. 

The text repeatedly mentions CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) and their application in processing imagery for tasks like:

* Image scene classification
* Estimating cyanobacteria levels
* Identifying and classifying algal species 


The text also describes a CNN model architecture with layers designed to process image data (convolutional layers, ReLU activation functions, pooling layers, and fully connected layers).
