Answer:::
The provided text describes the use of a random shuffle of the dataset before splitting it into training, validation, and test sets. It also mentions repeating this random partition ten times to reduce the influence of random splitting. 

The text does not explicitly mention strategies like setting a random seed value. However, the repeated random partitioning suggests an attempt to mitigate the impact of randomness on the model's performance.
