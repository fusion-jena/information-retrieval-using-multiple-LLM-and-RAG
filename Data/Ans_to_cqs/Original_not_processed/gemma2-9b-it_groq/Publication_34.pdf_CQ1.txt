Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning for species distribution modeling and doesn't specify the exact methods used for collecting the raw data.  It mentions "citizen programs in biodiversity sciences" and "fine geolocated plant species observations" suggesting that data collection likely involves:

* **Citizen science initiatives:**  Where volunteers contribute observations of plant species.
* **Botanical surveys and expeditions:**  Scientists conducting field surveys to record plant species locations. 

It's also possible that existing public datasets from herbaria, museums, and conservatories are used.
