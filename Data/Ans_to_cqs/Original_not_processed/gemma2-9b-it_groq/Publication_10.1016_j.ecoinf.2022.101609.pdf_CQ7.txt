Answer:::
The provided text states that the dataset is typically split into training, test, and validation datasets. 

* **Training data** is used to train the model.
* **Validation data** is used to select the best-performing model after training. 
* **Test data** is used for final evaluation of the selected model.

The text also mentions that randomisation and stratification are common practices for splitting the data, especially when dealing with class imbalance. However, in this specific case, the problem is described as a time-series problem, implying that the data might be split based on time periods rather than class imbalance. 


The exact criteria for splitting the data in this specific scenario are not detailed in the provided text.
