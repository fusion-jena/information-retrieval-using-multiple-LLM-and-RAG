Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the use of GPUs in deep learning and mentions popular deep learning software tools like TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch. However, it doesn't delve into specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. 

To answer your query about optimization techniques, here are some commonly used ones:

* **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):** A fundamental optimization algorithm that iteratively updates model weights based on the gradient of the loss function calculated on a small batch of data.

* **Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation):** An adaptive learning rate method that combines momentum and adaptive learning rates, often outperforming SGD.

* **RMSprop (Root Mean Square Propagation):** Another adaptive learning rate method that addresses the issue of vanishing gradients.

* **AdaGrad (Adaptive Gradient Algorithm):**  An early adaptive learning rate method that scales the learning rate inversely proportional to the accumulated squared gradients.

These are just a few examples, and many other optimization techniques exist. The choice of optimization algorithm depends on factors like the specific deep learning model, dataset, and desired performance.
