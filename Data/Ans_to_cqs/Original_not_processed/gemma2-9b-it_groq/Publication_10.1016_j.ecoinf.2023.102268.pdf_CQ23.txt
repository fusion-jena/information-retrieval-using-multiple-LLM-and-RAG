Answer:::

The text states that the labeled dataset was split into 70% training and 30% testing data.  50% of the training data was held out for validation.  A 10-fold cross-validation was used to define the score-to-posterior-probability transformation function. 

These steps suggest the following measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model:

* **Train-test split:**  Dividing the data into training and testing sets is a standard practice to evaluate how well a model generalizes to unseen data.
* **Validation set:** Using a portion of the training data for validation helps prevent overfitting, where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on new data.
* **Cross-validation:** 10-fold cross-validation is a technique that further improves the robustness of the model by training and evaluating it on different subsets of the data multiple times. 



The text does not mention whether the dataset was specifically designed to be diverse.
