Answer:::

The provided text focuses on ecological prioritization using the ZONATION 5.0 model and doesn't delve into the post-processing steps typically involved in model training for machine learning tasks. 

Post-processing steps like saliency maps, metric calculation, and confusion matrix construction are common in fields like computer vision and natural language processing, where models are trained to make predictions. 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer your query about post-processing steps in model training.
