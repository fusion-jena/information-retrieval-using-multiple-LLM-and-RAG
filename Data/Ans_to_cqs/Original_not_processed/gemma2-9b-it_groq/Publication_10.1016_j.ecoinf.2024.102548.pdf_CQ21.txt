Answer:::
The provided text focuses on aspects of neural network architecture, training, and evaluation metrics. It doesn't delve into specific post-processing steps like saliency maps or confusion matrix construction. 

While it mentions accuracy as an evaluation metric and touches upon the concept of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, it doesn't explicitly describe how these are used to build a confusion matrix. 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot provide details on the post-processing steps involved after model training.
