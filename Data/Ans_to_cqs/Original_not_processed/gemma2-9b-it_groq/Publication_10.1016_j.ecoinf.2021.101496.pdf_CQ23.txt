Answer:::
The provided text does not describe any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. 

It mentions that the model was fitted using the Keras package in Python 3.8 and that 100 successful runs were performed to analyze the model residuals. However, it doesn't elaborate on the dataset used for training and testing the model or any techniques employed to prevent overfitting.
