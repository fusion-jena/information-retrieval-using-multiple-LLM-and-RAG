Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the development and application of a deep learning model called DeepMeerkat for hummingbird detection in time-lapse camera trap footage.  

While it describes the model's architecture and training process, it doesn't explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used to prepare the training dataset. 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what data annotation techniques were employed.
