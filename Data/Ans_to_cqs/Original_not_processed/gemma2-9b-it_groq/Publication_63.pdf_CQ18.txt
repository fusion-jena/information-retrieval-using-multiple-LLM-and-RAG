Answer:::
The model performance was monitored by calculating the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of the validation dataset after each epoch.  This allowed the researchers to track the training progress and identify when the model started to overfit (when the validation MAE diverged from the training MAE). Training was stopped when the validation MAE no longer improved compared to the previous epochs.
