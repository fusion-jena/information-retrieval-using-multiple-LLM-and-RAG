Answer:::
The provided text focuses on Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and doesn't specify preprocessing steps for general deep learning models.  

However, common preprocessing steps before training a deep learning model include:

* **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies.
* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1 or -1 to 1) to prevent features with larger magnitudes from dominating the learning process.
* **Standardization:** Transforming data to have zero mean and unit variance. This can improve the performance of some algorithms.
* **Encoding Categorical Features:** Converting categorical variables into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding) that models can understand.
* **Feature Scaling:** Techniques like min-max scaling or standardization can be used to ensure features have similar scales.
