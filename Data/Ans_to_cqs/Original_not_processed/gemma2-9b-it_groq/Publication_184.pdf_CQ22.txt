Answer:::
The provided text states that the following metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model:

* **Recall:**  Calculated as TP / (TP + FN), where TP is the number of True Positives and FN is the number of False Negatives.
* **Precision:** Calculated as TP / (TP + FP), where TP is the number of True Positives and FP is the number of False Positives.
* **Average Precision (AP):**  A metric that considers the performance of a model at different confidence thresholds.
