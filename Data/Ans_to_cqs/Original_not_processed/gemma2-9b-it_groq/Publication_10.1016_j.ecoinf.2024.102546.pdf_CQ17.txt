Answer:::
The provided text does not specify the exact regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.  While it mentions "regularizations for feature consistency" in the context of the I3Net model, it doesn't elaborate on the specific types of regularization employed. 


Therefore, based on the given information, I cannot answer what regularization methods (like dropout or L2 regularization) were used.
