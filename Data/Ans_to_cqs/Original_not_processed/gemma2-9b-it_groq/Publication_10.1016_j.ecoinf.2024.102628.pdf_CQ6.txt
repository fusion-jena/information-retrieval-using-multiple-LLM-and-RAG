Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the specific implementation details of a deep learning model for forest classification and HAND prediction using 2D LiDAR images. It doesn't explicitly describe the preprocessing steps involved before training the model. 

However, it does mention the use of a Convolutional Autoencoder for feature extraction.  Autoencoders often involve data normalization as part of their training process to ensure stable learning. 

Generally, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models include:

* **Normalization:** Scaling pixel values to a specific range (e.g., 0 to 1) to prevent features with larger magnitudes from dominating the learning process.
* **Scaling:**  Similar to normalization, but often involves subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of each feature.
* **Cleaning:** Removing noise, outliers, or irrelevant data points from the dataset. This can involve techniques like median filtering or removing data points that fall outside certain thresholds.

Without more specific information about the dataset and the model architecture, it's impossible to say for sure what exact preprocessing steps were used.
