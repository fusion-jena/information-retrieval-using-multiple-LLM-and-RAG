Answer:::
The text states that 10-fold cross-validation was used during the training process to eliminate bias.  It also mentions that mean RMSE was used as the objective function (loss function). 

Therefore, the strategy implemented to monitor model performance during training involved:

1. **10-fold cross-validation:**  The data was split into 10 parts, and the model was trained and evaluated 10 times, each time using a different part of the data for testing. This helps to get a more robust estimate of the model's performance.
2. **Mean RMSE:** The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) was calculated for each fold and then averaged to obtain the mean RMSE. This metric was used to track the model's performance and guide the optimization process.
