Answer:::
The provided text focuses on describing the architecture and training process of the TrunkNet model for saliency detection.  It doesn't offer details about specific measures taken to ensure the model's generalizability, such as:

* **Diverse dataset:**  While it mentions using public datasets, it doesn't specify the diversity of these datasets (e.g., image types, object categories, lighting conditions).
* **Cross-validation:**  The text doesn't describe any cross-validation techniques used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
* **Stratified splitting:**  There's no mention of stratified splitting for data partitioning during training and validation. 


Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot determine what specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the TrunkNet model.
