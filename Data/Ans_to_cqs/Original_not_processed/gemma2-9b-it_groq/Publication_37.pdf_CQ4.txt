Answer:::
The text describes the following data augmentation techniques applied to flight calls:

* **Adding background noise:**  Four different field recordings of nighttime geophony (sounds from natural sources) are used to add background noise to the audio.
* **Dynamic range compression:** Four different compression parameterizations are applied: music, film, speech, and radio.
* **Pitch shifting:**  Both conservative ( -0.5, -0.25, 0.25, 0.5 semitones) and less conservative ( -2, -1, 1, 2 semitones) pitch shifts are used.
* **Time stretching:** Four different stretching ratios (0.81, 0.93, 1.07, 1.23) are applied. 


These augmentations are implemented using the MUDA library.
