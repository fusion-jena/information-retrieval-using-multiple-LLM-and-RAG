Answer:::

The provided text focuses on building a specific neural network model for predicting TSI using DOM optical parameters and doesn't delve into general preprocessing steps for deep learning models. 

However, based on common practices in deep learning, here are some preprocessing steps often involved:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values (imputation or removal), identifying and removing outliers, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1 or -1 to 1) can improve model performance. Common methods include min-max scaling and z-score normalization.

* **Feature Engineering:**  Creating new features from existing ones can sometimes enhance model accuracy. This might involve combining variables, transforming them (e.g., taking logarithms), or encoding categorical features.

* **Encoding Categorical Features:**  Converting categorical variables into numerical representations is necessary for most deep learning models. Techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding are commonly used.

The specific preprocessing steps will depend on the nature of the data and the chosen deep learning model.
