Answer:::
The provided text focuses on data augmentation techniques used to increase the size and diversity of training data for deep learning models, particularly in the context of plant identification. It doesn't discuss techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing. 

However, some common techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing stage of a deep learning pipeline include:

* **Stratified splitting:** This technique ensures that the training, validation, and test sets have a similar distribution of target classes as the original dataset. This helps prevent bias towards majority classes during training.
* **Oversampling:** This involves duplicating instances of minority classes to balance the class distribution in the dataset.
* **Undersampling:** This involves removing instances from majority classes to balance the class distribution.
* **Diverse data collection:**  This involves actively seeking out and including data from a wide range of sources and representing different demographics, viewpoints, and perspectives. This helps mitigate bias that may arise from a limited or unrepresentative dataset.
