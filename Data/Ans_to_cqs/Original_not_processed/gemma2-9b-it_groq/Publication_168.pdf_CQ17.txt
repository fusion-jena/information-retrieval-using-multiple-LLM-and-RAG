The provided text focuses on the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification and doesn't delve into specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting.  

Therefore, I cannot answer your question about regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization from the given context.
