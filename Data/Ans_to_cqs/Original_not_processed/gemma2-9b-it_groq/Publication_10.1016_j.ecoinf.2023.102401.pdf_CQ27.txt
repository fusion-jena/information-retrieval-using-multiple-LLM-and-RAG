Answer:::
The provided text describes the process of training the YWnet model for underwater target detection but doesn't specify the exact process followed for deploying the trained model.  

It mentions preparing hardware servers capable of training deep learning models, tuning hyperparameters, and using the SRC3 block for feature extraction. However, it doesn't detail how the trained model weights are saved, the platform chosen for deployment, or any specific deployment strategies used.
