Answer:::
The provided text describes the methodology used for training machine learning models, including the use of a repeated nested k-fold cross-validation approach. 

Specifically, a 10-fold cross-validation was used to divide the data into holdout data and data for model development. An inner 5-fold cross-validation was then employed to minimize bias caused by hyperparameter tuning.  

The text doesn't explicitly mention the use of a diverse dataset or stratified splitting.
