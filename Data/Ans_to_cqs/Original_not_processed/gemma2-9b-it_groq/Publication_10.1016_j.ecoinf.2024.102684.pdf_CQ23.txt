Answer:::

The text describes the use of a standard machine learning hyperparameter search over two sites to mitigate computational costs.  

To evaluate the models and avoid overfitting, the dataset was split into training (60%), validation (20%), and testing (20%) subsets.  

While the text mentions the importance of generalization and acknowledges limitations of simple data partitioning, it doesn't explicitly state the use of techniques like diverse dataset creation, cross-validation, or stratified splitting beyond the basic train-validation-test split.
