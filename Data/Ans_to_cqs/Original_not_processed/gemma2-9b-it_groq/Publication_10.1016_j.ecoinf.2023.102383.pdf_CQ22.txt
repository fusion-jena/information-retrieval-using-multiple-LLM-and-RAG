Answer:::
The provided text mentions **Average Precision (AP)** as a metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models. 

It states that FRC_ResNet152FPN obtains the best detection performance for small objects with an AP of 78.3%.  The text also refers to  "detection precision and recall trade-offs"  as a way to assess the overall effectiveness of a model.
