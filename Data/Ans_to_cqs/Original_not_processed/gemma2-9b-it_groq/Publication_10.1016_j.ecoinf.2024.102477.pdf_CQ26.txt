Answer:::

The provided text focuses on deep learning methods for time-series prediction, particularly the SLSTM model. It doesn't discuss techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing. 

To answer your query about techniques to address data bias, here are some common methods used in deep learning preprocessing:

* **Stratified Splitting:** This technique ensures that the training, validation, and test sets have a similar distribution of target variable classes as the original dataset. This helps prevent bias towards certain classes during model training.

* **Oversampling:** This involves duplicating instances of minority classes to balance the dataset and reduce the impact of class imbalance.

* **Undersampling:** This technique removes instances from the majority class to balance the dataset.

* **Diverse Data Collection:**  This involves actively seeking out and including data from a wide range of sources and demographics to minimize biases that may arise from a limited or homogeneous dataset.
