Answer:::
The provided text does not specify the exact optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.  While it mentions training DNN models with datasets like NIPS4Bplus and BirdCLEF 2020, it doesn't delve into the specific algorithms used for model optimization (e.g., SGD, Adam, RMSprop).
