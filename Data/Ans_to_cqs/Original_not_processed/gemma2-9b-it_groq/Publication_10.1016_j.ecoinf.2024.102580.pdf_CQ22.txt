Answer:::
The provided text states that the performance of the semantic segmentation model was evaluated using the following metrics:

* **Accuracy:**  The overall accuracy of the model was 92%.
* **Precision:**  Precision measures how many of the predicted instances were actually correct.  The precision for the vegetation class was 0.90, for the bare class was 0.96, and for the 'other' class was 0.50.
* **Recall:** Recall measures how many of the actual instances were correctly identified by the model. The recall reached 0.97 for vegetation, 0.87 for bare substrate, and 0.53 for the 'other' class.
