Answer:::
The provided text focuses on integrating machine learning and deep learning into animal behavior studies, particularly for predicting behavioral patterns and mapping animal movement trajectories. 

While it mentions the predictive capabilities of these techniques, it doesn't explicitly state the specific purpose of the deep learning model used in this context. 

Therefore, based on the given information, I cannot definitively say what the purpose of the deep learning model is (e.g., classification, segmentation, detection).
