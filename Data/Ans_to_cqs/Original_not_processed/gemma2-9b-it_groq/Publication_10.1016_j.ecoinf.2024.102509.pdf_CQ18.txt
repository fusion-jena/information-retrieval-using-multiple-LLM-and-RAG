Answer:::
The provided text describes the development and evaluation of an artificial neural network (ANN) model for predicting soil organic carbon (SOC) values.  

While it mentions the use of a loss function to guide the training process, it doesn't explicitly state the specific strategy used to monitor model performance *during* training. 

The text focuses more on:

* The architecture of the ANN model (input, hidden, and output layers).
* The selection of the number of hidden layers and neurons through trial and error.
* The software package used for training (R's 'neuralnet').
* The evaluation metrics used *after* training (Adjusted R-squared, Mean Squared Error, AIC, BIC). 


Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot determine the specific strategy employed to monitor model performance during training.
