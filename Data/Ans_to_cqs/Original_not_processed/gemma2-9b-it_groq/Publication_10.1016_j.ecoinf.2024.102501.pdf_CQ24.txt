Answer:::

The provided text focuses on dissolved oxygen concentration prediction using various machine learning models and doesn't delve into specific strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. 

However, it's common practice in deep learning to address randomness through techniques like:

* **Setting a random seed:** This initializes the random number generator, ensuring reproducibility of results. Different runs with the same seed will produce identical outputs.

* **Dropout:** A regularization technique that randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during training. This prevents overfitting by preventing the model from relying too heavily on any single neuron.

* **Batch normalization:**  A technique that normalizes the activations of neurons within each layer, reducing the internal covariate shift and stabilizing training.

* **Data augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training dataset by applying random transformations (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) to existing data.


Keep in mind that these are general strategies, and the specific techniques used may vary depending on the deep learning model and the nature of the problem being addressed.
