Answer:::
The provided text states that the ResNet50 model is initialized with ImageNet weights from Keras. It also mentions using the AdamW optimizer from Keras. 

Therefore, **Keras** is a framework used to build the deep learning model. 


The text does not explicitly mention TensorFlow or PyTorch.
