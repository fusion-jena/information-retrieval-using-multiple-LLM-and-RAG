Answer:::
The provided text describes the dataset curation and model training process but doesn't explicitly mention specific techniques used to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as:

* **Diverse dataset:** While the text mentions using a dataset called "Weed25," it doesn't elaborate on the diversity of the dataset in terms of weed species, environmental conditions, or image acquisition methods. 
* **Cross-validation:** The text doesn't describe any cross-validation strategies used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
* **Stratified splitting:**  There's no mention of stratified splitting techniques used to ensure balanced representation of different weed classes in the training and testing sets.


Therefore, based on the information provided, it's impossible to definitively say what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
