Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the performance evaluation of a Random Forest classification model, not a deep learning model.  

The metrics used to evaluate the Random Forest model are:

* **Overall Accuracy (O.A.)**:  The proportion of correctly classified samples out of the total validation samples.
* **Producer Accuracy (P.A.)**: The proportion of accurately classified "present" samples out of all samples classified as "present".
* **User Accuracy (U.A.)**: The proportion of accurately classified "absent" samples out of all samples classified as "absent".
