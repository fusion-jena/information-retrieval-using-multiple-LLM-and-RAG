Answer:::
Deep learning models can process a variety of data formats.  

Commonly used formats include:

* **Image:**  Images are often represented as multi-dimensional arrays of pixel values. Common image formats include JPEG, PNG, and TIFF.

* **Audio:** Audio data is typically represented as a waveform, which can be stored as a series of numerical values representing sound pressure over time. Common audio formats include WAV, MP3, and FLAC.

* **Video:** Video data is a sequence of images, so it can be processed similarly to images. Common video formats include MP4, AVI, and MOV.

* **Text:** Text data is represented as a sequence of words or characters. It can be processed using techniques like word embeddings and recurrent neural networks. Common text formats include plain text (.txt), CSV, and JSON.

* **CSV:**  Comma-separated values (CSV) is a simple format for storing tabular data, where each line represents a data point and each value is separated by a comma.

* **Other:** Deep learning models can also be trained on other types of data, such as numerical data, sensor readings, and time series data.
