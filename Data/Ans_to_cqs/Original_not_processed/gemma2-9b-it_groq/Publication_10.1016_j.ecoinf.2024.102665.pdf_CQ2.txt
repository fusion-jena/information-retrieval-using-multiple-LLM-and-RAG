Answer:::
Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline likely uses **image** data. 

Here's why:

* **"underwater spectral images enables dense taxonomic mapping of benthic habitats"**: This statement directly mentions the use of underwater images for ecological analysis.
* **"Automatic underwater fish species classification with limited data using few-shot learning"**: This paper title suggests the use of images for fish species identification.


The context doesn't explicitly mention other data formats like audio, video, or CSV.
