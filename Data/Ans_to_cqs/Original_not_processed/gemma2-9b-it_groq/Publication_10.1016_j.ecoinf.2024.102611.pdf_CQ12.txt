Answer:::
The provided text mentions several deep learning models used in plant leaf recognition, including:

* **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network):**  Specifically, a deep CNN based on global average pooling is used in Azadnia et al. (2022) for medicinal plant identification.
* **VGG-16:** Adapted and used in Barhate et al. (2023) for classifying 32 plant species.
* **ResNet-50:** Utilized in Ganguly et al. (2022) for capturing leaf feature patterns via fusion learning. 


The text does not explicitly state the type of deep learning model used in the "pipeline"  without further context.
