Answer:::
The provided text states that the performance of the deep learning models is evaluated using the following metrics:

* **Precision:**  A measure of how many of the predicted positive cases are actually correct.
* **Recall:** A measure of how many of the actual positive cases are correctly predicted.
* **F-score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of both. 


The text also mentions the calculation of **Confidence Intervals (CI)** for precision and recall to estimate the uncertainty associated with these metrics.
