Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the application of machine learning in fisheries biology and doesn't delve into the specifics of addressing data bias during the preprocessing stage of a deep learning pipeline. 

Therefore, I cannot answer your query based on the given context. 

To learn about techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection for addressing data bias in deep learning, I recommend consulting resources on machine learning preprocessing and bias mitigation.
