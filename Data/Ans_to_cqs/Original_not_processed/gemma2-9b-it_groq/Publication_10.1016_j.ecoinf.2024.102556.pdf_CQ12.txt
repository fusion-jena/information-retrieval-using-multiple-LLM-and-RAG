Answer:::
The provided text describes a deep learning model that utilizes a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. 

Several clues point to this:

* **Convolutional Layers:** The text repeatedly mentions "convolutional layers" and "convolutional kernels," which are fundamental components of CNNs.
* **Feature Extraction:** The model's primary function is "feature extraction," a core task for CNNs.
* **Image Processing:** The context discusses features extracted from "images," a typical input for CNNs.
* **Specific CNN Architectures:** The text mentions architectures like Res2Net, CBS (Convolution+BatchNorm+SiLU), ELAN (Efficient Layer Aggregation Networks), and MPConv (Hybrid Convolutional), all of which are variations or components commonly found in CNNs.
