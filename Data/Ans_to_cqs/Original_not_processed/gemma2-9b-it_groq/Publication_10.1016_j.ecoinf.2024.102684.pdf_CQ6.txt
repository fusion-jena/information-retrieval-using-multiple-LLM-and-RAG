Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the architecture and hyperparameter tuning of a deep learning model for invasion prediction, but it doesn't explicitly detail the preprocessing steps applied to the image data before training. 

However, it does mention "data augmentation techniques" used to increase the training data's variability. These techniques likely involve modifications to the original images, such as:

* **Rotation:** Rotating the images by a certain angle.
* **Horizontal/Vertical Flip:** Mirroring the images horizontally or vertically.
* **Width/Height Shift Range:** Shifting the image horizontally or vertically within a specified range.
* **Shear Range:** Applying a shearing transformation to the image.
* **Zoom Range:** Zooming in or out on the image within a specified range.
* **Brightness Range:** Adjusting the brightness of the image.

Common preprocessing steps generally include:

* **Normalization:** Scaling pixel values to a specific range (e.g., 0 to 1) to improve model stability and convergence.
* **Scaling:**  Similar to normalization, but might involve different scaling factors.
* **Cleaning:** Removing noise, artifacts, or irrelevant information from the images.

Without further information from the source, it's impossible to confirm if these specific preprocessing steps were used.
