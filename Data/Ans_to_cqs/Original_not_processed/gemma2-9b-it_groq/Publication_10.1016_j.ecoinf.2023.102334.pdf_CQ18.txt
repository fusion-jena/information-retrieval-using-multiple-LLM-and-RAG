Answer:::
The provided text describes the model's performance evaluation after training, not the monitoring strategy during training.  

It states that the model's performance was assessed by comparing it to five other models using a fixed experimental setup. The results, including loss rate and accuracy, are illustrated in Figure 11.  

The text highlights the proposed model's stability based on the smoothness of the curves and small fluctuations during training and testing.  

However, it does not specify the metrics or techniques used to monitor the model's performance *in real-time* during the training process.
