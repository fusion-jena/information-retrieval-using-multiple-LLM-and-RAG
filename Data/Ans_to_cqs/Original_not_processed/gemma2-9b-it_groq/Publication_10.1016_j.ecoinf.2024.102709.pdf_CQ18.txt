Answer:::
The provided text states that the performance of the model was monitored by investigating the YOLO training losses and mAP50 values of each model. 

Specifically, the text says: "The split with the highest mAP50 value indicates the highest number of correctly predicted labels for the model trained on a specific split. We used the  YOLO loss function was divided into three parts (Zafar et al., 2018)."

mAP50 (mean Average Precision at 50%) is a common metric for evaluating object detection models. It measures the accuracy of the model in detecting objects at different confidence levels. A higher mAP50 value indicates better performance.
