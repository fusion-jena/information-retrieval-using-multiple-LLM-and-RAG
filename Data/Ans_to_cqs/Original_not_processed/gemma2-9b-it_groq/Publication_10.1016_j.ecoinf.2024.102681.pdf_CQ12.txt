Answer:::
The pipeline uses a hybrid model called CNN-LSTM (C-L).  

This is stated in the text: "This study compiled a comprehensive dataset to delve deeper into the temporal dynamics of various factors' influence on drought propagation. This dataset encompassed various influencing factors alongside an extensive drought propagation time series spanning from January 1950 to December 2020. By employing a sliding window method with a window size of 30 years and a step size of one year, we successfully generated forty-two distinct datasets, each corresponding to a separate  Kaur, A., Sood, S.K., 2020.
