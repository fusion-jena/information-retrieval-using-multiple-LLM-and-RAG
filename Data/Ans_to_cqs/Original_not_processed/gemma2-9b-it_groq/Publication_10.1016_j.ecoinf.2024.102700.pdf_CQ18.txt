Answer:::
The provided text does not describe the specific strategies used to monitor model performance during training. 

It primarily focuses on:

* The types of model validation methods used in studies (e.g., internal validation, external validation).
* The prevalence of studies that did not explicitly state or implement a validation method.
* The types of ecological modelling approaches and specific models employed in the reviewed literature.
* The nature of model results, mainly species spatial predictions. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer your query about the model performance monitoring strategy during training.
