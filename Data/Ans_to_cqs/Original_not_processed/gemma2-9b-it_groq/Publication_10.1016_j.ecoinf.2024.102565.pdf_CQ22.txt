Answer:::
The text provides information about four specific metrics used to evaluate the deep learning model:

* **Coefficient of determination (R2):** This metric quantifies the proportion of variance in the dependent variable (TSM concentration) explained by the independent variable (wind speed) in the model. 
* **Mean bias error (MBE):**  This metric assesses the average bias of the model's predictions. A positive MBE indicates a tendency to overestimate the true values.
* **Root mean square error (RMSE):** This metric calculates the square root of the average squared difference between predicted and actual TSM concentrations.
* **Mean absolute error (MAE):** This metric represents the average absolute difference between predicted and actual TSM concentrations. 


The text states that a superior model performance is indicated by higher R2 scores, lower RMSE and MAE scores, and an MBE close to zero.
