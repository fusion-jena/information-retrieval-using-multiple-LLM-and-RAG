Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the generation of synthetic data using deep learning methods, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). It doesn't delve into the specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. 

Therefore, I cannot answer your query about data annotation techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation based on the given context.
