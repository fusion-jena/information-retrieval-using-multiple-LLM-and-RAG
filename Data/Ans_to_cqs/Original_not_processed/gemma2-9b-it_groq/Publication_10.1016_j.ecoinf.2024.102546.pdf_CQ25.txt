Answer:::
Based on the provided context, the deep learning models are primarily used for **object detection**. 

Several references mention using deep learning for "weed detection" and "precision weeding."  

For example:

* **Rahman et al. (2022)** state: "Deep neural networks for weed detections towards precision weeding."
* **Ahmad et al. (2021)** focus on "classifying and detecting common weeds."
* **Beck et al. (2021)** present a dataset specifically for "computer vision tasks in agriculture," which often involves object detection. 

The context also includes details about specific object detection models like YOLOX and YOLOv8, further supporting this conclusion.
