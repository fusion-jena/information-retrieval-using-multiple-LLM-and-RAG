Answer:::
The provided text mentions the use of  Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) data for generating initial training data in the deep learning pipeline. It also states that the study utilizes data from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) site.  

While the text doesn't explicitly detail the specific sensors or methods used by NEON to collect data, it's likely they employ a combination of remote sensing technologies, including:

* **Optical sensors:**  For capturing multispectral or hyperspectral imagery of the study site.
* **LIDAR:** As mentioned, LIDAR is used for generating initial training data. 

It's also possible that NEON collects ground-truth data through field surveys and manual annotations, which are used to refine the deep learning models.
