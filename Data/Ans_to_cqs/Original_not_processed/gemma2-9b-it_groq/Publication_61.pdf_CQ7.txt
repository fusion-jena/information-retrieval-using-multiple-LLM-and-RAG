The provided text focuses on the training process of a specific deep learning model for cactus recognition and doesn't mention the criteria used to split data into training, testing, and validation sets.  

To answer your question generally:

Data for deep learning models is typically split into three sets:

* **Training set:** This is the largest portion of the data used to train the model. The model learns patterns and relationships within this data.
* **Validation set:** This set is used to evaluate the model's performance during training. It helps to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting (where the model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data).
* **Test set:** This set is held out entirely from the training process and is only used to evaluate the final performance of the trained model on unseen data. 

The typical split ratios are:

* 70-80% for training
* 10-15% for validation
* 10-15% for testing 


These ratios can be adjusted depending on the size and nature of the dataset.
