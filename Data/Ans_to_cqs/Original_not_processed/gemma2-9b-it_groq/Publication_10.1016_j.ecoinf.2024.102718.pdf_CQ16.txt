Answer:::
The provided text mentions the use of callbacks like `EarlyStopping`, `ReduceLROnPlateau`, and `ModelCheckpoint` to dynamically modify the learning rate and monitor training progress. 

Specifically, `EarlyStopping` is likely used to halt training when there is no significant improvement in validation accuracy for a predefined number of epochs. This prevents overfitting, where the model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data.

`ReduceLROnPlateau` adjusts the learning rate based on the validation loss. If the validation loss plateaus or starts increasing, the learning rate is reduced to help the model escape local minima and continue learning.

`ModelCheckpoint` saves the model weights at specific intervals or when certain criteria are met (e.g., best validation accuracy). This ensures that the best-performing model is preserved throughout training.
