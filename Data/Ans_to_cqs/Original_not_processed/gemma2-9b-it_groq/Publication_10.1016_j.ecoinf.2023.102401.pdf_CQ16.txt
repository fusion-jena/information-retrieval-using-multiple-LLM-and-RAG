Answer:::
The provided text focuses on describing the YWnet object detection model and its performance evaluation. It doesn't specify the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete. 

However, it does mention:

* **Iterative training and evaluation:** The training process involves repeatedly training the model, evaluating its performance on a test set, and adjusting parameters based on the results.
* **Satisfactory level of performance:** Training is considered complete when the desired level of performance is achieved.

Based on common machine learning practices,  likely criteria for determining training completion include:

* **Validation loss plateau:**  If the loss on the validation set stops decreasing significantly, it could indicate overfitting and signal the end of training.
* **Performance metrics:** Reaching a target accuracy, recall, F1-score, or other relevant metric on the validation set might signify satisfactory performance.
* **Time constraints:**  Training can be stopped after a predetermined amount of time if a satisfactory performance level isn't reached. 



It's important to note that the specific criteria used would depend on the specific goals of the project and the characteristics of the dataset.
