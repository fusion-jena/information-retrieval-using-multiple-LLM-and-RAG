Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the design and implementation of a deep learning model for toxicovigilance, outlining the data collection, model architecture, and performance evaluation techniques. 

However, it does not explicitly mention specific techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing stage.  

While the text states that the dataset was split into training and testing subsets using `train_test_split` and that the subsets were balanced to ensure an even distribution of individuals from both control and pesticide-exposed groups, it doesn't elaborate on whether additional bias mitigation strategies like oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection were employed.
