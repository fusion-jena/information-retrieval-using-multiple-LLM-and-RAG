Answer:::
While the provided text describes the structure and components of a deep learning model, it doesn't explicitly state the specific purpose of the model being discussed. 

We can infer that the model is likely used for **classification** based on the following:

*  The text mentions "classification process" occurring after feature extraction.
*  The text refers to "SoftMax activation function layer," which is commonly used in the final layer of a classification model.
*  The performance metrics mentioned (Accuracy, Precision) are standard evaluation metrics for classification tasks.


However, without further information from the source material, we cannot definitively confirm the model's purpose.
