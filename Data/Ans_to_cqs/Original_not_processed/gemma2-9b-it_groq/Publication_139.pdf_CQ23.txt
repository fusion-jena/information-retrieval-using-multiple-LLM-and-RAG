Answer:::
The text describes the use of five-fold cross-validation to assess the model's generalizability.  

Here's a breakdown:

* **Five-fold cross-validation:** The dataset was divided into five equal parts. The model was trained on four parts and tested on the remaining part. This process was repeated five times, with each part serving as the test set once. The final reported accuracy is the average of the results from all five folds. 

The text doesn't mention other techniques like data augmentation, stratified splitting, or details about the dataset's diversity.
