Answer:::
The provided text does not specify the exact hyperparameters used in the BEiT model, such as the learning rate or optimizer.  It does mention a sensitivity study that investigated the impact of parameters like learning rate, batch size, regularization intensity, and training epochs. However, it doesn't reveal the specific values used in the experiments or the optimal settings found.
