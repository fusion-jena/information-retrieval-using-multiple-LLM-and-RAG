Answer:::
The provided text describes splitting data into training and testing sets to assess a deep learning model's generalization power.  

It mentions dividing the data into four non-overlapping subsites to maximize independence between training and testing sets. This suggests a strategy based on **data provenance** (where the data comes from) rather than a specific algorithm for splitting. 

The text also highlights the potential pitfalls of randomly dividing a single dataset, as it can lead to overestimating performance. 

However, it **doesn't explicitly state the criteria** used for splitting the data into train, test, and validation sets.
