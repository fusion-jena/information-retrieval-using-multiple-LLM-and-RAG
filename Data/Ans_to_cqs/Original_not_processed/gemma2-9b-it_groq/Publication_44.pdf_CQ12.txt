Answer:::
The provided text describes a pipeline that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). 

Several clues point to this:

* **"Fully convolution neural network for semantic segmentation"**: This phrase explicitly states the type of network used.
* **Mention of ResNet-101 and Xception**: These are both architectures based on CNNs.
* **Descriptions of operations like convolutions, atrous convolutions, and depth-wise separable convolutions**: These are all fundamental operations in CNNs.
