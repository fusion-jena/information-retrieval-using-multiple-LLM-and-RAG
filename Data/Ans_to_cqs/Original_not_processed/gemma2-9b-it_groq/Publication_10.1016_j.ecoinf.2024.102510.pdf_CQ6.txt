Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the performance of different pre-trained models and hyperparameter tuning techniques. It doesn't offer details about specific preprocessing steps involved in training deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.
* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1) can improve model training stability and speed.
* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones can sometimes enhance model performance.
* **Encoding Categorical Variables:** Converting categorical data (e.g., text labels) into numerical representations suitable for model training. 


Let me know if you have other questions about the provided text or deep learning concepts in general.
