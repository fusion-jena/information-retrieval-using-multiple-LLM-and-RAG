Answer:::
The provided text describes the experimental setup and results of various YOLOv8 model modifications but doesn't specify the exact criteria used to determine the completion of training. 

It mentions the number of epochs (150) and other training parameters like batch size, learning rate, and optimizer, but it doesn't state whether training stops based on validation loss plateau, a specific accuracy threshold, or other metrics.
