Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training was to use a validation dataset. 

This dataset, separate from the training dataset, consisted of images that the model had not seen during training.  The model's accuracy and loss (error) were computed on this validation dataset after each epoch (one pass through the entire training dataset). 

This allowed the researchers to assess if the model was learning effectively and to detect overfitting, which occurs when a model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data.
