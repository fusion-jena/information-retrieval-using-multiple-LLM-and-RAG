Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the design and optimization of a lightweight deep learning model called SIAlex for bird voice recognition.  

While it mentions that the two convolution layers are merged in the model deployment mode to improve computational efficiency, it doesn't specify the exact process followed for deploying the trained model. 

Therefore, I cannot answer your query about the specific process used for model deployment (e.g., model serialization, platform selection) based on the given context.
