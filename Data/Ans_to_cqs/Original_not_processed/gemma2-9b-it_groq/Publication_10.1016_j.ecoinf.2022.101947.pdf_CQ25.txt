Answer:::
The provided text describes a method for identifying individual Amur tigers using their footprints.  It mentions a "FIT pairwise comparison model" and its use in classifying trails of footprints. 

While the text doesn't explicitly state the type of deep learning model used (classification, segmentation, or detection), based on the description, it's most likely a **classification** model. 

Here's why:

* **Classification:**  The model aims to categorize each trail of footprints into a specific tiger individual. This involves assigning a label (the identity of the tiger) to each input (a trail of footprints).

* **Segmentation:**  Segmentation involves dividing an image into distinct regions or segments. This doesn't seem to be the primary goal described in the text.

* **Detection:** Detection focuses on identifying the presence or absence of a specific object (like a tiger) within an image.  The text focuses on identifying individual tigers based on their footprints, not simply detecting their presence. 


Therefore, based on the context, the deep learning model is likely a **classification** model used to identify individual Amur tigers from their footprints.
