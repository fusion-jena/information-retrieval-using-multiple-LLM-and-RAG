Answer:::
The provided text focuses on comparing Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Backpropagation Neural Networks (BPNN) for predicting an EF (presumably a specific engineering factor). It doesn't delve into the specifics of deep learning hyperparameters like learning rate or optimizers.  


Therefore, I cannot answer your question based on the given context.
