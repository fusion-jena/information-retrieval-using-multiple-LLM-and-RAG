Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the preprocessing of GF-6 (WFV) remote sensing data for bathymetry retrieval. It mentions radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction, geometric correction, and image cropping. 

While the text discusses the use of machine learning techniques like CART, RFR, and SVM for bathymetry estimation, it doesn't specify the exact data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.
