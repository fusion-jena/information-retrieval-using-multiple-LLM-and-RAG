Answer:::
Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline primarily utilizes image data. 

Several papers mention image-based approaches for tasks like:

* **Fish size monitoring:** Coro and Walsh (2021) describe a remote underwater video device for fish size monitoring.
* **Fish length and catch number estimation:** Palmer (2021) focuses on high-resolution monitoring of fish length and catch numbers from landings using deep learning.
* **Fish detection:** Qin et al. (2022) propose a method for fish detection in fuzzy underwater images.
* **Fish biomass estimation:** Rani et al. (2024) develop an automated approach for fish biomass estimation in turbid environments using deep learning and object detection.
* **Cetacean photo-identification:** Patton et al. (2023) demonstrate a deep learning approach for photo-identification of cetaceans.

While the context primarily focuses on images, it's possible that other data formats like video or audio are used in conjunction with images for more complex tasks.
