Answer:::
The provided text mentions that parameters of a DL network are adjusted using an optimization process during training.  It also states that newer architectures like Swin and ConvNeXt  have improved parameter optimization compared to ResNet. 

However, the specific optimization techniques used (e.g., SGD, Adam) are not named in the text.
