Answer:::
While the provided context focuses on deep learning architectures and their performance, it doesn't delve into the specific preprocessing steps involved in training these models. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

* **Normalization:** Scaling the features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1 or -1 to 1) can improve model training stability and speed.

* **Feature Scaling:** Techniques like standardization (subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation) can help features with different scales contribute equally to the model.
* **Encoding Categorical Data:** Converting categorical variables into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding) is necessary for most deep learning algorithms.

The specific preprocessing steps will vary depending on the nature of the data and the chosen deep learning model.
