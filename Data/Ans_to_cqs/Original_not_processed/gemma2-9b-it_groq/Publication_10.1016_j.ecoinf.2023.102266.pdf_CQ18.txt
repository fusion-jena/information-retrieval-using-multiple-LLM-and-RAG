Answer:::
The provided text does not describe a specific strategy for monitoring model performance during training. 

It does mention that the model's performance is evaluated by ensuring a sufficient number of trials in the Monte Carlo method to obtain precise and reliable estimates.  

The text also highlights the importance of  "variance reduction techniques" to improve the model's accuracy, suggesting that monitoring variance could be part of the evaluation process. However, it doesn't detail specific metrics or techniques used for performance monitoring.
