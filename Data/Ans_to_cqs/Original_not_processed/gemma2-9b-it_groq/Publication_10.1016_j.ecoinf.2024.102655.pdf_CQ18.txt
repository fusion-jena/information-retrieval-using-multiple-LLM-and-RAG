Answer:::
The provided text does not describe the specific strategy used to monitor model performance during training. 

It does mention that the performance of different models (CA, TSA, ANFIS, ANN, and SVM) was evaluated using various measurements (not specified) and that the BTS-ANFIS model showed significantly better performance than a model trained on the complete dataset, likely due to overtraining. 


The text focuses on the impact of using a reduced dataset (BTS) for training and highlights its positive effect on the ANFIS model's performance.
