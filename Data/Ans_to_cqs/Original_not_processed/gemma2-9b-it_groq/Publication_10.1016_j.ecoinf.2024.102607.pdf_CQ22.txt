Answer:::
The provided text focuses on  Land Use Land Cover (LULC) mapping techniques and doesn't delve into the specific metrics used to evaluate a deep learning model for this task. 

However, it does mention the following metrics in the context of traditional classification models:

* **Producer Accuracy (PA):**  Measures the proportion of correctly classified samples of a particular class out of all samples of that class.
* **User Accuracy (UA):**  Measures the proportion of correctly classified samples of a particular class out of all samples that were classified as that class.
* **Overall Accuracy (OA):**  The percentage of correctly classified samples out of the total number of samples.
* **Kappa (Îº):** A statistical measure of inter-rater reliability for categorical items. It accounts for the possibility of agreement occurring by chance.


While these metrics are commonly used in LULC mapping,  deep learning models often employ additional metrics like:

* **Precision:**  Measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions.
* **Recall:** Measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive cases.
* **F1-Score:**  The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of performance.
* **Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU):**  A metric commonly used in semantic segmentation tasks, measuring the overlap between predicted and ground truth segmentation masks.



To get a definitive answer on the specific metrics used for the deep learning model in your context, you would need to refer to the original research paper or documentation describing the model.
