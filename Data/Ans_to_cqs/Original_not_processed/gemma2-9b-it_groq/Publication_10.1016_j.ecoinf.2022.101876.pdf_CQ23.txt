Answer:::

The provided text does not specify the exact methods used to ensure the generalizability of the MegaDetector model. 

While it mentions the importance of well-labeled and diverse image sets for model accuracy and the need for thorough evaluations, it doesn't detail the specific techniques employed during the training and evaluation process. 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
