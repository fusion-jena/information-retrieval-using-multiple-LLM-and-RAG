Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the dataset split and performance evaluation metrics used for a YOLOv8 model but doesn't specify the criteria for determining when training is complete. 

It mentions using a validation set to fine-tune hyperparameters and assess performance on unseen data, which suggests monitoring the model's performance on this validation set during training. A common criterion for stopping training is when the validation loss plateaus or starts to increase, indicating that the model might be overfitting to the training data.
