The provided text focuses on the challenges of training deep learning models for plant image recognition due to the limited size and diversity of plant datasets. It discusses the analysis of filter responses in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to understand feature learning. 

However, the text **does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model**, such as:

* **Diverse dataset:**  While it highlights the lack of diversity in existing plant datasets, it doesn't describe any efforts to create a more diverse dataset.
* **Cross-validation:**  The text doesn't mention the use of cross-validation techniques to evaluate model performance on unseen data.
* **Stratified splitting:**  There is no information about stratified splitting of the dataset to ensure balanced representation of different plant categories. 


Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot answer what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
