Answer:::
The deep learning model described in the text is used for **semantic image segmentation**. 

The purpose of semantic segmentation is to classify every pixel in an image, assigning each pixel to a specific class.  This is in contrast to image classification, which assigns a single label to the entire image. 

In the context of biocrust coverage estimation, the model segments an image to identify and quantify the pixels that belong to the biocrust class.
