Answer:::
The provided text states that the CNN model is trained on "covey call spectrogram data".  Spectrograms are a visual representation of sound over time, essentially turning audio data into a format that can be processed by a deep learning model. 

Therefore, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is **audio**, which is transformed into **spectrograms** for model training.
