Answer:::
The provided text does not explicitly mention specific regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization. 

It does state that "Early stopping was introduced to prevent overfitting when no further improvement was observed on the validation set."  

Early stopping is a common technique to mitigate overfitting by halting training when performance on a validation set stops improving.
