Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the challenges of imbalanced datasets in land cover classification using machine learning, particularly concerning iceplant detection. While it mentions techniques to address this imbalance, it doesn't delve into specific deep learning preprocessing techniques. 

The text highlights the issue of  "highly unbalanced dataset" due to iceplant being a minority land cover class. It states that they created a reasonably balanced final training dataset (38% iceplant, 62% other vegetation) without explicitly mentioning techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling. 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot definitively answer what deep learning preprocessing techniques are used to address data bias.
