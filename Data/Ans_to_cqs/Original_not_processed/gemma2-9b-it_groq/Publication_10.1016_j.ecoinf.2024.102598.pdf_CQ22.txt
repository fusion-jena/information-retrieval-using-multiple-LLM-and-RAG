Answer:::
The provided text describes the evaluation of several machine learning models (MLMs), not deep learning models. 

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of these MLMs are:

* **AUC (Area under the receiver operator characteristics curve):**  Measures the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative cases.
* **TSS (True Skill Statistics):**  Another metric for assessing the model's discrimination ability.
* **Kappa:**  A measure of inter-rater reliability for categorical items, indicating the agreement between the model's predictions and a reference standard.
* **Phi:**  A measure of association between two categorical variables, in this case, the model's predictions and the actual forest fire presence. 


The text does not mention deep learning models or metrics typically used for their evaluation, such as accuracy, precision, or recall.
