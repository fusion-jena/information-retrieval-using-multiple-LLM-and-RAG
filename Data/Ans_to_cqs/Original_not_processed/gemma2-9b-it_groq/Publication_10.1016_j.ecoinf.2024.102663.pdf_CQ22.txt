Answer:::
The provided text lists the following metrics for evaluating deep learning models, particularly in the context of object detection:

* **Precision:**  Measures the accuracy of the projected segment.
* **Recall:**  Indicates the model's ability to identify all relevant instances of a specific class.
* **mAP (Mean Average Precision):**  The primary metric for object detection algorithms. It considers the area under the precision-recall curve at various Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds. 

The text also mentions other metrics used in different contexts, such as:

* **Accuracy:**  A general metric for classification tasks, representing the percentage of correct predictions.
* **IoU (Intersection over Union):**  Measures the overlap between the predicted bounding box and the ground truth bounding box.
* **R2:**  A measure of how well a regression model fits the data.
* **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):**  A measure of the average difference between predicted and actual values in regression tasks.
* **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):**  Another measure of the average difference between predicted and actual values in regression tasks.
* **MaxRE (Maximum Relative Error):**  The maximum percentage difference between predicted and actual values.
