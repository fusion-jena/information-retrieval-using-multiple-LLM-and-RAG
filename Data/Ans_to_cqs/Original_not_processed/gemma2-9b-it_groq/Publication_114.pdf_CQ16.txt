Answer:::
The provided text focuses on comparing the performance of different deep learning algorithms (VGG16, ResNet50, and AlexNet) for tree species classification. It doesn't mention specific criteria used to determine the completion of training. 

However, it is common practice in deep learning to monitor the performance on a validation set during training.  Training is typically considered complete when:

* **Validation loss plateaus:**  The validation loss stops decreasing significantly and starts to fluctuate. This indicates that the model might be overfitting to the training data.
* **Validation accuracy peaks:** The validation accuracy reaches its highest point. 
* **A predefined number of epochs is reached:**  An epoch is one complete pass through the entire training dataset.

Other criteria might include monitoring metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, or a combination of these.
