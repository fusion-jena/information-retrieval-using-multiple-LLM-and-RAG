Answer:::
The provided text does not specify the exact optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline.  While it mentions hyperparameters like learning rate (0.001), batch size (64), and the number of epochs (10), it doesn't explicitly state whether SGD, Adam, or any other optimizer was employed.
