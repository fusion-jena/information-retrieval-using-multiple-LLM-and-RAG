Answer:::
The provided text describes a post-processing step that involves setting a confidence threshold (τi) specific to each species class. 

Here's how it works:

1. **Model Output:** The trained CNN model produces an output {C(X), S(X)} for an image X, where C(X) is the predicted species (class) with the highest score, and S(X) is the classification score.

2. **Ground Truth:** The system knows the actual species (ground truth) Y for the image.

3. **Threshold Tuning:** Using a separate dataset (T1), the system determines an optimal threshold (τi) for each species. This threshold is based on a trade-off between accuracy and the proportion of images fully processed.

4. **Post-Processing:** The model output is post-processed using the determined thresholds.  The text explains that this transforms the classification from two options (correct/wrong) to three:

    * **Correct:** The model's prediction matches the ground truth.
    * **Misclassified:** The model's prediction is incorrect.
    * **Unsure:** The model's confidence score falls below the species-specific threshold.


The text doesn't mention other post-processing steps like saliency maps or confusion matrix calculation.
