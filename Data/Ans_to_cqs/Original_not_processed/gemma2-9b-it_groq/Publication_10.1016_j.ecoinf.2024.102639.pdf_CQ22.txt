Answer:::
The provided text mentions several metrics used to evaluate the performance of the machine learning models (KNN, SVM, and PCA-SVM), not deep learning models. These metrics include:

* **Precision:**  Measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all instances predicted as positive.
* **Recall:**  Measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all actual positive instances.
* **F-measure:**  The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of both.
* **Accuracy:**  Measures the overall correctness of the model, calculated as the ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total number of instances.
