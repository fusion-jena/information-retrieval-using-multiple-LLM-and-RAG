Answer:::

The provided text describes the training process and data augmentation techniques used but doesn't explicitly detail the post-processing steps taken after model training. 

However, it does mention the following:

* **Selection of the best model:** The model with the lowest validation loss at epoch 6 was chosen for further inference. This implies a process of evaluating model performance on a held-out validation set.
* **Metrics calculation:**  Metrics like Precision, Recall, F-score, and their associated confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using the validation dataset. This suggests a standard evaluation procedure for object detection models.
* **Intersection over Union (IoU):**  The text states that a detection is considered positive if the IoU between the predicted bounding box and the ground truth bounding box is greater than 0.5. This is a common metric for evaluating object detection accuracy.

Based on these clues, we can infer that the post-processing steps likely include:

1. **Model Selection:** Choosing the model with the best performance on the validation set.
2. **Metrics Calculation:**  Quantifying the model's performance using metrics like Precision, Recall, F-score, and IoU.
3. **Confusion Matrix:**  Potentially, a confusion matrix was generated to visualize the types of errors the model makes (e.g., true positives, false positives, true negatives, false negatives).

The text doesn't explicitly mention saliency maps, but they are a common post-processing technique for understanding model decision-making.
