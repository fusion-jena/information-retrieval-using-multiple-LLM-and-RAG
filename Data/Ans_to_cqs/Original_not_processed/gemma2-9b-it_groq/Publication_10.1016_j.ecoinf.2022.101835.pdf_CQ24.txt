Answer:::
The provided text focuses on optimizing machine learning models (RF, ANN, and GBDT) for predicting flowering dates and doesn't delve into specific strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. 

However, it does mention the use of:

* **Randomized Feature Selection:**  "feature_fraction = 0.5" suggests a strategy where a random subset of features is used for each tree in the Random Forest model.

* **Bagging:** "bagging_fraction = 0.573" and "bagging_freq = 7" indicate the use of bagging, a technique that involves training multiple models on different random subsets of the data.

These techniques introduce randomness to prevent overfitting and improve model generalization.

To address randomness in the broader deep learning pipeline, common strategies include:

* **Setting a Random Seed:**  Initializing random number generators with a fixed seed ensures reproducibility by making the random choices deterministic.

* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training data by applying random transformations (e.g., rotations, flips, noise) to existing samples.

* **Dropout:**  Randomly "dropping out" (ignoring) a percentage of neurons during training to prevent over-reliance on any single neuron and encourage the network to learn more robust features.



It's important to note that these strategies are not exhaustive and the specific techniques used depend on the particular deep learning task and model architecture.
