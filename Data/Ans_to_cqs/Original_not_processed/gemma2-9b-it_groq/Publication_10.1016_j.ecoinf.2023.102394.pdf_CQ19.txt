Answer:::
The provided text states that the deep learning algorithm used for SOCS modeling is a multilayer perceptron (MLP).  It also mentions Keras as a relevant R interface for Keras. 

While the text doesn't explicitly name TensorFlow or PyTorch, it does refer to TensorFlow as a system for large-scale machine learning. 

Therefore, it's possible that TensorFlow could be involved in the implementation of the MLP model, but the text doesn't confirm this.
