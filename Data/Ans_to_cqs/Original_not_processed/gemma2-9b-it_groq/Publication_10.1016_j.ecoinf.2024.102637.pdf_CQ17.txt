Answer:::
The provided text focuses on optimizing a lightweight deep learning model called SIAlex and doesn't explicitly mention specific regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization. 

While it does discuss the use of Batch Normalization (BN) during training, BN primarily aims to accelerate convergence and prevent overfitting by normalizing the activations within each layer, rather than being a traditional regularization technique like dropout or L2.
