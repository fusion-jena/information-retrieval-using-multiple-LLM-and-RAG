Answer:::
Based on the provided text, the deep learning model is designed for **instance segmentation**. 

The text mentions Mask R-CNN, a model specifically known for instance segmentation. It states: "Mask R-CNN is a combination of Faster R-CNN and FCN models with some advancements where a parallel layer of FCN is added for the mask implementation in the Faster R-CNN head along with some extra convolutional layers on each Region of Interest." 

Instance segmentation goes beyond simple object detection by identifying and segmenting individual instances of objects within an image.
