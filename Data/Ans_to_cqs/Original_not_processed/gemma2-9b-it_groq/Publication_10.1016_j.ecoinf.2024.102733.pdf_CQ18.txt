Answer:::
The provided text doesn't explicitly describe the specific strategies used to monitor model performance during training. 

It does mention:

* **Use of a learning rate scheduler:** This suggests that the learning rate was adjusted during training to help the model avoid plateaus and improve performance.
* **Exploration of various parameter values:** The authors experimented with different learning rates, batch sizes, weight decay, and dropout rates. This implies they tracked performance metrics (likely accuracy or loss) while varying these parameters to find the optimal configuration.
* **Comparison of Cross-Entropy and Focal Loss:** The text states they investigated both loss functions, suggesting they compared the performance achieved with each.


However, it doesn't detail the specific metrics used, how frequently performance was evaluated, or any visualization techniques employed to monitor training progress.
