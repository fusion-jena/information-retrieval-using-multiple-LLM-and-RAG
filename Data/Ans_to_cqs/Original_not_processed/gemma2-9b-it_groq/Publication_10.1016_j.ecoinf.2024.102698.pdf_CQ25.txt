Answer:::
The provided text describes the use of deep learning models for generating synthetic connectivity data.  It states that GAN models were chosen because they were best at replicating the sparseness of the original connectivity matrices and performed well in terms of utility metrics. 

The text does not explicitly state the specific purpose of the deep learning model beyond data generation.
