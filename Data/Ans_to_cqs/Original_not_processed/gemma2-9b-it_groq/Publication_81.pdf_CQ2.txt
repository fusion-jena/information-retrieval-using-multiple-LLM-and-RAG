Answer: The text states that the DNA barcode sequences are first aligned to obtain sequences of the same length. Then, they are converted into numerical data using one-hot encoding.  

Therefore, the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are:

* **DNA sequences:** Initially in text format.
* **Numerical data:**  Representing the DNA sequences after one-hot encoding.
