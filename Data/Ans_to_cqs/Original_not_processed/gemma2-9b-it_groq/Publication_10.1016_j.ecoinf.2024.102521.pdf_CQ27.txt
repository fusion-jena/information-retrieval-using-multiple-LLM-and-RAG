Answer:::

The provided text describes the STARdbi project and its components, including tools for image splitting, model training, and inference. However, it doesn't specify the exact process followed for deploying the trained deep learning model. 

The text mentions that the trained model is saved as a binary pickle file. This suggests that model serialization was likely used to save the trained weights and architecture.  

However, information about the platform selection for deployment (e.g., cloud, on-premise server, edge device) or any specific deployment strategies (e.g., containerization, API integration) is not available in the given context.
