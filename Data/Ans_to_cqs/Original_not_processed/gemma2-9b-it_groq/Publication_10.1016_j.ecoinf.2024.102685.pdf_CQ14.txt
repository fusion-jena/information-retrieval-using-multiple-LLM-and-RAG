Answer:::
The provided text states that the number of variables used for each node (mtry) were automatically selected using repeated cross validations. 

It specifies:

* 10 folds and 10 repetitions were used for seagrass meadow models.
* 5 folds and 5 repetitions were used for species meadow models. 


While it mentions repeated cross-validation, it doesn't explicitly state whether grid search or random search was used within the cross-validation process for hyperparameter optimization.
