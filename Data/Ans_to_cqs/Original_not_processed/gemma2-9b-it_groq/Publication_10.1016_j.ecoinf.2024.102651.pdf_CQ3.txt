Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the architectural design and performance of deep learning models, particularly hybrid networks combining CNN and Transformer architectures. It doesn't delve into the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. 

Therefore, I cannot answer your query about data annotation techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation based on the given context.
