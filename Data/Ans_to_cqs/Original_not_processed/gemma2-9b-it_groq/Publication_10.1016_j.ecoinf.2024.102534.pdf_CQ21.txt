Answer:::
The provided text describes the data used, model training, and evaluation metrics but doesn't detail specific post-processing steps like saliency maps or confusion matrices. 

It does mention these post-processing actions:

* **AUC evaluation metric:**  Area Under the Curve, a common metric for evaluating classification models.
* **True Skill Statistics (TSS):** Another metric used to assess model performance.
* **Predictive map classification:**  The model's output (predicting suitable areas) is classified into "unsuitable" (0-0.6) and "suitable" (0.6-1) categories. 
* **Threshold comparison:** The suitable areas from current predictions are compared to future predictions to estimate changes over time.
