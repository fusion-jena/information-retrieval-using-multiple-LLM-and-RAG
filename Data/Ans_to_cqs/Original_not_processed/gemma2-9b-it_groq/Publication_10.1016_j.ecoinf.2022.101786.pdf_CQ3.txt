Answer:::
The provided text describes the use of bounding box annotation for training a CNN to detect *S. fragilissima* in images. 

Specifically, it mentions:

* **Manually annotated images:**  500 images were manually annotated with bounding boxes around instances of *S. fragilissima*.
* **Bounding box coordinates:** The annotations include the coordinates of the bounding box for each instance.
* **Confidence score:** The CNN outputs a confidence score for each prediction, ranging from 0.05 to 1.

The text does not mention other data annotation techniques like instance segmentation.
