Answer:::
Based on the provided text snippets, the specific deep learning model type used in the pipeline is not explicitly stated. 

However, the text mentions:

* **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network):**  This is mentioned in the context of Rauf et al. (2019) proposing a deep learning framework based on the CNN method for fish species recognition. 
* **YOLOv4:** This is mentioned in the context of Zhang et al. (2021) proposing an underwater fish individual recognition method based on improved YOLOv4 and FaceNet.

Therefore, it is possible that the pipeline utilizes either a CNN, YOLOv4, or a combination of both.
