Answer:::
The provided text does not specify the exact data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.  While it mentions the use of deep learning models for plant leaf recognition and disease detection, it doesn't delve into the specific preprocessing steps involved. 

Common data augmentation techniques used in image classification tasks include:

* **Flipping:** Horizontally or vertically flipping images to increase dataset size and improve model robustness.
* **Rotation:** Rotating images by a certain angle to account for variations in object orientation.
* **Scaling:**  Resizing images to different proportions while maintaining aspect ratio.
* **Color Jitter:**  Randomly adjusting brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue to introduce diversity.

However, without further information from the source material, we cannot confirm which of these techniques (or others) were applied in this particular deep learning pipeline.
