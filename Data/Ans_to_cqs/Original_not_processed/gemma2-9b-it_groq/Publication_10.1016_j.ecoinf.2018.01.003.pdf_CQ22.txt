Answer:::
The provided text focuses on comparing the performance of a BPNN (Backpropagation Neural Network) and an SVM (Support Vector Machine) model, not a deep learning model.  

Therefore, it doesn't list the metrics used to evaluate a deep learning model. 

Common metrics used for evaluating deep learning models include:

* **Accuracy:** The percentage of correctly classified instances.
* **Precision:** The proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions.
* **Recall:** The proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances.
* **F1-score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure.
* **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):**  Used for regression tasks, it measures the average magnitude of the errors in predictions.
