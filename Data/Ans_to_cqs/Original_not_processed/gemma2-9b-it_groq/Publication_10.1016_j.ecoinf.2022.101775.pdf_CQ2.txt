Answer:::
The provided text focuses on matrix factorization and deep learning applications in the context of sensor data from Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs).  

It doesn't specify the exact data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However,  we can infer that the data likely involves numerical sensor readings. 

Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline could be:

* **Numerical arrays or matrices:** Representing sensor readings over time and space. 
* **CSV (Comma Separated Values):**  A common format for storing tabular data, which could be used to represent sensor readings if they are organized in a structured way. 


The text doesn't mention image, audio, or video data formats.
