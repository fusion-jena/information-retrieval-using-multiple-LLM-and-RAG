Answer:::
The text provided describes a deep learning model for Land Use Change Classification (LUCC) but doesn't specify the exact datasets used in the training pipeline. 

It mentions:

* **Training set:** A grid with neighborhood features of six years (1986, 2005, 2008, 2010, and 2013). These features include LU type, soil, topography, elevation, slope, aspect, distance to settlements, distance to roads, distance to rivers, and features from 4 neighboring grid units.
* **Constraint Factors:** Statistical data and simulation results from a Markov model are used to define the number of different LU types in 2000.
* **Water and settlements:**  Probability maps for these are created through manual interpretation and are not simulated. 


The text focuses on the model's architecture and how it uses these data sources to predict LU probability maps. It doesn't name specific benchmark datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, which are commonly used in computer vision tasks.
