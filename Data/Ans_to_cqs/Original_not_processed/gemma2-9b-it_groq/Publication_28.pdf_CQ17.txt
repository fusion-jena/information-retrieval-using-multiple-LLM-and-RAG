Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the structure of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and the PTDLEN-VAE model for satellite imagery analysis. It doesn't mention any specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.  

Therefore, based on the context given, I cannot answer your question about regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization.
