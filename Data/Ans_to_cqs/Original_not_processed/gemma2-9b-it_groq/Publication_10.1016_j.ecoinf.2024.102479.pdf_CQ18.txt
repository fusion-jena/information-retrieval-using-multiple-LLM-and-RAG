Answer:::
The text describes the use of k-fold cross-validation to monitor model performance during training. 

Specifically, a 10-fold cross-validation design was employed. This means the dataset was divided into 10 subsets.  The model was trained on 9 of these subsets and evaluated on the remaining subset. This process was repeated 10 times, with each subset serving as the evaluation set once. 

This technique helps prevent overfitting, which occurs when a model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data. By evaluating the model on multiple different subsets of the data, k-fold cross-validation provides a more robust estimate of the model's performance.
