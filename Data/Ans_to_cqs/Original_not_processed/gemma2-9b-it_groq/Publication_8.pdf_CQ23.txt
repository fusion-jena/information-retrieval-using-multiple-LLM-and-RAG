Answer: The text mentions that the model was trained and evaluated on two separate datasets:

1. **Training subset:** 498 images used for initial training on a single GPU.
2. **Test subset:** 155 images used to evaluate the initial model performance, also on a single GPU.

Later, the model was retrained on the full dataset of 653 annotated images using three GPUs.  

The text also states that the second training dataset consisted of 708 full-scale herbarium scans from the Herbarium Senckenbergianum (FR) with a different set of species and geographical origins compared to the initial training data. This suggests an attempt to improve the model's generalizability by using data from a different source.

However, the text does not explicitly mention techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting, which are commonly used to ensure model generalizability.
