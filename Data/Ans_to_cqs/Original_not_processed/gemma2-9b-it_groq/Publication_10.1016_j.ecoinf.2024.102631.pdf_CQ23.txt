Answer:::
The provided text describes the experimental setup and evaluation metrics but doesn't specify the exact methods used to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. 

It mentions using three different datasets (UCCS, C-60, and U45) for evaluation, which suggests an attempt to test the model's performance on diverse image types. However, it doesn't explicitly state whether techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting were employed during the training process.
