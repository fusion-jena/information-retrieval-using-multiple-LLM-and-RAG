Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the training process and doesn't describe any post-processing steps like saliency maps, metric calculation, or confusion matrix construction. 


It mainly discusses:

* **Model Training:**  Tuning the number of training epochs to avoid overfitting.
* **Accuracy Evaluation:**  Using top-k accuracy (k=1, 5, 10) on a test set to measure the model's performance. 
* **Data Availability:**  Information on how to access the training data.



Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer your query about post-processing steps.
