Answer:::
I cannot provide a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline described in the provided text. 

The text excerpt focuses on the methodology and results of a study using deep learning LSTM models to predict air quality. It mentions the use of Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor vertical column density (VCD) products for data, but it does not specify a data repository link for the pipeline itself.
