Answer:::
The text mentions the following performance metrics:

* **Area under the ROC curve (AUC)**
* **Average precision (AP)**
* **Mean average precision (mAP)**
* **Macro-average AUC**
* **Precision**
* **Recall**
* **F1 score** 


These metrics are calculated using the scikit-learn package.  The text also states that precision, recall, and F1 score are plotted as curves for each class to examine class-specific performance.
