Answer:::
The provided text focuses on machine learning algorithms like K-nearest neighbors and decision trees, and doesn't discuss preprocessing steps for deep learning models.  

To answer your question about preprocessing for deep learning, here are some common steps:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values (imputation or removal), removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies.
* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1) can improve model performance.
* **Standardization:**  Transforming data to have zero mean and unit variance.
* **Encoding Categorical Features:** Converting categorical variables into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding, label encoding).
* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones to potentially improve model accuracy.
