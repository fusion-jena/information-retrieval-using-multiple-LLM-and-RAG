Answer:::
The provided text mentions the following metrics for evaluating the performance of the artificial neural network (ANN) model:

* **Mean C (t. ha-1):** This likely represents the mean carbon stock (in tonnes per hectare) predicted by the model. 
* **R2:**  R-squared, a measure of how well the model's predictions fit the actual data. It ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating a perfect fit.
* **RMSE (t. ha-1):** Root Mean Squared Error, a measure of the average difference between the model's predictions and the actual carbon stock values.
* **MAE (t. ha-1):** Mean Absolute Error, another measure of the average difference between predictions and actual values, but it uses the absolute value of the difference. 


The text does not mention accuracy, precision, or recall, which are commonly used metrics for classification tasks, not regression tasks like predicting carbon stock.
