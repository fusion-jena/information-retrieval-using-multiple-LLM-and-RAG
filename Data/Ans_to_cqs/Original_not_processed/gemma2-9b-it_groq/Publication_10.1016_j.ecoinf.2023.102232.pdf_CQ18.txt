Answer:::
The provided text describes a hybrid method for estimating model parameters using a combination of Least Squares (LS), Genetic Algorithms (GA), and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches. 

However, it doesn't explicitly mention a specific strategy for monitoring model performance *during* training. 

The text focuses on:

* **Initial parameter exploration:** Using LS and GA to find a preliminary set of optimal parameter values.
* **Refining parameter estimates:** Employing MCMC to determine the statistical distribution and uncertainty of the parameters.

While it highlights the use of perturbed numerical solutions for a preliminary validation, it doesn't detail how model performance is tracked during the iterative optimization process of the GA or the MCMC sampling.
