Answer:::
The provided text states that the endemic bird data was randomly split into 3,132 images for training and 760 images for testing.  

To further improve the model's ability to generalize, the training dataset was augmented 10 times, resulting in a total of 31,320 images. Of these augmented images, 25,056 (80%) were used for training and 6,264 (20%) were used for validation.
