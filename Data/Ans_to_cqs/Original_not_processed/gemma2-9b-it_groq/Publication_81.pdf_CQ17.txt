Answer: The provided text mentions Elastic Net as a regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.  

It states: "To address the problem of overÔ¨Åtting caused by small dataset due to the limited number of species in the family, the Elastic Net is introduced for the proposed method to improve the generalization ability." 


While the text doesn't explicitly list other regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization, it's common practice to use these techniques in deep learning to combat overfitting.
