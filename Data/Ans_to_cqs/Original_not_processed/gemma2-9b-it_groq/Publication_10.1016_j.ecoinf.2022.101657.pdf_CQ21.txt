Answer:::
The provided text describes the training process and dataset used for the DynAIkonTrap model but doesn't detail the specific post-processing steps performed after training. 

It mentions that the model outputs a belief score (b âˆˆ [0, 1]) for each species identification and that this score is thresholded for classification.  

However, it doesn't explicitly state whether saliency maps, metrics calculation (like mAP50), or confusion matrix construction are used as part of the post-processing pipeline.
