Answer:::
The provided text describes the process of data preparation for training a ResNet50 model for plant classification. It mentions the following preprocessing steps:

* **Data Augmentation:** During training, standard data augmentation techniques like shearing, translation, and mirroring are applied to the images. This helps to increase the diversity of the training data and improve the model's generalization ability.
* **Rotation and Upside Down Mirroring Exclusion:** For images tagged as 'habit', rotation and upside-down mirroring are not applied as they are considered irrelevant for this category.
* **Downscaling:** The images are downscaled to the ResNet standard input size of 224x224 pixels. 

The text does not explicitly mention normalization or scaling as preprocessing steps.
