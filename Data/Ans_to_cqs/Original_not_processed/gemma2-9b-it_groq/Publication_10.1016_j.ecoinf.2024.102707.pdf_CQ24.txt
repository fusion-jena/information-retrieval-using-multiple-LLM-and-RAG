Answer:::

The provided text focuses on using machine learning for counting Antarctic shag nests and doesn't delve into the specifics of handling randomness in deep learning pipelines.  

To answer your query about strategies for handling randomness in deep learning, here are some common techniques:

* **Setting a Random Seed:**  This initializes the random number generator used throughout the deep learning process. By setting a fixed seed, you ensure that the same "random" values are generated every time you run your code, making your results reproducible.

* **Data Augmentation:** This involves introducing controlled variations into your training data (e.g., rotations, flips, crops). This helps the model generalize better and reduces the impact of random fluctuations in the data.

* **Dropout:**  A regularization technique where a percentage of neurons are randomly "dropped out" during each training step. This prevents overfitting and encourages the network to learn more robust features.

* **Batch Normalization:**  A technique that normalizes the activations of each layer during training. This helps stabilize the learning process and reduce the impact of internal covariate shift (random changes in the distribution of inputs to a layer).
