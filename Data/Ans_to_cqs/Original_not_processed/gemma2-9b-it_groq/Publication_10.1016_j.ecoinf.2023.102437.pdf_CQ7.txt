Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the implementation of an LSTM model for a specific task and doesn't explicitly detail the criteria used to split the data into training, testing, and validation sets. 

To generally answer your question, data splitting for deep learning models typically follows these common practices:

* **Training Set:** The largest portion of the data (e.g., 70-80%) is used to train the model, allowing it to learn patterns and relationships within the data.

* **Validation Set:** A smaller portion (e.g., 10-15%) is held out for validation. This set is used during training to monitor the model's performance on unseen data and make adjustments to hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, number of layers) to prevent overfitting.

* **Test Set:**  A separate, unseen portion (e.g., 10-15%) is reserved solely for final evaluation of the trained model's performance. This provides an unbiased estimate of how well the model generalizes to new data.

The specific split ratios can vary depending on the dataset size, complexity of the task, and the preferences of the researchers.
