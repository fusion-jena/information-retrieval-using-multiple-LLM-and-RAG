Answer:::

The provided text focuses on a specific study using machine learning for predicting lake TSM concentration based on wind speed. It doesn't delve into the broader topic of handling randomness in deep learning pipelines. 

However, I can offer some general strategies commonly used to address randomness in deep learning:

* **Random Seed Initialization:** Setting a fixed random seed value ensures that the initial weights and biases of the neural network are the same every time the model is trained. This reproducibility is crucial for comparing different experiments and understanding the impact of hyperparameters.

* **Data Shuffling:** Randomly shuffling the training data before each epoch prevents the model from learning patterns that are specific to the order of data points. This helps to generalize the model better.

* **Dropout:** This regularization technique randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during each training step. This prevents the model from relying too heavily on any single neuron and encourages the learning of more robust features.

* **Batch Normalization:** This technique normalizes the activations of each layer during training, reducing the internal covariate shift and stabilizing the learning process.

* **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):** This optimization algorithm uses a random subset (batch) of the training data to update the model weights in each iteration. This introduces randomness and helps to escape local minima during training.
