Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning for soil organic carbon stock prediction and doesn't delve into the specific preprocessing steps involved in training such models. 

However, based on common practices in deep learning, here are some preprocessing steps typically applied:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values (imputation or removal), identifying and removing outliers, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

* **Feature Engineering:**  Transforming existing features to create new, potentially more informative features. This could include creating interaction terms, binning continuous variables, or encoding categorical variables.

* **Normalization/Scaling:**  Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1 or -1 to 1) can improve the performance of some deep learning algorithms. Common techniques include min-max scaling and standardization.

* **Encoding Categorical Variables:**  Converting categorical variables (e.g., soil type, land use) into numerical representations that the model can understand. One-hot encoding is a common method.

The specific preprocessing steps used will depend on the nature of the data and the chosen deep learning model.
