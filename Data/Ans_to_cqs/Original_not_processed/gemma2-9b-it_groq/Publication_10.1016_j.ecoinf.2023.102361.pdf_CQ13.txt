Answer:::
The provided text does not specify the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning models.  It focuses on describing the dataset split and the different model architectures (VGG16, VGG19, ResNet-50, etc.) selected for the research. 

To find the specific hyperparameters (like learning rate, optimizer), you would need to consult the full research paper or any supplementary materials provided by the authors.
