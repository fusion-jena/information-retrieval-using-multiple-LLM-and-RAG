Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the preprocessing and training steps of a deep learning model for plant disease classification.  It doesn't explicitly detail the post-processing steps taken after training. 

However, based on common practices in machine learning, we can infer some likely post-processing steps:

* **Metrics Calculation:** As mentioned, the text states that accuracy, precision, and recall are used to evaluate the model's performance. These metrics would be calculated after training to assess the model's effectiveness.

* **Confusion Matrix:** The text also mentions the use of a confusion matrix for visualization. This matrix is generated after training to show the counts of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions for each class.

* **Potential Additional Steps:** Other common post-processing steps include:
    * **Saliency Map Generation:**  Visualizing which parts of the input image are most influential in the model's decision.
    * **Threshold Tuning:**  Optimizing the decision threshold for classification tasks to balance precision and recall.
    * **Model Deployment:** Preparing the trained model for use in a real-world application.



It's important to note that without further information from the text, these are educated guesses about potential post-processing steps.
