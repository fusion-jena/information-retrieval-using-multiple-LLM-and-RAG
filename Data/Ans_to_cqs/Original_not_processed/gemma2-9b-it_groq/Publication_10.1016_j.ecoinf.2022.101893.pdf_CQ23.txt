Answer:::
The provided text describes the model architecture and performance evaluation but doesn't mention specific techniques used to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.  

It states that the datasets were divided into training and test sets with an 8:2 ratio. However, it doesn't elaborate on whether techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting were employed during training.  

Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot determine what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
