Answer:::

The provided text focuses on specific deep learning model architectures, datasets, and experimental results. It doesn't explicitly detail the criteria used to split data for training, testing, and validation. 

However, common practices in deep learning data splitting are:

* **Training Set:** This is the largest portion of the data (typically 70-80%) used to train the model. The model learns patterns and relationships within this data.

* **Validation Set:** A smaller portion (around 10-15%) used to evaluate the model's performance during training. It helps monitor how well the model is generalizing and prevents overfitting (where the model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data).

* **Test Set:** Held out entirely from the training process (typically 10-15%). Used *only once* at the end to provide an unbiased estimate of the model's performance on unseen data.

**Criteria for Splitting:**

* **Representativeness:** The splits should reflect the distribution of the overall dataset.
* **Independence:** Data points in each split should be independent of each other.
* **Size:** The sizes of the splits are chosen based on the dataset size and the desired level of accuracy.

Remember, the specific splitting criteria can vary depending on the dataset, task, and model complexity.
