Answer:::
The provided text states that the performance of the models was evaluated in different epochs.  It also mentions that  "the performance of the proposed models increases with the number of epochs and the number of training data." 

Figure 8 shows the performance of the models in different epochs.  

Therefore, it can be inferred that the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training was to track the performance metrics (accuracy in this case) over multiple training epochs.
