Answer:::
The provided text does not describe any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.  It mentions the use of a training set that was normalized and standardized, a batch size of 32, the Adam optimizer, a cosine annealing learning rate schedule, 100 epochs with early stopping, and the cross-entropy loss function. However, it does not discuss techniques like data augmentation, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, which are commonly used to improve model generalizability.
