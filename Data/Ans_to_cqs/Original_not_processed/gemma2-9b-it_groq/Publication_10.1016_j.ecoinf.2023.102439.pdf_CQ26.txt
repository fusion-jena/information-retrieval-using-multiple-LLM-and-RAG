Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the application of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and wavelet analysis for vegetation biomass density prediction. It doesn't delve into specific techniques for addressing data bias during the preprocessing stage of a deep learning pipeline. 

However, based on general knowledge of machine learning and deep learning, here are some common techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing:

* **Stratified Splitting:** This technique ensures that the training, validation, and test sets proportionally reflect the distribution of target classes in the original dataset. This helps prevent bias towards majority classes during model training.

* **Oversampling:** This involves duplicating instances of minority classes to balance the dataset and prevent them from being underrepresented during training.

* **Undersampling:** This technique removes instances from the majority class to balance the dataset.

* **Diverse Data Collection:**  The most effective way to mitigate bias is to ensure the training data is diverse and representative of the real-world population. This requires careful consideration of the features and characteristics that might contribute to bias.

* **Data Augmentation:**  This involves artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training dataset by applying transformations to existing data points (e.g., rotations, flips, crops).


It's important to note that addressing data bias is an ongoing challenge in machine learning, and the most suitable techniques will depend on the specific dataset and the nature of the bias present.
