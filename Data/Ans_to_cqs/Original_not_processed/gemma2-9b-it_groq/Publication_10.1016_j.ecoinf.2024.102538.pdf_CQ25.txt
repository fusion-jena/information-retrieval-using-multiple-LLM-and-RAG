Answer:::
The deep learning model described in the text is primarily used for **classification**. 

The text states that the model's objective is to "learn the model parameters... to enable the model for bird sound identification."  This implies that the model takes an audio input (bird sound) and outputs a classification label, indicating the species of bird making the sound. 

The text also mentions "K classification levels" and "predicted scores representing the probability of each class," further supporting the classification purpose.
