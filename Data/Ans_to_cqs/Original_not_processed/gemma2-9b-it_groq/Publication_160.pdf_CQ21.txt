Answer: The text mentions the use of the SGR (Selective Geometric Rejection) algorithm for post-processing. 

Here's what the text says about the post-processing steps:

* **SGR Algorithm:** This algorithm helps filter predictions based on their reliability. It provides accurate thresholds that allow users to reject predictions that fall below a desired level of accuracy. 
* **Top-5 Accuracy:** The text states that the top-5 accuracy consistently exceeded 80% on the rejected data. This suggests that the SGR algorithm effectively identifies less reliable predictions.
* **Expert Annotation:** The high top-5 accuracy on rejected data could be used to create a tool that assists experts in quickly annotating the rejected samples. This helps mitigate the limitations of human annotation, which can impact the overall classification performance. 


The text does not discuss other post-processing steps like saliency maps or confusion matrix calculation.
