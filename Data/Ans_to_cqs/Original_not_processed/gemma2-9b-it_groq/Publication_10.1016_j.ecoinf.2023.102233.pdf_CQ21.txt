Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the active learning framework and data preparation for training a CNN model for bird call recognition. It doesn't describe any post-processing steps performed after model training, such as:

* **Saliency maps:**  Visualizing which parts of the input audio are most influential in the model's decision.
* **Metrics calculation:**  Evaluating the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.
* **Confusion matrix:**  Showing the counts of correct and incorrect predictions for each class. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what post-processing steps were used.
