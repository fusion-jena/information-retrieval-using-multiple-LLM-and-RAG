Answer:::

The text mentions several measures taken to enhance the generalizability of the deep learning model:

* **80-10-10 Data Split:** The data was divided into 80% for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing. This larger training set aims to improve the model's ability to learn patterns and generalize to unseen data.

* **Cross-Validation:** GridSearchCV with 10-fold cross-validation was used for hyperparameter tuning. This technique involves splitting the data into 10 folds, training the model on 9 folds, and evaluating it on the remaining fold. This process is repeated 10 times, using each fold as the test set once. Cross-validation helps to assess the model's performance on different data subsets, reducing the risk of overfitting.

The text doesn't explicitly mention "diverse dataset" or "stratified splitting."
