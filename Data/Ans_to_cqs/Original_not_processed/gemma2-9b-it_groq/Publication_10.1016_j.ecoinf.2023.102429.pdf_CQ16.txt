Answer: 

The provided text focuses on the implementation of an epsilon-Support Vector Regression (epsilon-SVR) model for soil nutrient concentration analysis. It describes the model's structure, the use of a Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) kernel, and the optimization of parameters (C, epsilon, and gamma) based on Root Mean Squared Error cross-validation (RMSEcv). 

However, the text does not specify the criteria used to determine the completion of training for the epsilon-SVR model.  It does mention that parameter values were selected based on RMSEcv, implying that the training process likely involves iteratively adjusting parameters and evaluating their performance using cross-validation. 

To determine when training is complete, one would typically look for signs of overfitting or a plateau in validation loss.
