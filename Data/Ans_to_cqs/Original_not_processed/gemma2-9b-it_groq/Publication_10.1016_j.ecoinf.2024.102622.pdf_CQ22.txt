Answer:::
The provided text focuses on evaluating the performance of various machine learning models for rice canopy coverage estimation, not deep learning models specifically. 

The metrics used to evaluate these models are:

* **R-squared (R2):**  Measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable (rice canopy coverage) that is explained by the independent variables (features used by the model). A higher R2 value indicates a better fit.
* **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):**  Represents the average difference between the predicted values and the actual values. A lower RMSE value indicates better accuracy.
* **Relative Percentage Error (REP):**  Calculates the percentage difference between the predicted values and the actual values.
