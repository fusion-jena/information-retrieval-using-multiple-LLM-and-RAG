Answer:::

The provided text focuses on describing the hyperparameters used in different deep learning models (CNN-BiGRU, CNN-BiRNN, RVFL, KELM) for streamflow forecasting.  

It does not mention any specific strategies employed to ensure the generalizability of the models, such as:

* **Diverse dataset:**  Information about the dataset's diversity (e.g., temporal coverage, geographical representation) is lacking.
* **Cross-validation:**  The text doesn't describe the use of cross-validation techniques (e.g., k-fold cross-validation) to evaluate model performance on unseen data.
* **Stratified splitting:**  There's no mention of stratified splitting, a technique used to maintain class proportions in training and testing sets. 


Therefore, based on the given context, we cannot determine what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
