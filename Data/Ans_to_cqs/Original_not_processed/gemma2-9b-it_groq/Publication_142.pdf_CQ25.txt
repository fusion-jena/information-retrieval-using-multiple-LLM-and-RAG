Answer: The deep learning model described in the text is used for **classification**. 

Specifically, it is trained to classify images of plants into different species.  The text states that the network is "pre-trained on the commonly used ImageNet dataset and fine-tuned on Pl@ntNet data" and that the main feature of the Pl@ntNet API is a "RESTful JSON-based web service that can accept one to five images of a plant and returns a list of likely species."
