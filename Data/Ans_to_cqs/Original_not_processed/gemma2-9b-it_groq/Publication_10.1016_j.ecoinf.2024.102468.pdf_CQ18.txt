Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the performance of a WT-HMM model with different dataset sizes and doesn't explicitly describe the strategy used to monitor model performance during training. 

It does mention that experiments are run over different iterations to account for randomness introduced by factors like weight initialization in ANNs or random sampling during training. This suggests that performance is likely evaluated across these multiple runs, but the specific metrics and how they are tracked during training are not detailed in the excerpt.
