Answer:::
The provided text focuses on architectural details of CNNs like ResNet and InceptionV3, and mentions their use in image analysis.  

It doesn't explicitly state the overall purpose of deep learning models. However, we can infer that they are used for tasks like **classification**, **segmentation**, or **detection** based on the statement: 

"For all image-based pre-trained networks, the purpose of CNN means the images where the extracted numerical features were used in Approach 1 during training were the exact images used in training in highly improves the performance of Hybrid Deep Neural Network models". 

This suggests that CNNs learn to map image data to numerical features, which can then be used for various downstream tasks like classifying images, segmenting objects within images, or detecting specific objects.
