Answer:::
The provided text states that model performance is evaluated using "2-shot, 2-way test accuracy".  It also mentions that "validation and test dataset performance are reported". 

While the text doesn't explicitly list other metrics like precision or recall, it implies that standard classification metrics are likely used given the context of evaluating a deep learning model for classification tasks.
