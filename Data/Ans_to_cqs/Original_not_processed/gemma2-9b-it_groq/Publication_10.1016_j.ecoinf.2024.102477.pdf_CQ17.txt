Answer:::
The provided text focuses on Support Vector Regression (SVR) and the SLSTM method in deep learning for time series prediction. It doesn't delve into specific regularization methods used in deep learning to prevent overfitting. 

However,  common regularization techniques used in deep learning to combat overfitting include:

* **Dropout:** Randomly "dropping out" (ignoring) a percentage of neurons during each training step. This prevents the model from relying too heavily on any single neuron and encourages the learning of more robust features.

* **L2 Regularization (Weight Decay):** Adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. This discourages the weights from becoming too large, effectively shrinking them and reducing the model's complexity.

* **L1 Regularization (Lasso):** Similar to L2 regularization but uses the absolute value of the weights. This can lead to some weights being driven to exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection.
