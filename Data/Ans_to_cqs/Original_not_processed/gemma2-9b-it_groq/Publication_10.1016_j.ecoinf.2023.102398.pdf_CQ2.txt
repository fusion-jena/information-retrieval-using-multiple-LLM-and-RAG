Answer:::
Based on the provided text, the deep learning pipeline uses **image** data. 

The text discusses:

*  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) used for object detection and recognition.
*  Training models on image datasets for tasks like elephant re-identification.
*  Fine-tuning models with optimized hyperparameters for image-based tasks.


There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the described pipeline.
