Answer: The provided text states that the method uses "very high-resolution imagery".  It also mentions "manual samples in the image". 

Therefore, the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are likely:

* **Image:** This is the primary data format used for training and inference.
* **Possibly CSV:**  "Manual samples" could refer to labeled data stored in a CSV format, where each row represents a sample with corresponding labels.
