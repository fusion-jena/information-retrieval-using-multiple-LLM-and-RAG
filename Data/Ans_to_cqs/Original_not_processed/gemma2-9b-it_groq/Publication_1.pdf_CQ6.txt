The provided text focuses on the applications and principles of deep learning, but it doesn't delve into specific preprocessing steps.  

To answer your question, here are some common preprocessing steps used before training a deep learning model:

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1 or -1 to 1). This helps algorithms converge faster and prevents features with larger scales from dominating the learning process.

* **Scaling:** Similar to normalization, but the goal is to reduce the variance of features. This can be achieved by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.

* **Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

* **Encoding Categorical Data:** Converting categorical variables (e.g., colors, categories) into numerical representations that the model can understand. Common techniques include one-hot encoding and label encoding.

* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones to improve model performance. This often involves domain expertise and understanding the problem.
