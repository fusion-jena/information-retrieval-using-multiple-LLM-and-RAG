Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model described in the text is **fish biomass estimation**. 

The text states that training a deep learning model on large datasets of fish images can provide accurate biomass estimates. It highlights the need for non-intrusive methods to estimate fish biomass, especially in turbid environments, where manual methods are challenging.
