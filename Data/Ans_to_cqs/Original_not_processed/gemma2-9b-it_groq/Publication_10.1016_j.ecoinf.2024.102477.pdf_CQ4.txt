Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the SLSTM (Seasonal Long Short-Term Memory) model for time-series prediction and doesn't discuss data augmentation techniques commonly used in deep learning pipelines. 

Data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling are primarily used for image data to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset. 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer your query about data augmentation techniques.
