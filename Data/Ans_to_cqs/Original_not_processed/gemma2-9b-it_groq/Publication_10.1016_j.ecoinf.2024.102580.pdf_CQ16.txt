Answer:::
The provided text describes the training process but doesn't explicitly state the criteria used to determine when training is complete.  

It does mention that the model accuracy was assessed "after each full training set iteration (epoch)", and that the training process involved minimizing the loss function using stochastic gradient descent. 

It's common practice to monitor validation loss and accuracy during training. Training might be considered complete when:

* **Validation loss plateaus or starts to increase:** This suggests the model is no longer learning effectively from the training data and may be overfitting.
* **Validation accuracy reaches a satisfactory level:**  The desired level of accuracy depends on the specific application.

The text focuses on describing the methods used, not the specific stopping criteria.
