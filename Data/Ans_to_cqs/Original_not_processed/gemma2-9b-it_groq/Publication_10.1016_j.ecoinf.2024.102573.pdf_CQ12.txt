Answer:::
The provided text describes an experiment using two specific deep learning models called LEAF-P and SincNet-P.  

While it doesn't explicitly state the full architecture of these models, it does mention:

* **Learnable frontends:** This suggests the models likely have an initial layer that learns features from the input data (either waveform or time-frequency representation).
* **Filters:** The text refers to "80 filters of length 512" which is a characteristic of convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

* **Convolutional layers:** The phrase "filtering convolution layer" further supports the use of CNNs.

Based on these clues, it's highly probable that the deep learning models used in this experiment are variations of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.
