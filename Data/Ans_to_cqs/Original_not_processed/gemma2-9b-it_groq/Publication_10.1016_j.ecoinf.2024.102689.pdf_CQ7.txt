Answer:::
The provided text describes the use of 10-fold cross-validation, where the dataset is split into ten equal sections (folds).  

In each iteration of the cross-validation process, one fold is used as the test set, and the remaining nine folds are used for training. 

The text doesn't explicitly state the criteria used to initially split the data into these ten folds. It's likely that the data was randomly shuffled before partitioning to ensure a representative distribution of samples across the folds.
