Answer:::
The provided text describes the use of three hyperparameter optimization approaches: Random Search, Hyperband, and Bayesian Optimization. 

Specifically, it states: "Our study employed three popular hyperparameter optimization approaches: Random Search, Hyperband, and Bayesian Optimization. Each method has its own strengths and weaknesses." 

Therefore, the model's hyperparameters are optimized using Random Search, Hyperband, and Bayesian Optimization.
