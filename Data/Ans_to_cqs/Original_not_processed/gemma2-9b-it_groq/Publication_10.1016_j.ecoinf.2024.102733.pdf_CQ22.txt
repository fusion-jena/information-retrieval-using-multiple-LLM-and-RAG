Answer:::
The text mentions the following metrics for evaluating the performance of the deep learning models:

* **F1-score:**  A harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure.
* **Geometric mean of true positives and negatives:**  This metric considers both true positives and true negatives, offering a broader view of performance. 
* **Cross-Entropy Loss:** While not strictly a performance metric, it's a loss function used during training and its minimization indicates improved model performance.
