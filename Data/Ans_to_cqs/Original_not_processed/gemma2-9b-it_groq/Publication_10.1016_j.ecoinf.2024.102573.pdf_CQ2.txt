Answer:::
The provided text mentions the use of audio data and mel-spectrograms.  It also states that pre-trained weights from image classification are used. 

Therefore, the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are:

* **Audio** 
* **Mel-spectrograms** (which are derived from audio)
* **Image** (for the pre-trained weights)
