Answer:::
The provided text describes the model training process and results but doesn't explicitly detail the post-processing steps taken after training. 

However, we can infer some post-processing steps based on the information given:

* **Metrics Calculation:** The text mentions "macro-F1 averages" and "accuracy" as evaluation metrics. These are calculated after training to assess the model's performance.
* **Confusion Matrix:** Table V shows a confusion matrix for the TFLite Inception-V3 model. This matrix is a common post-processing tool used to visualize the model's performance by showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives for each class.
* **ROC Curves:** The text mentions ROC curves being generated for the TFLite model, indicating that the model's performance was also evaluated using this metric.

While the text doesn't mention saliency maps, they are a common post-processing technique used to understand which parts of the input image the model focuses on when making a prediction. 


It's important to note that this is an inference based on the limited information provided.
