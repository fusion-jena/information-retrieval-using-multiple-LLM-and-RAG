Answer:::
The provided text states that the deep learning model is used for **binary classification** or **multi-class classification**, depending on the task. 

It specifies:

*  "In the case of binary classification, a dense layer with a single output is used, and Ïƒ is employed as the activation function."
*  "For tasks involving more than two classes, the dense layer has multiple outputs and the softmax function is used as the activation function." 


Therefore, the purpose of the deep learning model is to classify data into predefined categories.
