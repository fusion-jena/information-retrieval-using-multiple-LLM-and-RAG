Answer:::
The provided text describes a strategy to monitor model performance during training using two key metrics: accuracy and loss. 

The model's performance is tracked over multiple "epochs," which are iterations of the training process.  

* **Accuracy:** This metric measures the percentage of correct predictions made by the model.  A higher accuracy indicates better performance.

* **Loss:** This metric quantifies the error made by the model during training.  A lower loss value signifies better performance.

The text states that the model's performance is visualized using two line graphs: one for accuracy and one for loss. These graphs display the training and validation results over epochs.  

The blue color represents training results, while orange represents validation results. This allows for a direct comparison of how the model generalizes to unseen data (validation) versus its performance on the data it has already learned (training).
