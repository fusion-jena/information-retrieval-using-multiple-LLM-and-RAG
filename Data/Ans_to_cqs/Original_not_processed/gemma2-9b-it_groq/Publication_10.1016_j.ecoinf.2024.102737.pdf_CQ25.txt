Answer:::
The deep learning model described in this text is used for **recognition** of bluespotted ribbontail rays (Taeniura Lymma).  

While the text doesn't explicitly state if it's classification, segmentation, or detection, the context strongly suggests **classification**. 

Here's why:

* **"Recognition"** generally implies identifying an object within an image, which aligns with classification tasks.
* The text mentions comparing the performance of a CNN to traditional classification methods like SVM and K-Nearest Neighbors.
* The focus on "feature extraction enhancement" and "handling different poses" suggests adapting the model to accurately classify rays despite variations in their appearance and position.
