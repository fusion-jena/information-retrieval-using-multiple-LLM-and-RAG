The provided text describes the training process of the IUC-NN model but doesn't specify the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete. 

It mentions that cross-validation was performed by shifting the validation set 5 times to quantify the average validation cross-entropy loss and accuracy.  It also states that the model with the lowest cross-entropy loss across different model architectures was selected. 

Therefore, we can infer that the training process likely stopped when the validation cross-entropy loss plateaued or started to increase, indicating potential overfitting.
