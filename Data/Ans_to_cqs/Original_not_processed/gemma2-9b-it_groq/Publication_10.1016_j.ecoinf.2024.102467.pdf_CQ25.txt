Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the architecture and efficiency improvements of the EfficientNetV2 and BoTNet models. It doesn't explicitly state the specific purpose or task these models are designed for (e.g., classification, segmentation, detection). 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what the purpose of the deep learning model is.
