Answer:::

The provided text focuses on spatial modeling for estimating volumetric water content (VWC) using remote sensing data and topographic indices. It doesn't delve into the preprocessing steps involved in training deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.
* **Feature Scaling:**  Transforming features to a similar scale to prevent features with larger magnitudes from dominating the learning process. Common techniques include standardization (z-score normalization) and min-max scaling.
* **Normalization:**  Scaling features to a specific range, often between 0 and 1, to improve model convergence.
* **Encoding Categorical Features:** Converting categorical variables into numerical representations that deep learning models can understand. Techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding are commonly used.
* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training dataset by applying transformations to existing data (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) to improve model generalization. 


Remember that the specific preprocessing steps will depend on the nature of the data and the chosen deep learning model.
