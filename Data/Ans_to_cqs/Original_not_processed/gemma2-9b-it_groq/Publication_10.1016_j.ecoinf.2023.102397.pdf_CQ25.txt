Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the application of machine learning models, particularly random forests and deep neural networks, for species distribution modeling and bird acoustic data analysis. 

While it mentions the use of deep learning, it doesn't explicitly state the specific purpose of the deep learning model described in Benkendorf and Hawkins (2020). 

Based on the context, it's likely that the deep learning model is used for **species distribution modeling**, similar to the approach taken by Benkendorf and Hawkins.
