Answer:::
The provided text mentions the following metrics for evaluating the deep learning model:

* **MSAE (Mean Scaled Absolute Error):** This metric measures the average difference between the model's predictions and the actual cover estimates.

* **IoU (Plants):** This stands for Intersection over Union, averaged over all plant species. It measures the overlap between the predicted plant areas and the actual plant areas.

* **DPC (DCA-Procrustes-Correlation):** This metric assesses the similarity between the predicted species distribution and the actual species distribution.
