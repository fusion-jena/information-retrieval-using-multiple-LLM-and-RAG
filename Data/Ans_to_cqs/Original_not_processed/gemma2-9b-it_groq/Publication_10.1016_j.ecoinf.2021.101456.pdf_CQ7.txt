Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the implementation details of a dynamic Î²-VAE model and doesn't specify the criteria used to split the data for training, testing, and validation.  

To answer your query generally, the splitting of data for deep learning is typically done as follows:

* **Training set:** This is the largest portion of the data (e.g., 70-80%) used to train the model. The model learns patterns and relationships within this data.
* **Validation set:** A smaller portion of the data (e.g., 10-15%) used to evaluate the model's performance during training. This helps monitor overfitting (when the model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data) and tune hyperparameters.
* **Test set:** A separate, unseen portion of the data (e.g., 10-15%) used only once at the end of training to provide an unbiased estimate of the model's final performance.
