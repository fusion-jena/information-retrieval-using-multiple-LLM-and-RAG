Answer:::
The provided text focuses on data processing techniques for ecological studies and doesn't delve into deep learning preprocessing methods like those used to address data bias. 

Therefore, I cannot answer your query about specific techniques used to address data bias in a deep learning pipeline (e.g., stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, diverse data collection) based on the given context.
