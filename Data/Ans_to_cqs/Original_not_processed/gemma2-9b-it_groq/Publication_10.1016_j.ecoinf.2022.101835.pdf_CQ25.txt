Answer:::
The provided text focuses on optimizing machine learning models (Random Forest, Artificial Neural Networks, and LightGBM) for predicting flowering dates.  It doesn't explicitly state the specific purpose of the deep learning model (ANN) beyond that goal. 

Based on the context, we can infer that the ANN is being used for **regression**, as the performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R2), which are common in regression tasks. 


The models aim to predict the dates of first flowering and full blossom, likely for a plant species.
