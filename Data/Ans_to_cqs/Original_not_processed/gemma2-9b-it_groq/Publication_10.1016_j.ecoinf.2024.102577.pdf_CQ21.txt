Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the model building process and doesn't describe any post-processing steps like saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. 


It mainly details:

* **Data Preparation:**  Selecting relevant environmental variables.
* **Feature Selection:** Using the CFS (Correlation Feature Selection) method to choose the most important predictors.
* **Model Training:**  Training four different classification models (Random Forest, SMO, Multilayer Perceptron, Na√Øve Bayes) and evaluating their performance using 5-fold cross-validation.
* **Model Selection:** Choosing Random Forest as the best-performing model based on accuracy.

The text concludes by mentioning the prediction of probabilities for each species based on the selected variables but doesn't elaborate on any further analysis or visualization techniques.
