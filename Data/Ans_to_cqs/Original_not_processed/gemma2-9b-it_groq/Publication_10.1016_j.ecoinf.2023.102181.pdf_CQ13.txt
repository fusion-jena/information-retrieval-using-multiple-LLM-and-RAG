Answer:::
The provided text does not mention any deep learning models or their hyperparameters (like learning rate or optimizer). It focuses on a machine learning method called covariance-weighted bagging, which is an ensemble technique using decision trees. 

The text does specify hyperparameters for the decision trees used in this method:

* **ntree:** 500 (number of trees)
* **nodesize:** 5 (minimum number of observations in a terminal node)
* **mtry:** ⌊Nβ⌋ = 3 (number of variables tried at each split, where Nβ = 5 is the number of predictors)
