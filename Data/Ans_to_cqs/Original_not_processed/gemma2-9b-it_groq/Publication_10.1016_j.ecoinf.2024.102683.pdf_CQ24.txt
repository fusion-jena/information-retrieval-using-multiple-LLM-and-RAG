Answer:::

The provided text focuses on a specific deep learning approach for plant identification and doesn't delve into general strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. 

However, it does mention the use of a Bayesian optimizer to evaluate and select optimal data augmentation policies. Bayesian optimization is a technique that can help mitigate randomness by intelligently searching for the best set of hyperparameters, including those related to data augmentation.

Generally, to handle randomness in deep learning, practitioners employ several strategies:

* **Setting a fixed random seed:** This ensures that the same "random" numbers are generated each time a model is trained, making results reproducible.
* **Using techniques like dropout:** Dropout randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during training, preventing overfitting and introducing some randomness.
* **Data augmentation:**  As mentioned in the text, data augmentation involves applying random transformations (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) to existing data, increasing the diversity of the training set and reducing the impact of randomness in the data itself.
* **Ensemble methods:** Training multiple models with different random initializations and averaging their predictions can help reduce the variance introduced by randomness.
