Answer:::
The provided text focuses on traditional image processing techniques and rule-based systems within eCognition, rather than deep learning models.  

Therefore, it doesn't explicitly state the purpose of a deep learning model within this context. 

However, the text does mention that machine learning techniques are being integrated with segmentation for more automatic image classification. 

Based on this, we can infer that a deep learning model, if used in eCognition, would likely be employed for **image classification**.
