Answer:::
The provided text describes the use of an artificial neural network (ANN) for SPAD value modeling.  

SPAD (Soil Plant Analysis Development) is a method for measuring chlorophyll content in plants. The ANN is used to predict the SPAD value based on other measured indices obtained from the Rasp2SPAD prototype. 

Therefore, the purpose of the deep learning model in this context is **regression**, specifically to predict a continuous numerical value (the SPAD value).
