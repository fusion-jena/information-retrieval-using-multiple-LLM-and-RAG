Answer:::
The text states that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used in the pipeline.  

Specifically, four pretrained CNN architectures are evaluated: ResNet18, VGG16, DenseNet121, and AlexNet. These CNNs are used for feature extraction as part of meta-learning algorithms like Matching Networks, Prototypical Networks, and Relation Networks.
