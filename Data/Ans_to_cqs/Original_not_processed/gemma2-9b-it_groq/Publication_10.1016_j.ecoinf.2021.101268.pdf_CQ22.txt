Answer:::
The provided text focuses on accuracy as the primary metric for evaluating the deep learning models. 

Specifically, it reports accuracy scores for three different scenarios:

* **Raw vs. Pre-processed Data:**  Accuracy is measured on both raw and pre-processed images during training, validation, and testing phases.
* **Data Swapping:**  Accuracy is assessed when testing sets are swapped between raw and pre-processed images.

While the text mentions other aspects like robustness and model behavior, it doesn't delve into other metrics like precision, recall, or F1-score.
