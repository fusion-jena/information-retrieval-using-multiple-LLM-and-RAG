Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the implementation of machine learning models like Random Forest, Artificial Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines. It describes the structure of the ANN, its hyperparameters, and the activation function used. 

However, the text doesn't delve into the specific optimization techniques employed during the training process of these models.  Therefore, I cannot answer your query about optimization techniques like SGD or Adam based on the given context.
