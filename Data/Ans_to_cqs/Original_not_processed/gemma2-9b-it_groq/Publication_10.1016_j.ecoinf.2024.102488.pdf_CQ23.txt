Answer:::

The provided text focuses on a machine learning approach rather than deep learning. It describes a process of feature selection using Recursive Feature Elimination and Cross-Validation (RFECV) and ensemble methods combining multiple base models (TKNN, TRF, TAdaBoost, TXGBoost, TLightGBM) for classification. 

While the text mentions five-fold cross-validation in the context of RFECV for feature selection, it doesn't explicitly state whether stratified splitting was used for dataset partitioning or if the dataset itself was designed for diversity.
