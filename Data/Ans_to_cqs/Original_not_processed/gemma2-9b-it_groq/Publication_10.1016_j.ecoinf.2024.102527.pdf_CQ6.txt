Answer:::
The provided text focuses on transfer learning strategies and model architecture details for image recognition, particularly in the context of empty image vs. animal image classification. It doesn't specify the exact preprocessing steps used before training the deep learning models. 

Therefore, I cannot answer your query about specific preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning from this context.
