Answer:::
The provided text focuses on hyperparameter tuning for machine learning models and doesn't specify the criteria used to determine the completion of training.  

To answer your query generally, common criteria for determining training completion include:

* **Validation Loss Plateau:**  Training continues until the validation loss (loss on unseen data) stops decreasing significantly. This indicates the model might be overfitting (performing well on training data but poorly on new data).
* **Epoch Limit:** A predefined number of training epochs (passes through the entire dataset) is set. Training stops after reaching this limit.
* **Early Stopping:**  Monitoring a metric like validation loss or accuracy. If the metric doesn't improve for a certain number of epochs, training stops to prevent overfitting.
* **Convergence:**  The model's performance on the training data reaches a satisfactory level, and further training yields negligible improvements.
