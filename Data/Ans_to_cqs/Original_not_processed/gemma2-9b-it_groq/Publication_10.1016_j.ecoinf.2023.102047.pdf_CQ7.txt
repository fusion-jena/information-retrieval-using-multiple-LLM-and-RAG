Answer:::
The provided text focuses on object detection models and data preprocessing techniques, but it doesn't specify the criteria used to split data for training, testing, and validation in deep learning. 

Generally, data is split into these sets using the following criteria:

* **Training set:** This is the largest portion of the data (e.g., 70-80%) used to train the deep learning model. The model learns patterns and relationships within this data.
* **Validation set:** A smaller portion of the data (e.g., 10-15%) used to evaluate the model's performance during training. This helps monitor overfitting and tune hyperparameters.
* **Test set:**  A separate, unseen portion of the data (e.g., 10-15%) used only once at the end of training to provide an unbiased estimate of the final model performance. 

The specific split ratios can vary depending on the dataset size and the complexity of the problem.
