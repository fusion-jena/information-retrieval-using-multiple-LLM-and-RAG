Answer:::
The provided text does not describe the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.  It focuses on the hyperparameter optimization process using a technique called HPB3C-3PGA and compares the performance of the proposed approach with various existing transfer learning methods on different datasets. 

There is no mention of techniques like data augmentation, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, which are commonly used to improve model generalizability.
