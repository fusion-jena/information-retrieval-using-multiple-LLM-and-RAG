Answer:::

Several strategies are used to manage randomness in the deep learning pipeline. 

* **Setting a Random Seed:** This is a fundamental technique. By initializing the random number generator with a specific seed value, you ensure that the same "random" numbers are generated every time you run your code. This reproducibility is crucial for comparing results and debugging.

* **Data Shuffling:**  Training data is often shuffled randomly before each epoch (iteration over the entire dataset). This prevents the model from learning patterns that might arise from the inherent order of the data.

* **Dropout:** This regularization technique randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during each training step. This prevents the model from relying too heavily on any single neuron and encourages the learning of more robust features.

* **Batch Normalization:** This technique normalizes the activations of neurons within each mini-batch (a subset of the training data). This helps stabilize training and reduce the impact of random fluctuations in the data.

* **Weight Initialization:** Different methods for initializing the weights of the neural network can influence the training process. Some techniques, like Xavier or He initialization, aim to reduce the initial variance in activations and promote more stable learning.


These strategies, when combined, help mitigate the randomness inherent in deep learning and lead to more reliable and reproducible results.
