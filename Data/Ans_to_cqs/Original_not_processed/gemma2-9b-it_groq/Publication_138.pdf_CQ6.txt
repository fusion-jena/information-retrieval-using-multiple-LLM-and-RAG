The provided text focuses on the architecture of a specific deep learning model (ICSNet) and doesn't describe the preprocessing steps involved in training deep learning models in general. 

To answer your question about common preprocessing steps:

**Common preprocessing steps for deep learning models include:**

* **Normalization:** Scaling pixel values to a specific range (e.g., 0 to 1 or -1 to 1). This helps improve training stability and speed.
* **Scaling:**  Adjusting the range of feature values to have zero mean and unit variance. This can help algorithms converge faster.
* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training dataset by applying transformations like rotations, flips, crops, and color adjustments. This helps models generalize better to unseen data.
* **Cleaning:** Removing noise, outliers, or irrelevant information from the data. This can involve techniques like handling missing values, removing duplicates, or filtering based on specific criteria.
* **Encoding Categorical Data:** Converting categorical variables (e.g., text labels) into numerical representations that the model can understand. Common methods include one-hot encoding or label encoding.
