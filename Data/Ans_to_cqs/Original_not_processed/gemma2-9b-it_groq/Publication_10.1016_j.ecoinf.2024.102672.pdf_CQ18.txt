Answer:::
The provided text describes the process of training a classification model to detect stratification in reservoirs. It mentions that the number of epochs was set to 500 to ensure the stabilization of the loss curves during training. 

However, it doesn't explicitly state what specific strategy was used to monitor the model's performance *during* training.  We know the final performance was evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and percentile, but the text doesn't detail how these metrics were tracked throughout the training process.
