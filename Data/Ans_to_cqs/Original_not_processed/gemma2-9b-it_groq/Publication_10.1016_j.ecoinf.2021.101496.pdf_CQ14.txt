Answer:::
The provided text doesn't specify the exact method used for optimizing the hyperparameters of the artificial neural network (ANN). 

It only mentions that the ANN was "constructed empirically" and that "a random number generator was used for numerical optimization of the model". 


This suggests that a random search approach might have been employed for hyperparameter optimization.
