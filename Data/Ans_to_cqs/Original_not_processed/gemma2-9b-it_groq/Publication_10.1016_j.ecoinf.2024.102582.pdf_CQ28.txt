Answer:::
The provided text states that the study utilized the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform.  While it doesn't explicitly mention deploying a deep learning model, it highlights GEE's capabilities for processing and analyzing large volumes of geospatial data, including remote sensing images. 

Therefore, it's plausible that the deep learning model was deployed on the Google Cloud Platform, as GEE is a cloud-based platform associated with Google.
