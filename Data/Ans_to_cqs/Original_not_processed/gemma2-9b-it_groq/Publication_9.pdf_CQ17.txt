The provided text focuses on the training process of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and their applications in computer vision, particularly in ecology and evolutionary biology.  It doesn't delve into specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting. 


However,  common regularization techniques used in deep learning to combat overfitting include:

* **Dropout:** Randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during each training step. This prevents the network from relying too heavily on any single neuron and encourages the learning of more robust features.

* **L2 Regularization (Weight Decay):** Adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model weights. This discourages the weights from becoming too large, effectively preventing overfitting.

* **L1 Regularization (Lasso):**  Similar to L2 regularization but uses the absolute value of the weights. This can lead to some weights being driven to exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection.
