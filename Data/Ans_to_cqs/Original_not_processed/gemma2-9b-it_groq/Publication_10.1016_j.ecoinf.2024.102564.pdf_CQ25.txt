Answer:::
The provided text focuses on comparing the performance of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Random Forests (RF) in modeling net growth in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest.  

While it mentions that the ANN used was a multilayer perceptron (MLP), it doesn't explicitly state the specific purpose of this model beyond growth prediction. 

Therefore, based on the given context, we can infer that the purpose of the deep learning model (MLP) is **to predict net growth** in forest fragments within the Brazilian Atlantic Forest.
