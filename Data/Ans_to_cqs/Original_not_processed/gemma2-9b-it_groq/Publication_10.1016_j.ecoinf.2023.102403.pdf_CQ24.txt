Answer:::

The provided text focuses on biodiversity patterns and data analysis, and doesn't contain information about deep learning or strategies for handling randomness in machine learning pipelines. 

To answer your query about randomness in deep learning, here are some common strategies:

* **Setting a random seed:** This initializes the random number generator, ensuring that the same "random" values are generated every time you run your code. This is crucial for reproducibility.

* **Using deterministic operations:**  Wherever possible, use operations in your model that are deterministic (i.e., they always produce the same output for the same input).

* **Dropout:** This technique randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during training. This prevents overfitting and introduces some randomness into the learning process.
* **Batch normalization:** This technique normalizes the activations of neurons within each batch, reducing the impact of internal covariate shift and improving training stability.
