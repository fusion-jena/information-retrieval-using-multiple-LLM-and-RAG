Answer:::
The provided text describes a deep learning pipeline for goat vocalization detection. It explicitly mentions the use of **audio** data. 

Here's a breakdown of the audio data processing steps:

1. **Monophonic audio:** The audio is converted to a single channel.
2. **Resampling:** The audio is resampled to 16 kHz.
3. **Spectrogram extraction:** A spectrogram is created using the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) with 25 ms windows and 15 ms overlap.
4. **Mel spectrogram:** The spectrogram is converted to a Mel spectrogram using 64 bins in the range of 125â€“7500 Hz.

Therefore, the deep learning pipeline primarily uses **audio data** in the form of spectrograms.
