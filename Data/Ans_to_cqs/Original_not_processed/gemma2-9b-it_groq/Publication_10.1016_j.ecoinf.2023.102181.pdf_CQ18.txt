Answer:::
The provided text describes a method called covariance-weighted bagging for training machine learning models, particularly focusing on addressing bias in clustered data.  

It mentions using "out-of-bag validation" to assess the model's performance. This technique involves:

* **Bootstrap Sampling:**  Training multiple models on different random subsets (bootstrap samples) of the data.
* **Prediction on Omitted Data:** For each bootstrap sample, the model predicts values for data points *not* included in that specific sample. These are the "out-of-bag" data points.
* **Averaging Predictions:** The predictions from all models for each out-of-bag data point are averaged to obtain a final prediction.

This out-of-bag validation allows for performance monitoring during training without the need to explicitly hold out a separate validation set.
