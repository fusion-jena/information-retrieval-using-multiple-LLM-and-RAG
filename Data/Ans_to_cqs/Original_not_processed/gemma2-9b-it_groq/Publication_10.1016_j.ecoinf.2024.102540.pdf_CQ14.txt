Answer:::
The provided text states that the optimal hyperparameters (400 epochs and a batch size of 8) were determined through "initial computational experiments with different combinations of epochs of 300, 400 and 500 with batch sizes of 8, 16, and 32". 

However, it does not specify the exact method used for these experiments (e.g., grid search, random search, or a manual process).
