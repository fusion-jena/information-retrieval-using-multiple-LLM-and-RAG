The provided text focuses on the performance comparison of the PTDLEN-VAE model with other techniques on the UCM and AID datasets. It doesn't mention specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model, such as:

* **Diverse dataset:**  Whether the datasets used for training and evaluation were diverse enough to represent the real-world scenarios.
* **Cross-validation:**  If techniques like k-fold cross-validation were employed to assess the model's performance on different subsets of the data.
* **Stratified splitting:** Whether the data was split into training and testing sets in a way that maintains the class distribution. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
