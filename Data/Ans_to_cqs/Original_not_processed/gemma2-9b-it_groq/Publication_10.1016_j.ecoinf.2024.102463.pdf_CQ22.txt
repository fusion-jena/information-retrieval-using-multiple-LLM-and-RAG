Answer:::
The text mentions the following metrics for evaluating the deep learning model's performance:

* **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):**  Measures the average absolute difference between the predicted values (Ì‚yt) and the actual values (yt).
* **NSE (Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency):**  A statistical measure that compares the variance of the observed data to the variance of the predicted data. 
* **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error):**  Measures the square root of the average squared difference between the predicted values and the actual values.
* **Bias:**  Measures the average difference between the predicted values and the actual values.
