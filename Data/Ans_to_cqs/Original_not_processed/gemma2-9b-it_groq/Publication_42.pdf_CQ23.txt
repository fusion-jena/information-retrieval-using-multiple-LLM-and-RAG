The provided text focuses on the model architecture and hyperparameter tuning process. It doesn't mention specific techniques used to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as:

* **Diverse dataset:**  Information about the dataset's diversity (e.g., species representation, environmental conditions) is not provided.
* **Cross-validation:** The text doesn't describe the use of cross-validation techniques to evaluate model performance on different data subsets.
* **Stratified splitting:**  There's no mention of stratified splitting for ensuring balanced class representation in training and validation sets. 


Therefore, based on the given context, we cannot determine what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.
