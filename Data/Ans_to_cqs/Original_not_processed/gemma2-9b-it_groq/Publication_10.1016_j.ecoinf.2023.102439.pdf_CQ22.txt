Answer:::
The text mentions several statistical metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model:

* **Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE)**
* **Mean Square Error (MSE)**
* **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**
* **Correlation coefficient (R)** 


These metrics help assess the accuracy and predictive capability of the model by comparing the predicted values with the actual observed values.
