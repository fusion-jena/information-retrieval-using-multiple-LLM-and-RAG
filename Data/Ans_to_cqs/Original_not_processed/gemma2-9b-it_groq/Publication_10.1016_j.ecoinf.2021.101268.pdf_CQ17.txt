Answer:::
The provided text focuses on comparing the performance of different deep learning architectures (AlexNet, VGG-19, ResNet-101, DenseNet-201) for leaf classification. It doesn't mention any specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting.  


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what regularization methods were used.
