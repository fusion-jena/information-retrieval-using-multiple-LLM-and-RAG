Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the use of GPUs in machine learning, particularly in ecology.  While it mentions applications like image recognition and acoustic recording classification, it doesn't explicitly state the overarching purpose of deep learning models in those contexts. 

However, we can infer the purpose based on the examples:

* **Image recognition:** Deep learning models are used to identify and classify objects within images. 
* **Acoustic recording classification:** Deep learning models are used to categorize sounds captured in recordings.

Therefore, we can conclude that the deep learning models mentioned in the text are primarily used for **classification** tasks.
