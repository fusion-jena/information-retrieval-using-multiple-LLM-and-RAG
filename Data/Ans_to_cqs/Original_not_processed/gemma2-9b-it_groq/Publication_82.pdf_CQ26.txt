The text mentions that the authors were concerned about biases associated with lighting conditions and data collection methods. To address this, they experimented with a gray-scaled version of the dataset to test the model's ability to learn higher-level structural information without relying on color. 

However, the text doesn't explicitly describe other techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection used during the preprocessing stage.
