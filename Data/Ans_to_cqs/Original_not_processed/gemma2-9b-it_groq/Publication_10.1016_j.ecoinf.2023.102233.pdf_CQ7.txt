Answer:::
The provided text states that the training/validation dataset was split into 70% for training and 30% for validation.  

This split was chosen to minimize overfitting, which is when a model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data. 

A separate test dataset was used for final evaluation of the model.  The text does not specify how the test dataset was split from the training/validation data.
