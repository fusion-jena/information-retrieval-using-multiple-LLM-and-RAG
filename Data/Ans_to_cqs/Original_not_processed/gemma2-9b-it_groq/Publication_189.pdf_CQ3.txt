Answer: The provided text describes the use of **instance segmentation** for data annotation. 

Specifically, it mentions:

* **Bounding boxes:** While not explicitly stated, outlining the borders of objects to associate each pixel with a label implies the use of bounding boxes as a technique.

* **Segmentation:** The text clearly states that "the borders of objects were outlined to associate every single pixel of objects in an entire image with a particular tag/label." This is the defining characteristic of instance segmentation.


The text also mentions that the annotated data was converted into the COCO 1.0 dataset format, which includes information like segmentation masks, bounding boxes, and object IDs, further supporting the use of instance segmentation.
