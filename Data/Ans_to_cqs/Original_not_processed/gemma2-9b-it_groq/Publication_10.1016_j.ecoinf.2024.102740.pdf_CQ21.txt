Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the methodology of using Random Forest for grassland classification, outlining data preparation, model training parameters, and software used.  

However, it doesn't delve into specific post-processing steps like:

* **Saliency maps:**  These are visualizations that highlight the input features most influential in a model's prediction for a specific instance.
* **Metrics calculation:**  This involves evaluating the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC.
* **Confusion matrix:** This is a table that summarizes the model's predictions by showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what post-processing steps were involved after model training.
