Answer:::
The provided text describes the datasets used for training and testing a deep learning model but doesn't explicitly state the criteria used to split the data into train, test, and validation sets. 

It does mention that 80% of the Dhan-Shomadhan dataset is used for training purposes, and the remaining 20% is used for testing and validation.  

To generally answer your question, data splitting for deep learning typically follows these common practices:

* **Training Set:** The largest portion of the data (e.g., 70-80%) is used to train the model. The model learns patterns and relationships within this data.
* **Validation Set:** A smaller portion (e.g., 10-15%) is used to evaluate the model's performance during training. This helps monitor training progress, prevent overfitting, and tune hyperparameters.
* **Test Set:**  A separate, unseen portion (e.g., 10-15%) is reserved for final evaluation of the trained model's performance on data it hasn't encountered before. This provides a realistic estimate of how well the model will generalize to new data.
