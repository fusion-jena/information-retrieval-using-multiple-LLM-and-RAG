Answer:::
To monitor model performance during training, the researchers used a validation set.  

For each training stage, a validation set comprising 20% of the current dataset's images was constructed. This validation set was carefully designed to:

* **Maintain a similar distribution of species:** This ensured that the model wasn't overfitting to a particular species.
* **Ensure independence:** Images from the same transect were kept together to avoid spatial bias.

The model's performance was evaluated on this validation set at each training stage.  The model relative to the epoch that gave the best performance on the validation set was selected to avoid overfitting.
