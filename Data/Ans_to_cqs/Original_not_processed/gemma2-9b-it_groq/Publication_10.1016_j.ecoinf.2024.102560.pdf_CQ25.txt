Answer:::
The provided text describes a study that used machine learning to map soil salinity in the Urmia Lake basin.  Specifically, it mentions the use of Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2A satellite images, along with ground-based EC (electrical conductivity) measurements. 

Based on this information, the purpose of the deep learning model is likely **classification**. 

The model is probably trained to classify different areas within the Urmia Lake basin based on their soil salinity levels. This would result in a soil salinity map that shows the spatial distribution of various soil salinity classes.
