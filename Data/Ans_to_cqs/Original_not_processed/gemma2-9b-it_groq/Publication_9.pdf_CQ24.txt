The provided text focuses on the challenges and applications of using deep learning for image segmentation in biological research, particularly with fish images. It doesn't discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. 


To answer your question about handling randomness in deep learning, here are some common strategies:

* **Setting a Random Seed:**  Deep learning models often use random initialization for weights and random shuffling of data during training. Setting a random seed ensures that the same "random" values are used each time you run the code, making your results reproducible.

* **Data Augmentation:**  This technique introduces controlled variations (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) to your training data. It helps the model generalize better and reduces the impact of randomness in the data itself.

* **Dropout:**  A regularization technique that randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during each training step. This prevents the model from relying too heavily on any single neuron and encourages the learning of more robust features.

* **Batch Normalization:**  A technique that normalizes the activations of neurons within each mini-batch during training. This can help stabilize training and reduce the impact of random fluctuations in the data.
