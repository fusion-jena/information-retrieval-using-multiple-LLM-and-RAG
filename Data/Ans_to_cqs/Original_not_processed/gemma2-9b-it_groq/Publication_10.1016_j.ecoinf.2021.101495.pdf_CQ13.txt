Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the architecture and training process of the deep learning models, but it doesn't specify the exact optimizer used. 

Here's what we know about the hyperparameters:

* **Epochs:** The segmentation model used 15,000 epochs, while the classification model used 500 epochs.
* **Batch size:** The segmentation model used a batch size of 128, and the classification model used a batch size of 500.
* **Learning rate:** The segmentation model used a learning rate of 0.008, and the classification model used a learning rate of 0.0001.
* **Activation function:** Both the segmentation and classification models used the Softmax activation function.
* **Train/test split:** Both models used a train/test split of 0.9/0.1 for segmentation and 0.8/0.2 for classification.
