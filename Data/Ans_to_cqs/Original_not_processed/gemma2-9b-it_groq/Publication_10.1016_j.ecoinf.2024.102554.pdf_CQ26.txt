Answer: 

The provided text focuses on remote sensing data from various sources like Sentinel, VIIRS, and MODIS, and doesn't delve into the specifics of deep learning preprocessing techniques for addressing data bias. 

Therefore, I cannot answer your query about techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection used in a deep learning pipeline's preprocessing stage based on the given context.
