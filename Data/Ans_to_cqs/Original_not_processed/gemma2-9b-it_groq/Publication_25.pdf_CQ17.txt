Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the challenges of training deep learning models for natural systems, particularly in remote sensing, due to limited training data. It discusses self-supervised learning as a potential solution to this problem. 

However, the text does not mention specific regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization used to prevent overfitting.
