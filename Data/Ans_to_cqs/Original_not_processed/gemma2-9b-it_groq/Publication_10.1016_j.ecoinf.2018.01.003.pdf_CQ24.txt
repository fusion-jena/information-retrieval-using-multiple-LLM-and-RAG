Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the history and development of deep learning and related fields like ecological informatics and doesn't delve into specific strategies for handling randomness within the deep learning pipeline. 

To answer your query about strategies for handling randomness in deep learning, here are some common techniques:

* **Setting a Random Seed:**  As you mentioned, specifying a random seed initializes random number generators used in various parts of the deep learning process (weight initialization, dropout, etc.). This ensures reproducibility of results.

* **Weight Initialization Techniques:**  Different methods for initializing the initial weights of a neural network can influence the learning process. Some techniques aim to reduce randomness and improve stability.

* **Dropout:** This regularization technique randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during each training step. This prevents overfitting and introduces stochasticity, helping the network generalize better.

* **Batch Normalization:** This technique normalizes the activations within each layer, reducing internal covariate shift and making the training process more stable.

* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training dataset by applying random transformations (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) to existing data samples. This introduces variation and helps the model learn more robust features.
