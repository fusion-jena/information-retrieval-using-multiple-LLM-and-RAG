Answer:::
The provided text focuses on describing the Wav2Vec model architecture and its training process but doesn't specify the exact criteria used to determine the completion of training. 

However, it does mention:

* **Loss and accuracy plots (Figs. 12 and 13):** These plots likely show how the model's performance (measured by loss and accuracy) changes over time during training. 
* **Varying epochs:** The text refers to "varying epochs," which suggests that training duration is measured in epochs (one epoch being a complete pass through the training dataset).

Based on common machine learning practices, it's likely that training is considered complete when:

* **Validation loss plateaus:**  The loss on a separate validation dataset stops decreasing significantly, indicating the model is likely overfitting to the training data.
* **Accuracy reaches a satisfactory level:** The model achieves a desired level of accuracy on the validation set.
* **A maximum number of epochs is reached:** Training might be stopped after a predetermined number of epochs, even if the loss hasn't plateaued.


It's important to note that these are general practices, and the specific criteria used in this particular case would need to be found in the full research paper or documentation.
