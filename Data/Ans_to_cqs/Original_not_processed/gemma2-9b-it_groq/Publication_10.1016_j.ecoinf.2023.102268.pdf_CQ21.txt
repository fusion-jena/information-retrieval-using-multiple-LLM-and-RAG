Answer:::
The provided text describes the following post-processing steps:

* **10-fold cross-validation:** This technique was used to define the score-to-posterior-probability transformation function. This function is crucial for estimating the probability of a new observation belonging to a particular class.

* **Confusion matrix:** A confusion matrix was generated for the test data to visualize the performance of the trained SVM classifier. This matrix shows the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, providing insights into the model's accuracy and potential biases. 


The text does not mention saliency maps or other specific metrics calculation methods.
