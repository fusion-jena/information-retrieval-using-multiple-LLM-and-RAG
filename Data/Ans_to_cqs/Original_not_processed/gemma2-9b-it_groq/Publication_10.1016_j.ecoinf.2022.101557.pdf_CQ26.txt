Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the data pre-processing steps for a specific project involving wetland classification using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).  It describes how the data is split into blocks for cross-validation and further divided into smaller areas for training the CNN.  

The text doesn't mention specific techniques to address data bias during pre-processing, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.
