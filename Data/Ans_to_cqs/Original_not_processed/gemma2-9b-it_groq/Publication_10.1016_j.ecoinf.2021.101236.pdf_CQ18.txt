Answer:::
The provided text doesn't explicitly state the specific strategy used to monitor model performance during training.  It does mention:

* **Oversampling:**  Used to address class imbalance in the dataset.
* **Mixup training:** Employed to diversify the training data.
* **Learning rate reduction:**  A step-wise reduction in the learning rate was applied.
* **Batch size:**  A batch size of 32 was used.
* **Optimizer:** The ADAM optimizer was used with an initial learning rate of 0.001. 


While these are training hyperparameters and techniques, they don't directly reveal the method used to track performance metrics like accuracy, loss, or validation performance during the training process.
