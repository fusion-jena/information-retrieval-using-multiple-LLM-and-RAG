The provided text describes the model training process and evaluation metrics but doesn't detail specific post-processing steps like saliency maps or confusion matrix generation. 

It does mention:

* **Performance Metrics Calculation:** The text states that Table 1 shows performance metrics like Sensitivity and Specificity calculated using the test data. 
* **Logging Predictions:** The text describes the predicted vector being processed and logged to a site for review.


Therefore, we can infer that at least performance metric calculation is a post-processing step. However, the text doesn't explicitly mention other post-processing techniques like saliency maps or confusion matrix construction.
