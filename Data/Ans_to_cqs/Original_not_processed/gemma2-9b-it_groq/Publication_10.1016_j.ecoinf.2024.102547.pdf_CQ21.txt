Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the analysis of a multifrequency acoustics dataset and the application of functional data analysis (FDA) techniques. It doesn't delve into specific post-processing steps commonly used after model training in machine learning, such as:

* **Saliency maps:** These highlight the regions of input data that are most influential in the model's prediction.
* **Metrics calculation:**  This involves evaluating the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC, etc.
* **Confusion matrix:** This visualizes the performance of a classification model by showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what post-processing steps were involved after model training.
