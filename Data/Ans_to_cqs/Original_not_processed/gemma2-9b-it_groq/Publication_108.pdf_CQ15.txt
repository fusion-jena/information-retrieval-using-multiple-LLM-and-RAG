Answer: The provided text states that the optimal solution was found using  "Scenario 5" which employed a learning rate of 0.001.  It also mentions Adam as an optimization technique in reference 31. 

Therefore, we can infer that **Adam** was likely the optimization algorithm used in this deep learning pipeline.
