The provided text describes the performance of models trained with different annotation sets but doesn't specify the strategy used to monitor model performance *during* training. 

It does mention evaluating the models on separate evaluation sets (SWAMS and ElephantIsland2013) after training, using metrics like AUC and mAP.
