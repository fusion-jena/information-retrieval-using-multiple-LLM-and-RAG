Answer:::

The provided text focuses on describing the methodology used for downscaling wind fields and doesn't explicitly mention specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. 

The text does discuss the following:

* **Training data:** The text mentions using a diverse dataset for training the model, but it doesn't specify the details of the dataset's diversity.
* **Cross-validation:** The text mentions using cross-validation to calibrate the models, but it doesn't elaborate on the specific cross-validation technique employed.
* **Stratified splitting:** The text doesn't mention stratified splitting as a technique used for data preparation.

Therefore, based on the provided information, we can't definitively say what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model beyond stating that a diverse dataset was used and cross-validation was employed for calibration.
