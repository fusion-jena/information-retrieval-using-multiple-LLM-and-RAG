Answer:::
The text states that the following metrics were computed to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model:

* **Accuracy:**  A measure of the overall correctness of the model.
* **Precision:** A measure of how many correctly predicted positive instances there are among all instances predicted as positive.
* **Recall:** Measures the ability of the model to capture all the positive instances.
* **F1 score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
* **Confusion matrix:**  A table that summarizes the performance of the classification model by showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
