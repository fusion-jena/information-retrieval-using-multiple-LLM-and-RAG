Answer:::
The provided text describes a deep learning model used for **predicting invasion**.  

Specifically, the model takes an image as input and outputs a prediction between 0.0 and 1.0, indicating the likelihood of invasion in that area.  The text mentions that this regression approach is practical and easy to interpret because it allows for the direct estimation of continuous transitions and patterns in the landscape, such as plant covers.
