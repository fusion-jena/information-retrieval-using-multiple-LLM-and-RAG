Answer:::

The provided text describes the model's training process and architecture but doesn't explicitly mention specific techniques used to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. 

The text states that the model was fine-tuned using Gulf of Mexico data, implying some level of domain adaptation. However, it doesn't detail whether a diverse dataset was used for training or fine-tuning, nor does it mention cross-validation or stratified splitting techniques. 


Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot definitively say what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.
