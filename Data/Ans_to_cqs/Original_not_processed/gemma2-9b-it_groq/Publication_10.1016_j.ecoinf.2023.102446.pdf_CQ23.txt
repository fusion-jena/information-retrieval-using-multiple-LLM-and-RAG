Answer:::
The provided text does not describe any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.  It mentions the use of 100 surrogates and a 1% significance level, but these are related to statistical analysis and model validation, not generalizability techniques. 

The text also states that the study period was limited to two years (December 2014 to November 2016) due to data availability. This limitation could potentially affect the generalizability of the model to other time periods.
