Answer:::
The provided text snippets do not explicitly state the specific purpose of the deep learning model. 

However,  several clues suggest the model is likely used for **classification**:

* **"automated signal recognition software"**: This phrase implies the model is trained to recognize and categorize different bird vocalizations.
* **"identify species for which we have a clear gap of knowledge"**: This suggests the model is used to classify unknown bird sounds, helping researchers identify species that need further study.
* **"a pipeline for identification of bird and frog species"**: This explicitly mentions species identification as the goal of the model.


Therefore, based on the context, it is highly probable that the deep learning model is used for **bird and frog species classification**.
