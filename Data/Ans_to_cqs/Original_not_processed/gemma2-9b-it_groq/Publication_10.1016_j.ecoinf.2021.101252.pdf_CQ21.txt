Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the model training process and doesn't describe any post-processing steps like saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix construction. 


It mainly explains:

* **Candidate model training:**  Various architectures (ResNet, InceptionTime, LSTM, CNN) were trained and evaluated based on accuracy.
* **Epoch selection:** The "optimal" number of training epochs was determined by monitoring validation performance (Bv) and stopping when no further improvement was observed.
* **Final model evaluation:** The model with the best validation performance was then tested on a separate dataset (T) to measure its predictive performance using AUC. 


Therefore, based on the given information, we can't determine the specific post-processing steps used.
