Answer:::
The provided text mentions several datasets used for evaluating the performance of the proposed TrunkNet model, but it doesn't explicitly list the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for training the model. 

The text states that TrunkNet was evaluated on public datasets such as:

*  RGB-images of a modern apple orchard 
*  RGB-images of complex urban scenes
*  Static images and living videos of a commercial orchard
*  RGB-images and point cloud data of a commercial orchard
*  RGB-images of a single tree branch
*  Synthetic images and natural images of forests 


It also mentions  datasets used for evaluating other models, like SOD and OD datasets.
