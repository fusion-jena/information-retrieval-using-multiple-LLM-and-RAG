Answer:::
To improve the generalizability of the deep learning model, the researchers took the following steps:

* **Data Augmentation:** They used a partially trained model to annotate new data, effectively creating a larger dataset. This self-annotation process was then manually checked and edited by a human. This method allowed them to expand the dataset significantly while reducing the time required for manual annotation.

* **Location-Specific Fine-Tuning:** Recognizing the differences in image quality between the locations, they fine-tuned the model separately on a smaller dataset specific to Kenya, where the image quality was lower.
