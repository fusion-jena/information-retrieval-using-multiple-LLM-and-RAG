Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the implementation and comparison of different machine learning models, particularly Random Forest (RF) and Lasso, for forecasting ENSO. It doesn't delve into the specifics of how the deep learning model (LSTM) was evaluated for generalizability. 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
