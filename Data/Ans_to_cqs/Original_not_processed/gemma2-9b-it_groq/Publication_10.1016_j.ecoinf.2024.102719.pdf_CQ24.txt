Answer:::

Several strategies are used to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. 

* **Setting a fixed random seed:** This ensures that the same "random" numbers are generated each time a model is trained, leading to reproducible results. This is crucial for debugging, comparing different models, and ensuring consistent experiments.

* **Data shuffling:**  Training data is often shuffled before each epoch (iteration over the entire dataset). This prevents the model from learning patterns that might arise from the order of data points.

* **Dropout:** This regularization technique randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during each training step. This prevents the model from relying too heavily on any single neuron and encourages the learning of more robust features.

* **Weight initialization:** Different methods exist for initializing the weights of a neural network, some of which introduce randomness. Techniques like Xavier or He initialization aim to distribute the initial weights in a way that helps with training stability.

* **Batch normalization:** This technique normalizes the activations of neurons within each mini-batch (a subset of the training data). This can help stabilize training and reduce the impact of random fluctuations in the data.

By employing these strategies, deep learning practitioners can mitigate the negative effects of randomness and improve the reliability and reproducibility of their models.
