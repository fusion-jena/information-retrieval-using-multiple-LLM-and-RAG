Answer:::
The provided text focuses on semantic segmentation and doesn't explicitly detail the specific data annotation techniques used in the broader deep learning pipeline. 

However, it does mention:

* **Semantic Segmentation:** This technique involves pixel-wise classification, assigning each pixel in an image to a specific category.  

While the text doesn't state how the COCO dataset was annotated, it's widely known that datasets like COCO use **instance segmentation** for object detection. Instance segmentation goes beyond simple bounding boxes by identifying and segmenting individual instances of objects within an image. 

Therefore, we can infer that instance segmentation was likely used for annotating the COCO dataset, which the model was trained on.
