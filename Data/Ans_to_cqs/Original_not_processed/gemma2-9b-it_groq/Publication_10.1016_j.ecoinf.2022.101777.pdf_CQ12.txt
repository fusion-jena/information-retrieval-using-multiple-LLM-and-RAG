Answer:::
The provided text states that a Random Forest (RF) model is used for image classification.  Random Forest is a machine learning technique, not a deep learning model. 

Deep learning models typically include architectures like CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks), RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks), or Transformers.
