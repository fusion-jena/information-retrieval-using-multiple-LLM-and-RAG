Answer: 

The provided text describes the training and testing process for a machine learning (ML) model, but it doesn't mention the use of deep learning. 

The text does state that:

* **Training and testing datasets were generated using existing field datasets and VHR images.** This suggests an attempt to use real-world data to train the model.
* **Areas dominated by target communities were digitized as polygons, and these polygons were split into calibration and validation sets.** This splitting process aims to prevent overfitting by evaluating the model on unseen data.
* **Splitting polygons rather than pixels minimizes the effect of spatial autocorrelation on model accuracies.** This is a technique to address the potential issue of spatial dependence in the data.

However, the text doesn't explicitly mention techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting, which are commonly used to improve the generalizability of deep learning models.
