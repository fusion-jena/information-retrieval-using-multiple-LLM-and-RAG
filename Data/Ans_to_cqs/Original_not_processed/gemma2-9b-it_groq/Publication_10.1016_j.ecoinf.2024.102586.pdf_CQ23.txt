Answer:::

The provided text does not describe the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.  It does mention that the dataset included specimens of native and alien species, and that the model was evaluated using a  "minimum of 15 executions" and a method relying on the "median obtained from the 30 repetitions". 

However, it does not mention techniques like diverse dataset creation, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, which are commonly used to improve model generalizability.
