Answer:::
The text provides the following metrics for evaluating the performance of the deep learning models:

* **Miss Rate (MR):**  Measures the percentage of true pollen-bearing bees that are incorrectly classified as non-pollen-bearing bees.
* **False Alarm Rate (FAR):** Measures the percentage of non-pollen-bearing bees that are incorrectly classified as pollen-bearing bees.
* **Precision:**  Measures the proportion of correctly identified pollen-bearing bees out of all instances predicted as pollen-bearing.
* **Recall:** Measures the proportion of correctly identified pollen-bearing bees out of all actual pollen-bearing bees.
* **F1-score:**  A harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of a model's performance.
