Answer:::

The provided text focuses on a specific epidemiological model and doesn't delve into strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines.  

However, I can offer some general information about how randomness is managed in deep learning:

* **Random Initialization:**  Weights and biases in neural networks are often initialized randomly. This prevents all neurons from starting with the same values, promoting diversity in the network's initial state and aiding in learning.

* **Dropout:**  A regularization technique where a percentage of neurons are randomly "dropped out" (ignored) during each training step. This prevents overfitting by forcing the network to learn more robust features.

* **Batch Normalization:**  A technique that normalizes the activations of neurons within each mini-batch. This can help stabilize training and reduce the impact of random fluctuations in the data.

* **Random Data Augmentation:**  During training, images or other data can be randomly transformed (e.g., rotated, flipped, cropped) to increase the diversity of the training data and improve generalization.

* **Random Seed:**  Setting a random seed ensures that the random number generator produces the same sequence of random numbers each time a model is trained. This allows for reproducibility of results.
