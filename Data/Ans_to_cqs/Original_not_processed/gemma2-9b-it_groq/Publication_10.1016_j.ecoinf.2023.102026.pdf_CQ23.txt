Answer:::
The provided text does not contain information about a deep learning model or the measures taken to ensure its generalizability.  It focuses on scaling hypotheses in species distribution modeling using various techniques like bootstrapping, generalized linear models, machine learning, random forests, and discusses the potential for similarity in model scales based on factors like species, genus, study area, and algorithm used.
