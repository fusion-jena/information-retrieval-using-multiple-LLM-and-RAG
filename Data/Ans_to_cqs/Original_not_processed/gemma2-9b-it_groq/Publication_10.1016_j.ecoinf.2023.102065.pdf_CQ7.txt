Answer:::
The provided text describes how the data was split into training, validation, and test sets, but it doesn't explicitly state the criteria used for the split. 

We know the following:

* **ROI data:** Recordings were cut using start/stop times from ROIs (regions of interest) and merged into single .wav files for each species and set (train, validation).
* **Data augmentation:** The training set was augmented by splitting the merged .wav file in half and adding the halves sample-wise.
* **Mel-spectrograms:**  All merged .wav files (train, validation) were sliced into 2-second increments and mel-spectrograms were computed.

The text focuses on the data preprocessing steps and doesn't mention the specific proportions allocated to each set (train, validation, test) or any other criteria used for the split.
