Answer:::
The provided text does not specify the exact measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. 

It mentions that the model evaluation was performed on two datasets which are smaller compared to ImageNet.  Additionally, it states that the techniques used for fine-tuning have not been applied to large datasets.  

While the text discusses the importance of dataset size and transfer learning strategies, it doesn't detail specific techniques like diverse dataset creation, cross-validation, or stratified splitting used for model generalizability.
