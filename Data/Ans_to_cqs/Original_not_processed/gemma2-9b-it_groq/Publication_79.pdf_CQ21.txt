The provided text describes the methodology used for training a deep learning model to classify Cerrado physiognomies but doesn't explicitly detail the post-processing steps after training. 

However, based on common practices in deep learning image classification, we can infer some likely post-processing steps:

* **Metrics Calculation:**  Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and overall accuracy (OA) are standard metrics used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. These metrics would be calculated based on the model's predictions and the ground truth labels.
* **Confusion Matrix:** A confusion matrix is a visual representation of the model's performance, showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives for each class. This helps to understand the types of errors the model makes.
* **Visualization:**  Visualizing the results is crucial. This might include:
    * **Thematic Maps:**  Displaying the classified image with each physiognomy represented by a different color.
    * **Saliency Maps:**  Highlighting the regions of the input image that the model focused on when making a prediction for a particular pixel.

It's also possible that other post-processing steps were used, such as:

* **Thresholding:** Adjusting the classification probabilities to create a binary classification map.
* **Smoothing:** Applying filters to reduce noise and create a more visually appealing output map.
