Answer:::
The provided text focuses on a deep learning model for species distribution modeling (SDMs) and doesn't explicitly mention the data formats used in the pipeline. 

However, it does state that the research intends to expand to datasets involving:

* Environmental rasters
* Satellite images
* Time series data 

This suggests that the pipeline likely handles geospatial and time-dependent data formats. 


It's also mentioned that the model is trained on a dataset used in the GeoLifeCLEF 2023 competition, which further implies the use of geospatial data.
