Answer:::
The provided text focuses on machine learning and deep learning approaches for predicting infectious disease and doesn't specify the exact metrics used to evaluate a deep learning model's performance. 

However, it does mention using "out-of-bag" R2 and RMSE values to assess the performance of the trained models.  

Common metrics used to evaluate deep learning models include:

* **Accuracy:** The percentage of correctly classified instances.
* **Precision:** The proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions.
* **Recall:** The proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances.
* **F1-score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure.
* **Area Under the Curve (AUC):**  A measure of the model's ability to distinguish between classes.


It's important to note that the best metrics to use depend on the specific problem and the relative importance of different types of errors.
