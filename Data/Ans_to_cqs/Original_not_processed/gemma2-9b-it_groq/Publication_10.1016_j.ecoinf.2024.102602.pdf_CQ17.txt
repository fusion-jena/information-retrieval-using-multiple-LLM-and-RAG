Answer:::
The provided text mentions the use of early stopping as a regularization technique to prevent overfitting. 

Early stopping works by monitoring the model's performance on a validation dataset. If the performance doesn't improve beyond a certain threshold for a predefined number of epochs (in this case, 16), the training process is halted. This prevents the model from training for too long and memorizing the training data, which can lead to poor generalization on unseen data.

The text does not mention other regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization.
