Answer:::
The provided text describes the architecture of a convolutional neural network (CNN) used for LULC classification but doesn't specify the exact measures taken to ensure the model's generalizability. 

It mentions using auxiliary data like climate and soil characteristics through transfer learning techniques to improve generalization in periods with limited direct data.  

However, it doesn't mention specific techniques like:

* **Diverse dataset:**  Whether the dataset used to train the model was diverse in terms of LULC types, geographical locations, and time periods.
* **Cross-validation:**  Whether techniques like k-fold cross-validation were employed to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
* **Stratified splitting:** Whether the dataset was split into training and testing sets in a stratified manner to maintain the proportion of different LULC classes in both sets. 


Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively say what specific measures were taken to ensure the model's generalizability.
