Answer:::
The text mentions data augmentation techniques like vertical and horizontal flipping to improve the model's accuracy. It also suggests that including more examples in the dataset under different conditions (daylight, seasons) would be beneficial for improving generalization.  

However, the text doesn't describe the use of techniques like cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the diversity of the initial dataset used for training.
