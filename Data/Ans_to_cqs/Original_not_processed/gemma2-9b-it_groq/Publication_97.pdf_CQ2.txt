Answer: The provided text focuses on a deep learning pipeline for image classification using satellite imagery.  

It mentions:

* **Satellite images:** These are the primary input data, described as having a shape of (256, 256, 3) representing height, width, and color channels.
* **Mask data:** This is likely used for supervised learning, with a shape of (20, 256, 256, 1) suggesting it represents binary masks (0 or 1) for object segmentation. 


Therefore, the data formats used in this specific pipeline are **image** (satellite imagery) and **binary mask data**.
