Answer:::
The deep learning model described in the text is used for **segmentation**. 

Specifically, it is used to create a high-resolution CHM (canopy height model) of the Earth at 10m resolution. This CHM is generated by fusing Sentinel-2 optical images with GEDI lidar data using a convolutional neural network.
