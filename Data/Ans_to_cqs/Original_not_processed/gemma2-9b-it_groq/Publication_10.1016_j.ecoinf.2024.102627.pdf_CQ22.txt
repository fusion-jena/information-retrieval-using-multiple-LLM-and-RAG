Answer:::
The provided text describes two metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model:

1. **A30:** This metric represents the percentage of test observations where the correct species label is among the top 30 predicted species. It focuses on the performance for common species, as it prioritizes the first 30 predictions.

2. **MSAk:** This metric, specifically MSA30, is the macro-average accuracy at rank 30. It calculates the average accuracy across all species classes, where accuracy is defined as the percentage of test observations where the correct species label is within the top 30 predicted species. This metric considers the performance for both common and rare species. 


The text also mentions "micro-average" (Ak), but doesn't provide a specific value for it.
