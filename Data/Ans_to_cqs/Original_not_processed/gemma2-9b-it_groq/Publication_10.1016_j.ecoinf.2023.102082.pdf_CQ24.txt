Answer:::

The provided text focuses on using LiDAR data and deep learning for forest biodiversity analysis. It doesn't delve into specific strategies for handling randomness within the deep learning pipeline itself. 

To answer your query about strategies for handling randomness in deep learning (like random seed values), here are some common techniques:

* **Setting a Random Seed:**  A random seed is a starting point for the random number generator. By setting a fixed seed, you ensure that the same "random" numbers are generated each time you run your code, making your results reproducible.

* **Data Augmentation:** This involves introducing controlled variations into your training data (e.g., slight rotations, flips, or color adjustments) to increase the diversity of the data the model sees and reduce overfitting.

* **Dropout:**  During training, dropout randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons in a layer. This prevents the model from relying too heavily on any single neuron and encourages the learning of more robust features.

* **Batch Normalization:** This technique normalizes the activations within each layer of the network, helping to stabilize training and reduce the impact of random initialization.
