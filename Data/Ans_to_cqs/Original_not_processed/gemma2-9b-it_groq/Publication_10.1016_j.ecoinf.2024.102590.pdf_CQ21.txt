Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the data preparation and training process of a supervised learning model for woody cover classification using Google Earth Engine (GEE).  

It doesn't describe any post-processing steps like:

* **Saliency maps:**  Visualizing which image features the model focuses on for making predictions.
* **Metrics calculation:**  Quantifying the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, etc.
* **Confusion matrix:**  A table showing the model's performance by classifying instances correctly and incorrectly.


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what post-processing steps are involved after model training.
