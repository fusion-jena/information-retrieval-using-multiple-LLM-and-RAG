Answer:::
The provided text describes the training process but doesn't specify the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete. 

It does mention that 50% of the training data was held out for validation and a 10-fold cross-validation was used to define the score-to-posterior-probability transformation function. These techniques are common practices in machine learning for evaluating model performance and preventing overfitting, but they don't directly address the stopping point for training. 

Possible criteria for determining training completion, not mentioned in the text, include:

* **Validation loss plateau:**  Training might stop when the validation loss stops decreasing significantly.
* **Maximum number of epochs:**  A predefined limit on the number of training iterations could be set.
* **Early stopping:** Training could be stopped if the validation loss starts increasing, indicating overfitting.
