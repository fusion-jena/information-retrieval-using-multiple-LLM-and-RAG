Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the experimental design and results of three experiments (Exp.1, Exp.2, and Exp.3) related to training and evaluating air quality prediction models. 

It doesn't explicitly describe the post-processing steps involved after model training, such as:

* **Saliency maps:**  These are used to visualize which input features are most influential in the model's predictions.
* **Metrics calculation:**  Various metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE, MRE, accuracy) are used to quantify the model's performance.
* **Confusion matrix:** This matrix helps analyze the types of errors the model makes by showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what post-processing steps are used.
