Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the data collection and preprocessing steps for a deep learning image classification pipeline using Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 data.  

While it mentions the importance of representative training data and the careful selection of samples, it doesn't explicitly describe specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. 

The text does highlight the following:

* **Careful sample selection:** The authors checked all samples for accuracy and found no mis-collected samples. This suggests a focus on ensuring data quality from the outset.
* **Distribution matching:** The text states that the sample's class proportions aim to reflect the real-world class proportions of the landscape. This implies an attempt to balance class representation in the dataset.

However, it doesn't mention techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.
