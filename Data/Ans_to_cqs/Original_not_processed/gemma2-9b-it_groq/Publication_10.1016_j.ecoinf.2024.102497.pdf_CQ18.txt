Answer:::

The provided text doesn't explicitly describe the specific strategy used to monitor model performance during training for either the Random Forest Regression (RFR) or CART models. 

However, it does mention:

* **Fine-tuning model parameters:**  The authors experimented with different parameter values for both models (like 'n_estimators', 'max_depth', etc.) to optimize performance. This process likely involved evaluating the model's performance on a validation set at each stage of parameter adjustment.
* **Cross-validation:** The text states that the goal of parameter tuning was to "minimize cross-validation error." This suggests that cross-validation was used as a performance evaluation technique during training.

Therefore, we can infer that the authors likely used cross-validation to monitor model performance during training and guide the fine-tuning of model parameters.
