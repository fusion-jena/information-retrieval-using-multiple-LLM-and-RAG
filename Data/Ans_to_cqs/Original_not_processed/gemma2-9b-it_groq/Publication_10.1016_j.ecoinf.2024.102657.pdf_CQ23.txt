Answer:::

The provided text describes the dataset splitting process for training and testing the CNN and k-NN models.  

They split each dialect class into training, validation, and testing sets using a 70/10/20 ratio. This means 70% of the songs in each dialect folder were used for training, 10% for validation, and 20% for testing. 

However, the text does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model beyond this splitting strategy.  It does not discuss the diversity of the dataset, cross-validation techniques, or stratified splitting.
