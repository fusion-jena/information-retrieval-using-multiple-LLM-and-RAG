Answer:::

The provided text focuses on challenges and techniques in deep learning for audio enhancement, particularly in bioacoustics. It doesn't delve into specific strategies for handling randomness within the deep learning pipeline. 

However, common practices to manage randomness in deep learning generally include:

* **Setting a fixed random seed:** This ensures that the same "random" numbers are generated in each run, leading to reproducible results.

* **Using deterministic operations:**  Wherever possible, employ operations that don't inherently involve randomness (e.g., matrix multiplication) to minimize variability.

* **Careful hyperparameter tuning:**  Randomness often plays a role in hyperparameter optimization. Techniques like grid search or random search introduce randomness, but the final model selection is based on performance.
