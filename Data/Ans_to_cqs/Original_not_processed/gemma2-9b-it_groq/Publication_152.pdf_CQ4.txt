Answer:::
The provided text mentions data augmentation as a technique used to increase the F1 score, particularly for images collected by UAV flights. 

It states that small changes in brightness and zoom can be helpful, but changes in height and width can lead to visual confusion for CNNs.  

The text also notes that medium or large zoom changes degrade results.  

However, it does **not** specify the exact data augmentation techniques used beyond these general descriptions (brightness, zoom, height, width changes).
