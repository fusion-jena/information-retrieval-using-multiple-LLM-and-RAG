Answer:::
The provided text focuses on overfitting and techniques to mitigate it in deep learning models, particularly in the context of the GREMM dataset and marine mammal re-identification. It doesn't delve into the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. 

However, common preprocessing steps generally include:

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1) to prevent features with larger magnitudes from dominating the learning process.
* **Scaling:**  Similar to normalization, but often involves subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of each feature.
* **Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.
* **Encoding:** Converting categorical variables into numerical representations suitable for deep learning models (e.g., one-hot encoding).
