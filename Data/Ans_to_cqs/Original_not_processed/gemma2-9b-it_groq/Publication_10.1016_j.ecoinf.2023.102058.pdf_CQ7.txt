Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the application of machine learning algorithms, including deep learning, to hyperspectral data for water quality prediction. It doesn't delve into the specific criteria used for splitting data in deep learning model training. 

However, general practices in deep learning data splitting involve the following:

* **Training Set:** The largest portion of the data (typically 70-80%) is used to train the model, allowing it to learn patterns and relationships within the data.
* **Validation Set:** A smaller portion (around 10-15%) is used to evaluate the model's performance during training. This helps in tuning hyperparameters and preventing overfitting (where the model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data).
* **Test Set:**  A separate, unseen portion (around 10-15%) is reserved for final evaluation of the trained model's performance on data it hasn't encountered during training. This provides a realistic estimate of how well the model will generalize to new data.

The specific split ratios can be adjusted based on the size and characteristics of the dataset.
