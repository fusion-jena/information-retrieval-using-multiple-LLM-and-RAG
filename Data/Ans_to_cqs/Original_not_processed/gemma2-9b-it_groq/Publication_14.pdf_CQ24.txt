Answer:::
The provided text focuses on a specific application of deep learning for animal detection in time-lapse camera footage and doesn't delve into the broader strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. 

However, I can tell you that random elements are often incorporated in deep learning for several reasons:

* **Weight Initialization:**  Neural network weights are often initialized randomly to break symmetry and allow the network to learn diverse patterns.

* **Dropout:** As mentioned in the text, dropout randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during training. This prevents overfitting by forcing the network to learn more robust features.
* **Data Augmentation:** Random transformations (like rotations, flips, or crops) are applied to training data to increase its size and diversity, helping the model generalize better.

To control randomness, practitioners often use:

* **Random Seeds:** Setting a random seed ensures that the same random numbers are generated each time a model is trained, making results reproducible.
* **Fixed Architectures:**  Using pre-defined network architectures with specific layer configurations reduces the randomness introduced by design choices.
