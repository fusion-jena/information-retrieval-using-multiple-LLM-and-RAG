Answer:::
The provided text focuses on cross-validation techniques for evaluating machine learning models, particularly in the context of imbalanced datasets. It doesn't delve into the specific criteria used for splitting data in deep learning for training, testing, and validation. 

However, common practices in deep learning generally involve the following:

* **Training Set:** This is the largest portion of the data used to train the deep learning model. The model learns patterns and relationships within this dataset.

* **Validation Set:** A separate subset of the data used to evaluate the model's performance during training. It helps monitor how well the model generalizes to unseen data and prevents overfitting (where the model performs well on training data but poorly on new data).

* **Test Set:** Held out entirely from the training process. It's used only once at the end to provide an unbiased estimate of the final model's performance on unseen data.

The exact size of each split can vary depending on the dataset size and the specific problem. A common split is 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing.
