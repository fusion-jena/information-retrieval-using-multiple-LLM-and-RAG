Answer:::
The provided text describes EfficientNetV2, which is a type of **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. 

Several clues point to this:

* **EfficientNetV2 is described as a "lightweight convolutional neural network."**
* **The text discusses "depth-wise separable convolutions," a key component of CNNs.**
* **The MBConv block, the building block of EfficientNetV2, includes 1x1 convolutions, depthwise convolutions, and 1x1 convolutions for dimensionality expansion and reduction, all characteristic of CNN architectures.** 


While the text mentions self-attention (MHSA) being used in a modified ResNet architecture (BoTNet), it doesn't state that this is part of the EfficientNetV2 pipeline.
