Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the technical details of implementing and training a deep learning model, particularly concerning its application in automated monitoring of marine mammals and fish habitats. 

While it describes the model's architecture (Siamese network), training process (contrastive loss function), and dataset, it doesn't explicitly state the primary purpose of the model. 

However, based on the context, we can infer that the deep learning model is likely used for **image classification**.  

The text mentions:

*  "discrimination performance across the entire dataset"
*  "minimizing the distance between two similar images (of the same beluga) while maximizing the distance between dissimilar images (of different belugas)"

These points suggest the model is trained to distinguish between different belugas (or potentially other marine species) based on visual features extracted from images.
