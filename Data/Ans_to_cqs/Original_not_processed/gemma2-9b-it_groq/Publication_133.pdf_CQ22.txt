Answer: The text describes the use of **recall** and **precision** to evaluate the deep learning model's performance. 

* **Recall** is defined as the number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false negatives. It measures the model's ability to identify all the positive cases (in this case, correctly identifying the target insect species).

* **Precision** is defined as the number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false positives. It measures the accuracy of the positive predictions made by the model.

The text also mentions **average precision**, which takes into account the trade-off between precision and recall across different recall values.
