The text describes several measures taken to improve the generalizability of the deep learning model:

* **Data Augmentation:** Six data augmentation techniques were applied to the training and validation samples to increase the diversity of the dataset. 
* **Cross-Validation:** A three-fold cross-validation approach was used. The data was split into three regions (A, B, and C).  For each experiment, 70% of the data from two regions was used for training and 30% for validation, while the remaining region was used for testing. This process was repeated three times, with each region serving as the test set once.
* **Sliding Window Approach:** This technique was used to create results, likely helping to capture variations in the data at different scales. 
* **Hierarchical Classification:** The model was trained in a hierarchical manner, first classifying into broad categories (forest, grassland, savanna) and then further classifying within each category. This approach allows for more nuanced and accurate classification.



It's worth noting that the text doesn't explicitly mention stratified splitting.
