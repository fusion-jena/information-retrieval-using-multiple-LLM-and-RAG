Answer: The provided text mentions several techniques to address data bias during preprocessing, though it doesn't delve into the specifics of  "Stratified splitting," "oversampling," or "undersampling." 

Here's what the text suggests:

* **Choosing alternative data sources:** Instead of relying on sources like image databases that might be biased towards managed gardens, using social media platforms targeted at outdoor enthusiasts (e.g., hiking groups) could yield a less biased dataset.
* **Modifying search terms:**  Adjusting the keywords used to search for images can help narrow the focus and potentially reduce bias.
* **Pre-filtering images:**  Before feeding images into the deep learning pipeline, manually filtering out images that are clearly from managed gardens or other biased sources can improve the dataset's quality.
* **Diverse data collection:**  The text emphasizes the importance of considering the diversity of the training data and ensuring it aligns with the research question. This implies a conscious effort to collect images from a wide range of environments and taxonomic groups to minimize bias.
