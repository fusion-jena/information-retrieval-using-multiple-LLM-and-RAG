Answer:::

The provided text focuses on topics like object retrieval, ecological studies, and land cover classification. It doesn't delve into the specifics of deep learning or strategies for handling randomness within the deep learning pipeline. 

To answer your query about strategies for handling randomness in deep learning, here are some common techniques:

* **Setting a fixed random seed:** This ensures that the random number generator starts from the same point each time, leading to reproducible results.

* **Data augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training dataset by applying random transformations (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) to existing data. This helps the model generalize better and be less sensitive to small variations in the input.
* **Dropout:** Randomly "dropping out" (ignoring) a percentage of neurons during training. This prevents the model from relying too heavily on any single neuron and encourages the learning of more robust features.
* **Batch normalization:** Normalizing the activations of neurons within each mini-batch during training. This helps stabilize the training process and reduce the impact of random initialization.
