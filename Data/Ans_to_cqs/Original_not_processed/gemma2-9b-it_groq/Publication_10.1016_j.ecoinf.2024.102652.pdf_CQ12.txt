Answer:::
The provided text describes a model called MU-Net.  While it doesn't explicitly state the specific type of deep learning architecture (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer), it mentions that it is a "pixel-based deep learning segmentation architecture." 

This suggests that MU-Net is likely based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, as CNNs are commonly used for image segmentation tasks.
