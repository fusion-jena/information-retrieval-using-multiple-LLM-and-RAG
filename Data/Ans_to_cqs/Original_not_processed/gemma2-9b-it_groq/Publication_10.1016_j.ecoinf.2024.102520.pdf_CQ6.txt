Answer:::

The provided text focuses on image acquisition and processing for a remote sensing study, and doesn't delve into the preprocessing steps specifically for training a deep learning model. 

Therefore, I cannot answer your query based on the given context. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.
* **Normalization/Scaling:**  Transforming data features to a common scale (e.g., between 0 and 1) to improve model performance.
* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones to potentially enhance the model's ability to learn patterns.
* **Encoding Categorical Data:** Converting categorical variables into numerical representations that the model can understand.
