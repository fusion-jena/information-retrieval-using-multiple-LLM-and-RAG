Answer:::
The hyperparameters of the models are optimized using two main methods: grid search and manual tuning. 

For the two-part split models (RI and RY), a grid search is employed. This involves exhaustively searching through a predefined set of possible values for each hyperparameter. The model is trained and evaluated for every combination of these values, and the combination resulting in the highest accuracy is selected.

For the three-part split models, grid search is not used. Instead, hyperparameter tuning is done manually.  

The text also mentions the use of early stopping to prevent overfitting during the training process.
