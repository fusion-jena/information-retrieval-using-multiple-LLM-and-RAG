Answer:::

The provided text focuses on a study analyzing marine organism acoustic data and doesn't contain information about training completion criteria in machine learning. 

To answer your query about criteria for determining training completion, here are some common ones:

* **Validation Loss Plateau:**  This is a popular method. Training continues until the validation loss (performance on unseen data) stops decreasing significantly. This helps prevent overfitting, where the model performs well on training data but poorly on new data.
* **Epoch Limit:** A predetermined number of training iterations (epochs) is set. Training stops after reaching this limit, even if the loss hasn't plateaued.
* **Early Stopping:**  Similar to plateau monitoring, but more aggressive. Training stops if the validation loss doesn't improve for a specified number of epochs, even if it's still decreasing on the training data.
* **Performance Metric Threshold:** Training continues until a desired performance level is achieved on the validation set, based on a chosen metric like accuracy, F1-score, or AUC.
