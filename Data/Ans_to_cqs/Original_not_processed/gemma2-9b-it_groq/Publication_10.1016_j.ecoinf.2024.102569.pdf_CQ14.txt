Answer:::
The provided text describes the use of the root trimmed mean squared prediction error (RTMSPE) to select appropriate values for the tuning parameters τ and ϕ.  

It states: "The RTMSPE is utilized to select the appropriate values for the tuning parameters τ and ϕ, removing the impact of heterogeneous observations."

However, the text does not specify the exact optimization method used to find these values (e.g., grid search, random search).
