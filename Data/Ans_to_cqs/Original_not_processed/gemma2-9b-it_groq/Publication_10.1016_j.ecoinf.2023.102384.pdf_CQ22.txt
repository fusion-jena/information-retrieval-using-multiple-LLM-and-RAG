Answer:::
The provided text states that the evaluation of the deep learning model's performance is done using counting metrics.  Specifically, the metrics used are:

* **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**:  Calculates the average absolute difference between the predicted count and the ground truth count.
* **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**:  Calculates the average squared difference between the predicted count and the ground truth count.
* **Mean Absolute Relative Error (MARE)**:  Calculates the average absolute relative difference between the predicted count and the ground truth count. 


The text does not mention accuracy, precision, or recall as evaluation metrics.
