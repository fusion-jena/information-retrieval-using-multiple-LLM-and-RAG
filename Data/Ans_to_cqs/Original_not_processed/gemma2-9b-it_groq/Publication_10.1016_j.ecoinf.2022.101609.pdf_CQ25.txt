Answer:::
The deep learning model is designed for **regression**. 

The text states: "This study set out to develop and evaluate a baseline deep learning model to make hourly predictions of PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 concentration levels."  

Predicting concentration levels is a regression task because it involves forecasting a continuous numerical value.
