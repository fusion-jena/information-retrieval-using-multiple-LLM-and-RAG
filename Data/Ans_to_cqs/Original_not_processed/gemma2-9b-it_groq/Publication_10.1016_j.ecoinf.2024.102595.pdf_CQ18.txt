Answer:::
The provided text describes the data splitting strategy (80% training, 10% validation, 10% test) and hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV with 10-fold cross-validation. 

However, it doesn't explicitly detail the specific metrics or techniques used to monitor model performance *during* training. 

It does mention that the performance of different models was evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) values on the test set *after* training.
