Answer:::
The provided text describes the hyperparameters used for two types of models: Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). 

For **SVMs**, the hyperparameters are:

* **C:**  This parameter controls the trade-off between achieving a low training error and maximizing the margin between classes. The text mentions searching for values of C in the range of 23 to 27 for both linear and RBF SVMs.
* **Î³:** This parameter controls the influence of each training example on the decision boundary. It is specific to RBF SVMs and was searched in the range of 2^(-13) to 2^(-11).

For **CNNs**, the hyperparameters are:

* **Batch size:** This determines the number of images processed in each training iteration. The text states a batch size of 32 was used.
* **Learning rate:** This controls the step size taken during parameter updates. The initial learning rate was set to 1e-03.
* **Optimizer:** The Adam optimizer was used, which automatically adjusts the learning rate during training.
* **Loss function:** The cross-entropy loss function was used, which is common for multi-class classification tasks.
* **Epochs:** The model was trained for a maximum of 100 epochs, but early stopping was implemented to terminate training if the validation error did not decrease for 10 consecutive epochs.
