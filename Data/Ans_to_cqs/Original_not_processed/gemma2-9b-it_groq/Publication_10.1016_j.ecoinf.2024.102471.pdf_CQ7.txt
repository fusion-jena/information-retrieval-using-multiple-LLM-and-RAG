Answer:::
The provided text states that the dataset is split into training and testing sets using various ratios, including 70:30, 80:20, and 90:10.  

It also mentions that the 90:10 split resulted in the best performance.  

The text does not, however, explicitly state if a validation set is used in addition to the training and testing sets.
