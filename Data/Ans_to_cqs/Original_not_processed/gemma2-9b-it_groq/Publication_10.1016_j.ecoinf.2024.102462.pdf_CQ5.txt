Answer:::
The provided text mentions the ImageNet dataset as a relevant benchmark for image classification algorithms.  It specifically states: "Originally released as part of a worldwide competition called the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) (Krizhevsky et al., 2012), ImageNet spans 1000 object classes in more than 1.2 millions of annotated images and is considered one of the most relevant benchmarks for new algorithms."

However, the text does not explicitly state the specific dataset used in the deep learning pipeline for the study described.
