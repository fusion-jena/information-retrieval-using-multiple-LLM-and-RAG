Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the use of the SOFM algorithm for ecological source identification and doesn't contain information about preprocessing steps for deep learning models. 

To answer your query about preprocessing steps for deep learning models, here are some common ones:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values (imputation or removal), removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1 or -1 to 1) can improve model performance. Common methods include min-max scaling and z-score normalization.

* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones can sometimes enhance model accuracy. This might involve combining features, transforming them, or extracting relevant information.

* **Encoding Categorical Variables:**  Converting categorical data (e.g., colors, categories) into numerical representations that the model can understand is often necessary. Techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding are commonly used.
* **Splitting Data:** Dividing the data into training, validation, and test sets is crucial for evaluating model performance and preventing overfitting.
