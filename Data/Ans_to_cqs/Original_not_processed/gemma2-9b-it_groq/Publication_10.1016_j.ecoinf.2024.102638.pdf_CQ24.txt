Answer:::

The provided text focuses on traditional machine learning models and their hyperparameter tuning, not deep learning. Therefore, it doesn't offer information about strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline. 

However,  randomness is indeed a significant factor in deep learning. Common strategies to manage it include:

* **Setting a random seed:** This initializes the random number generator, ensuring reproducibility of results.

* **Data shuffling:** Randomly shuffling the training data before each epoch prevents the model from learning patterns based on the data order.
* **Dropout:** Randomly "dropping out" (ignoring) a percentage of neurons during training helps prevent overfitting and encourages the network to learn more robust features.
* **Batch normalization:** Normalizes the activations within each layer, reducing internal covariate shift and stabilizing training.

These techniques help mitigate the impact of randomness and promote more reliable and generalizable deep learning models.
