Answer:::
Based on the provided text, here are the preprocessing steps mentioned before training a deep learning model:

1. **Normalization of signal amplitude:** This step aims to address variations in signal strength captured by different microphones.  

The text highlights that microphone characteristics and usage can lead to significant differences in gain (signal amplitude). Normalization helps to standardize the amplitude of the audio signals, ensuring that variations in microphone performance don't disproportionately influence the model's training.


It's important to note that the provided text focuses specifically on audio signal processing and doesn't cover a comprehensive list of preprocessing steps applicable to all types of data used in deep learning.
