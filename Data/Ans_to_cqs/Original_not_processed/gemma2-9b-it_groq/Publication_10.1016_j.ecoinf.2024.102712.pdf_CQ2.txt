Answer: 

Based on the provided context, I cannot determine the specific data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. 

The text focuses on remote sensing data, specifically mentioning:

*  WGS 84 map data
*  Sentinel-2 data
*  UAV data
*  Remote sensing images

It also discusses processing techniques and modeling approaches related to these data types. However, it doesn't explicitly state the formats used in a deep learning pipeline.
