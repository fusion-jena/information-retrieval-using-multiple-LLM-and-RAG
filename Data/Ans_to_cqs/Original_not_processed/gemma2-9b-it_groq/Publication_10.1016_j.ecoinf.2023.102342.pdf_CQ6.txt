Answer:::

The provided text focuses on data mining techniques and the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process. It doesn't delve into the specifics of preprocessing steps for deep learning models. 

However, based on general knowledge of deep learning, here are some common preprocessing steps:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., between 0 and 1) can improve model performance.

* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones can enhance the model's ability to learn patterns.

* **Encoding Categorical Variables:** Converting categorical data into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding) is necessary for most deep learning algorithms.

* **Splitting Data:** Dividing the data into training, validation, and test sets is crucial for evaluating the model's performance. 


Keep in mind that the specific preprocessing steps will vary depending on the nature of the data and the deep learning model being used.
