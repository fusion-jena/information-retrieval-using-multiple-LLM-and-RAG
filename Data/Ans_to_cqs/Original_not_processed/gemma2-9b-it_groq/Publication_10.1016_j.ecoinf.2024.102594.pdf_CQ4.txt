The provided text describes the following data augmentation techniques used during the training of the DeepLabV3+ model:

* **Flipping:** Images and labels are flipped horizontally (along the X-axis) or vertically (along the Y-axis).
* **Channel Exchange:** The order of image channels is randomly swapped while the labels remain unchanged.
* **Rotation:** Images and labels are randomly rotated by 90 degrees.
* **Noise Addition:** Random noise is added to the images while keeping the labels unchanged.
