Answer:::
The provided text doesn't explicitly describe the strategy used to monitor model performance during training. 

It does mention that the authors:

*  Used different percentages of the initial observations from the time series for training the model.
*  Evaluated the performance of the model using accuracy, false positive rate, and true positive rate.
*  Compared the performance of the proposed method (PBP) with other machine learning methods like Support Vector Machines, Deep Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Memory, and Random Forests.

However, it doesn't detail how the performance was tracked *during* the training process itself (e.g., using validation sets, learning curves, etc.).
