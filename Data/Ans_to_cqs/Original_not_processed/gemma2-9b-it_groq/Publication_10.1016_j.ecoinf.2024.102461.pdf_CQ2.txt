Answer:::
The provided text focuses on using Landsat 8 satellite images and vegetation indices for fire risk assessment. It mentions the use of  "artificial neural networks" and "deep learning" techniques but doesn't specify the exact data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. 

Based on the context, it's likely that the deep learning models process **image data** from Landsat 8 satellite imagery.
