Answer:::
The provided text describes the use of images and their corresponding labels for training a deep learning model to identify sub-alpine shrub species.  It mentions "fieldwork expeditions" to confirm species identification and validate annotations on orthomosaics (likely aerial imagery). 

Therefore, we can infer that **image collection through fieldwork expeditions and potentially orthomosaics** are methods used for data acquisition in this specific deep learning pipeline. 


The text doesn't explicitly mention other data collection methods like surveys or sensors.
