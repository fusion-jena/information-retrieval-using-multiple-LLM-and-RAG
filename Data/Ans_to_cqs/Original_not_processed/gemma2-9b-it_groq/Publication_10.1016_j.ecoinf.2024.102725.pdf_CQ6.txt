Answer:::

While the provided text focuses on NDVI reconstruction techniques, it doesn't delve into the specific preprocessing steps for training deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1) can improve model performance. Common methods include min-max scaling and z-score normalization.

* **Feature Engineering:**  Creating new features from existing ones can enhance the model's ability to learn patterns. This might involve combining features, transforming them (e.g., taking logarithms), or encoding categorical variables.

* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training data by applying transformations like rotations, flips, or crops can improve generalization.

The specific preprocessing steps will depend on the nature of the data and the deep learning model being used.
