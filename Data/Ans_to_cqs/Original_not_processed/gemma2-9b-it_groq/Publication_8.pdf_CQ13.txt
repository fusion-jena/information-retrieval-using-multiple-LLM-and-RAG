Answer:::
The deep learning model used a Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0025 and momentum of 0.9.  The anchor generator in the Region Proposal Network had six anchor scales ([32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024]) each with three aspect ratios ([1:2, 1:1, 2:1]).  The thresholds for non-maximum suppression (NMS) were 0.6 for training and 0.25 for testing.
