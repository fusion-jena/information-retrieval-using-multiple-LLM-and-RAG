Answer:::
The provided text describes a dataset containing clusters of extracted numbers, images of single trees, and point clouds. It also mentions the use of a modified MNIST dataset for training some models. 

However, the text does not explicitly detail the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.  Therefore, I cannot answer your query about the annotation techniques used (e.g., bounding box annotation, instance segmentation) based on the given context.
