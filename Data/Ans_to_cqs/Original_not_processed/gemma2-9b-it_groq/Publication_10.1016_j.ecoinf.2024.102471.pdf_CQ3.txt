Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the architecture of deep learning models (like CNN-LSTM and wav2vec) and their application in bird species classification. It doesn't delve into specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. 

Therefore, I cannot answer your query about data annotation techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation based on the given context.
