Answer:::
The deep learning model described in the text is used for **regression**. 

Specifically, it aims to predict plant functional traits from simple RGB photographs.  The text states that the "regressor following the basic CNN consisted of a global average pooling layer followed by two dense layers with 512 and 1 output units. The latter forces the CNN to output exactly one prediction (trait) value." 

This indicates that the model takes an image as input and outputs a single numerical value representing a specific plant trait.
