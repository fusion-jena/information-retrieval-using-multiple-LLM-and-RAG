Answer:::

The provided text focuses on a framework for equitable nutrient reduction and doesn't contain information about preprocessing steps for deep learning models.  

To answer your query about preprocessing steps for deep learning models, here are some common ones:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., between 0 and 1) can improve model performance.

* **Standardization:**  Centering data by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. This is often used for algorithms sensitive to feature scales.

* **Encoding Categorical Features:** Converting categorical variables (e.g., text labels) into numerical representations that models can understand.

* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones to potentially improve model accuracy.

* **Splitting Data:** Dividing the dataset into training, validation, and test sets to train the model, tune hyperparameters, and evaluate performance.
