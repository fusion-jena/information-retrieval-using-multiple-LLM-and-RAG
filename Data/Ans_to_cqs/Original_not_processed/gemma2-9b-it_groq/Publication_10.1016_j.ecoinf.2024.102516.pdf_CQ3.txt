Answer:::
The provided text describes a deep learning pipeline for plant cover prediction but doesn't specify the exact data annotation techniques used. 

It mentions "plant cover information" being extracted without training on "actual annotated plant cover data." This suggests the pipeline might utilize techniques like:

* **Semantic Segmentation:**  Assigning a class label to each pixel in an image, identifying the plant cover as a whole.

However, the text doesn't confirm this.  It focuses on the network architecture and training process rather than the data preparation steps.
