Answer:::
The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a grid search approach.  

The authors define a range of potential values for each hyperparameter based on prior knowledge and literature review. The grid search then exhaustively tests all possible combinations of these values and evaluates the model's performance using cross-validation techniques.  The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is used as the evaluation metric, with the goal of minimizing RMSE to achieve the most accurate predictions.
