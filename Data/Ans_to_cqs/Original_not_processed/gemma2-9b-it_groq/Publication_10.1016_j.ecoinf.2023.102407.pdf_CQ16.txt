Answer:::
The provided text states that the SDP-EPL model was trained for up to 400 epochs.  It also mentions that the value of K was selected empirically based on the AUC of SDP-EPL on the validation set.  

The text says that when K=200, the AUC gradually improved as the number of training epochs increased, achieving the highest score overall. 

Therefore, it appears that training was considered complete when the AUC on the validation set reached its highest point.
