The provided text focuses on the training and validation process of a model, particularly highlighting techniques like multistage training and data swapping to improve performance and reduce overfitting. 

It doesn't, however, describe any post-processing steps like:

* **Saliency maps:**  Visualizing which parts of the input image are most influential in the model's decision.
* **Metrics calculation:**  Quantifying the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.
* **Confusion matrix:**  A table showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, providing a detailed view of the model's classification performance. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what post-processing steps are involved.
