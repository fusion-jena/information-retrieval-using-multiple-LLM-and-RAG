Answer:::

The provided text focuses on a framework called HypeAIR for calibrating low-cost air quality (LCAQ) sensors.  While it mentions the use of LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) deep learning for calibration, it doesn't specify the methods used for *collecting* the raw data that feeds into this pipeline. 

The text does state that the LSTM algorithm uses "a temporal sequence of observations" from LCAQ sensors, including measurements of pollutants, air temperature, and humidity. This implies that sensors are the primary data source.
