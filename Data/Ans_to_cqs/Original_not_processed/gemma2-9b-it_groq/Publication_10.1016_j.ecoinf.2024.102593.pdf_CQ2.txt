Answer:::
The provided text describes a deep learning pipeline that uses audio data. 

Specifically, it mentions:

* **Sound frames:** These are extracted from audio files and used as input to the models.
* **Mel spectrograms:** These are representations of the sound frames, created using a fast Fourier transform.


Therefore, the primary data format used in this pipeline is **audio**.
