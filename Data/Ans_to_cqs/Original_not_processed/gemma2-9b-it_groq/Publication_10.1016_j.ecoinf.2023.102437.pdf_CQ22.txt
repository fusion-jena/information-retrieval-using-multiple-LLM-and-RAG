Answer:::
The provided text mentions the following metrics for evaluating the performance of the deep learning models:

* **R-squared (R2):**  This metric indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables. A higher R2 value suggests a better fit of the model to the data.

* **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** This metric measures the average magnitude of the errors between the predicted and actual values. A lower RMSE value indicates better predictive accuracy. 


The text does not explicitly mention other common metrics like accuracy, precision, or recall.
