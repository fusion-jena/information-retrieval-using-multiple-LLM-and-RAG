Answer:::
The text describes two post-processing decision rules applied to the raw output of the model:

* **Decision rule r1:** If the model's first proposition is "environment" with a confidence score below 99%, the final output is set to "fish" with the highest probability. This rule addresses the issue of the model potentially classifying fish as "environment" with high confidence.

* **Decision rule r2:** If the model's result is "part of species X", the final output is set to "species X". This rule accounts for the fact that "part of species" classes were used in the training dataset (T4) but not in the test dataset. 

The text states that applying decision rule r2 increased the success rate to 94.1%.  It also mentions that decision rule r1 reduced the error rate of misclassifying fish as "environment" to less than 4%. 


The provided text does not mention other post-processing steps like saliency maps or metrics calculation.
