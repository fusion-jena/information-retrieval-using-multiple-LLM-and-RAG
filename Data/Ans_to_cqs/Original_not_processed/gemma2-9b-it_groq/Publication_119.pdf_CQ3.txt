Answer:::
The provided text describes the use of a U-Net model for image segmentation but doesn't specify the exact data annotation techniques used to prepare the training data.  

While it mentions that the U-Net model is used for "the labeling of each pixel in the training data," it doesn't elaborate on the method used for this labeling. 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot determine the specific data annotation techniques employed.
