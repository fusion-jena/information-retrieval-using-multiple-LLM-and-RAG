Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning for detecting artisanal small-scale mining (ASGM) and doesn't delve into the specific methods used for collecting the raw data in the deep learning pipeline. 

However, it does mention the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE), a cloud-based platform with a public catalog of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets. This suggests that satellite imagery is likely a primary source of raw data for this deep learning application.
