Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning for plant classification and the creation of a Peruvian Amazon Forestry Dataset. It doesn't delve into specific strategies for handling randomness within the deep learning pipeline. 

However, it's common practice in deep learning to address randomness through techniques like:

* **Setting a fixed random seed:** This ensures that the random initialization of weights and the shuffling of data during training are reproducible. By setting a specific seed value, you can obtain consistent results across multiple runs.

* **Data augmentation:** This involves applying random transformations to the training data (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) to increase its size and diversity, mitigating the impact of randomness in the initial dataset.

* **Dropout:** This regularization technique randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during each training step. This prevents overfitting and introduces some randomness into the model's learning process.

* **Batch normalization:** This technique normalizes the activations of neurons within each mini-batch, reducing the internal covariate shift and stabilizing training.


Keep in mind that these are general strategies, and the specific techniques used may vary depending on the deep learning model and the task at hand.
