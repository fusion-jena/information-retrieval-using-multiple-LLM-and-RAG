Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the TPEBO algorithm for hyperparameter optimization in LSTM models and doesn't explicitly mention specific optimization techniques used during the training process (like SGD or Adam). 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what optimization techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline.
