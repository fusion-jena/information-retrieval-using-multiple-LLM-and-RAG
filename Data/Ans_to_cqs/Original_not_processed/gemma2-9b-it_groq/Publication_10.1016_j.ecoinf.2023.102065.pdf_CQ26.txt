Answer:::

The provided text focuses on data augmentation techniques used to increase the size of a training dataset, not on addressing data bias during preprocessing.  

While data augmentation can help improve model robustness, it doesn't directly tackle issues of bias in the original data. 

Techniques to address data bias during preprocessing include:

* **Stratified splitting:**  Dividing the dataset into training, validation, and test sets while preserving the proportions of different classes or subgroups present in the original data. This helps ensure that the model is trained on a representative sample of the data and doesn't become biased towards a particular class.
* **Oversampling:**  Increasing the number of samples in underrepresented classes by duplicating existing samples or using synthetic data generation techniques.
* **Undersampling:**  Reducing the number of samples in overrepresented classes to balance the dataset.
* **Diverse data collection:**  Actively seeking out and including data from a wide range of sources and representing different demographics, viewpoints, and perspectives. This helps mitigate bias that may arise from a limited or unrepresentative dataset.
