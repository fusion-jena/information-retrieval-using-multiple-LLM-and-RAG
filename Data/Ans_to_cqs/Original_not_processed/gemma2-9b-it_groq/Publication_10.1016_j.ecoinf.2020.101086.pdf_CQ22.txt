Answer:::
The provided text focuses on evaluating the performance of species distribution modeling methods and bias correction techniques, not deep learning models.  It mentions metrics like AUC, Denv, and Dgeo, but these are specific to species distribution modeling and not standard deep learning evaluation metrics. 


Therefore, I cannot answer your query about deep learning model performance metrics based on the given context.
