Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the training and evaluation of a deep learning model for tree detection in airborne imagery, rather than the methods used for collecting the raw data. 

It mentions the use of:

* **LiDAR data:**  A LiDAR-based unsupervised algorithm is used to generate pretraining data by predicting tree locations.
* **RGB imagery:**  This imagery is used for both pretraining and retraining the deep learning model.

The text doesn't specify the source of these datasets (e.g., surveys, sensors, public datasets).
