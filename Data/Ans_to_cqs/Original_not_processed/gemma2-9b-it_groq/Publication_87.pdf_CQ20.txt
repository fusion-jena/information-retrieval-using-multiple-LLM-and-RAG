Answer: The text states that training with a resnet50 on a full dataset took approximately 75 minutes per epoch on a Mac with a 2.4Ghz processor and 64GB of memory.  It also mentions that training on the same machine with a reduced dataset took a bit more than a minute per epoch.  

The text further says that training with a resnet50 on the full dataset took less than half an hour on a machine with a GPU. 


Therefore, the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model include:

* **CPU:**  A 2.4Ghz processor was used for training on a Mac.
* **GPU:** A GPU was used to speed up training on the full dataset.
