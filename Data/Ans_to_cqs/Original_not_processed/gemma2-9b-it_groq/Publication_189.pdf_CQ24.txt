The provided text focuses on the implementation details of a Mask R-CNN model and doesn't discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.  

To answer your query about strategies for handling randomness, here are some common techniques:

* **Setting a Random Seed:**  This is crucial for reproducibility. By initializing the random number generator with a specific seed, you ensure that the same "random" values are generated each time you run your code. This makes your experiments repeatable.

* **Data Augmentation:** While not directly addressing randomness in the model itself, data augmentation introduces controlled variations to your training data (e.g., rotations, flips, crops). This helps the model generalize better and reduces the impact of random fluctuations in the training data.

* **Dropout:** This regularization technique randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during each training step. This prevents the model from relying too heavily on any single neuron and encourages the learning of more robust features.

* **Batch Normalization:** This technique normalizes the activations of each layer, helping to stabilize training and reduce the sensitivity to initial weight values.
