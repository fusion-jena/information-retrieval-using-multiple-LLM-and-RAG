Answer:::
The provided text does not specify the exact data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipelines described.  

While the papers discuss various aspects of deep learning for tasks like wetland classification, mangrove crown diameter measurement, and tree canopy segmentation, they don't delve into the specific data augmentation methods employed. 

Common data augmentation techniques in computer vision include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, and color adjustments. However, without explicit information from the cited papers, we cannot confirm which techniques were applied.
