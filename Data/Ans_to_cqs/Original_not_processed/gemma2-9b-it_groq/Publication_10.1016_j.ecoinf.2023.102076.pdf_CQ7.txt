Answer:::

The provided text describes how data is split for training a BERT model, but it doesn't explicitly state the criteria used to create the train, test, and validation sets. 

We know the following:

* **Initial Split:** The text mentions that "the best performing classifier was used to classify the whole dataset" and then "the relevant texts from these predictions were then used as data from which training, development and testing sets were selected for the next classification task." This suggests an initial classification step followed by a selection process for training, development, and testing sets.

* **Stratified Sampling:** For classification tasks 2 and 3, the authors experimented with both random and balanced stratified sampling.  Balanced stratified sampling involved grouping texts by their initial exploitation-related query term and randomly selecting 110 texts from each group to ensure equal representation of all topics.

However, the exact proportions allocated to train, validation, and test sets, and the specific method used to select these sets after the initial classification, are not detailed in the provided text.
