Answer:::

The provided text focuses on various machine learning algorithms and their hyperparameter tuning, particularly in the context of ecological informatics and biomass estimation. It doesn't delve into the specifics of deep learning or strategies for handling randomness within its pipeline. 

However, I can offer some general information about randomness handling in deep learning:

Deep learning models often incorporate randomness in several stages:

* **Initialization:** Weights and biases are typically initialized randomly. This helps break symmetry and allows different parts of the network to learn diverse features.

* **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):** This popular optimization algorithm uses random mini-batches of data to update model parameters. This introduces noise and prevents the model from getting stuck in local minima.
* **Dropout:** A regularization technique that randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during training. This prevents overfitting and encourages the network to learn more robust features.

To mitigate the impact of randomness and ensure reproducibility, practitioners often use:

* **Random Seed Setting:**  Specifying a fixed random seed value ensures that the same random numbers are generated each time the code is run, leading to consistent results.
* **Data Splitting:** Dividing the data into training, validation, and test sets in a reproducible manner helps ensure fair evaluation and prevents biases introduced by random data shuffling.
