Answer:::
The provided text states that the deep learning method used "a version of the YOLO DCNN using pretrained weights from the COCO dataset".  It also mentions that the initial output of the YOLO DCNN was filtered by discarding any object detections that did not correspond to an identification from the Zooniverse data. 

Based on this information, we can infer that the data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline is likely **bounding box annotation**. 

Here's why:

* **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** is a popular object detection algorithm that typically uses bounding boxes to define the location of objects within an image.
* The mention of filtering detections that don't correspond to Zooniverse identifications suggests that the Zooniverse data likely contained bounding box annotations for the wildebeest in the images. 


Instance segmentation, which involves outlining each individual instance of an object, is not explicitly mentioned in the text.
