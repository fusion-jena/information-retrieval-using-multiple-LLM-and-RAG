Answer:::
The provided text mentions the following metrics for evaluating the deep learning model's performance:

* **Mean AUC (Area Under the Curve):** This metric is used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. It is the average of the AUC scores obtained for each class.
* **AUPRG (Area Under the Precision-Recall Gain Curve):** This metric is also used for evaluating classification models, particularly when dealing with imbalanced datasets. It focuses on the trade-off between precision and recall. 


The text does not explicitly mention other common metrics like accuracy, precision, or recall.
