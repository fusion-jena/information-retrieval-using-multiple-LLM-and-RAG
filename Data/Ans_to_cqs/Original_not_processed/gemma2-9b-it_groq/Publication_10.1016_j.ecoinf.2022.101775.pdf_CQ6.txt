Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the implementation of deep learning models for matrix factorization in the context of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). It doesn't delve into the specific preprocessing steps involved in training deep learning models in general. 

However, based on common practices in deep learning, here are some preprocessing steps often used:

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1) can improve model performance.
* **Scaling:** Similar to normalization, scaling adjusts the range of features to prevent features with larger magnitudes from dominating the learning process. Min-max scaling is mentioned in the text as being used.
* **Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing outliers, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

It's important to note that the specific preprocessing steps depend on the nature of the data and the chosen deep learning model.
