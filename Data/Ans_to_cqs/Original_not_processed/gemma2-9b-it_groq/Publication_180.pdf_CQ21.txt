Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the training process of a deep learning model using TensorFlow for automated species identification of Triatominae bugs, which are vectors for Chagas disease.  

It details the optimization of training parameters like the number of training steps and validation percentage. However, it doesn't describe any post-processing steps involved after the model training. 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what post-processing steps are used.
