The text provides three metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model:

* **TP (True Positive):** The number of birds correctly identified as endemic birds.
* **TN (True Negative):** The number of birds correctly identified as non-endemic birds.
* **FP (False Positive):** The number of birds incorrectly identified as endemic birds.
* **FN (False Negative):** The number of ground truth endemic birds that the model failed to detect.
