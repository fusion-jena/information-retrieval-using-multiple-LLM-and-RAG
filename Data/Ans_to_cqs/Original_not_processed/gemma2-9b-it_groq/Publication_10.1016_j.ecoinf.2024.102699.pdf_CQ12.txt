Answer:::
The provided text mentions the use of several deep learning models:

* **DenseNet-161:**  A type of convolutional neural network (CNN).
* **ResNet-50:** Another type of convolutional neural network (CNN).
* **Vision Transformers (ViT):**  A transformer-based model, inspired by the architecture used in natural language processing. 

Specifically, the text discusses ViT variants like ViT-S/16, ViT-B/16, and ViT-L/16.
