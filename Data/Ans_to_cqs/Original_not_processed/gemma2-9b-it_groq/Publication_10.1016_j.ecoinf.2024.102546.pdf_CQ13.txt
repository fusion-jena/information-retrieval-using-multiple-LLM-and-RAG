Answer:::
The provided text lists the primary hyperparameter settings for three detection models: YOLOX, YOLOv8, and I3Net. 

Here's a breakdown:

* **Initial Learning Rate:** 
    * YOLOX and YOLOv8: 0.01
    * I3Net: 0.001 (initially) then reinitialized to 0.01

* **Learning Rate Schedule:** Warm up + cosine decay for both YOLOX and YOLOv8.

* **NMS Threshold:** 0.45 for YOLOX and 0.7 for YOLOv8.

* **Confidence Threshold:** 0.25 for both YOLOX and YOLOv8.

* **Weight Decay:** 0.0005 for both YOLOX and YOLOv8.

* **Image Size:** 800 for both YOLOX and YOLOv8.

* **Batch Size:** 8 for both YOLOX and YOLOv8.

* **Optimizer:** SGD for both YOLOX and YOLOv8.

The text also mentions data augmentation techniques used, but doesn't specify hyperparameters for them.
