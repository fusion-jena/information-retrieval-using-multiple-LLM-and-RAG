Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the model training process and doesn't explicitly detail the post-processing steps after training.  

While it mentions a "confusion matrix" (Fig. 7(b)) which is a common post-processing tool for evaluating classification models, it doesn't list other potential steps like:

* **Saliency map generation:**  Visualizing which parts of the input image the model focuses on for making predictions.
* **Metric calculation:**  Quantifying the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc. 
* **Threshold tuning:**  Finding the optimal threshold for classifying predictions (e.g., converting probabilities to binary classes).
* **Visualization of predictions:**  Displaying the model's output alongside the input images for analysis.



Therefore, based on the given context, we can only confirm the use of a confusion matrix for evaluation.
