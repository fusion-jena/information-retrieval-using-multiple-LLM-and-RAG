Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the architecture and training process of a specific deep learning model for image restoration. It doesn't describe the preprocessing steps involved before training. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Normalization:** Scaling pixel values to a specific range (e.g., 0 to 1) to improve training stability and speed.
* **Scaling:**  Adjusting the range of feature values to prevent issues with vanishing or exploding gradients.
* **Cleaning:** Removing noise, outliers, or irrelevant information from the data. This can involve techniques like removing duplicates, handling missing values, or applying filters to reduce noise. 


Keep in mind that the specific preprocessing steps depend on the dataset and the model being trained.
