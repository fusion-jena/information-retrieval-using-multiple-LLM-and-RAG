Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor model performance during training involves using a three-set data split:

* **Training set (82%):** Used to train the model and adjust its parameters.
* **Validation set (13%):** Utilized to fine-tune hyperparameters and assess the model's performance on unseen data during training, preventing overfitting.
* **Testing set (5%):** Serves as an independent evaluation of the model's performance on completely unseen data, providing a reliable measure of its real-world effectiveness and generalization ability. 


This approach allows for continuous monitoring and evaluation of the model's progress throughout the training process.
