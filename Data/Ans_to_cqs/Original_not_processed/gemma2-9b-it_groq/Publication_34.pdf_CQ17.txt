The provided text mentions Batch Normalization as a technique that has a regularization effect.  

Here's why:

* **Batch Normalization's Impact:** It centers and scales the activations of neurons within each mini-batch. This process is linked to the mini-batch statistics, which are stochastic (random) due to the random selection of samples in each mini-batch. 

* **Stochasticity and Regularization:** Because the neuron activations become stochastic, the model is less likely to rely too heavily on any single activation. If an activation doesn't contribute positively to the prediction, its influence is reduced. This inherent randomness acts as a form of regularization, preventing the model from overfitting to the training data.


The text does *not* explicitly discuss other regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization.
