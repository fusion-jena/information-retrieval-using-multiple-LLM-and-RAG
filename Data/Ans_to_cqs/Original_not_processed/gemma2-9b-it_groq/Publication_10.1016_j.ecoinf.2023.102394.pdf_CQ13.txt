Answer:::
The provided text states that the parameter selection for the MLP model was done by minimizing the mean squared error.  It also lists the parameter settings of the MLP model in Table 2, but Table 2 is not included in the provided context. 

Therefore, based on the information given, I cannot answer what hyperparameters were used in the deep learning model.
