Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the application of EfficientNet for object detection and mentions the use of random erasing as a data augmentation technique.  

However, it doesn't explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline beyond data augmentation. 

While the text states that the EfficientNet was trained using the Adagrad optimizer for 100 epochs with a dropout rate of 0.5, it doesn't mention specific techniques for ensuring reproducibility, such as setting a random seed value.
