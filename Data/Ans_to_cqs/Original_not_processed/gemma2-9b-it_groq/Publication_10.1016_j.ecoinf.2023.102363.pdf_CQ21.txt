Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the model fine-tuning process and doesn't describe any post-processing steps performed after training.  It mentions the use of Grad-CAM for visualizing model predictions but doesn't state if it's used as a post-processing step. 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what specific post-processing steps are involved after model training.
