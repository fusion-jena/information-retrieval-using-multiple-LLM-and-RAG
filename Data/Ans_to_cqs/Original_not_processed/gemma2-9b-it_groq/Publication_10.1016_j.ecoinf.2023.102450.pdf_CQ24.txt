Answer:::

The provided context focuses on applications of deep learning in wildlife research and doesn't delve into the specifics of handling randomness within the deep learning pipeline. 

However, I can offer some general strategies commonly used to address randomness in deep learning:

* **Setting a Fixed Random Seed:**  Deep learning algorithms often rely on random initialization of weights and random shuffling of data during training. Setting a fixed random seed ensures that these random processes are reproducible. This means that if you run the same code with the same seed, you'll get the same results.

* **Data Augmentation:**  This technique introduces controlled variations into the training data (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) to increase its size and diversity. This helps the model generalize better and reduces the impact of randomness in the data itself.

* **Dropout:**  During training, dropout randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons in each layer. This prevents the model from relying too heavily on any single neuron and encourages the learning of more robust features.

* **Batch Normalization:** This technique normalizes the activations of neurons within each layer, reducing the internal covariate shift and stabilizing training.

Keep in mind that some level of randomness is inherent in deep learning, and it can contribute to the model's ability to explore different solutions. The goal is to manage randomness effectively to ensure reproducibility and reliable performance.
