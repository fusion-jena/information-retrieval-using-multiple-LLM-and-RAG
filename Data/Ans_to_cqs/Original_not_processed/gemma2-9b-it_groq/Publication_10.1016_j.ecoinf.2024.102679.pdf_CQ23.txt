Answer:::

The provided text describes the fine-tuning process of a pre-trained deep learning model for wildlife population estimation from aerial imagery.  

It mentions using the entire SW stratum for fine-tuning and creating hard negative patches from false positives identified in the thumbnail classification step. However, it doesn't explicitly state the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model, such as:

* **Diverse dataset:**  While it mentions using the entire SW stratum, it doesn't specify if this stratum represents diverse wildlife populations and environmental conditions.
* **Cross-validation:** The text doesn't describe any cross-validation techniques used during training.
* **Stratified splitting:**  There's no mention of stratified splitting of the dataset for training and validation. 


Therefore, based on the provided information, we cannot definitively say what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
