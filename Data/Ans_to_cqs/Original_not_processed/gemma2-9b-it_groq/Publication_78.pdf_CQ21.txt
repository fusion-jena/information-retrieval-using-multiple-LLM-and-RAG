The provided text describes the framework for classifying bleached and unbleached corals using image processing and machine learning.  It details steps like image segmentation, feature extraction, and classifier training (SVM in this case). 

However, it doesn't explicitly list post-processing steps like saliency maps, metric calculation, or confusion matrix construction *after* the model training is complete. 


While the text mentions the confusion matrix as a tool for validating model performance, it doesn't describe how it's generated after training.
