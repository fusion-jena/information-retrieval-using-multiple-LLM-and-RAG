Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning in water quality management and doesn't specify the exact methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. 

However, it does mention:

* **Conventional on-site sampling:** This suggests that traditional water sampling techniques are likely involved.
* **Acoustic sensors:** These sensors could be used to measure various water quality parameters.

It's also possible that other data sources, such as:

* **Remote sensing:** Satellite or aerial imagery could provide information about water coverage and other relevant factors.
* **Public datasets:** Existing water quality databases might be utilized.


Without further information from the source material, it's impossible to definitively list all the data collection methods employed.
