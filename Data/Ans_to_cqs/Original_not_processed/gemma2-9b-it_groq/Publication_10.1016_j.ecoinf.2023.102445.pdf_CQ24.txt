Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the architecture and functionality of a specific deep learning model for pest detection. It doesn't delve into strategies for handling randomness within the deep learning pipeline. 

However, common strategies to address randomness in deep learning include:

* **Setting a fixed random seed:** This ensures that the random initialization of weights and the shuffling of data during training are reproducible. 

* **Using techniques like dropout:** Dropout randomly "drops out" neurons during training, preventing overfitting and introducing some stochasticity.
* **Batch normalization:** This technique normalizes the activations within each layer, reducing the impact of internal covariate shift and improving training stability.
