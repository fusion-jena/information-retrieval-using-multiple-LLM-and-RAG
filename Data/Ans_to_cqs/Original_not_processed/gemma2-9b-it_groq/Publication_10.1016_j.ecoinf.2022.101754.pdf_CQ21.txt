Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the model training process and doesn't describe any post-processing steps like saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. 


It details the use of different regression models (AdaBoost, Random Forest, Neural Network, Bayesian Ridge Regression) and the training-validation split approach with 100 different splits for hyperparameter tuning.  

The text also mentions the calculation of  R2, RMSE, and accuracy metrics but doesn't elaborate on how these are calculated or used in a post-processing context.
