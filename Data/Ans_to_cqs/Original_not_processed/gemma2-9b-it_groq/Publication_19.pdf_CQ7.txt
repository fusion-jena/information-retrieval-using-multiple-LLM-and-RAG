Answer:::
The data was split into three sets: training, validation, and testing, using a 60-20-20 ratio. 

* **Training set:** 60% of the data was used to train the deep learning models.
* **Validation set:** 20% of the data was used to validate the models during training and to tune hyperparameters.
* **Testing set:** 20% of the data was held out and used only to evaluate the final performance of the trained models.
