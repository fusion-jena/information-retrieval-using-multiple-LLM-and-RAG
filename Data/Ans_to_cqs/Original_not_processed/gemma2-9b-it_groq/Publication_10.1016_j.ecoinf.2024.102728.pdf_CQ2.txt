Answer:::
Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline primarily uses image data. 

The references mention:

* **Deep convolutional networks** for object retrieval (Mohedano et al., 2017).
* **Deep learning for feature extraction in remote sensing** using aerial scenes (Petrovska et al., 2020).
* **Orthophoto** data with 12.5 cm resolution from the Survey of Israel (S.O.I, 2018). 


While the context doesn't explicitly mention other data formats like audio or video, it's possible they are used given the general nature of deep learning applications.
