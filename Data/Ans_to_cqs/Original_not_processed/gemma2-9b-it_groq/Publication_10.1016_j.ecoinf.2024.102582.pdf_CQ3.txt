Answer:::
The provided text does not specify the exact data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. 

While it mentions the creation of training samples and the use of a random forest algorithm for classification, it doesn't detail how these samples were annotated.  Techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation could have been employed, but the text doesn't confirm this.
