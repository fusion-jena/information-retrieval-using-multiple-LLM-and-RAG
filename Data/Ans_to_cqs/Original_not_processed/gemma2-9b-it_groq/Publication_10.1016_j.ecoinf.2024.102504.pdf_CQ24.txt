Answer:::

The provided text focuses on air quality studies and doesn't delve into the specifics of handling randomness in deep learning pipelines. 

However, I can tell you that randomness is inherent in many aspects of deep learning, including:

* **Initialization of weights:** Neural network weights are often initialized randomly.

* **Activation functions:** Some activation functions, like dropout, introduce randomness during training.
* **Data shuffling:** Training data is often shuffled randomly before each epoch to prevent the model from learning patterns based on the data order.

To mitigate the impact of randomness and ensure reproducibility, practitioners commonly use techniques like:

* **Setting a random seed:** This initializes random number generators, making the results reproducible.

* **Using deterministic operations:**  Wherever possible, using deterministic operations (e.g., fixed-point arithmetic) can reduce randomness.
* **Ensemble methods:** Training multiple models with different random initializations and averaging their predictions can reduce the impact of individual model variations.
