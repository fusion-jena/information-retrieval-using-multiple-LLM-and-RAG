Answer:::
The provided text states that for manual annotation, experienced analysts "delineate and assign each fish to a class".  

This indicates that the data annotation technique used is **instance segmentation**. 

Instance segmentation involves drawing a bounding box around each individual instance of an object (in this case, each fish) and then segmenting the object into a pixel-level mask. This allows the model to learn the precise shape and boundaries of each fish.
