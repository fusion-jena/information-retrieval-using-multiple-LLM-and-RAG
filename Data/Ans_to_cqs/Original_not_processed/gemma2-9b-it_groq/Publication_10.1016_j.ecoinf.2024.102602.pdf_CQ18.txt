Answer:::
The text describes the use of 5-fold cross-validation for model performance evaluation. During each iteration of this process, one subset of the data is used for evaluation, while the remaining four subsets are used for training and validation. 

Furthermore, an early stopping approach is implemented to regulate the training process. This technique monitors the model's performance on a validation dataset and halts training if performance improvement stalls beyond a predefined threshold. This prevents overfitting and conserves computational resources.
