Answer:::
The provided text does not contain information about a deep learning model or the measures taken to ensure its generalizability.  It focuses on the Random Forest (RF) classification approach and mentions other machine learning algorithms like k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) but doesn't delve into their specific implementation details or generalizability strategies.
