Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is **classification**. 

The text states: "The deep learning revolution has brought significant advances in a number of fields [1], primarily linked to image and speech recognition. The standardization of image classification tasks like the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge [2] has resulted in a reliable way to compare top performing architectures." 

It further mentions that the model is based on a ResNet architecture that won the ILSVRC'15, which is an image classification competition.
