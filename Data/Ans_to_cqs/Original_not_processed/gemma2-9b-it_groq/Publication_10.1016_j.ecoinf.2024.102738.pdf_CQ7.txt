Answer:::
The provided text describes the sampling strategy used for training and testing a deep learning model, but it doesn't explicitly state the criteria used to split the data into train, test, and validation sets. 

However, it does mention:

* **Chuvieco (2020):** This source suggests using at least 196 test points for categorical variables.
* **Congalton (1991) and Hay (1979):** These sources recommend at least 50 pixels per thematic class for training.

Based on this information, we can infer that the authors likely used a combination of these criteria to split the data. They aimed for a minimum of 196 test points and ensured each of the 6 thematic classes had at least 50 training samples.  

The text also mentions "simplified random sampling," suggesting a random distribution of training and testing samples. 

To get a definitive answer on the exact split proportions (e.g., 70% train, 15% validation, 15% test), you would need to consult the full research paper or contact the authors directly.
