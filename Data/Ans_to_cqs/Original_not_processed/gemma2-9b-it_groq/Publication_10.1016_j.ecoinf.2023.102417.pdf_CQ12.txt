Answer:::
The provided text mentions several deep learning architectures used for semantic image segmentation, such as UNet and DeepLabV3.  

It also states that neural networks can be used to extract complex image features and project them into a latent space representation for image classification. 

Based on this information, it's likely that a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** is used in the pipeline. CNNs are particularly well-suited for image processing tasks like classification and segmentation due to their ability to learn spatial hierarchies of features.
