Answer:::
The provided text states that deep learning has been successfully applied to **identifying and counting animal or plant species**.  It also mentions using CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) for this purpose, particularly when many features are needed for classification. 


Therefore, the purpose of the deep learning model in this context is **classification**.
