Answer:::

The provided text focuses on wetland classification using Sentinel-2 data and doesn't delve into the specifics of deep learning preprocessing techniques for addressing data bias.  

Therefore, I cannot answer your query about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline (e.g., stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, diverse data collection) based on the given context.
