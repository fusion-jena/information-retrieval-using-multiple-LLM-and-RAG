Answer: 

The provided text focuses on the architecture and performance of the Bayesian Deep Learning model, particularly its ability to handle uncertainty in predictions.  It mentions using a re-labeled output (BBCH_res) for both training and prediction phases, and discusses metrics like MAE, SMAPE, and NMPIW to evaluate the model's performance. 

However, the text **does not** provide information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model, such as:

* **Diverse dataset:**  Whether the dataset used was diverse enough to represent the range of conditions the model might encounter.
* **Cross-validation:**  Whether techniques like k-fold cross-validation were used to train and evaluate the model on different subsets of the data.
* **Stratified splitting:** Whether the dataset was split into training and testing sets in a way that proportionally maintains the distribution of classes or features. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer how the researchers ensured the generalizability of the deep learning model.
