Answer:::
The provided text focuses on using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for **classification** in bioacoustics research. 

Specifically, the authors aim to create models that can automatically identify and classify animal vocalizations (calls) within audio recordings. This is achieved by training CNNs to recognize patterns and characteristics within the calls, allowing them to differentiate between different species or call types.
