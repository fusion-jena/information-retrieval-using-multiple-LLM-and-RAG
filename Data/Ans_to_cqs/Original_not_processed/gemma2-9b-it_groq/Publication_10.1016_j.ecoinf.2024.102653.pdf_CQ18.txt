The text states that two validation methodologies were used. The first involved splitting the dataset into training (70%) and validation (30%) sets.  The performance of the model was monitored using the validation set. 

The text also mentions that the accuracy of the training and validation datasets was tracked. A graph (Figure 4) is referenced which shows the accuracy of the training and validation datasets.
