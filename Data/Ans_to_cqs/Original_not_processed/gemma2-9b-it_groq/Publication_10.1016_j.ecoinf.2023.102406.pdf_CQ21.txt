Answer:::
The provided text describes the modeling process but doesn't explicitly detail post-processing steps like saliency maps, metric calculation, or confusion matrix construction. 

However, it does mention:

* **Accuracy metrics:** These are calculated on a separate testing dataset (25% of the samples) to evaluate the model's performance.  Specific metrics mentioned include true positive rate (sensitivity) and true negative rate (specificity).

It's reasonable to infer that other common post-processing steps, such as:

* **Confusion matrix:** This visualizes the performance of a classification model by showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
* **Saliency maps:** These highlight the regions of input data (e.g., images) that are most influential in the model's prediction.

...would likely be employed as part of a comprehensive model evaluation and analysis.
