Answer: 

The provided text describes the training process of a deep learning model for classifying images of small mammals captured by camera traps.  

It mentions using the ResNet50 architecture, an adam optimizer, and training the model for 55 epochs. However, it **does not** specify details about measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model, such as:

* **Data diversity:**  While the text provides information about the number of training, validation, and test images for each class, it doesn't elaborate on the diversity of the dataset in terms of factors like location, time of year, or environmental conditions.
* **Cross-validation:** The text doesn't mention the use of cross-validation techniques to evaluate the model's performance on different subsets of the data.
* **Stratified splitting:**  There's no information about whether the dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets using stratified sampling to maintain the class distribution. 


Therefore, based on the provided text, we cannot definitively say what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
