Answer:::
The provided text does not describe the specific strategy used to monitor model performance during training. 

It does, however, discuss the accuracy assessment of the trained model using a dataset called GMEP (presumably a ground truth dataset).  The assessment focuses on:

* **Producer's Accuracy (PA):**  The proportion of correctly classified instances for each class.
* **User's Accuracy (UA):** The proportion of correctly classified instances out of all instances predicted as a particular class.
* **Overall Accuracy (OA):** The overall percentage of correctly classified instances.


The text highlights that classes with extensive coverage or those dominated by few species were mapped with higher accuracy.
