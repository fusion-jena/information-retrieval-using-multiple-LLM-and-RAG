Answer:::
The provided text mentions that the CA-Hybrid network, which incorporates a CAM (Woo et al., 2018) module in its CNN, was able to "boost the generalization ability of the model."  

However, it doesn't specify the exact measures taken to ensure generalizability beyond this architectural choice.  The text doesn't discuss:

* **Dataset diversity:**  Whether the dataset used to train the model was diverse in terms of the types of Cervidae it contained.
* **Cross-validation:**  Whether techniques like k-fold cross-validation were employed to evaluate the model's performance on different subsets of the data.
* **Stratified splitting:** Whether the dataset was split into training and testing sets in a way that proportionally represented the different classes of Cervidae. 


Therefore, based on the information given, we can't definitively say what other measures were taken to ensure the model's generalizability.
