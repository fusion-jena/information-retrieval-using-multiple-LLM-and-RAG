Answer:::

The provided text does not describe the specific strategy used to monitor model performance during training of the Potapov30m model. 

It does mention that the authors validated the model using ALS data after training, reporting a Mean Error (ME) of 3.8 m, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 9.07 m, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 6.36 m. 


However, it doesn't explain how they monitored performance *during* the training process itself.
