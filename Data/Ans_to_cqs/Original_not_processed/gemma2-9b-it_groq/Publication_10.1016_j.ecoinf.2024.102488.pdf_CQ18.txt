Answer:::
The provided text describes a machine learning workflow for land cover classification but doesn't explicitly state the strategy used to monitor model performance during training. 

However, we can infer some information:

* **Five-fold cross-validation:** This technique is mentioned in the context of feature selection (RFECV) and likely plays a role in performance monitoring. Cross-validation involves splitting the data into five folds, training the model on four folds, and evaluating it on the remaining fold. This process is repeated five times, using each fold as the validation set once. The average performance across all five folds provides a more robust estimate of the model's performance.
* **Accuracy:** The text mentions that the cross-validation accuracy is used to guide the feature selection process. This suggests that accuracy is a key metric used to monitor model performance.

Therefore, we can infer that the strategy likely involves using five-fold cross-validation to evaluate the model's accuracy during the training process.
