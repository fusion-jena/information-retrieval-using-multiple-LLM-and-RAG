Answer:::

The provided text focuses on comparing XGBoost and deep learning models, and doesn't delve into specific techniques for addressing data bias during the preprocessing stage of a deep learning pipeline. 

However, based on general knowledge of machine learning practices, here are some common techniques used to mitigate data bias:

* **Stratified Splitting:** This technique ensures that the training, validation, and test sets proportionally reflect the distribution of target classes in the original dataset. This helps prevent bias towards majority classes during model training.

* **Oversampling:** This involves duplicating instances from underrepresented classes to balance the dataset and give these classes more weight during training.

* **Undersampling:** This technique removes instances from the majority class to reduce its dominance and bring the class distribution closer to balance.

* **Diverse Data Collection:**  The most effective way to address bias is to collect data that is representative of the real-world population. This requires conscious effort to include diverse samples across various demographics, backgrounds, and perspectives.


It's important to note that addressing data bias is an ongoing challenge in machine learning, and a combination of these techniques is often necessary to achieve fairness and mitigate potential biases.
