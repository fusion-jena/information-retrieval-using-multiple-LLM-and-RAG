Answer:::
The provided text describes how the data is split for the SCAM-Herb model but doesn't explicitly state the criteria used for splitting the data into train, test, and validation sets. 

It does mention:

* **Data splitting:**  The text refers to data splitting in Figure 7 and provides details about the data split in Table 1. 
* **Five equal folds:** Figure 3 describes the data being divided into five equal folds for the FAA-based approach.

However, it doesn't clarify if this five-fold split is used for train, test, and validation sets or if other criteria are employed. 


To determine the exact criteria used for splitting the data, you would need to refer to Table 1 and potentially further context not included in the provided text.
