Answer:::
The provided text does not describe any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as the use of a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. 

The text mentions that the model was fine-tuned using a maximum of 1000 five-second noisy and clean samples. It also states that all data was down-sampled to 16 kHz to align with the model's input requirements. However, it does not provide details about the dataset's diversity or any techniques used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
