Answer:::
The provided text states that the data set was randomly split into two sets: 80% for model training and 20% for model testing. 

It further explains that the 80% used for training is called the "training set" and is used to compute the gradient and update the network parameters (weights and biases). The 20% used for testing is called the "validation set" and is used to test the model error.
