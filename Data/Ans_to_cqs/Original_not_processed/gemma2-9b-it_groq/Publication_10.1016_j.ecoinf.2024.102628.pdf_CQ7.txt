Answer:::
The provided text describes a Leave-One-Group-Out (LOGO) cross-validation approach for training and evaluating deep learning models. 

In this method, the data is split into groups, where each group represents a complete 450m multitemporal transect.  

For each iteration of the cross-validation:

* **Training Data:**  All transects except one are used for training the model.
* **Test Data:** The single excluded transect serves as the test set to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

This approach ensures that each transect is used as a test set exactly once, preventing information leakage between folds and providing a robust evaluation of the model's generalization ability. 


There isn't a separate validation set explicitly mentioned in the text. The LOGO approach inherently incorporates a testing phase within each iteration, allowing for performance monitoring during the training process.
