Answer:::

The provided text does not contain information about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.  It discusses the challenges of training data for bioacoustic classification, particularly for species with small sample sizes and variable call characteristics. 

The text mentions the importance of:

* **Including all species:** To better represent local species diversity.
* **Including all events:** To better represent the variability found in the area.
* **Confident 'ground truth' classifications:** To ensure the accuracy of the training data.

However, it does not detail techniques like diverse dataset creation, cross-validation, or stratified splitting that are commonly used to improve model generalizability.
