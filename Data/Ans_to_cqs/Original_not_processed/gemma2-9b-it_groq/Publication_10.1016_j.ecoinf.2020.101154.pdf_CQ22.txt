Answer:::
The provided text focuses on Gradient Boosting Regression Trees (GBRT) models, not deep learning models.  Therefore, it doesn't specify the metrics used to evaluate deep learning models. 

The text does mention that the performance of the GBRT models was evaluated based on Mean Squared Error (MSE).
