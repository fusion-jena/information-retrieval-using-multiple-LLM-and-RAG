Answer:::
The provided text focuses on describing different convolutional neural network architectures (LeNet, AlexNet, VGG, GoogLeNet, ResNet) and their characteristics.  It doesn't delve into specific regularization techniques used to prevent overfitting. 

While the text mentions that pooling is used to "prevent the model from overfitting," it doesn't explicitly list regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization.
