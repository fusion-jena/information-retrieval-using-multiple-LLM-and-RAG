Answer:::
The provided text describes the AutoML process for selecting a deep learning model architecture but doesn't specify the exact hyperparameters used during training. 

It mentions that hyperparameters like the "number of layers" and "learning rate" are randomly selected from a predefined range. However, it doesn't list other common hyperparameters such as:

* **Optimizer:**  (e.g., Adam, SGD)
* **Batch size:**  
* **Dropout rate:** 
* **Regularization techniques:** (e.g., L1, L2)
* **Activation functions:** (e.g., ReLU, sigmoid)


To know the precise hyperparameters used in each case study, you would need to refer to the original research paper or code implementation.
