Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the FIREMAP algorithm's use of Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery for burn area mapping. It mentions "atmospherically corrected, harmonized Sentinel-2 (S2) post-fire Level-2 A scenes" and "S2 Level-1C scenes." 

Therefore, the deep learning pipeline in FIREMAP likely uses **raster image data** formats derived from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery.
