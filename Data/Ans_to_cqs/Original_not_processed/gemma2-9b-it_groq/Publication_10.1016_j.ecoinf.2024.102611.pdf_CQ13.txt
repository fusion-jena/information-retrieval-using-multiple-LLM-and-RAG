Answer:::
The provided text does not specify the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning models.  It mentions that hyperparameter tuning and batch updated stochastic gradient descent were used in one study (Barhate et al., 2023), but it doesn't list the specific values for learning rate, optimizer, or other hyperparameters.
