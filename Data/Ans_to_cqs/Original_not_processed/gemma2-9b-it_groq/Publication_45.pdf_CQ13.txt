Answer:::
The provided text states that the hyperparameters evaluated were:

* **network capacity** (number of layers and neurons per layer)
* **applied regularization techniques**
* **used loss function**
* **optimizer** 

However, it does *not* specify the exact values used for these hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate).
