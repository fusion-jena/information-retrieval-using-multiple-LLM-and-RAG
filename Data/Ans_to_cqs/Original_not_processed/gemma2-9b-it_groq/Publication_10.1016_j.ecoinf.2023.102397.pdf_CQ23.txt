Answer:::

The provided text does not describe the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.  It mentions that the model was trained and evaluated on the same dataset, but it doesn't detail techniques like data splitting (e.g., stratified splitting, cross-validation), dataset diversity strategies, or any steps to prevent overfitting.
