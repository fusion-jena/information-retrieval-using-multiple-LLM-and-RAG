The provided text focuses on the challenges of training CNNs with limited data and discusses techniques like transfer learning and data augmentation. It doesn't delve into specific preprocessing steps for deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps generally include:

* **Normalization:** Scaling pixel values to a specific range (e.g., 0 to 1) to improve training stability and speed.
* **Scaling:**  Similar to normalization, but might involve subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of the data.
* **Cleaning:** Removing noise, artifacts, or irrelevant information from the images. This can involve techniques like removing blurry regions, filling in missing pixels, or correcting color distortions.

Keep in mind that the specific preprocessing steps depend on the dataset and the deep learning model being used.
