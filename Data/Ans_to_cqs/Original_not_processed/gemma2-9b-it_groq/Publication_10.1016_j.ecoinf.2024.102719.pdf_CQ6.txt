Answer:::
The provided text focuses on ensemble learning methods and bias-variance decomposition in machine learning, and doesn't offer details about preprocessing steps for deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values (imputation or removal), removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies.
* **Feature Scaling:**  Transforming features to a similar scale (e.g., standardization, normalization) to prevent features with larger magnitudes from dominating the learning process.
* **Encoding Categorical Features:** Converting categorical variables into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding, label encoding) that deep learning models can understand.
* **Normalization:** Scaling data to a specific range (e.g., 0 to 1) to improve model stability and convergence.
* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training dataset by applying transformations to existing data (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) to enhance model robustness.
