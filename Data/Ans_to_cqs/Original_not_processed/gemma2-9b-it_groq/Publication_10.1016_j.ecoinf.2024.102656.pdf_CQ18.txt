Answer:::
The provided text does not describe the specific strategy implemented to monitor model performance during training. 

It does mention that the performance of individual models and the ensemble model was evaluated using two metrics: the area under the curve (AUC) and the true skill statistic (TSS).  It also states that AUC values exceeding 0.9 were considered excellent, and TSS values were categorized as excellent, good, or poor. 

However, it doesn't explain how these metrics were used during the training process itself to adjust model parameters or determine when training should stop.
