Answer: 

The provided text focuses on the hyperparameter optimization process for a deep learning model and the Random Forest model, detailing the specific configurations tested and performance metrics used.  

However, it does not mention any strategies employed to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as:

* **Diverse dataset:** Information about the dataset's diversity (e.g., representativeness, class distribution) is lacking.
* **Cross-validation:**  The text doesn't describe the use of cross-validation techniques to evaluate model performance on unseen data.
* **Stratified splitting:**  There's no mention of stratified splitting for ensuring proportional class representation in training and testing sets. 


Therefore, based on the given context, we cannot determine what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
