Answer:::

The provided text focuses on data splitting techniques (80% training, 20% testing) and random sampling to ensure representative subsets. It also mentions data filtering to remove outliers and smooth data points. 

However, the text does not explicitly discuss techniques to address data bias during preprocessing, such as:

* **Stratified splitting:**  Dividing data into subsets while preserving the proportion of classes.
* **Oversampling:**  Increasing the representation of minority classes.
* **Undersampling:**  Decreasing the representation of majority classes.
* **Diverse data collection:**  Actively seeking out data from various sources and demographics to minimize representation gaps. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer your query about specific bias mitigation techniques used in the preprocessing stage.
