The provided text doesn't specify the exact method used for hyperparameter optimization (e.g., grid search, random search). 

It only states that the hyperparameters (network capacity, regularization techniques, loss function, and optimizer) were "evaluated iteratively" and the training was stopped when accuracy on the test dataset plateaued.
