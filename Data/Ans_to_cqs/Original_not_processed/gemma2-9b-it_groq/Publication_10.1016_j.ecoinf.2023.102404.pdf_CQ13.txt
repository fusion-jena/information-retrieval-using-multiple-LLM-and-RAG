Answer:::
The provided text focuses on a Random Forest (RF) model, not a deep learning model. Therefore, it doesn't mention hyperparameters commonly used in deep learning, such as learning rate or optimizer. 

The text does discuss hyperparameters specific to the RF model:

* **numberOfTrees:** The number of decision trees in the ensemble.
* **minLeafPopulation:** The minimum number of samples required to form a leaf node.
* **bagFraction:** The proportion of the training dataset used to train each tree.
* **seed:** A random number seed for reproducibility.
