Answer:::
Based on the provided text, the deep learning pipeline likely uses image data formats. 

The text mentions:

*  UAV-based LiDAR, hyperspectral, and ultrahigh-resolution RGB data being used for tree segmentation and species classification.
*  DOM (Digital Orthophoto Map), DSM (Digital Surface Model), and DTM (Digital Terrain Model) being generated from UAV photogrammetry.
*  Image classification using the "Image Classification" tool in ArcMap.

These points strongly suggest that images, likely in RGB format, are a key input to the deep learning pipeline.
