Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the application of Random Forest, a machine learning algorithm, not deep learning.  It mentions using gonad data collected from commercial industrial and acoustic surveys.  

While the text doesn't explicitly state the data format of this gonad data, it's likely that it's  processed and represented in a way suitable for machine learning. This could involve:

* **Numerical Features:**  Measurements extracted from the gonad samples, such as size, weight, or other relevant biological characteristics. These could be stored in a CSV or similar tabular format.
* **Image Data:**  If images of the gonads were taken, they could be used as input.  

Without further information from the study, it's impossible to definitively say what data formats are used in their pipeline.
