Answer:::

The provided text describes the model development process and hyperparameter tuning but doesn't explicitly mention techniques to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. 

Here's what we can infer:

* **Data Splitting:** The text describes a three-part split for model training and evaluation. This involves splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets.  The validation set is used for hyperparameter tuning, and the final test set is used for a single evaluation of the best model. This approach helps prevent overfitting to the training data.
* **Cross-Validation:** While not explicitly stated, the use of a three-part split suggests a form of cross-validation, as the validation set is used to evaluate the model during the training process.

* **RY Data Splitting:**  A specific data splitting approach is described for the RY dataset, where observations are grouped by year of capture and years are randomly selected for training and testing. This aims to ensure the model is tested on unseen combinations of explanatory variables, enhancing its robustness.

**Missing Information:**

The text doesn't mention techniques like:

* **Stratified splitting:** Ensuring proportional representation of different classes in the training and test sets.
* **Diverse dataset:**  Information about the dataset's diversity (e.g., geographical, temporal) is limited.


Therefore, while the text suggests some measures for generalizability, it lacks details about specific techniques used to ensure a diverse dataset or stratified splitting.
