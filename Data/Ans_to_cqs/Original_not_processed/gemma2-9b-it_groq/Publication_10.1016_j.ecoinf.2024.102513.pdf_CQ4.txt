Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the architecture and functionality of a convolutional neural network for land use and land cover (LULC) classification. It doesn't delve into specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. 

Therefore, based on the context given, I cannot answer your question about data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, or scaling.
