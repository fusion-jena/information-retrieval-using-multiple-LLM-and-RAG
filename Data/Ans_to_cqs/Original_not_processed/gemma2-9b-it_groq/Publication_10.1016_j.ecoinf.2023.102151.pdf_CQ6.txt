Answer:::

While the provided context focuses on soil science and data visualization, it doesn't delve into the specifics of deep learning preprocessing steps. 

However, I can offer some general information about common preprocessing steps used before training deep learning models:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values (imputation or removal), identifying and removing outliers, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1 or -1 to 1) can improve model performance. Common techniques include min-max scaling and z-score normalization.

* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones can sometimes enhance model accuracy. This might involve combining features, transforming them (e.g., taking logarithms), or encoding categorical variables.

* **Encoding Categorical Variables:**  Converting categorical data (e.g., colors, types) into numerical representations that deep learning models can understand is crucial. Techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding are often used.

* **Data Augmentation:**  For image data, augmenting the dataset by applying transformations (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) can increase model robustness and generalization ability.


Remember that the specific preprocessing steps will depend on the nature of your data and the deep learning model you are using.
