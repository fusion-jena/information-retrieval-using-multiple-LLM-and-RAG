Answer:::

The provided text focuses on water quality assessment using machine learning and doesn't delve into the specifics of handling randomness in deep learning pipelines.  

However, I can provide some general information about strategies used to manage randomness in deep learning:

* **Random Seed Initialization:**  Deep learning models often initialize weights randomly. Setting a fixed random seed ensures that the same random weights are used each time you run the code, making the results reproducible.

* **Dropout:** This technique randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during each training step. This prevents overfitting by forcing the network to learn more robust features.

* **Batch Normalization:** This technique normalizes the activations of each layer, reducing the internal covariate shift and stabilizing training.

* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training data by applying random transformations (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) to existing samples.

* **Ensemble Methods:** Training multiple models with different random initializations and averaging their predictions can reduce the impact of randomness.
