Answer:::
The provided text describes a data partitioning scheme for model training and selection, but it doesn't explicitly state the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (train, test, validation). 

However, we can infer some information:

* **Training Data (At + Av):**  A combined 75% of the data is used for training the selected candidate model. This suggests a standard split where a large portion of the data is dedicated to training the model.
* **Validation Data (Av):** 50% of the data is used for validating candidate models during the selection process. This indicates a separate validation set used to evaluate model performance and guide the selection of the best-performing model.
* **Test Data (T):**  The text mentions a separate "test" partition (T) used to assess the final model's performance. This implies a final test set held out from the training and validation processes.

While the exact criteria for splitting the data into train, validation, and test sets aren't explicitly stated, the described process aligns with common practices in machine learning:

* **Train Set:** Largest portion for model training.
* **Validation Set:** Used to tune hyperparameters and compare different models during training.
* **Test Set:**  Held out entirely from training and used only once for final performance evaluation.


It's important to note that the specific split ratios (e.g., 75%, 25%) can vary depending on the dataset size and the specific needs of the project.
