Answer:::
The provided text describes methods to *prevent* overfitting, which can hinder generalization, rather than techniques to directly ensure generalizability. 

Specifically, it mentions these strategies to combat overfitting:

* **Batch normalization:**  A technique that normalizes the activations of each layer, helping the network learn more efficiently and preventing the gradients from becoming too large.
* **Weight decay:**  A regularization technique that adds a penalty to the sum of the squared weights during training. This discourages the network from learning overly complex representations.
* **Dropout:** A technique that randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during each training step. This prevents the network from relying too heavily on any single neuron and encourages the learning of more robust features.

The text also states that the learning rate was set to 0.0001 and the number of training epochs to 200. These hyperparameters can influence the model's ability to generalize, but the text doesn't explicitly describe other generalizability-enhancing techniques like using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.
