Answer:::
The provided text focuses on a specific deep learning application for animal tracking and doesn't explicitly detail the data splitting criteria used for training. 

However, common practices in deep learning model training involve splitting data into three main sets:

* **Training set:** This is the largest portion of the data used to train the model. The model learns patterns and relationships within this dataset.

* **Validation set:** This set is used to evaluate the model's performance during training. It helps in tuning hyperparameters and preventing overfitting (where the model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data).

* **Test set:** This set is held out entirely from the training process and is used only for a final evaluation of the trained model's performance on unseen data. This provides an unbiased estimate of how well the model generalizes to new examples.

The exact proportions of each set can vary depending on the dataset size and the specific task. A common split is 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing.
