Answer:::

The provided text snippets don't explicitly detail the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for insect detection and counting. 

However, we can infer some possibilities based on the context:

* **Sensors:**  The paper by Zhong et al. (2018) mentions a "vision-based counting and recognition system," suggesting the use of cameras as sensors to capture images of flying insects. 
* **Public Datasets:** While the text mentions some datasets, it doesn't confirm if they are publicly available.  It's possible that researchers utilize existing public datasets for insect image classification and detection.
* **Custom Datasets:** The emphasis on "data collection and curation phases" in the Yu and Koltun (2016) paper, along with the mention of "non-publicly available datasets" for evaluation, implies that researchers may create their own datasets for training and testing their models. This could involve manual image collection using cameras or other imaging devices.


It's important to note that without further information from the cited papers or additional context, we cannot definitively state the exact methods used for data collection.
