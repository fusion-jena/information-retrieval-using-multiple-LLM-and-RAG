Answer:::
The provided text mentions several metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. These include:

* **Sensitivity (Se):**  Represents the proportion of actual positive cases that are correctly identified. 
* **Specificity (Sp):** Represents the proportion of actual negative cases that are correctly identified.
* **Positive Predictive Value (PPV):**  Represents the proportion of predicted positive cases that are actually positive.
* **Negative Predictive Value (NPV):** Represents the proportion of predicted negative cases that are actually negative.
* **Accuracy (ACC):** Represents the overall proportion of correctly classified cases.
* **Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC):**  A balanced measure that considers both true and false positives and negatives.

The text also refers to **True Positive (TP)**, **True Negative (TN)**, **False Positive (FP)**, and **False Negative (FN)**, which are the individual counts used to calculate these metrics.
