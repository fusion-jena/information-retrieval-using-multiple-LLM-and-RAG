Answer:::
The provided text describes the use of  "bulk samples" of Coleoptera (beetles) collected in different sites around the world.  A subset of these bulk samples were photographed using a conventional stereoscope NIKON SMZ1270i equipped with a NIKON DS-Fi3 Microscope Camera. These photographs were denoted the "Local Low Quality (LL) dataset". 


Therefore, the method used for collecting raw data in this deep learning pipeline is **manual collection of bulk samples followed by photographing individual specimens within those samples**.
