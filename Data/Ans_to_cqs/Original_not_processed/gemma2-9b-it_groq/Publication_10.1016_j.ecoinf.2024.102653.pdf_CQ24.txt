Answer:::
The provided text describes the use of a random seed to ensure reproducible results when initializing the model's weights. 

Specifically, it states: "The modelâ€™s weights were randomly initialized using a specific integer seed to guarantee consistent reproducibility of results." 

This suggests that setting a fixed random seed value is the strategy employed to handle randomness in weight initialization, promoting reproducibility of the training process. 


The text doesn't mention other strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as shuffling data during training or using techniques to control the randomness of dropout.
