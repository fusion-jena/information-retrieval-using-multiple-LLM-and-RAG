Answer:::
The provided text does not specify the exact criteria used to split the data into training, testing, and validation sets for the deep learning model. 

It does mention that the training set is preprocessed using a MinMaxScaler to scale features to a [0-1] range and that the LSTM model has a single hidden layer with a number of neurons determined by the training data size. 

However, details about the specific data splitting strategy (e.g., percentages used for each set, techniques like stratified sampling) are not provided in the given context.
