Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the dataset characteristics, algorithm selection, and performance evaluation metrics. It doesn't delve into specific post-processing steps like saliency maps or confusion matrix construction. 

However, it does mention the following post-processing steps:

* **Metrics Calculation:**  The text states that the algorithms are ranked based on the F-measure, Precision, Recall, and Accuracy. This implies that these metrics are calculated after model training to evaluate its performance.

The text doesn't explicitly mention saliency maps or confusion matrix construction.
