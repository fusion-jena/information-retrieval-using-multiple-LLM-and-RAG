Answer:::
The text states that the ENS (likely referring to an evaluation metric) was calculated on four separate test sets. These test sets are described as "independent" and measuring "different aspects of model generalizability". 

While the specific techniques used for splitting the data (e.g., cross-validation, stratified splitting) are not mentioned, the use of multiple independent test sets suggests an attempt to evaluate the model's ability to generalize to different data variations.
