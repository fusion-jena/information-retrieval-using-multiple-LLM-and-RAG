Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the development and application of a deep learning model called DeepMeerkat for animal detection in camera trap videos. It doesn't explicitly describe the methods used for collecting the raw data (camera trap videos) used to train and test the model. 

However, we can infer that the raw data is likely collected using **camera traps**.  The text mentions "time-lapse camera trap images" and "camera trap videos" multiple times, suggesting that these are the primary data sources.
