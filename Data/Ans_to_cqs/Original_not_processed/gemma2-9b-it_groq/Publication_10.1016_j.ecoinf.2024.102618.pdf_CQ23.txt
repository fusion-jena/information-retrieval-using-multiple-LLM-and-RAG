Answer:::

The provided text focuses on describing the performance metrics used to evaluate deep learning models and presents a comparison of different models' accuracy and F1-score. 

It does not, however, mention any specific techniques used to ensure the generalizability of the models, such as:

* **Diverse dataset:**  Information about the dataset's diversity is not provided.
* **Cross-validation:**  The text doesn't describe the use of cross-validation techniques.
* **Stratified splitting:**  There is no mention of stratified splitting for data partitioning. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
