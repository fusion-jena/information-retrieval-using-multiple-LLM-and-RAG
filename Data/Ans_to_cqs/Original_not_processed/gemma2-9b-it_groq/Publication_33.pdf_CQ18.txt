Answer:::
The provided text describes a two-phase process for training and evaluating a classification model, but it doesn't explicitly detail the strategy used to monitor model performance *during* training. 

We know:

* **Phase 1:** A CNN is trained on a dataset T0.
* **Phase 2:**  A risk threshold (Ï„i) is tuned for each class using a separate dataset T1.

The text focuses on the post-processing techniques and threshold tuning for accuracy improvement after training.  It doesn't mention specific metrics or techniques used to monitor the model's performance *while* it's being trained on dataset T0.
