Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the development of a dataset for Green View Index (GVI) extraction and the use of a deep learning model called SegFormer for this task. It doesn't delve into the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the broader context of deep learning pipelines. 

However, based on general knowledge about deep learning, here are some common methods for collecting raw data:

* **Surveys:**  Surveys can be used to gather labeled data, where humans provide annotations or classifications for images or text.
* **Sensors:** Various types of sensors, such as cameras, LiDAR, and microphones, can collect raw data about the physical world.
* **Public Datasets:** Many publicly available datasets exist, containing images, text, audio, and other types of data that can be used for training deep learning models. 


The specific methods used will depend on the nature of the deep learning task and the type of data required.
