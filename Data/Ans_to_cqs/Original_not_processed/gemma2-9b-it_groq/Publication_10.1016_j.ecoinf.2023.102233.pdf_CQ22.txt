The provided text states that the model's performance was evaluated using macro-averaged Mean Absolute Error (MAE).  It also mentions that the model's ability to differentiate non-target sounds was improved, leading to a reduction in false positives. 

While the text doesn't explicitly list other metrics like accuracy, precision, or recall, it does highlight the importance of addressing class imbalance in the evaluation data.
