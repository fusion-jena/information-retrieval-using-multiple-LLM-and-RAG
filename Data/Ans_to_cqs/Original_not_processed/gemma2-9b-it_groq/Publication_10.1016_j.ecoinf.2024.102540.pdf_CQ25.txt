Answer:::
The provided text states that deep learning models, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have been successfully used for **pattern recognition** in a range of insect images. 

More specifically, the text highlights their effectiveness in **detection and classification tasks** compared to traditional machine learning approaches. 


Therefore, the purpose of the deep learning model described in the context is **detection and classification** of organisms, likely insects, in images.
