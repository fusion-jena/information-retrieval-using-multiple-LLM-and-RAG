Answer:::
The text provides information about several metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model:

* **Precision:**  A measure of how many of the predicted positive cases are actually correct.
* **Recall:** A measure of how many of the actual positive cases are correctly predicted.
* **F1-measure:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of both.
* **Accuracy:** While not explicitly defined in the provided text, it is a common metric in machine learning and refers to the overall correctness of the model's predictions (the ratio of correct predictions to total predictions). 


The text also mentions the use of **True Positives (TP)**, **False Positives (FP)**, and **False Negatives (FN)**, which are fundamental building blocks for calculating precision, recall, and the F1-measure.
