Answer:::
The provided text focuses on hyperparameter optimization for a GRU-DNN model and other machine learning models like Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.  

While it mentions using the Tree Parzen Estimator (TPE) method to find optimal hyperparameters for the GRU-DNN model, it doesn't specify the exact hyperparameters used (e.g., learning rate, optimizer).
