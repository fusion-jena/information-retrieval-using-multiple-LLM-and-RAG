Answer:::
The provided text focuses on using deep learning for substratum classification in hydrothermal vent environments and doesn't specify the exact methods used for collecting raw data. 

However, it does mention:

* **"increasing availability of optical imagery datasets organized into large-scale temporal habitat maps"**: This suggests that optical imagery, likely collected through underwater cameras or remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), is a significant data source. 

Without further information, it's impossible to definitively list all the data collection methods used.
