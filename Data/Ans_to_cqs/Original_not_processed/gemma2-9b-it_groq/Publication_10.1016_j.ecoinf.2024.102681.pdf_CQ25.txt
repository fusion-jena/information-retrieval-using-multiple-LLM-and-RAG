Answer:::
The deep learning model described in the text is used for **prediction**. 

Specifically, it aims to predict the **propagation time of drought**, which is the time it takes for meteorological drought to develop into agricultural drought.  

The model takes into account various influencing factors, such as land use and land cover, and uses a hybrid architecture of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM) to analyze the complex relationships between these factors and drought propagation.
