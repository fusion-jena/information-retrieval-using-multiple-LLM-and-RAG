Answer:::
The provided text describes the model's performance evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and RMSE) but doesn't explicitly state the strategy used to monitor performance *during* training. 


It does mention hyperparameter tuning to find optimal values for regularization (Î± for linear and ridge regression, C for SVC) and the impact of different training dataset sizes on the linear model's performance.  

However, it doesn't detail how performance was tracked on a per-epoch or per-iteration basis during the training process.
