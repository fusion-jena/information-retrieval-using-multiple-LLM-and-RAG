Answer:::

Regularization methods are crucial techniques used in deep learning to prevent overfitting, a phenomenon where a model learns the training data too well and performs poorly on unseen data. 

Here are some common regularization methods:

* **Dropout:** Randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during each training step. This prevents the model from relying too heavily on any single neuron and encourages the learning of more robust features.

* **L1 Regularization (Lasso):** Adds a penalty to the sum of the absolute values of the weights during training. This encourages the model to use fewer features by driving some weights to exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection.

* **L2 Regularization (Ridge):** Adds a penalty to the sum of the squared values of the weights. This shrinks the weights towards zero, making the model less sensitive to small fluctuations in the data.

* **Early Stopping:** Monitors the model's performance on a validation set (separate from the training data) during training. Training is stopped when the validation performance starts to decrease, preventing the model from overfitting to the training data.

* **Batch Normalization:** Normalizes the activations of each layer during training, which can help stabilize training and reduce the need for excessive regularization.



These methods work by adding a cost to the model's complexity, discouraging it from learning overly complex patterns that might only fit the training data.
