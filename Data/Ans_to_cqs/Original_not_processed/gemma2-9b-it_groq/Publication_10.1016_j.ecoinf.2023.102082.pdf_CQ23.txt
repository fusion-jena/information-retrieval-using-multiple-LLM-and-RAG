Answer:::

The text mentions that the deep learning model was tested in three separate forest plot locations: 30 plots in the northern Italian Alps, 100 plots in the forested area of Traunstein (Germany), and finally all 130 plots combined through a cross-validation analysis. 

While it doesn't specify the exact details of the cross-validation method (e.g., k-fold cross-validation), it does indicate that a cross-validation analysis was performed to assess the model's performance. This suggests an attempt to evaluate the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.

The text doesn't provide information about data stratification or the diversity of the dataset used for training the model.
