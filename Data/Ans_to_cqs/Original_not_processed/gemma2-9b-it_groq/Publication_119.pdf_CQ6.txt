Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the architecture and hyperparameter tuning of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model and a U-Net model, and doesn't delve into the specific preprocessing steps involved before training these models.  

To answer your question generally, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models include:

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a specific range (e.g., 0 to 1 or -1 to 1) to prevent features with larger scales from dominating the learning process.
* **Scaling:** Similar to normalization, but often involves subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of each feature.
* **Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.
* **Encoding Categorical Features:** Converting categorical variables into numerical representations that the model can understand (e.g., one-hot encoding).
