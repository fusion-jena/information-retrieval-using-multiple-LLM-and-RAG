Answer: The text describes several measures taken to improve the generalizability of the Waveman model:

* **Adding Batch Normalization (BNorm) layers:** This helped prevent overfitting by encouraging the model to learn trends across both known and unknown datasets, rather than simply memorizing the training data.
* **Using a large batch size:** Training with 128 images per iteration allowed the model to learn from a larger volume of data at once, potentially leading to better generalization.
* **Testing on filtered and unfiltered data:** The model was tested on a validation dataset (filtered) and then on audio recordings from different environments (unfiltered) to assess its performance in diverse conditions.
* **Collecting audio from different conditions:**  The researchers recorded the same bat species under various human and natural conditions to further challenge the model's ability to generalize. 


The text doesn't explicitly mention techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting, but the combination of these methods suggests a focus on building a robust and generalizable model.
