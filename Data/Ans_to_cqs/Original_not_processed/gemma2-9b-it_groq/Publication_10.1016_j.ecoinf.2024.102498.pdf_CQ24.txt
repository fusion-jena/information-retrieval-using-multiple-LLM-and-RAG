Answer:::

The provided text focuses on using deep learning for land use and land cover (LULC) mapping and doesn't delve into specific strategies for handling randomness within the deep learning pipeline. 

However, it's common knowledge in the field of deep learning that randomness is inherent in several stages:

* **Initialization:**  Weights and biases in neural networks are often initialized randomly. Different random seeds can lead to different initial weight configurations, potentially resulting in variations in model training.

* **Activation Functions:** Some activation functions, like dropout, introduce randomness during training to prevent overfitting.

* **Data Augmentation:** Techniques like random cropping, flipping, and rotation are used to augment training data, adding randomness to the input.

* **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):** This popular optimization algorithm uses random samples of the training data (mini-batches) to update model parameters.

To mitigate the impact of randomness and ensure reproducibility, practitioners typically:

* **Set a Fixed Random Seed:**  Specifying a fixed random seed ensures that the random number generator produces the same sequence of random numbers each time the code is run. This makes experiments reproducible.

* **Use Techniques Like K-Fold Cross-Validation:** This method splits the data into k folds and trains the model on different combinations of these folds. Averaging the results across multiple runs helps reduce the impact of randomness in data splitting.
