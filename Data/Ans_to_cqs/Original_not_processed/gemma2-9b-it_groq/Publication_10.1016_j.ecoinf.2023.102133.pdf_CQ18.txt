Answer:::
The provided text describes the process of hyperparameter tuning for a machine learning model (likely Random Forest) but doesn't specify the strategy used to monitor performance *during* training. 

It does mention:

* **Grid search:** Used to find the best hyperparameter combination.
* **Performance scores:** Compared for different hyperparameter combinations to select the best model.

However, it doesn't detail how performance was tracked *while* the model was learning.
