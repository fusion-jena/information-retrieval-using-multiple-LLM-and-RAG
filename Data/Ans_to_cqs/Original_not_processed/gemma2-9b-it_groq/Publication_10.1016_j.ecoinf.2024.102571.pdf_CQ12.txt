Answer:::
The provided text states that a "three-layer feedforward back-propagation neural network with a 30â€“20-10 architecture" was developed. 

Feedforward neural networks are a type of artificial neural network where information flows in one direction, from input to output, without any cycles. 

Therefore, the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a **feedforward neural network**.
