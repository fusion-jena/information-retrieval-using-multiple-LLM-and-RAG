Answer:::
The provided text describes the process of data preparation and model training but doesn't mention specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. 

It states that the model was trained for 100 epochs with a batch size of 32 and details data augmentation techniques used during training, such as scaling, color space adjustments, and Mosaic augmentation. However, it doesn't elaborate on techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting, which are commonly used to improve model generalizability. 


Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively say what measures were taken to ensure the model's generalizability.
