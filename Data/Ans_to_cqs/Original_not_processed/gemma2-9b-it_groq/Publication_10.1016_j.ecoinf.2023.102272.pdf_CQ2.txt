Answer:::
The provided text focuses on using deep learning for predicting disease vector abundances. It mentions that deep learning models can use time series data directly as predictors.  

Therefore, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is likely **time series data**. 

The text doesn't specify the exact format of this time series data (e.g., CSV, numerical arrays), but it's safe to assume it's a structured format suitable for numerical analysis.
