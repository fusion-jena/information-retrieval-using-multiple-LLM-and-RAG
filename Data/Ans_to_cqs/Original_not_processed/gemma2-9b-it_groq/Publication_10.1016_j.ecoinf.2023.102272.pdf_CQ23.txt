Answer:::

The provided text describes a model selection procedure that involves splitting the data into several partitions:

* **At:** Training candidate models (25% of the data)
* **Av:** Validating candidate models (50% of the data)
* **Bt:** Training the selected candidate model (75% of the data, combining At and Av)
* **Bv:**  Validating the selected candidate model (25% of the data)

The text mentions using the `dismo` package in R for data partitioning, but it doesn't specify if techniques like cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the use of a diverse dataset were employed. 

Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot definitively say what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
