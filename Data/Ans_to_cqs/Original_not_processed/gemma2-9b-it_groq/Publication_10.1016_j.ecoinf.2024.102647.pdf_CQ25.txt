Answer:::
The provided text describes the use of a deep learning convolutional neural network algorithm for soil salinity distribution mapping in Lake Urmia, Iran.  

Therefore, the purpose of the deep learning model is **segmentation**. 

Convolutional neural networks are particularly well-suited for segmentation tasks, where the goal is to classify each pixel in an image into a specific category. In this case, the model is likely segmenting the image to identify areas of high and low soil salinity.
