Answer:::
The provided text describes a data splitting strategy for training deep learning models. 

Here's a breakdown:

1. **Initial Split:** 12,000 frames were extracted and divided into five datasets using repeated random sub-sampling.

2. **Training/Testing Split:** Each of the five datasets was further split into 80% for training and 20% for testing. This resulted in 9600 frames for training and 2400 frames for testing within each dataset.

The text doesn't explicitly mention a separate validation set. It focuses on the training and testing splits for each of the five data subsets.
