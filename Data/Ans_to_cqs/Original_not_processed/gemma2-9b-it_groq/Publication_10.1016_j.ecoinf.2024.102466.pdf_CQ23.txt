Answer:::
The provided text does not describe the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.  It focuses on comparing the performance of different object detection models (Cascade RCNN, FCOS, Sparse CNN, Faster CNN, ATSS, and RepPoint) on a bird recognition dataset. 

While the text mentions the dataset's size and division into training and validation sets, it doesn't elaborate on the dataset's diversity or the use of techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting.
