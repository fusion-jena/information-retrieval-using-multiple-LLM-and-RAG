Answer:::
The provided text does not describe any data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, or scaling applied to the audio data. 

It primarily focuses on:

* Handling varying audio file durations by repeating the signal to a fixed length (2 seconds).
* Using Mel-spectrograms as input to a VGG-style CNN.
* Exploring different spectrogram representations (Mel, harmonic, percussive) for classification.
