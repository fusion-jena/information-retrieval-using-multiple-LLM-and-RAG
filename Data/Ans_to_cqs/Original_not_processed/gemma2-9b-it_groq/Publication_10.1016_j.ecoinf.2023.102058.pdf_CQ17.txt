Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the application of machine learning, particularly deep learning, to hyperspectral data for water quality prediction.  While it mentions that ML methods are prone to overfitting, it doesn't delve into specific regularization techniques used to mitigate this issue. 

Therefore, based on the context given, I cannot answer what regularization methods are used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
