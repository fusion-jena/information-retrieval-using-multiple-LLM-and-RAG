Answer:::
The provided text describes a deep learning model used for **detection** of sharks in images. 

Several clues point to this:

*  The authors mention using the Faster-rcnn backbone, which is a popular architecture specifically designed for object detection.
* They discuss computing recall, precision, and F-measure, which are standard metrics for evaluating object detection models.
* The text states that the model was trained on "Trainingclips," suggesting a dataset containing images with labeled shark locations.
