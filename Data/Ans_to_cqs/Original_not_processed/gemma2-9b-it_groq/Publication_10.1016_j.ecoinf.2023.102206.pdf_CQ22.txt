Answer:::
The provided text focuses on a technique called IFTL (Iterative Fine-Tuning Learning) and its application to improve the performance of other machine learning models (ELM, GRNN, and SVR) in a transfer learning setting.  

It does not discuss the evaluation metrics used for deep learning models.  Common metrics for evaluating deep learning models include:

* **Accuracy:** The percentage of correctly classified instances.
* **Precision:**  The proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions.
* **Recall:** The proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances.
* **F1-Score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure.
* **Mean Squared Error (MSE):**  A measure of the average squared difference between predicted and actual values (often used for regression tasks).
