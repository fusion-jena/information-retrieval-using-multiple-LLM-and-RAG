Answer:::
The deep learning model described in the text is used for **detection** of artisanal and small-scale mines. 

The text states that the model is a "Sentinel-2 based multispectral convolutional neural network for detecting artisanal small-scale mining in Ghana".  It goes on to explain how the model's accuracy can be improved by reclassifying misclassified pixels in urban areas.
