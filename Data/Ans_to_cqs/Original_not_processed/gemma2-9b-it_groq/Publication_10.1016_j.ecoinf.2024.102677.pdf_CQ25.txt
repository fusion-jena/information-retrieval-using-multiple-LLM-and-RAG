Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model described in the text is **landscape type classification**. 

The text states that the researchers fine-tuned several CNN architectures and used them to predict the types of landscapes in a case study area.  It also mentions evaluating the models using performance metrics on validation and test sets to determine the best model for this classification task.
