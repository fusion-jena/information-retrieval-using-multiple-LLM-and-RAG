Answer:::
The provided text focuses on image classification and mentions the use of NAIP imagery.  

It states: "We review our approach to arriving at the existing broad classification, but also demonstrate below how a finer classification may be possible (and desirable) for individual sites or images."

and

"Perhaps more promising, however, are emerging methods that incorporate the human ability to see patterns with machine learning methods used for classification, for example “human in the loop” classification (Buscombe et al., 2022). This could speed up the classification of larger areas, and might also enable finer classification of woody vegetation, especially in the NAIP imagery."

Therefore, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is likely **image**.
