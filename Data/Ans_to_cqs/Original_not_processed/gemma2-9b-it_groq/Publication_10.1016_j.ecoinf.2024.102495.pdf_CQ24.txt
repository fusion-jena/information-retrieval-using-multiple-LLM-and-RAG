Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the optimization of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for mosquito classification and doesn't delve into specific strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. 

However, it does mention the use of:

* **Randomized Initialization:**  Deep learning models often initialize their weights randomly. This introduces variability in the starting point of the training process.
* **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):** This optimization algorithm uses a random subset (mini-batch) of the training data for each update to the model's weights. This introduces randomness into the weight updates.

Common strategies to mitigate randomness in deep learning pipelines include:

* **Setting a Fixed Random Seed:**  By setting a specific random seed, you ensure that the random number generator produces the same sequence of random numbers each time you run your code. This allows for reproducibility of results.
* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of your training data by applying random transformations (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) can help reduce the impact of randomness in the data itself.
* **Regularization Techniques:** Techniques like dropout and weight decay can help prevent overfitting by introducing controlled randomness during training.



It's important to note that some level of randomness is often beneficial in deep learning, as it helps models explore a wider range of solutions and avoid getting stuck in local optima.
