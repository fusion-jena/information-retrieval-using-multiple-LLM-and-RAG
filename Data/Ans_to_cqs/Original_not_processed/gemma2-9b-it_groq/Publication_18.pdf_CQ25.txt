Answer:::
CNNs are primarily used for three main tasks in computer vision:

1. **Image Classification:**  The model analyzes an image and assigns a label that describes its content (e.g., "cat," "dog," "car"). It also provides a probability indicating the confidence in its prediction.

2. **Object Detection:**  Similar to classification, but the model not only identifies the object but also locates it within the image using a bounding box.

3. **Segmentation:** The model partitions an image into multiple segments, each corresponding to a specific object or region (e.g., outlining the boundaries of a person in a photo).
