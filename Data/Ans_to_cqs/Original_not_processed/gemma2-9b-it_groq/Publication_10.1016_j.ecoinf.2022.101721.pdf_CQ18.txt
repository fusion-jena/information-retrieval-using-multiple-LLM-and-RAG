Answer:::
The provided text does not describe the specific strategy used to monitor model performance during training. 

It does, however, highlight the following points regarding model evaluation:

* **Importance of real-world data:** The text emphasizes that the performance of bat identification software should be evaluated using real-world examples, not just training and testing datasets.
* **Limitations of current approaches:**  The text criticizes current software for being "locked in a vacuum" and lacking real-world applicability.
* **Need for informative priors:** The text suggests incorporating informative priors into the algorithms to improve accuracy.


While these points shed light on the desired outcomes and challenges in evaluating bat identification software, they don't detail the specific techniques used to monitor performance during training.
