Answer:::
The provided text focuses on machine learning algorithms for forest fire susceptibility prediction and doesn't specify the exact data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. 

However, considering the context of forest fire prediction, it's likely that the data formats used include:

* **Remote sensing imagery:** This could be satellite or aerial images providing information about land cover, vegetation density, and other relevant features. Common formats for remote sensing data include GeoTIFF, JPEG, and PNG.
* **Geospatial data:** This might include shapefiles, KML files, or other formats representing geographical features like roads, water bodies, and administrative boundaries.

Without further information from the cited papers, it's impossible to definitively state the precise data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.
