Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the training process of the detection models and the development of a web application. It doesn't describe any post-processing steps performed after training, such as:

* **Saliency maps:**  These highlight the regions of an input image that are most influential in the model's decision.
* **Metrics calculation:**  This involves evaluating the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.
* **Confusion matrix:** This visualizes the performance of a classification model by showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what post-processing steps were involved.
