Answer: The deep learning model described in the text is used for **classification**. 

The text states that the model is designed for the "automatic annotation of marine images" and that it uses "deep learning and computer vision based models for automatic annotation of imagery from coral reefs."  

Furthermore, it mentions using the activation vectors of the first fully connected layer of a pre-trained VGGnet as feature representations for classification.
