Answer:::
The provided text describes a model called MLPnn-MC, which integrates a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) algorithm with a Markov chain.  

The text states that this model is used for "robust future LULC simulation" and "predict unseen data within the model at a single time by comprehending the hidden relationships." 

Based on this information, the purpose of the deep learning model is likely **classification**.  

The model aims to learn complex relationships between different factors to predict future land use and land cover (LULC) changes. This type of prediction involves categorizing land into different classes (e.g., forest, urban, agricultural).
