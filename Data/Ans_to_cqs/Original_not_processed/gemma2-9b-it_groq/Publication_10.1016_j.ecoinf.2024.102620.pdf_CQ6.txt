Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the PLUS model for land use change prediction and doesn't offer information about preprocessing steps for deep learning models.  

To answer your query about preprocessing steps for deep learning models, here are some common ones:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values (imputation or removal), removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., between 0 and 1) can improve model performance. Common methods include min-max scaling and z-score normalization.

* **Feature Scaling:**  Similar to normalization, this adjusts the scale of features to prevent features with larger magnitudes from dominating the learning process.

* **Encoding Categorical Features:**  Converting categorical variables (e.g., colors, categories) into numerical representations that the model can understand (e.g., one-hot encoding, label encoding).
* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones to potentially improve model performance. This can involve combining features, extracting relevant information, or transforming data into a more suitable format.
