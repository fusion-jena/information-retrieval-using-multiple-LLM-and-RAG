Answer:::

Based on the provided context, deep learning models are used for various purposes in relation to animal research, particularly in Antarctica. 

Here are some examples:

* **Detection:**  Several papers mention using deep learning for detecting and counting animals like penguins, seabirds, and Weddell seals in aerial imagery. For example,  Peng et al. (2020) used a modified Faster R-CNN for kiang detection in Tibetan plateau, and Wood et al. (2021) evaluated the accuracy of citizen scientist animal counts from drone imagery.
* **Classification:** While not explicitly stated, classifying different species of animals within aerial imagery could be a potential application inferred from the detection tasks.
* **Segmentation:**  Witharana et al. (2016) used object-based image analysis, which often involves segmentation techniques, to detect penguin guano in satellite images.

Moreni et al. (2023) discuss using deep learning for automated aerial animal detection, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate architectures for pretrained neural networks. 


Overall, the context suggests that deep learning models are primarily employed for **detection** and potentially **classification** of animals in aerial imagery for research and conservation purposes in Antarctica.
