Answer:::
The provided text describes the use of cross-validation to evaluate model performance. 

Cross-validation involves splitting the dataset into training and evaluation sets multiple times (K times). A new model is trained for each split.  

By averaging the performance of these K models, the authors aim to get a more robust understanding of the model's ability to generalize to unseen data and mitigate the risk of overfitting.
