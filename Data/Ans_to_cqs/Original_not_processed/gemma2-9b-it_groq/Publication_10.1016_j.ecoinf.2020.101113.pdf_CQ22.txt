Answer:::
The provided text describes the use of several metrics to evaluate the performance of the CNN model. These include:

* **Precision (P(τ))**:  The fraction of predictions of presence that are correct. 
* **Recall (R(τ))**, also known as sensitivity or true-positive rate, measures the fraction of presences that are correctly identified.
* **Average-Precision (AP)**:  A single metric derived from the precision-recall curve. It is the weighted sum of precisions at each threshold, using the increase in recall from the previous threshold as the weight.
* **Mean Average-Precision (mAP)**: The average AP across all classes, commonly used in multi-label prediction evaluation. 


The text does not mention accuracy as a specific evaluation metric.
