Answer:::
The provided text describes two main data splitting approaches:

**1. Two-Part Split:**

*  This approach divides the data into training and testing sets. 
*  The text states that for this split, "randomly splitting all individual observations" is generally considered optimal. 
*  It emphasizes that this method avoids systematic differences between the test and train datasets.

**2. Three-Part Split:**

* This approach involves a training, validation, and testing set.
*  The text explains that the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters. 
*  Once the model's performance on the validation set is deemed optimal, the final model is evaluated on the unseen test set.


The text focuses on how these splits are applied in the context of specific models (RI and RY) and doesn't delve into the specific criteria used for defining the size of each set.
