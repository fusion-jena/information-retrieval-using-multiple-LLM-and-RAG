Answer:::
Based on the provided context, I cannot give a definitive list of regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. 

While the context discusses various deep learning applications and techniques (like LSTM, CNN, and genetic programming), it doesn't delve into specific regularization strategies employed within those pipelines. 

However,  it's widely known that techniques like dropout and L2 regularization are commonly used to combat overfitting in deep learning.
