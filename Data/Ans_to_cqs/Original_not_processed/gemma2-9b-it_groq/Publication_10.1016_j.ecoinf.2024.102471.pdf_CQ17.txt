Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the Wav2Vec model architecture and training process. While it mentions "diversity loss" as a regularization technique used during pre-training, it doesn't delve into other common regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I can only confirm that diversity loss is used for regularization in Wav2Vec.
