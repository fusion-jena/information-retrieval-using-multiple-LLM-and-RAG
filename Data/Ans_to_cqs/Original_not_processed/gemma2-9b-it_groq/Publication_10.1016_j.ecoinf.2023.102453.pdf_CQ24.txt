Answer:::
The provided text focuses on hyperparameter optimization techniques and doesn't delve into strategies for handling randomness within the deep learning pipeline.  

To address your query about handling randomness in deep learning, here are some common strategies:

* **Setting a Random Seed:**  A random seed is a starting point for the random number generator. By setting a fixed seed, you ensure that the same "random" values are generated each time you run your code, making your results reproducible.

* **Using Deterministic Operations:**  Some deep learning libraries and frameworks offer deterministic versions of operations that typically involve randomness (e.g., weight initialization). Using these deterministic versions eliminates randomness in those specific steps.

* **Dropout:** While dropout introduces randomness during training by randomly "dropping out" (ignoring) a percentage of neurons, it's a technique designed to improve model generalization and reduce overfitting, not to manage randomness in the broader pipeline.

* **Batch Normalization:** This technique normalizes the activations within each layer, helping to stabilize training and reduce the impact of internal covariate shift, which can be influenced by randomness in the data.
