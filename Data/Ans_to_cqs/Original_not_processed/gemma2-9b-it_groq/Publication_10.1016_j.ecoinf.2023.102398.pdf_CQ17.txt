Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the training process and performance evaluation of a deep learning model, particularly mentioning the use of mean square error (MSE) for optimization and graded MSE convergence to avoid overtraining. 

However, it doesn't explicitly list specific regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization used to prevent overfitting.
