Answer:::
The provided text describes two approaches to address data bias during the experiment:

1. **Unbiased Dataset Creation:**  For the "Unbiased Dataset," the authors attempt to maintain a roughly 70%-30% split between training and testing data for each species.  Crucially, they ensure that images from the same specimen are not included in both the training and testing sets. This helps mitigate the bias that could arise if multiple images of the same specimen were used for both training and evaluation.

2. **Deep Learning with No Segmentation:** The second experiment uses deep learning CNNs without any explicit segmentation of the data.  The text states that the data is simply resized to 224x224 pixels before being fed into the network.  While this doesn't directly address data bias in the preprocessing stage, it relies on the network's ability to learn representations that are robust to variations within the dataset.


The text does not mention techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling, which are common methods for addressing data imbalance in machine learning.
