Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning models, particularly transformers, for wetland mapping. It doesn't delve into the specific preprocessing steps involved in training these models. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1) can improve model performance.

* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones can sometimes enhance the model's ability to learn patterns.
* **Encoding Categorical Data:** Converting categorical variables into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding) is often necessary for deep learning algorithms.

The specific preprocessing steps will depend on the nature of the data and the chosen deep learning model.
