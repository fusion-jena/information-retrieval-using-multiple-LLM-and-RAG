Answer:::
The provided text states that training was stopped after 100 epochs.  It also mentions that cross-validation was used with 80% of the data for training and 20% for validation. 

While the text doesn't explicitly state other criteria for determining training completion (like validation loss plateau), it implies that the model's performance on the validation set was monitored during training.
