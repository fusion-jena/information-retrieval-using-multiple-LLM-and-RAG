The provided text doesn't specify the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete.  It mentions a 60-20-20 train/validate/test split and that SMOTE, oversampling, or class weights were not used in the first stage of training. However, it doesn't describe how the training process itself was monitored or stopped. 


Possible criteria not mentioned in the text include:

* **Validation loss plateau:**  Training might stop when the validation loss stops decreasing significantly.
* **Maximum number of epochs:** The training could be limited to a predetermined number of epochs.
* **Early stopping:**  Training could be stopped if the validation performance doesn't improve for a certain number of epochs. 


To know the precise criteria used, you would need to refer to the full research paper or the code used for training.
