Answer:::
The provided text describes the process of determining when training is complete by looking for signs of overfitting. 

Specifically, it states that models were trained and tested by:

* Tuning the number of required epochs.
* Inspecting the model outputs and error outcomes for signs of overfitting.

Overfitting occurs when a model focuses too much on fitting the training data and starts to memorize noise instead of learning general patterns. This is indicated by the model's performance decreasing on held-out test data after a certain point.

The text doesn't mention specific criteria like validation loss plateau, but it implies that observing the model's performance on both training and test data is crucial for determining when training is complete.
