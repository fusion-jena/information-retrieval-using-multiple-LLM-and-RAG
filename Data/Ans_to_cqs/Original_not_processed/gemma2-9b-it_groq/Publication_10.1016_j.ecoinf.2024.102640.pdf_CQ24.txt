Answer:::

The provided text focuses on semantic segmentation using the SegFormer model and doesn't delve into strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. 

However, I can offer some general strategies commonly used to address randomness:

* **Setting a Fixed Random Seed:**  This ensures that the same "random" numbers are generated in each run, making experiments reproducible. You'd typically set this at the beginning of your code execution.

* **Data Augmentation with Controlled Randomness:** Techniques like image flipping, rotation, or cropping introduce variation during training.  While these involve randomness, they are often carefully designed and controlled to prevent overfitting and improve model generalization.

* **Dropout:** This regularization technique randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during each training step. This prevents the model from relying too heavily on any single neuron and encourages the learning of more robust features.

* **Batch Normalization:** This technique normalizes the activations within each layer, helping to stabilize training and reduce the impact of internal covariate shift (changes in the distribution of activations).

* **Weight Initialization:**  Choosing appropriate weight initialization strategies (e.g., Xavier or He initialization) can help to prevent vanishing or exploding gradients during training, which can be influenced by random weight values.
