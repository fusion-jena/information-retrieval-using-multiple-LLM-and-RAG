Answer:::

The provided text describes the process of training a deep learning model for polar bear detection in aerial imagery.  It details the dataset preparation, including random cropping and selection of background images, but it does not explicitly mention techniques like cross-validation, stratified splitting, or other measures typically used to ensure the generalizability of a model. 

Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot definitively say what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
