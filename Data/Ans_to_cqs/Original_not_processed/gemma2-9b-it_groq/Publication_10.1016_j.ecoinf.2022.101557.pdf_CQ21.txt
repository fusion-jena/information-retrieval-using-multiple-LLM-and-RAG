Answer:::
The provided text describes post-processing steps taken *after* the CNN produces its initial predictions, not after model training. 

Here are the post-processing steps outlined in the text:

1. **Rounding Predictions:** Pixel predictions with a value greater than 0.5 are classified as wetlands, while those below 0.5 are classified as non-wetlands. This creates a binary raster map.

2. **Raster to Vector Conversion:** The raster map is converted into a vector representation for easier analysis, storage, and distribution. 


The text does not mention steps like saliency map generation, metric calculation, or confusion matrix construction, which are typically performed during or after model training to evaluate and understand the model's performance.
