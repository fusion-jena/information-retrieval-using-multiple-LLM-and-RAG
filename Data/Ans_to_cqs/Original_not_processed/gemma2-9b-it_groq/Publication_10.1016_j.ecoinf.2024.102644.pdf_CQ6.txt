Answer:::

The provided text focuses on evapotranspiration, water surplus, and other environmental factors related to wetland basins. It doesn't contain information about preprocessing steps for deep learning models. 

To answer your query about preprocessing steps for deep learning models, here are some common ones:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1) can improve model performance.

* **Standardization:**  Transforming data to have zero mean and unit variance.

* **Encoding Categorical Features:** Converting categorical variables into numerical representations that the model can understand (e.g., one-hot encoding).
* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones to potentially improve model accuracy.
