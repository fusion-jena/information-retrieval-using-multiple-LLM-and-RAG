Answer:::

The provided text focuses on imputation methods for missing data in the context of wildlife conservation and doesn't discuss strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines.  

To answer your query about randomness in deep learning, here are some common strategies:

* **Random Seed:** Setting a random seed ensures that the same "random" numbers are generated each time a model is trained. This allows for reproducibility of results.

* **Dropout:**  A regularization technique where a percentage of neurons are randomly "dropped out" (ignored) during each training step. This prevents overfitting and introduces stochasticity.

* **Batch Normalization:** Normalizes the activations of neurons within each mini-batch, reducing the internal covariate shift and stabilizing training.

* **Weight Initialization:**  Different methods for initializing the model's weights (e.g., Xavier initialization, He initialization) introduce randomness to help the model learn more effectively.

* **Data Augmentation:**  Randomly applying transformations to the training data (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) increases the diversity of the training set and reduces overfitting.
