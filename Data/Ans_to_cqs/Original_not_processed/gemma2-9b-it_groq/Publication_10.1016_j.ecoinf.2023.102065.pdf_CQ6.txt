Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for sound classification and details the training process, including pre-training with external sound data and fine-tuning with ROI data. 

However, it doesn't explicitly describe the preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model. 

While it mentions using mel-spectrograms, which is a common preprocessing step for sound data, it doesn't elaborate on other potential preprocessing techniques like normalization, scaling, or cleaning.
