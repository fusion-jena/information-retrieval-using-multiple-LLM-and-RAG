Answer: 

The provided text focuses on the methodology used for training a Random Forest model, not a deep learning model.  Therefore, it doesn't offer information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. 


The text does mention the use of wildfire events from the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS) for both training and validation of the FIREMAP burned area (BA) product. It also describes the use of recursive validation of the BA classification algorithm over independent wildfires to assess the model's performance.
