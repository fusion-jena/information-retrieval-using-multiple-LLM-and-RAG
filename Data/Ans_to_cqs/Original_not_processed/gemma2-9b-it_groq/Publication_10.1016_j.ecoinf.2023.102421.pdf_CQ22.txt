Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the performance evaluation of machine learning models, specifically XGBoost and LightGBM, rather than deep learning models. 

The metrics used to evaluate these models are:

* **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** This is the primary metric used, as stated in the text. It measures the average difference between the predicted and actual values.
* **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):**  This metric calculates the average absolute difference between predictions and actual values.
* **R2 (Coefficient of Determination):** This metric indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables in the model. 


The text does not mention deep learning models or the specific metrics typically used for their evaluation (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).
