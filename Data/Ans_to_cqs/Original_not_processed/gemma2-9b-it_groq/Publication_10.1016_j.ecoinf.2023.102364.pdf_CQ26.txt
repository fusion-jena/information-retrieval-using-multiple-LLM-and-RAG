Answer:::

The provided text focuses on a study using machine learning for predicting Short-billed Gull presence, employing techniques like RandomForest, MARS regression splines, and analyzing model diagnostics. It doesn't delve into deep learning or data bias mitigation techniques during preprocessing. 

Therefore, I cannot answer your query about techniques used to address data bias in a deep learning pipeline based on this context.
