Answer:::
The provided text mentions L1 and L2 regularization as hyperparameters used in the LightGBM models. 

Specifically,  `lambda_l1` and `lambda_l2` are listed as candidates for optimization,  indicating they represent the L1 and L2 regularization strengths, respectively. 

The text does not mention dropout as a regularization method used in the pipeline.
