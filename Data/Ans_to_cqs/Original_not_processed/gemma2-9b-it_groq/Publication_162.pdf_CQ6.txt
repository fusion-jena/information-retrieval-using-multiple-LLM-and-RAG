Answer:::
The provided text describes preprocessing steps taken for a specific deep learning model (D-Mask R-CNN) for object detection in RGB-D images. 

Here are the preprocessing steps mentioned:

* **Normalization:** All input channels (red, green, blue, and depth) are normalized by subtracting the respective mean and dividing by the respective standard deviation calculated over the entire dataset.
* **Feature Fusion:** A feature fusion module combines features extracted from two backbones using 3x3 convolutions at each FPN scale, reducing the number of channels.
* **Weight Initialization:**  Pre-trained weights from a model trained on the Microsoft COCO dataset are used for the region proposal network (RPN) classifier and mask head.

The text doesn't explicitly mention other common preprocessing steps like scaling, cleaning, or data augmentation techniques beyond using additional images from the internet.
