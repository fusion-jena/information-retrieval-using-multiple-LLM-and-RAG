Answer:::
The text provides information about the hyperparameters explored during the Optuna grid search for training the MLP models. 

Here are the hyperparameters mentioned:

* **Number of neurons in the first layer:**  Values ranged from 10 to 100.
* **Number of neurons in the second layer:** Values ranged from 0 to 100.
* **Strength of the L2 regularization term:** Values ranged from 1e-4 to 1e-1 on a logarithmic scale.
* **Solver for weight optimization:** Options included 'adam' and 'lbfgs'.
* **Initial learning rate:**  The optimal value was 0.0290 for SOS, 0.0010 for POS, and 0.0606 for PEAK.
* **Learning rate schedule for weight updates:** The text doesn't specify the exact schedule used, only that 'adam' was the chosen optimizer for all tasks.
* **Maximum number of iterations:**  The text doesn't provide a specific range for this hyperparameter.
* **Maximum number of iterations with no improvement:** The text doesn't provide a specific range for this hyperparameter.
