Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the model creation process and performance evaluation metrics (AUC, TSS) used for the study.  It mentions the use of ensemble models and committee averaging techniques to improve robustness. 

However, the text does not provide information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as:

* **Diverse dataset:**  Whether the dataset used for training was diverse in terms of the features it covered.
* **Cross-validation:**  If techniques like k-fold cross-validation were employed to assess the model's performance on unseen data.
* **Stratified splitting:** Whether the dataset was split into training and evaluation sets in a stratified manner to maintain the class distribution. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
