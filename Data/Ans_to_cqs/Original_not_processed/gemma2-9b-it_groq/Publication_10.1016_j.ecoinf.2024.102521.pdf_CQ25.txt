Answer:::
The provided text describes STARdbi, a web-based platform for insect identification and analysis.  It mentions the use of deep learning models for two specific purposes:

1. **Object Detection:** Identifying and locating individual insects within images.
2. **Percentage Cover Assessment:**  Estimating the proportion of an image covered by insects. 


The text also states that the platform aims to integrate taxonomic classification models in the future.  

Therefore, the deep learning models in STARdbi are primarily used for **object detection** and **percentage cover assessment**, with the potential for future expansion into **taxonomic classification**.
