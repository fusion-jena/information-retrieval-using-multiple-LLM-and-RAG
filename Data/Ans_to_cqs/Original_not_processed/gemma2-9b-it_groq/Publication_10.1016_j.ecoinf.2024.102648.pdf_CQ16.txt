Answer:::
The provided text states that the process of "early stopping" is used to determine when training is complete for the bootstrap forest and boosted tree methods. 

Early stopping monitors a validation statistic, in this case, the R2 value, which measures the goodness of fit of the model. If adding more trees, layers, or splits does not improve the validation R2 value, the training process stops. This prevents the model from overfitting to the training data. 

For the artificial neural network (ANN) models, the text mentions that a penalty method is used within the framework of the ANN models to address the inclination of neural networks to overfit data. However, it doesn't specify the exact criteria used for determining when training is complete for ANN models.
