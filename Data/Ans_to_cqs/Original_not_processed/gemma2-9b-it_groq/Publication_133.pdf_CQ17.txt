The provided text mentions using validation data as a partial remedy for overfitting.  It states: "A common (partial) remedy is the use of validation data, which are set aside while training, yet their annotations by the models are monitored. The validation data help to limit the training duration, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting."

However, the text does not specify other regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization.
