Answer:::

The provided text focuses on ecological studies and the use of sound recordings for wildlife detection. It doesn't offer information about deep learning pipelines or strategies for handling randomness within them. 

To answer your query about randomness in deep learning, here are some common strategies:

* **Setting a Random Seed:**  Deep learning models often use random initialization for weights and stochastic optimization algorithms. Setting a random seed ensures that the same "random" values are used each time you run the model, making the results reproducible.

* **Data Augmentation:**  This involves introducing controlled variations into the training data (e.g., rotations, flips, brightness adjustments). This helps the model generalize better and reduces the impact of randomness in the data itself.

* **Dropout:**  A regularization technique where a percentage of neurons are randomly "dropped out" during each training step. This prevents overfitting and introduces some randomness into the model's learning process.

* **Batch Normalization:**  A technique that normalizes the activations of neurons within each mini-batch during training. This helps stabilize the learning process and reduce the impact of internal covariate shift, which can be influenced by randomness.
