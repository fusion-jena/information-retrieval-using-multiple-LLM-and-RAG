Answer:::
The provided text mentions two metrics used to evaluate object-tracking algorithms:

* **Precision plot:** This metric evaluates the accuracy of the center location of the tracked target. It plots the percentage of video frames where the Euclidean distance between the tracked centroid and the manually labeled ground truth is within a specified threshold. 
* **Success plots:**  While not explicitly defined in the text, success plots are a common metric in object tracking. They typically show the percentage of successful tracking over a range of allowed center location errors. 


The text does not mention other general machine learning evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score.
