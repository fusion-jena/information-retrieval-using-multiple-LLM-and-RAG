Answer:::
The provided text describes the model development process but doesn't explicitly mention specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as dataset diversity, cross-validation techniques, or stratified splitting. 

It does state that a k-fold cross-validation (k=5) was used for hyperparameter optimization of the SVM models. This technique helps evaluate model performance on different subsets of the data, providing a measure of how well the model generalizes to unseen data. 


However, information about the dataset itself (e.g., its size, diversity, or how it was split into training, validation, and test sets) is lacking.
