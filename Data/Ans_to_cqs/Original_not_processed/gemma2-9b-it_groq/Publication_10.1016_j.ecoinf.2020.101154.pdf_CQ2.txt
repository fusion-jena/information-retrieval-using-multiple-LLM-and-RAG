Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the hyperparameter tuning and model selection process for Gradient Boosting Regression Trees (GBRT) applied to herring growth data.  

It doesn't specify the exact data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.  

We can infer that the data is likely numerical, as it mentions variables like "salinity" and "SST" (Sea Surface Temperature), and the model is trained to predict "growth". 

However, without further information, we cannot definitively say whether the data is stored in CSV format or other formats.
