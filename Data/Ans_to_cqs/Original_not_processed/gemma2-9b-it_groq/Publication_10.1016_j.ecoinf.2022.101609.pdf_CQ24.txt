Answer:::

The provided text focuses on air quality monitoring and deep learning model development for PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 prediction. It doesn't delve into specific strategies for handling randomness within the deep learning pipeline. 

However, it's common practice in deep learning to address randomness through techniques like:

* **Setting a Random Seed:**  Initializing the random number generator with a specific seed value ensures reproducibility. Different runs with the same seed will produce identical results.

* **Data Shuffling:** Randomly shuffling the training data before each epoch prevents the model from learning patterns based on the data's original order.

* **Dropout:** This regularization technique randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during training. This prevents overfitting and introduces stochasticity into the model.

* **Batch Normalization:** This technique normalizes the activations within each layer, reducing the internal covariate shift and stabilizing training.

For a comprehensive understanding of randomness handling in deep learning, you'd need to consult dedicated resources on deep learning best practices and architectures.
