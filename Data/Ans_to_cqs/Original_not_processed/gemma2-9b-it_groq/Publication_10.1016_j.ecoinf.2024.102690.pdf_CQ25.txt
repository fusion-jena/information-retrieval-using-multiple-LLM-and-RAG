Answer:::
The provided text describes the use of the Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM) algorithm, a type of unsupervised learning neural network, for identifying ecological sources. 

The purpose of the SOFM model in this context is **to cluster research units into different ecosystem service (ES) bundles based on spatial similarities**.  

It achieves this by:

1. **Dimensionality reduction:**  Reducing the complexity of the data representing ecosystem services.
2. **Clustering analysis:** Grouping similar research units together based on their ES characteristics.

This clustering process helps identify areas with distinct ES profiles, which can then be designated as "ecological sources" based on their importance and potential for providing specific services.
