Answer:::
The provided text lists several metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model for semantic segmentation:

* **Intersection over Union (IOU):**  Measures the proportion of intersection to union between the predicted segmentation mask and the true segmentation mask.

* **Mean IOU (MIoU):**  Calculates the IOU for each category separately and then averages the results across all categories.

* **Mean Pixel Accuracy (MPA):**  Assesses the accuracy of pixel-level categorization by measuring the ratio of correctly categorized pixels to the total number of pixels.

* **Accuracy:** Represents the proportion of accurately predicted data points from the whole dataset.

* **Precision:** Ranges between 0 and 1, with values closer to 1 indicating better discrimination between negative samples.

* **Recall:** Also ranges between 0 and 1, with values closer to 1 indicating better identification of positive samples.

* **F1-score:** Ranges from 0 to 1 and reflects the model's robustness, with higher scores indicating better performance.
