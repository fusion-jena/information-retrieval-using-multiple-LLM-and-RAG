Answer:::
The provided text describes the training and testing process of the deep learning model but doesn't mention specific measures taken to ensure its generalizability.  

It details the use of different training datasets (T1 to T4) with varying compositions, including thumbnails of whole fish, parts of fish species, and the environment.  

However, it doesn't discuss techniques like cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the use of a diverse dataset beyond the description of the thumbnail content.
