Answer:::

The provided text does not specify the exact criteria used to split data for deep learning model training (train, test, validation). 

While it mentions the use of deep learning methods in bioacoustic classification, it doesn't delve into the specifics of data preprocessing and splitting techniques. 

To find information about common data splitting criteria in deep learning, you would need to consult resources on machine learning methodologies.
