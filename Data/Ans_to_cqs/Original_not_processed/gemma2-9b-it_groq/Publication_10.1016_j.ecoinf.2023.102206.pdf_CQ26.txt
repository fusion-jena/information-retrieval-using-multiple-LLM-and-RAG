Answer:::

The provided text focuses on transfer learning techniques and doesn't discuss data bias mitigation strategies during the preprocessing stage of a deep learning pipeline. 

However,  common techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing include:

* **Stratified Splitting:** This technique ensures that the training and testing sets have a similar distribution of target variable values across different demographic groups, helping to prevent bias towards certain groups.

* **Oversampling:** This involves duplicating instances from underrepresented groups to balance the dataset and improve model performance on those groups.

* **Undersampling:** This technique removes instances from overrepresented groups to balance the dataset.

* **Diverse Data Collection:**  Actively seeking out and including data from a wide range of sources and demographics can help reduce bias by capturing a more representative view of the real world.
