Answer:::
The provided text does not describe the specific strategy used to monitor model performance during training. 

It does mention that the authors evaluated the performance of initial experiments using the precision measure (P1, P3, P5, P6) and that these initial experiments yielded poor results (less than 50% precision in P6). 

However, it doesn't detail how this evaluation was conducted during the training process itself.
