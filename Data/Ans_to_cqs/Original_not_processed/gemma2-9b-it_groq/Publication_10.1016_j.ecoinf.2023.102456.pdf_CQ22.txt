Answer:::
The text mentions several metrics used to evaluate the deep learning model's performance:

* **False Positive (FP) and False Negative (FN) percentage:** These metrics indicate the proportion of incorrect classifications made by the model for each class.

* **Balanced Accuracy (B. Acc):**  A measure of overall accuracy that considers the performance across all classes, particularly useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets.

* **F-measure Fβ:**  A harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of the model's performance.

* **Cohen’s kappa coefficient (k):**  A statistical measure of inter-rater reliability for categorical items, often used to assess the agreement between two raters.

* **Matthew’s correlation coefficient (MCC):**  A metric that considers both true and false positives and negatives, providing a balanced measure of performance across all classes. 



The text also states that **accuracy** is used for evaluation, although it doesn't provide specific details about its calculation or interpretation in this context.
