Answer:::

The provided text focuses on forest fire modeling and doesn't offer information about data collection methods used in deep learning pipelines.  

To answer your query, here are some common methods for collecting raw data used in deep learning:

* **Surveys:**  Structured questionnaires can gather information from individuals, businesses, or organizations. This data can be used for tasks like sentiment analysis, market research, or understanding user behavior.
* **Sensors:**  Physical devices collect real-world data like temperature, pressure, location, sound, or images. This data is valuable for applications in fields like environmental monitoring, healthcare, and industrial automation.
* **Public Datasets:**  Many organizations and research groups make large collections of data publicly available. These datasets can cover a wide range of topics, from images and text to financial data and scientific measurements.

Deep learning models often rely on massive datasets for training. The choice of data collection method depends on the specific application and the type of data required.
