Answer:::
The text mentions the following metrics for evaluating the deep learning model:

* **Overall Accuracy:**  A general measure of how often the model makes correct predictions.
* **Intersection over Union (IoU):**  A metric used to evaluate the accuracy of object localization or segmentation. 
* **Mean Accuracy (MA):** The average accuracy across all classes in the dataset.
* **Mean IoU (MIoU):** The average IoU across all classes in the dataset. 


The text emphasizes that MA and MIoU are particularly important for handling imbalanced datasets, where some classes might be under-represented.
