Answer:::
The deep learning model described in the text is used for **automatic monitoring of stereotypical behaviors in captive wild animals**. 

More specifically, it performs the following tasks:

1. **Tracking:** Uses a Siamese relation network to automatically track animals in videos and extract their location boxes.
2. **Motion Trajectory Extraction:**  Determines the motion trajectories of animals by analyzing the coordinates of the location boxes' centroids.
3. **Trajectory Segmentation:** Segments the motion trajectories into periodic curves.
4. **Behavior Classification:** Classifies the motion trajectory patterns using cross-correlation functions to identify stereotypical behaviors.

The model aims to help animal management personnel by automatically recording, storing, and displaying motion trajectories, and providing real-time warnings for potentially problematic behaviors.
