Answer:::
The text mentions the following metrics for evaluating the performance of the deep learning model:

* **Correlation coefficient (R):** Measures the linear relationship between the predicted and actual values. 
* **Root mean square error (RMSE):**  A measure of the average magnitude of the errors in the predictions.
* **Mean absolute error (MAE):**  The average of the absolute values of the errors in the predictions.
* **Coefficient of determination (R2):**  Represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable(s).
* **Mean relative error (MRE):**  The average of the relative errors in the predictions.
