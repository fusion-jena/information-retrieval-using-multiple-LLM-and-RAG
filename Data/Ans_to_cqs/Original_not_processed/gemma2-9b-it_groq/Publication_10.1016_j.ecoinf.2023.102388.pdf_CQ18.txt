Answer:::
The provided text describes a setup for evaluating the robustness of a machine learning model against privacy attacks. It outlines the different datasets used (training, attack, validation, and test) but doesn't explicitly mention a specific strategy for monitoring model performance *during* training. 

The text focuses on:

* **Training the target model:** Using the training dataset (Dtrain) and a learning algorithm (A).
* **Training the attack model:** Using a separate attack dataset (DS) to mimic the target model's behavior.
* **Evaluating both models:** Using validation and test sets to assess performance and vulnerability to attacks.


Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot determine the specific strategy used to monitor model performance during training.
