Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning for vegetation studies and doesn't delve into specific strategies for handling randomness within the deep learning pipeline. 

However, it's common knowledge in the field of deep learning that randomness is inherent in several stages:

* **Data Shuffling:**  Training data is often shuffled randomly before each epoch to prevent the model from learning patterns specific to a particular data order.
* **Weight Initialization:** Initial values for the weights in neural networks are often assigned randomly from a distribution (e.g., normal distribution).
* **Activation Functions:** Some activation functions, like dropout, introduce randomness during training to prevent overfitting.
* **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):** This optimization algorithm uses a random subset (mini-batch) of the training data to calculate the gradient at each step.

To mitigate the impact of this randomness and ensure reproducibility, practitioners commonly use:

* **Random Seed Setting:**  A fixed random seed value is set at the beginning of the training process. This ensures that the same random numbers are generated for shuffling, weight initialization, and other random operations, leading to consistent results across multiple runs.
