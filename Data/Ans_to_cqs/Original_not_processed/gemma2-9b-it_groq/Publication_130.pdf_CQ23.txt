Answer:::
The text mentions several strategies used to improve the generalizability of the deep learning model:

* **Diverse Dataset:**  While the text doesn't explicitly use the term "diverse dataset," it highlights the importance of capturing variation in recording conditions (light intensity, shadow, recording quality) during training. This suggests an effort was made to include images with different environmental factors.

* **Large Batch Size:** The text states that a small batch size (eight pictures per training iteration) was used because it has been shown to improve models' generalization capability.

* **Data Augmentation:**  The text mentions that oversampling was used for one bird with fewer images (1,197 instead of 1,600). This technique artificially increases the size of the training dataset by creating duplicates of existing images, potentially helping the model generalize better.

* **Retraining:** The text describes a process of retraining the model with the lowest loss achieved during training. This iterative process allows the model to continuously learn and adapt.


The text does not mention cross-validation or stratified splitting, which are other common techniques for improving model generalizability.
