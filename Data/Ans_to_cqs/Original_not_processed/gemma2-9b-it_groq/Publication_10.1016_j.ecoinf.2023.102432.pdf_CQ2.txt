Answer:::
Based on the provided text, the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are:

* **Image:** The text discusses "remote sensing imagery" and "pixels' spectral data," indicating the use of image data. 
* **CSV:** While not explicitly stated, the mention of "metadata records" and "training locations" suggests the use of CSV or similar tabular data formats for storing associated information. 


It's important to note that the text focuses on machine learning techniques (Random Forest, MTMI-SMF) rather than deep learning specifically.
