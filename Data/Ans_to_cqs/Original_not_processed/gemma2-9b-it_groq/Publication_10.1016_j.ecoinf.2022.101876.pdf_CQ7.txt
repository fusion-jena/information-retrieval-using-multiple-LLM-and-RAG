Answer:::
The provided text describes the general process of training a deep learning model for wildlife detection in camera trap images but doesn't specify the exact criteria used to split the data into training, testing, and validation sets. 

Typically, data is split into these sets using a percentage-based approach:

* **Training set:** The largest portion of the data (e.g., 70-80%) is used to train the model. 
* **Validation set:** A smaller portion (e.g., 10-15%) is used to evaluate the model's performance during training and fine-tune its hyperparameters.
* **Test set:** The remaining portion (e.g., 10-15%) is held out until the end of training and used to provide a final, unbiased evaluation of the model's performance on unseen data. 

The specific percentages may vary depending on the size of the dataset and the complexity of the task.
