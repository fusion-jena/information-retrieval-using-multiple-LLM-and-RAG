Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the application of machine learning models, particularly recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, in environmental science, specifically for forecasting El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. 

While the text mentions various machine learning models, it doesn't explicitly state the purpose of deep learning models in general.  

However, based on the context and general knowledge of deep learning, we can infer that these models are likely used for tasks like:

* **Classification:** Categorizing ENSO events (e.g., El Niño, La Niña, neutral).
* **Forecasting:** Predicting the intensity and duration of future ENSO events.
* **Pattern Recognition:** Identifying patterns in climate data that are associated with ENSO. 


It's important to note that the text primarily focuses on the specific application of these models for ENSO forecasting and doesn't provide a comprehensive overview of all the purposes of deep learning models.
