Answer:::
The text states that the performance of the models is evaluated using accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score. 

These metrics are defined as follows:

* **Accuracy:**  (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
* **Recall:** TP / (TP + FN)
* **Precision:** TP / (TP + FP)
* **F1-score:** 2 * (TP) / (2 * TP + FP + FN) 

Where TP, TN, FP, and FN represent the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, respectively.
