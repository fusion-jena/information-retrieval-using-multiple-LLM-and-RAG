Answer:::
The provided text describes the splitting of data for training and testing machine learning models, not deep learning models specifically. 

It states that the dataset was divided into a "training dataset" containing 60 randomly selected records and a "testing dataset" containing the remaining 29 records.  

The text doesn't mention a separate validation set, which is a common practice in deep learning.
