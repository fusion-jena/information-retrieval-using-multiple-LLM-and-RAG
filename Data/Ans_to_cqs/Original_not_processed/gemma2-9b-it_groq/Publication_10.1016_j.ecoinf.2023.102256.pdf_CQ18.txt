Answer:::
The provided text describes the training and testing process but doesn't explicitly state the strategy used to monitor model performance *during* training. 

It does mention:

* **Training, validation, and testing datasets:** The data was split into these sets.
* **Epochs, batch size, and learning rate:** These are hyperparameters used in the training process.
* **Confusion matrix, True Positives, False Positives, True Negatives, and False Negatives:** These metrics were recorded *after* training to evaluate performance on the testing dataset.

However, there's no information about techniques used to track performance *within* each epoch, such as:

* **Loss function:**  A function that measures the difference between the model's predictions and the actual values.
* **Validation accuracy:** Evaluating the model's performance on the validation set after each epoch.
* **Early stopping:**  Stopping training if the validation performance plateaus or starts to decrease. 


Therefore, based on the given text, we cannot determine the specific strategy used to monitor model performance during training.
