Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the categorization of native and alien species for a study and doesn't offer information about preprocessing steps for deep learning models. 

To answer your query about preprocessing steps for deep learning models, here are some common techniques:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., between 0 and 1) can improve model performance.

* **Standardization:**  Transforming data to have zero mean and unit variance.

* **Encoding Categorical Features:** Converting categorical variables into numerical representations that models can understand (e.g., one-hot encoding, label encoding).
* **Feature Selection/Engineering:** Identifying the most relevant features and creating new features that may improve model accuracy.
