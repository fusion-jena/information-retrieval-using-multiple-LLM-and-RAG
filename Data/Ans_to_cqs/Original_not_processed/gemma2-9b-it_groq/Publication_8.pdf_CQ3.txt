The provided text describes the use of deep learning for detecting and annotating plant organs from digitized herbarium scans.  

It mentions using the Faster R-CNN model, which is a popular object detection algorithm.  Faster R-CNN typically uses **region proposal networks (RPNs)** to generate candidate bounding boxes for objects in an image. These bounding boxes are then refined and classified by a second network. 

Therefore, the data annotation technique used in this deep learning pipeline is likely **bounding box annotation**.
