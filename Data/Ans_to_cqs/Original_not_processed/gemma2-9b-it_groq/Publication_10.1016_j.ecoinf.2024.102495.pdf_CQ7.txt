Answer:::
The provided text does not specify the exact criteria used to split the data for training, testing, and validation the deep learning model. 


It only mentions that the model was evaluated using "stratified 10-fold cross-validation".  Stratified k-fold cross-validation is a technique where the original dataset is divided into k subsets (folds). The model is then trained k times, each time using k-1 folds for training and the remaining fold for validation.  Stratification ensures that each fold maintains the same distribution of classes as the original dataset.
