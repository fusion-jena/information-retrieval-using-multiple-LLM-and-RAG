Answer:::
The provided text describes a method of optimizing hyperparameters called "controlling variables."  

This involves keeping other variables constant and systematically changing one parameter at a time to observe its effect on the validation data forecast results. The parameter that yields the best results is then selected as the optimal value for that specific hyperparameter. 

The text does not mention using grid search or random search techniques for hyperparameter optimization.
