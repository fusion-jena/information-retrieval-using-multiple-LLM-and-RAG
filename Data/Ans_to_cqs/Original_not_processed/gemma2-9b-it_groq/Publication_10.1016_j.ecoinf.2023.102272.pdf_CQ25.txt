Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the model selection process and performance evaluation of different deep learning architectures.  

While it mentions the use of Deep Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (DeepConvLSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, it doesn't explicitly state the specific purpose of the deep learning model. 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot determine the exact purpose of the deep learning model.
