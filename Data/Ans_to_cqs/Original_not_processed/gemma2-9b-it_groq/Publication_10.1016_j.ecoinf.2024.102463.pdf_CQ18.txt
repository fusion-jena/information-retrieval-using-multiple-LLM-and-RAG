Answer:::
The provided text describes a model selection and optimization process rather than a strategy for monitoring model performance during training. 

The text outlines the following steps:

1. **Hyperparameter Search:**  Using techniques like partial training and successive halving to identify the best model configuration (hyperparameters).
2. **Data Standardization:**  Standardizing the data using parameters calculated on a chosen training base.
3. **Hyperband Algorithm:** Applying the Hyperband algorithm to determine the optimal hyperparameters and model parameters for each dataset.
4. **Performance Metrics:** Evaluating model performance using MAE (mean absolute error) and NSE (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency) scores.

The focus is on finding the best-performing model configuration, not on continuously monitoring performance during the training process itself.
