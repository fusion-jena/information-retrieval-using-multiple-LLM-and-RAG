Answer:::

The provided text focuses on machine learning models for species distribution, not deep learning. It doesn't describe preprocessing steps specific to deep learning. 

However, common preprocessing steps for many machine learning models, which could also be relevant for deep learning, include:

* **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.
* **Feature Scaling:**  Transforming features to a similar scale to prevent features with larger magnitudes from dominating the learning process. This can involve methods like standardization (z-score normalization) or min-max scaling.
* **Encoding Categorical Variables:** Converting categorical features (e.g., species names, land cover types) into numerical representations that the model can understand. Techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding are commonly used. 


Let me know if you have other questions about machine learning or species distribution modeling.
