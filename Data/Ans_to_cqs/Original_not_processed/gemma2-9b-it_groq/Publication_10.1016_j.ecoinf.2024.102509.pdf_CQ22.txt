Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the performance evaluation of AGBpred prediction models using various regression methods, including artificial neural networks (ANN).  

While it mentions metrics like Adjusted R2, MSE (Mean squared error), AIC (Akaike Information Criterion), and BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion), it doesn't explicitly list metrics commonly used for deep learning models such as accuracy, precision, or recall.
