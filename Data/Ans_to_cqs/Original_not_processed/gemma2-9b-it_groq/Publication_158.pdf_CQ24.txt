Answer: The text mentions that weight initialization and random selection for batch training can lead to variability in the results for CNNs. To address this randomness, an ensemble of three models is generated.  Each model in the ensemble uses a different strategy for handling randomness:

* **Max pooling:** Two models in the ensemble utilize max pooling.
* **Average pooling:** One model in the ensemble uses average pooling. 

The final output layer's average from all three models is then taken to reduce the impact of individual model variations caused by randomness.
