Answer:::
The deep learning pipeline described in the text utilizes a combination of models. 

Specifically, it employs:

* **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network):**  Used as a feature extractor.
* **Swin Transformer:**  A hierarchical transformer model for processing the extracted features.
* **Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN):** Incorporated to enhance the training process. 


Let me know if you have any other questions about this pipeline!
