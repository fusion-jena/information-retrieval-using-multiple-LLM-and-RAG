Answer:::
The provided text mentions that 80% of the data was used for training and 20% for testing the model to improve its generalization performance.  It also describes a data augmentation approach called SCAM-Herb that uses a CNN model and a Bayesian optimizer to select the best augmentation policies. 

However, the text does not explicitly state whether other measures like diverse dataset creation, cross-validation, or stratified splitting were used to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
