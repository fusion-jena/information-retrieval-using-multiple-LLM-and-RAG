Answer:::
The provided text does not specify the exact criteria used to split the data for training, testing, and validation.  It only mentions the sizes of the different data sets:

* **Training data:** 271,909, 267,301, 262,693, 258,085, 253,477, or 248,869 samples depending on the observation time.
* **Validation data:** 90,639, 89,103, 87,567, 86,031, 84,495, or 82,959 samples depending on the observation time.
* **Test data:** 90,636, 89,100, 87,564, 86,028, 84,492, or 82,956 samples depending on the observation time. 


It's common to split data into these sets using a ratio like 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. However, the specific split used in this case is not provided.
