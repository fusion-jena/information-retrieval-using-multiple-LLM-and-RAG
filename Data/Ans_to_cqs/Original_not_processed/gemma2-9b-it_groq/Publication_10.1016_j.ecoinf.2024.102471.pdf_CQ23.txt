Answer:::
The provided text doesn't specify the exact measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model for bird species classification. 

While it mentions the use of a large dataset of 30 bird species and achieving high accuracy (89.61% and 91.49%), it doesn't detail techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting.  

The text focuses on describing the model's architecture (wav2vec) and its training process, including pre-training and fine-tuning phases.
