Answer:::

The provided text focuses on addressing bias in machine learning models when dealing with clustered data, particularly in the context of soil science and geospatial analysis. It discusses techniques like covariance-weighted bagging but doesn't delve into data augmentation methods commonly used in deep learning pipelines. 

Therefore, I cannot answer your query about specific data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, or scaling from the given context.
