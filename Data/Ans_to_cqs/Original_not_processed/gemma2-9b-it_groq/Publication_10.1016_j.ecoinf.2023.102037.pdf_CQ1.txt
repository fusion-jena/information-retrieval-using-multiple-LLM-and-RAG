Answer: 

The provided text mentions the use of an "automatic imaging trap" to collect the images in the "Pest24" dataset.  It also describes data being acquired by "multiple wireless imaging devices installed in greenhouses." 

Therefore, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline described in the text include:

* **Automatic imaging traps:** These devices capture images of pests as they are attracted to the trap.
* **Wireless imaging devices:** These devices are likely cameras installed in greenhouses to monitor pest populations.
