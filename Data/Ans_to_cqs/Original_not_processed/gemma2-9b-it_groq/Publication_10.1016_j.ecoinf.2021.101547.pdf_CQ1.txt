Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning in analyzing remotely sensed imagery for wildlife population assessment.  

While it mentions using high-resolution satellite imagery and spectral reflectance data, it doesn't explicitly detail the methods used for *collecting* the raw data. 

Based on the context, we can infer that:

* **Satellite imagery** is a primary data source, likely obtained through publicly available satellite datasets or commercial providers.
* **Sensors** might be involved in ground-truthing or collecting ancillary data related to the wildlife populations.

The text doesn't mention surveys or other data collection methods.
