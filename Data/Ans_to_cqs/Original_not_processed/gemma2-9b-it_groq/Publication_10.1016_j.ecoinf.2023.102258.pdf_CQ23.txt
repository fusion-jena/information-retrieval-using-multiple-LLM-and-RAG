Answer:::
The provided text describes the systems submitted to a public challenge for acoustic event detection but doesn't explicitly detail the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning models during development. 

The text mentions that the challenge aimed to generalize across a range of loosely-related datasets/tasks, suggesting a focus on evaluating model robustness. It also highlights the use of diverse datasets in the challenge itself. However, it doesn't specify if techniques like cross-validation, stratified splitting, or other data augmentation methods were employed during the training process to enhance the models' generalizability.
