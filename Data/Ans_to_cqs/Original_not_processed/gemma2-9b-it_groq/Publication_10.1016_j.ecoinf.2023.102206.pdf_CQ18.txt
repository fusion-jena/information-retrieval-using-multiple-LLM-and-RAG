Answer:::
The provided text does not describe the specific strategy used to monitor model performance during training. 

It focuses on:

*  The problem of overconfidence in transfer learning (TL) models when dealing with data distribution differences.
*  The proposed solution, Intuitionistic Fuzzy Transfer Learning (IFTL), which aims to mitigate overconfidence and improve learning.
*  Comparisons of IFTL with other TL approaches (ELM, GRNN, and SVR) in terms of performance and execution time.


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what strategy was used to monitor model performance during training.
