Answer:::
The provided text describes an iterative process for hyperparameter optimization rather than specifying a particular method like grid search or random search. 

It states that:

*  A small dimensional space of initial hyperparameters was defined and explored.
* One hyperparameter was modified iteratively, following the direction that led to the best performance.

This suggests a manual or guided search approach where the authors adjust hyperparameters one at a time, observing the impact on model performance and refining the settings accordingly.
