The provided text lists the following metrics to evaluate the deep learning model's performance:

* **Accuracy:**  A measure of how often the model makes correct predictions.
* **Precision:**  The proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all instances predicted as positive.
* **Recall:** The proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all actual positive instances.
* **F-Score:** A harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of both.
* **Loss:** A measure of the difference between the model's predictions and the actual values.
