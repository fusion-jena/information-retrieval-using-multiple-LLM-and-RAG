Answer:::
The provided text describes the Pl@ntNet project and its use of a deep learning model for species identification.  It mentions that the model is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and fine-tuned on Pl@ntNet data. 

However, the text does not specify the exact measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model, such as:

* **Diversity of the training dataset:** While it states Pl@ntNet covers 30,261 species illustrated by over 2.9 million images, it doesn't detail the geographic or environmental diversity within the dataset.
* **Cross-validation techniques:** The text doesn't mention any specific cross-validation strategies used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
* **Stratified splitting:**  There's no information about whether the dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets using stratified sampling to maintain class proportions. 


Therefore, based on the provided information, we cannot definitively say what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the Pl@ntNet deep learning model.
