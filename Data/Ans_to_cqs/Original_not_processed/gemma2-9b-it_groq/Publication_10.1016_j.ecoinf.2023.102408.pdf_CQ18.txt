Answer:::
The provided text describes the model evaluation strategy, not the monitoring strategy during training. 

The text states that a stratified sampling method was used to split the data into 70% for training and 30% for validation.  It also mentions the use of three error statistics (R2, MAE, and RMSE) to compare the accuracies of the models. 

However, it does not specify how model performance was monitored *during* the training process.
