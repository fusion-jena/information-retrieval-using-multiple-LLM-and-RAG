Answer:::
The provided text describes the experimental setup and results but doesn't explicitly mention specific techniques used to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. 

Here's what we can infer:

* **Diverse Dataset:** The text states that the images in both the training and test sets varied in poses and other characteristics like contrast and brightness. This suggests an attempt to include diversity in the dataset.
* **Cross-Validation/Stratified Splitting:** The text doesn't mention these techniques directly. 

Without further information, we cannot definitively say whether cross-validation or stratified splitting was used.
