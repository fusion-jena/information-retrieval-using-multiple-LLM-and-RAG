Answer:::
The provided text focuses on evaluating feature representations learned by an autoencoder, not the performance of a complete deep learning model. 

The evaluation metrics used are:

* **bcubed precision:**  A metric for clustering performance.
* **bcubed recall:** Another metric for clustering performance.
* **bcubed Fscore:**  A harmonic mean of precision and recall, also used for clustering performance.
* **Purity:**  A metric that measures the proportion of correctly classified instances within each cluster.
