Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the architecture and hyperparameter optimization of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and a Random Forest (RF) model, and doesn't delve into specific preprocessing steps for deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps before training a deep learning model generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values (e.g., imputation or removal), identifying and removing outliers, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

* **Feature Scaling:**  Transforming features to a similar scale (e.g., standardization or normalization) to prevent features with larger magnitudes from dominating the learning process.

* **Encoding Categorical Features:** Converting categorical variables into numerical representations that the model can understand (e.g., one-hot encoding, label encoding).

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a specific range, often between 0 and 1, to improve model convergence.

* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones to potentially enhance the model's ability to learn patterns in the data. 


Keep in mind that the specific preprocessing steps will depend on the nature of the dataset and the chosen deep learning model.
