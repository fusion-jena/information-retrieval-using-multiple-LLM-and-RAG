Answer:::
The provided text does not specify the exact criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (train, test, validation). 

It does mention that:

*  The models were trained for a set number of epochs (40 for SEIO PBW vocalization and 25 for blue whale Dcall) with early stopping to prevent overfitting.
*  An undersampling method was used for the blue whale Dcall dataset due to a low number of positive sections in the training set. 

However, it doesn't describe how the data was initially partitioned into training, validation, and test sets.
