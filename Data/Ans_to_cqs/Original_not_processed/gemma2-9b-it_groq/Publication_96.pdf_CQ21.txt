The provided text describes the training process and data used for a deep neural network (DNN) algorithm to map burned areas.  

However, it doesn't specify the post-processing steps taken after model training, such as:

* **Saliency maps:** These highlight the input features the model focuses on for making a prediction.
* **Metrics calculation:**  Various metrics (precision, recall, F1-score, etc.) are used to evaluate the model's performance.
* **Confusion matrix:** This visualizes the model's performance by showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. 


The text does mention an accuracy assessment using validation points and a confusion matrix based on comparing the model's output to a reference dataset (MODIS Burned Area MCD64A1).
