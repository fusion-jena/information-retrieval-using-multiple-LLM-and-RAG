The provided text focuses on deep learning applications in computer vision, particularly object detection, and doesn't delve into strategies for handling randomness within the deep learning pipeline.  

To answer your query about handling randomness in deep learning (e.g., random seed value), here are some common strategies:

* **Setting a Fixed Random Seed:**  Most deep learning libraries allow you to specify a random seed. Setting this seed to a fixed value ensures that the random number generator produces the same sequence of "random" numbers each time you run your code. This reproducibility is crucial for experiments and comparisons.

* **Deterministic Operations:**  Where possible, use deterministic operations within your deep learning models and training process. This means avoiding operations that inherently introduce randomness (like dropout) during inference (making predictions on new data).

* **Careful Data Shuffling:**  When splitting data into training, validation, and test sets, shuffle the data randomly. However, ensure you shuffle in the same way each time you train to maintain consistency.

* **Weight Initialization:**  Some weight initialization techniques, like Xavier or He initialization, aim to reduce randomness in the initial weights of your neural network, leading to more stable training.
