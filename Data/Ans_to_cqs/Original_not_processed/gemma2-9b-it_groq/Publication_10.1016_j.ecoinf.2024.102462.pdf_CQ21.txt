Answer:::
The provided text describes the training process of a DL model for classifying patches of vegetation but doesn't detail specific post-processing steps after training. 

It does mention:

* **Confusion matrices:** Used to evaluate the performance of the model, both for human observers and the trained network. These matrices show the counts of correct and incorrect classifications for each class.
* **Testing data set:** An independent dataset used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

While the text doesn't explicitly list "Saliency maps" or "Metrics calculation," these are common post-processing steps in DL model evaluation. 

Saliency maps highlight the regions of an input image that are most influential in the model's decision, providing insights into the model's reasoning. Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are commonly used to quantify the model's performance.
