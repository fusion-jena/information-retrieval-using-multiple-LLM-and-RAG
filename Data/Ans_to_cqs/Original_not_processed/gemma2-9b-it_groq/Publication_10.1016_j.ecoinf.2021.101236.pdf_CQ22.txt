The text states that the system was evaluated using sample-wise (mAP) and class-wise mean average precision (cmAP) metrics.  

In addition to these, the authors also used several complementary metrics like top-1 accuracy, F0.5 score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC) to assess the performance of the model.
