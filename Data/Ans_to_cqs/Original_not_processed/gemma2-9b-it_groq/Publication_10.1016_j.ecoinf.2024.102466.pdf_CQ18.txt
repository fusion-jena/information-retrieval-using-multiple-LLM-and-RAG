Answer:::
The provided text describes the performance of various object detection models on a bird species dataset but doesn't specify the exact strategy used to monitor model performance during training. 

We can infer that **mAP (mean Average Precision)** was likely used as a metric to evaluate the models' performance. The text mentions "mAP scores" and how different models achieved varying mAP scores at different training stages.
