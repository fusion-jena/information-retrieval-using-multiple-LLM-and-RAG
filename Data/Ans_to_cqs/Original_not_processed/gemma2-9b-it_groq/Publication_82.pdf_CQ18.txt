Answer:::
To monitor model performance, the researchers used a technique called train-test set splits. They divided the PlantVillage dataset into various ratios for training and testing (80-20, 60-40, 50-50, 40-60, and 20-80).  

For each of these splits, they trained and evaluated their models (AlexNet and GoogLeNet) using both transfer learning and training from scratch. This allowed them to assess how well the models generalized to unseen data and to identify any potential overfitting issues. 

They also tracked the validation loss and training loss during each experiment. The absence of divergence between these two metrics further indicated that overfitting was not a significant concern.
