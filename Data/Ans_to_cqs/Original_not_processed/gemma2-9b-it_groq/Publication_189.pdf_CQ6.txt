Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the training process of a Mask R-CNN model and doesn't specify the preprocessing steps involved before training.  

To answer your question generally, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models include:

* **Normalization:** Scaling pixel values to a specific range (e.g., 0 to 1) to improve training stability and speed.
* **Scaling:**  Adjusting the range of feature values to prevent features with larger magnitudes from dominating the learning process.
* **Cleaning:** Removing noise, outliers, or irrelevant information from the data. This can involve techniques like removing blank images, cropping, or filling in missing values.
* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training dataset by applying transformations like rotation, flipping, cropping, and color adjustments. This helps the model generalize better to unseen data.
