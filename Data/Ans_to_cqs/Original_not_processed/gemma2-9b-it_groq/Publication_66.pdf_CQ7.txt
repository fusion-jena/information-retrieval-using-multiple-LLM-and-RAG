Answer:::
The provided text describes a leave-one-out cross-validation technique used for model evaluation.  

In this method, for each bird in the dataset, the model is trained on all birds except that single bird, and then validated on the left-out bird. This process is repeated for every bird in the dataset. 

The text doesn't explicitly state how the data is split for initial training and testing of the models.
