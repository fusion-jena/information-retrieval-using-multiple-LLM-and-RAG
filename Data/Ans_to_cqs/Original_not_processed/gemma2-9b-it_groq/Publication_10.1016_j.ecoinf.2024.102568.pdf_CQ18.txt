Answer:::
The provided text describes the model performance evaluation metrics (RMSE, MAE, MRE, accuracy) but doesn't explicitly state the strategy used to monitor performance *during* training. 

We can infer some information:

* **Loss Function:** The text mentions using Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function. This is a common practice for training models like LSTM, and its value decreases as the model learns better. Monitoring MSE during training would indicate if the model is improving.
* **Dropout Layer:** The text states a dropout layer is used to prevent overfitting. Dropout randomly "drops out" neurons during training, which can help the model generalize better. While not a direct performance metric, dropout is a technique used to manage performance during training.

However, without further details, we cannot definitively say what specific strategies were used to monitor model performance *during* training (e.g., plotting loss curves, validation set performance checks, early stopping).
