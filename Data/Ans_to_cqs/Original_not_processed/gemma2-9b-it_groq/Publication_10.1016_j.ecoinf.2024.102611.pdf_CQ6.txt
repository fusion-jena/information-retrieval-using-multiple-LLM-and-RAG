Answer:::
The provided text mentions that the images used in the study were subjected to "resize, segmentation, and augmentation" preprocessing. 

It also states that the input image is subjected to a sequence of operations and length in both the X and Y axes, followed by a max-pooling layer, batch normalization layer, and ReLU activation. 

While these steps are part of the image processing pipeline, they are not explicitly described as preprocessing steps *before* training the deep learning model. 

The text does not provide details on other common preprocessing steps like normalization or scaling.
