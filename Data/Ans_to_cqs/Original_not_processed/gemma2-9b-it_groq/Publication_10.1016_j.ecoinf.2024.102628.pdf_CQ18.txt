Answer:::
The provided text describes the model evaluation strategy, not the monitoring strategy during training. 

The text states that a  "broader and more conservative testing strategy" was adopted, excluding three transects (~17% of the data) for testing in each iteration.  It also mentions cross-validation and a cumulative evaluation using the coefficient of determination (R2) to assess performance across all transects.

However, it does not specify how the model's performance was monitored *during* the training process.
