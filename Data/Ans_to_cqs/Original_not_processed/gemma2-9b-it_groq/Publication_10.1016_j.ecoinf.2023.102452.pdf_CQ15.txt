Answer:::
Based on the provided context, I can't definitively list all optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipelines of the cited studies. 

While the papers discuss deep learning models (LSTM, CNN, ConvLSTM) and their applications in areas like streamflow forecasting and wind power prediction, they don't explicitly detail the specific optimization algorithms employed during training. 

Common optimization techniques used in deep learning include:

* **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)** and its variants (e.g., momentum SGD, Nesterov accelerated SGD)
* **Adam**
* **RMSprop**
* **Adagrad**

To determine the precise optimization techniques used in each study, you would need to examine the full text of the respective research papers.
