Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in environmental studies, particularly for tasks like predicting cyanobacterial blooms and classifying algal species.  

While it mentions CNN architectures and their advantages, it doesn't delve into the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for these tasks. 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what data annotation techniques are used.
