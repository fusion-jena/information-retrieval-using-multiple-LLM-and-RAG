Answer: 

Several techniques are used to address data bias during the preprocessing stage of a deep learning pipeline. These techniques aim to create a more balanced and representative dataset, mitigating the potential for biased model outcomes. 

Here are some common methods:

* **Stratified Splitting:** This technique ensures that the training, validation, and test sets proportionally reflect the distribution of target classes in the original dataset. This helps prevent scenarios where one class is overrepresented in the training data, leading to biased model performance.

* **Oversampling:** This method involves duplicating instances from underrepresented classes to balance the dataset. Techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) can generate synthetic samples for minority classes, further improving representation.

* **Undersampling:** This approach reduces the number of instances from overrepresented classes to match the size of the underrepresented classes. While it can simplify the dataset, it may lead to information loss from the majority class.

* **Diverse Data Collection:**  This proactive approach focuses on gathering data from a wider range of sources and demographics to ensure the dataset encompasses the diversity of the real world. This helps minimize biases introduced by limited or skewed data collection practices.

The choice of technique depends on the specific dataset and the nature of the bias present.
