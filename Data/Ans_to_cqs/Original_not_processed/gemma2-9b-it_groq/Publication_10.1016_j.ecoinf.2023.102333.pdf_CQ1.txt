Answer:::
The provided text focuses on a study comparing hyperparameter optimization approaches for deep learning in land cover/land use classification. It doesn't delve into the specific methods used for collecting raw data. 

However, based on the keywords and the article's subject matter, we can infer that the raw data likely comes from:

* **Remote sensing:** The article mentions "remote sensing," "Google Earth Engine," and studies using Sentinel-1 SAR data. This suggests satellite imagery and other remotely sensed data are likely sources.
* **Public datasets:**  The use of Google Earth Engine, a platform with access to vast Earth observation datasets, points to the use of publicly available data.


Without further information from the full article or additional context, it's impossible to say definitively what other data collection methods might be involved.
