Answer:::
The text states that the CNN models were assessed using four performance metrics:

* **Test loss:**  This measures the overall error of the model on the test data.
* **Mean squared error (MSE):**  A measure of the average squared difference between the model's predictions and the actual values.
* **Mean average percentage error (MAPE):**  The average percentage difference between the model's predictions and the actual values.
* **Accuracy (%):**  The percentage of correct predictions made by the model.
