Answer:::
The provided text describes the process of training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for classifying zebrafish and rat movements in a T-maze.  

It mentions that the model's performance was evaluated using metrics like precision, recall, F-measure, and accuracy.  

However, it doesn't explicitly state the specific strategy used to monitor the model's performance *during* training. 

The text does say that hyperparameters like the regularization parameter ('C') and kernel type were calibrated using a combination of grid search and cross-validation. This suggests that the performance on a validation set was likely used to guide the hyperparameter tuning process.
