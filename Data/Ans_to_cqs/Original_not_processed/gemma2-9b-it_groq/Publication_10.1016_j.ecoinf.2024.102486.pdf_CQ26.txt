Answer:::

The provided text focuses on resampling techniques in particle filtering and doesn't discuss data bias mitigation in deep learning preprocessing. 

However, common techniques used to address data bias during deep learning preprocessing include:

* **Stratified Splitting:** Dividing the data into training, validation, and test sets while preserving the class distribution of the original dataset. This helps ensure that each subset represents the data's overall characteristics.

* **Oversampling:** Increasing the representation of minority classes by duplicating existing samples or generating synthetic samples. This can balance the dataset and prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.

* **Undersampling:** Reducing the number of samples in the majority class to match the size of the minority class. This can help prevent overfitting to the majority class and improve the model's performance on minority classes.

* **Diverse Data Collection:**  Actively seeking out and incorporating data from various sources and representing different demographics, viewpoints, and backgrounds. This helps create a more comprehensive and representative dataset, reducing the likelihood of bias.
