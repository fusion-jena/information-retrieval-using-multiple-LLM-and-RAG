The text mentions data resampling as a technique used to address imbalanced data. 

Specifically, it states: "To compare balanced data performance with imbalanced data, we used data resampling in training a new model. The new model covered six classes, where the classes are evenly distributed."

While the text doesn't explicitly list "stratified splitting," "oversampling," or "undersampling," these are common types of data resampling techniques used to balance datasets. 

The text also highlights the use of a small dataset without data augmentation.  Data augmentation techniques, which artificially increase the size and diversity of a dataset, could also be used to mitigate data bias.
