Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model described in the text is **classification**. 

The text states that the model is used for "tree species identification" and that a "top classifier softmax layer" is added for predicting the class of an input image. This clearly indicates a classification task where the model aims to assign a label (tree species) to each input image.
