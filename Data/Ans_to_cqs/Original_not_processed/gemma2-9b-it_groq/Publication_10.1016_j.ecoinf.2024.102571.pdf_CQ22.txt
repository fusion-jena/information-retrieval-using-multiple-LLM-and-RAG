Answer:::
The provided text mentions the R-squared value (R2) as a metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model.  

R-squared (R2) is a statistical measure that indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable (GHGdwts) that is explained by the independent variables (population size and GDP) used in the model. 

An R2 value of 1 indicates a perfect fit, meaning the model explains all the variance in the dependent variable.  Higher R2 values generally indicate better model performance.
