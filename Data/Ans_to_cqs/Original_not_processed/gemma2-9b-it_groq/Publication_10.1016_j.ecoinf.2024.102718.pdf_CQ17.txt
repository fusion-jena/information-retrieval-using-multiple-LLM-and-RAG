Answer:::
The provided text does not explicitly mention the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.  While it discusses callbacks like ReduceLROnPlateau, ModelCheckpoint, and EarlyStopping, these are primarily used for learning rate adjustment, model saving, and stopping training based on performance, not directly for regularization. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what regularization methods (like dropout or L2 regularization) are employed.
