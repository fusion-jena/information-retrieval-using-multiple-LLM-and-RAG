Answer:::

While the provided text focuses on the application of deep learning models in vegetation studies, it doesn't explicitly detail the methods used for collecting raw data. 

However, based on the context and common practices in remote sensing and ecological research, we can infer some likely data sources:

* **Satellite Imagery:**  Several papers mention using data from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and Landsat satellites. These satellites capture images of the Earth's surface, including vegetation, providing information about reflectance, which can be used to estimate vegetation indices like NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index).
* **Ground-Based Sensors:**  Researchers might use sensors deployed on the ground to collect data on vegetation characteristics like height, biomass, and species composition. 
* **Public Datasets:**  The text refers to the use of "synthetic NDVI time series blended from Landsat and MODIS data," suggesting the utilization of publicly available datasets.

It's important to note that this is an educated guess based on the context.  The specific data collection methods used in each study would need to be examined directly within the referenced papers.
