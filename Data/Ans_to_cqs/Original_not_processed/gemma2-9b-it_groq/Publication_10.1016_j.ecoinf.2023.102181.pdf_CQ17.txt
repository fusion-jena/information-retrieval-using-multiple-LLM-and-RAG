Answer:::
The provided text focuses on minimizing bias in machine learning models, particularly those dealing with clustered data. It doesn't discuss regularization methods used in deep learning to prevent overfitting. 

To answer your query about regularization methods in deep learning, here are some common techniques:

* **Dropout:** Randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during each training step. This prevents the model from relying too heavily on any single neuron and encourages the learning of more robust features.

* **L2 Regularization (Weight Decay):** Adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. This discourages the weights from becoming too large, effectively preventing overfitting.

* **L1 Regularization (Lasso):** Similar to L2 regularization, but uses the absolute value of the weights. This can lead to some weights being driven to exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection.
