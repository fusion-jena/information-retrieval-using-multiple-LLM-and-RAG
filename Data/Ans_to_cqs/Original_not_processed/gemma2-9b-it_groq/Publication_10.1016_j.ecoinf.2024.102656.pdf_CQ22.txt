Answer:::
The provided text focuses on evaluating the performance of five machine learning models (GLM, MaxEnt, RF, GBM, and MARS) rather than a deep learning model. 

The text states that the performance of these models was assessed using two metrics:

* **Area under the curve (AUC):** AUC values exceeding 0.9 were considered excellent, 0.9–0.8 as good, 0.8–0.7 as moderate, and < 0.7 as poor.
* **True skill statistic (TSS):** TSS values were categorized as excellent (>0.75), good (0.75 to 0.4), and poor (<0.4).
