Answer:::
The text describes the following data augmentation techniques:

* **Adding Gaussian noise:**  Noise is added to the images in the range of 0 to 255 * 0.2 to simulate low-resolution images. Two augmentations of this type are performed with different noise levels.
* **Sea waves distortion:** This technique adds a sea wave-like effect to the images using parameters alpha = 50 and sigma = 9.
* **Blurring effect:**  A blurring effect is applied to the images with a range of 0.75 to 1.5 to mimic unclear images. Two augmentations of this type are performed with different blur levels. 

The text explicitly states that **rotations** were *not* used as a data augmentation technique in this specific pipeline.
