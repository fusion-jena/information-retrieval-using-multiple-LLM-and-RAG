Answer:::
The text states that "several standard forms of deep-learning CNN architectures were tested".  It also mentions "a simple ResNet configuration" and "a separate network path following a simple ResNet configuration". 


Therefore, the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**.
