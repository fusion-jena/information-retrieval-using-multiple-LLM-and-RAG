Answer:::
The text states that the algorithm exploits the representation extracted from a deep neural network called YAMNet.  YAMNet follows the MobileV1 convolution architecture. 

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly used for processing sequential data like audio. 


Therefore, it can be inferred that YAMNet is a type of CNN.
