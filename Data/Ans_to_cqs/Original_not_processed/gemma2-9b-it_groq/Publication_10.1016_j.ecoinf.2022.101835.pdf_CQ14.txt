Answer:::
The provided text states that the hyperparameters of the Random Forest (RF) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models were optimized using **Optuna 2.10.0**.  

It also mentions that Optuna's LightGBM Tuner was used for hyperparameter fitting of the LightGBM models. 


While the text doesn't explicitly specify if Optuna uses grid search or random search, it implies an automated search process given its description as "optimizing" the hyperparameters.
