Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the methodology for extracting detailed skyline information from landscape photos using semantic segmentation and Conditional Random Fields (CRF).  

While it mentions post-processing steps like binarization of the results (sky vs. other) and extraction of classes below the sky, it doesn't explicitly detail steps like:

* **Saliency maps:**  The text doesn't discuss generating saliency maps to highlight the regions the model focuses on for classification.
* **Metrics calculation:**  It does mention calculating metrics like Normalized Segment Length, Sample Variance, and Average Absolute Deviation *after* extracting distances from orthophotos and topographic maps. These metrics are related to the analysis of skyline variations and their use in estimating distances to trees, not directly model evaluation metrics.
* **Confusion matrix:** The text doesn't discuss creating a confusion matrix, a common tool for evaluating the performance of a classification model. 


Therefore, based on the provided information, we can only confirm the extraction of classes and binarization as post-processing steps.
