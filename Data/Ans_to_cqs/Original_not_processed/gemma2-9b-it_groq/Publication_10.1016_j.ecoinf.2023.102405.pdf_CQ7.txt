Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the implementation of a specific deep learning model (AODEGRU) and doesn't explicitly detail the criteria used for splitting data into training, testing, and validation sets. 

However, common practices in deep learning model training generally involve the following:

* **Training Set:** This is the largest portion of the data used to train the model. The model learns patterns and relationships within this data.

* **Validation Set:** A separate subset of the data used to evaluate the model's performance during training. It helps monitor how well the model generalizes to unseen data and prevents overfitting (where the model performs well on training data but poorly on new data).

* **Test Set:** Held out entirely from the training process. It's used only once at the end to provide a final, unbiased evaluation of the trained model's performance.

**Typical Split Ratios:**

* 70-80% for training, 10-15% for validation, and 10-15% for testing.

**Criteria for Splitting:**

* **Randomness:** Data is randomly shuffled before splitting to ensure representative samples in each set.
* **Data Distribution:**  The split should aim to maintain the same distribution of classes or features across the training, validation, and test sets as much as possible.
