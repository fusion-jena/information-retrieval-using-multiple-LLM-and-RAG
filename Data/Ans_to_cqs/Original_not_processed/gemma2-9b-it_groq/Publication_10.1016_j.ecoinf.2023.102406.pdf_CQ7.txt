Answer:::
The provided text focuses on random forest algorithms and doesn't contain information about data splitting criteria for deep learning models. 

To answer your query about data splitting for deep learning, here's a common approach:

* **Training Set:** The largest portion of the data (e.g., 70-80%) is used to train the deep learning model. The model learns patterns and relationships within this data.
* **Validation Set:** A smaller portion of the data (e.g., 10-15%) is held out as the validation set. This set is used during training to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data and help tune hyperparameters (settings that control the learning process).

* **Test Set:**  A separate portion of the data (e.g., 10-15%) is kept completely separate from both training and validation. This is the test set, and it's only used *after* training is complete to provide a final, unbiased evaluation of the model's performance on data it has never encountered before.
