Answer:::
The provided text describes a hybrid method combining least squares and genetic algorithms for parameter estimation.  

It details the steps of the genetic algorithm but doesn't explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the genetic algorithm itself (e.g., population size, mutation rate) are optimized.  

Therefore, based on the information given, I cannot answer how the model's hyperparameters are optimized.
