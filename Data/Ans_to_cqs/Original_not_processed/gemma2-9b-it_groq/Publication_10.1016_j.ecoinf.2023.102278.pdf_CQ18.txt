Answer:::
The provided text states that the best model with transfer learning was chosen based on the minimum total loss after nine epochs.  It also mentions that the validation loss starts to increase after nine epochs, indicating overfitting.  

Therefore, the strategy implemented to monitor model performance during training was to track both the training loss and the validation loss.  The model with the lowest total loss after nine epochs was selected as the best performing model.
