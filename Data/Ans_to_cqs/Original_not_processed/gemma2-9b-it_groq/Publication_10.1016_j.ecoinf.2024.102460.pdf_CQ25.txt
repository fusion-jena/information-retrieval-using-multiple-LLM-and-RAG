Answer:::
The provided text focuses on using deep learning for land use change prediction and doesn't explicitly state the specific type of deep learning model used (e.g., classification, segmentation, detection). 

However, it mentions the use of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, which is commonly used for **time series forecasting**.  

Therefore, we can infer that the deep learning model in this context is likely used for **predicting future land use patterns** based on historical trends.
