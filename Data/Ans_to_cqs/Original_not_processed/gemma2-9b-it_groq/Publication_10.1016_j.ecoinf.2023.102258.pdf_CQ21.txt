Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the methods and challenges of few-shot sound event detection, particularly concerning event duration handling. It doesn't delve into specific post-processing steps like saliency maps, metric calculation, or confusion matrix construction. 

The text does mention some post-processing techniques used for event duration control:

* **Deleting/merging very short events:** This is a common approach to refine predictions and remove noise.
* **Estimating typical duration from examples:**  The model might learn to predict event length based on patterns in the training data.
* **Peak picking, thresholding, median filtering:** These techniques are used to identify and refine event segments.
* **Split-merge-filter:** This involves splitting long events and merging short ones to improve accuracy.
* **CRNN event filter:** This likely refers to a filter specific to Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks (CRNNs) used for event detection.
