Answer:::

The text describes the use of a Leave-One-Group-Out (LOGO) cross-validation approach to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. 

In this method, a complete 450m multitemporal transect is left out of the training process in each iteration and then used for testing. This ensures that every multitemporal transect is used for both training and testing, preventing overfitting to specific transects. 

The text also mentions that the dataset was expanded by incorporating multi-temporal data from three different months (March, September, and October 2015) across three environments ("Plateau", "White-sand", and "Riparian"). This helps to increase the diversity of the dataset and improve the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.
