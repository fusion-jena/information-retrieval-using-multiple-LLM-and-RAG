The provided text states that the deep learning model was fine-tuned on the Benthoz15 dataset, which consists of expert-annotated and geo-referenced marine images from Australian seas.  It also mentions that a subset of this dataset containing images from Western Australia (WA) was used for training the classifier. 

However, the text does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model beyond fine-tuning on the Benthoz15 dataset.  It does not discuss techniques like:

* **Diverse dataset:**  While the Benthoz15 dataset is mentioned, the text doesn't elaborate on its diversity in terms of image types, locations, or environmental conditions.
* **Cross-validation:**  The text doesn't describe any cross-validation strategies used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
* **Stratified splitting:**  There is no mention of stratified splitting techniques used to ensure balanced representation of classes during training and testing.
