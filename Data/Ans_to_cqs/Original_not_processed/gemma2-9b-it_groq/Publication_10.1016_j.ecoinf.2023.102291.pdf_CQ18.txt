Answer:::
The provided text states that the model performance was monitored using  "validation accuracy" and "precision". 

Validation accuracy is defined as the proportion of all correct predictions made by the model on a separate validation dataset. Precision, on the other hand, is calculated as the number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false positives. 

The authors chose the model architecture that yielded the best validation accuracy and precision during the training process.
