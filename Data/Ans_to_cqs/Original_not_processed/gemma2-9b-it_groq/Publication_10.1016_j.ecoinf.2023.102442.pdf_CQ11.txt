Answer: 

I cannot provide a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline described in the text. 

The provided text excerpts discuss the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) for processing satellite imagery and analyzing land use changes. While GEE is a powerful platform with a vast data catalog, it doesn't necessarily imply that the specific deep learning pipeline's code, models, or datasets are publicly available through a dedicated repository like Zenodo, Figshare, or Dryad.
