Answer:::
The provided text does not specify the exact criteria used to split the data for training, testing, and validation in the deep learning model. 

It mentions a process involving three phases:

1. **Training:** The model is trained on a dataset.
2. **Testing:** The trained model is evaluated on a separate dataset different from the training data to assess its performance.
3. **Expert Evaluation:** Field experts evaluate the model using a new, independent dataset.

However, the text doesn't detail the specific proportions or methods used to divide the data into these phases.
