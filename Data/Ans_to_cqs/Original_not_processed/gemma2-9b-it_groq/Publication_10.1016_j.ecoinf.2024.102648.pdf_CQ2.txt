Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning for predicting cotton leaf curl disease and doesn't specify the exact data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. 

However, based on the mention of "image analysis" and the illustration of deep learning methods for prediction, it can be inferred that **image data** is likely used as input. 


It's also possible that other data formats like **CSV** (for meteorological data, disease incidence records, etc.) are incorporated into the pipeline.
