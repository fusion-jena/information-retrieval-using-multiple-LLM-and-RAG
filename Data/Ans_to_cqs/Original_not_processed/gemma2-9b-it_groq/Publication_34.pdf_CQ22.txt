Answer:::
The text mentions the following performance metrics:

* **Mean Loss (Loss):**  This metric is directly related to the model's objective function and is minimized during training. 
* **Test Rmse:**  Root Mean Squared Error, a common metric for regression tasks.
* **Test A10%DQ:**  This likely refers to the Area Under the Curve (AUC) at a 10% displacement threshold, a metric often used in species distribution modeling. 


The text doesn't explicitly mention accuracy, precision, or recall.
