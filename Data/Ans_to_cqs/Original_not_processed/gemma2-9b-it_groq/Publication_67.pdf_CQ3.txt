Answer:::
The provided text does not specify the exact data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.  While it mentions the creation of training datasets with different levels of tree cover and the inclusion of a "Non-Forest" class, it doesn't detail how the images were annotated. 

Therefore, I cannot say for sure if techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation were used.
