Answer:::
The provided text describes the evaluation metrics used for a random forest model, not a deep learning model.  

The metrics mentioned are:

* **Cohen’s kappa coefficient (κ):** Measures the proportion of agreements between the model's predictions and the actual values.
* **Precision:**  Determines the proportion of correct positive predictions out of all positive predictions made by the model.
* **Sensitivity:**  Represents the true positive rate, or the proportion of actual positive cases that were correctly identified by the model.
* **Specificity:**  Represents the true negative rate, or the proportion of actual negative cases that were correctly identified by the model.
* **Prevalence:**  Indicates the proportion of instances belonging to each class in the dataset.
