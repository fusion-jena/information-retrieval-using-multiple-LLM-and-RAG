Answer:::
The text states that the model's performance was monitored by:

* **Training on the training set:** The CNN learns from the training data.
* **Evaluating performance on the validation set:**  A separate dataset, the validation set, is used to assess how well the model generalizes to unseen data. This helps detect overfitting.
* **Adjusting CNN node weights:** Based on the validation set performance, the model's internal parameters (weights) are tweaked to improve its accuracy.

These cycles of training, validation, and weight adjustment are referred to as epochs or iterations.  The authors specifically mention that the number of iterations significantly impacts the model's performance and confidence in its predictions.
