Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the impact of dataset size and model architecture on classification accuracy, and doesn't delve into specific regularization techniques used to prevent overfitting. 

However, it does mention "Dropout(Dropout_Rate)" as a component of the model architecture. Dropout is a common regularization method that randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during each training step. This prevents the model from relying too heavily on any single neuron and encourages the learning of more robust features, thus mitigating overfitting. 


L2 regularization, another technique often used to combat overfitting, is not explicitly mentioned in the text.
