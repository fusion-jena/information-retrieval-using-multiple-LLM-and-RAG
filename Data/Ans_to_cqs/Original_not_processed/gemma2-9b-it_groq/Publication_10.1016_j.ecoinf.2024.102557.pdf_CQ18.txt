Answer:::
The text states that model hyperparameters were tuned using Bayesian optimization. This optimization technique aims to find the best set of hyperparameters for the model by iteratively evaluating the model's performance and making adjustments to the hyperparameters. 

The performance metric used for this optimization was the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the predictions. This means the model's performance was monitored by calculating the RMSE of its predictions on a subset of the data (environmental cross-validation with ten folds).
