Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning in bioacoustic classification, particularly for marine mammals. It discusses the use of deep neural networks and the challenges of requiring large datasets for training. 

However, the text does not delve into specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for this application.  Therefore, I cannot answer your query about data annotation techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation based on the given context.
