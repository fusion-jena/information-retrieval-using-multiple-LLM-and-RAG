Answer:::

The provided text does not mention the use of a deep learning model. It describes the use of five machine learning models: GLM, MaxEnt, RF, GBM, and MARS.  

The text does discuss methods used to assess the performance and generalizability of these models, including:

* **Ensemble prediction:** Combining predictions from multiple models to improve accuracy.
* **AUC and TSS metrics:** Using these widely recognized metrics to evaluate model performance.
* **Variable contributions:** Analyzing the importance of different environmental variables in predicting habitat suitability. 


Therefore, information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model is not available in this text.
