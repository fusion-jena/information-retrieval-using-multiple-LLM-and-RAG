Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning for mapping Pacific oyster density using drone imagery. It describes the dataset creation process, including data augmentation techniques, but doesn't delve into specific strategies for handling randomness within the deep learning pipeline. 

To address randomness in deep learning, common strategies include:

* **Setting a random seed:** This initializes the random number generator, ensuring that the same "random" values are produced each time the code is run. This allows for reproducibility of results.

* **Using techniques like dropout:** Dropout randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during training. This prevents overfitting and introduces stochasticity, helping the model generalize better.

* **Batch normalization:** This technique normalizes the activations of each layer, reducing the internal covariate shift and stabilizing training.

* **Careful hyperparameter tuning:** Hyperparameters like learning rate and batch size can influence the randomness of the training process.

Without further information from the original research paper, it's impossible to say definitively which strategies were employed in this specific case.
