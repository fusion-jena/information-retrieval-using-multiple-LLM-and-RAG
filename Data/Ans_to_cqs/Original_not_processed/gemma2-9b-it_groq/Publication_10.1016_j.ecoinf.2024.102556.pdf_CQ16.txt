Answer:::
The provided text does not specify the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete for the YOLOv7 model.  

It mentions that the model underwent five rounds of training and validation using 5-fold cross-validation. This suggests that the training process was likely monitored over these rounds, and completion could have been based on factors like:

* **Performance on the validation set:**  A plateau in validation loss or accuracy could signal that further training is not significantly improving the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.
* **Training loss:**  While not explicitly stated, the training process might have stopped when the training loss reached a sufficiently low value.
* **Time constraints:** There might have been a predefined time limit for each training round.


Without further information from the study, it's impossible to say for sure what criteria were used to determine the completion of training.
