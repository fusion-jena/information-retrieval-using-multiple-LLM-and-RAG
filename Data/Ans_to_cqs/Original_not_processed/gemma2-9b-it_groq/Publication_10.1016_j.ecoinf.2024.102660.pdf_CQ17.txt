Answer:::
The provided text mentions reducing the number of convolutional kernels in each block from 64 to 32 as a measure to mitigate overfitting. It also states that residual structures were incorporated based on the ResNet network. 

While the text doesn't explicitly name regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization, these are common techniques used to prevent overfitting in deep learning.
