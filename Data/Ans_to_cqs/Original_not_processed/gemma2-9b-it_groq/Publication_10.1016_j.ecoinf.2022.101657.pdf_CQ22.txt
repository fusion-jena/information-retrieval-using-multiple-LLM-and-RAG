Answer:::
The text mentions several metrics used to evaluate the deep learning model:

* **Mean Average Precision (mAP50):** This metric is used to evaluate the overall performance of the model across different species. It takes the mean over all species of their respective average precision, considering only bounding box intersections that are at least 50% of the union area.

* **Specificity (S) and Recall (R):** These metrics are used to evaluate the model's ability to correctly identify and reject species. 

* **Eα:** This is a weighted harmonic mean between specificity (S) and recall (R), where α is a weight factor between 0 and 1.  Eα allows for balancing the importance of specificity and recall.

* **Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC):** While not the primary metric used, MCC is mentioned as an alternative measure that captures informedness and markedness.
