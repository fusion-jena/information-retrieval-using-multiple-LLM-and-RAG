Answer:::
The provided text describes the use of several metrics to evaluate the performance of the TrunkNet model for salient tree trunk detection.  These include:

* **Mean Absolute Error (M):** This metric assesses the pixel-level similarity between the model's predicted saliency map and the ground truth mask. It calculates the average absolute difference between the corresponding pixel values.

* **F-measure (Fβ):** This metric combines precision and recall into a single statistic. It is particularly useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets, as it gives more weight to the class that is under-represented. In this case, β2 is set to 0.3 to prioritize precision. The maximum Fβ (maxFβ) is also reported.

* **Weighted F-measure (Fωβ):** This metric addresses the issue of  unreasonable comparisons caused by prediction flaws. It introduces a weight (ω) to the Fβ calculation, giving more importance to errors at specific locations.
