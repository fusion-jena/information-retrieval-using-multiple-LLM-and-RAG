Answer:::

Based on the provided text snippets, it's difficult to definitively state the *exact* raw data collection methods used in the deep learning pipelines of the cited studies. 

However, we can infer some likely methods based on the data types mentioned:

* **Airborne LiDAR:**  Several papers (Tamiminia et al., 2021a, 2022) mention using airborne LiDAR-derived Above Ground Biomass (AGB) data. This suggests LiDAR sensors mounted on aircraft were used to collect 3D point cloud data of the forest canopy.
* **Landsat Data:** Tamiminia et al. (2021a) also use Landsat data, which is a satellite-based remote sensing dataset providing multispectral imagery of the Earth's surface.
* **GEDI and ICESat-2 Data:** Tamiminia et al. (2022) utilize data from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) and the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2), both of which are satellite-based lidar missions providing high-resolution elevation data.
* **Sentinel-1 SAR Data:** Mandal et al. (2020) employ data from the Sentinel-1 mission, which uses Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) to capture images of the Earth's surface, even through cloud cover.

**It's important to note:**

* The provided text focuses on the analysis and modeling aspects of these studies, not the detailed data collection procedures.
*  Other data sources might be involved, such as ground surveys or ancillary datasets.
