Answer:::
To enhance the generalizability of the deep learning model, the authors implemented a chronological split of the dataset. 

70% of the data was allocated for training, 10% for validation, and 20% for testing. This strategy mimics real-world scenarios by ensuring that the validation and test sets are distinct from the training data, thus promoting the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.
