Answer:::
The provided text focuses on comparing the performance of different machine learning methods (AdaBoost, Bayes, RF, and NET) for estimating forest biomass. It doesn't delve into the specifics of how a deep learning model would be evaluated. 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what metrics are used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model.
