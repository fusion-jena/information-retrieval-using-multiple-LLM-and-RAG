Answer:::
Based on the provided text snippets, the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline appear to be primarily:

* **Image:**  Many of the references discuss using images for tasks like plant disease identification, mangrove monitoring, and forest disease spread analysis. 
* **Multispectral:**  There are mentions of "multispectral features" and "hyperspectral imaging," indicating the use of data containing multiple spectral bands, often derived from remote sensing imagery.

It's possible that other formats like CSV (for tabular data) are also used, but the provided context doesn't explicitly mention them.
