Answer:::
The provided text focuses on hyperparameter tuning for machine learning models within Google Earth Engine (GEE) and doesn't specify the criteria used for splitting data for deep learning model training (train, test, validation). 

It does mention that 70% of the 33,209 samples were allocated for training, 30% for testing, and 10% of the training data was used for validation. However, it doesn't elaborate on the specific methods used to divide the data into these sets for deep learning.
