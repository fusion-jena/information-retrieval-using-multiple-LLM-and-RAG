Answer:::
The provided text describes the loss values for training and validation datasets during Mask R-CNN training for epoch 20. It breaks down the losses into components like rpn_class_loss, rpn_bbox_loss, mrcnn_class_loss, mrcnn_bbox_loss, and mrcnn_mask_loss. 

However, it doesn't explicitly state the strategy used to monitor model performance during training.  We can infer that loss values are being tracked for both training and validation sets, which is a common practice.  Lowering loss values generally indicates improved model performance.
