Answer:::
The text mentions two data augmentation techniques used for rare species:

1. **Exponential rescaling of signals:** This likely involves stretching or compressing the amplitude of the bat calls to create variations in their intensity.

2. **Slight window shifting:** This involves moving the analysis window slightly to the left or right within the bat call recording. This can change the background noise captured within the window, creating variations in the data. 


The text does not mention other common data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, or scaling.
