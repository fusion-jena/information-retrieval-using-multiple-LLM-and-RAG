Answer:::
The provided text describes the data splitting process for machine learning models (kNN, SVM, ANN, and RF) but doesn't specify criteria for deep learning models. 

It does mention using the `createDataPartition()` function from the `caret` package to split 80% of the data for testing and 20% for validation.  

However,  deep learning often involves more intricate data splitting strategies, sometimes including additional sets like a training set, validation set, and test set.  The specific criteria for these splits can vary depending on the complexity of the deep learning model, the size of the dataset, and the specific goals of the project.
