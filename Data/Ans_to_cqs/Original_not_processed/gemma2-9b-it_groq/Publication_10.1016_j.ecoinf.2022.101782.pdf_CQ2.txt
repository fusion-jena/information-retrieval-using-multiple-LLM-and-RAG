Answer:::
The provided text explicitly mentions the use of image data in the deep learning pipeline. 

It states: "Image augmentation was applied in the form of horizontal flip, 0.2 degree counter clock wise shear and a random zoom between 0 and 0.2 - all leading to 224 Ã— 244 pixel RGB input tensors."

It also mentions that the pixels values were rescaled in the range of [0, 1], indicating that the images are represented as numerical data. 

Therefore, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is **image data**, represented as numerical tensors.
