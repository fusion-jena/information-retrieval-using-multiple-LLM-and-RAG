The provided text describes the model training process and evaluation metrics (recall and precision) but doesn't mention specific techniques used to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as:

* **Diverse dataset:**  While the text mentions the data originates from various sources, it doesn't specify if the dataset itself was designed to be diverse in terms of species, locations, or environmental conditions.
* **Cross-validation:**  The text doesn't describe the use of cross-validation techniques to assess the model's performance on unseen data.
* **Stratified splitting:**  There's no mention of stratified splitting of the data into training, validation, and testing sets to maintain class proportions. 


Therefore, based on the given context, we cannot determine what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
