Answer:::
The provided text describes the preprocessing steps taken for a specific deep learning model used for red kite detection. These steps include:

* **Image Augmentation:**  Horizontal flipping, counter-clockwise shear (0.2 degrees), and random zoom (0 to 0.2) were applied to the images. This increases the size and diversity of the training data.
* **Resizing:** Images were resized to 224 Ã— 244 pixels.
* **Normalization:** Pixel values were normalized to ImageNet mean values. This helps the model learn more effectively by centering the data.
* **Scaling:** Pixel values were rescaled to the range of [0, 1]. This ensures that all pixel values fall within a consistent range. 


The text doesn't explicitly mention other common preprocessing steps like data cleaning (removing duplicates, outliers, or corrupted data) or handling missing values.
