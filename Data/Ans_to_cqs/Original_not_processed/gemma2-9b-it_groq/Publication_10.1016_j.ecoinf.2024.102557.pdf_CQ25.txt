Answer:::

While the provided text discusses the applications of deep learning in ecology, it doesn't specify the purpose of a particular deep learning model. 

The text mentions that deep learning techniques are used for tasks like:

* **Species distribution modeling:** Predicting the geographic distribution of species.
* **Species identification through imagery:** Recognizing and classifying species from images.
* **Land use change characterization:** Analyzing changes in land cover over time.
* **Conservation area identification:** Identifying areas suitable for conservation or restoration.
* **Biodiversity conservation and estimation:** Assessing and managing biodiversity.
* **Invasive species risk assessment:** Predicting the potential spread and impact of invasive species.

These examples suggest that deep learning models in ecology are used for a variety of purposes, including **classification, detection, and prediction**. 


To determine the specific purpose of a deep learning model, you would need more information about the model itself and the task it is designed to perform.
