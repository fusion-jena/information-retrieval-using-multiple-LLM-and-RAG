Answer:::
The provided text focuses on various applications of deep learning in fields like image classification and doesn't delve into strategies for handling randomness within the deep learning pipeline.  

To address your query about handling randomness in deep learning, here are some common strategies:

* **Setting a Random Seed:**  Deep learning algorithms often use random initialization for weights and random shuffling of data. Setting a fixed random seed ensures that these random processes are reproducible. This allows you to obtain consistent results across multiple runs and experiments.

* **Data Augmentation:**  This technique introduces controlled variations to your training data (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) to increase its size and diversity. It helps the model generalize better and reduces the impact of randomness in the training data itself.

* **Dropout:**  A regularization technique where randomly selected neurons are "dropped out" (ignored) during each training step. This prevents overfitting and introduces some randomness during training, leading to a more robust model.

* **Batch Normalization:**  This technique normalizes the activations within each layer of the network, reducing the internal covariate shift and stabilizing the training process. It can help mitigate the effects of randomness in weight updates.
