Answer:::

The provided text focuses on a specific study about soil mapping and doesn't delve into the general methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. 

However, based on the information given, we can infer some data collection methods used in this particular study:

* **Field investigation:** This suggests direct observation and sampling of the physical environment.
* **Digital elevation model (DEM):** This is a type of geospatial data derived from remote sensing, likely from satellite imagery.
* **Soil sample database:** This implies the use of existing datasets containing soil information.


To get a comprehensive answer about data collection methods in deep learning pipelines, you'd need to consult broader resources on the topic.
