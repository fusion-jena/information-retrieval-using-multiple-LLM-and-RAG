Answer: The text describes the creation of three datasets (E1000, E200, and E50) from a larger pool of 7626 species.  

The selection process involved choosing species with more than 300 observations and then randomly sampling subsets of these species to form the different datasets.  

The authors aimed to ensure the generalizability of their results by using a high number of randomly chosen species and by evaluating the performance of their model (CNN1000) on the full E1000 dataset. 

However, the text does not mention the use of techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting to further enhance the generalizability of the model.
