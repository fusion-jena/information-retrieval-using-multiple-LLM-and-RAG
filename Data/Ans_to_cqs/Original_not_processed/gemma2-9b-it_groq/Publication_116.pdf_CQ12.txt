Answer:::
The provided text states that a "deep learning approach" is used as a second pipeline, and it lists the architecture of the network, including convolutional layers, max pooling, batch normalization, and LRN layers.  

Based on this information, it can be inferred that the deep learning model used is a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.
