Answer:::
The provided text states that the performance of the deep learning model was evaluated using **accuracy**.  

The text says: "Experimental results on test sets showed that when the DCNN model was transferred from the ImageNet dataset to the SS or LSM dataset, the accuracy of the transfer learning model was always better than that of the model trained from scratch".
