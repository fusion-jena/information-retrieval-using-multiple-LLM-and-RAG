Answer:::
The provided text describes the use of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) but does not specify the type of deep learning model within that category. 

It mentions a single hidden-layer neural network with specific hyperparameters and activation functions.  

However,  it doesn't  explicitly  state  whether  it's  a  Convolutional  Neural  Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Transformer, or another type of deep learning architecture.
