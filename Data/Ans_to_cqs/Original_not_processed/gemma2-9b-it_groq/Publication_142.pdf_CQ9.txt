Answer:::

The provided text states that the data generated by the Pl@ntNet AI can be shared via the GBIF portal (www.gbif.org).  It also mentions that metadata should accompany these datasets.  

However, the text does not specify if the deep learning pipeline itself (the model weights, training data, etc.) is available in a repository like Zenodo, Figshare, or Dryad.
