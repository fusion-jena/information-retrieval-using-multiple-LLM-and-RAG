Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the application of IoT data in a deep learning pipeline for water quality analysis in aquaculture.  

While it mentions data collection from IoT devices including temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and nitrate concentration, it doesn't explicitly state the data format used. 

Based on the nature of the data (environmental parameters), it's highly likely that the data is collected and processed as numerical values, potentially in a format like CSV (Comma Separated Values).
