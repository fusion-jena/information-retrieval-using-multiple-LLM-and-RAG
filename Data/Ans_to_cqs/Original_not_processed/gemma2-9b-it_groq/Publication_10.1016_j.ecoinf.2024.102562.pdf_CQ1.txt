Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning for analyzing images of bacteria in soil-analogue environments. It mentions that the data used to train and validate the deep learning model was obtained from "soil chip analysis" and that the images were captured using microfluidic platforms. 

Therefore, the method used for collecting raw data in this deep learning pipeline is **image capture using microfluidic platforms**.
