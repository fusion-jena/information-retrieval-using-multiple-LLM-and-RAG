Answer:::

The provided text describes the use of the BirdNET deep learning model for bird species identification based on vocalizations.  

While it mentions the creation of the "Agmon annotated dataset" and the selection of species based on precision/recall values, it does not explicitly detail the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model. 

The text does not mention techniques like:

* **Diverse dataset:**  Information about the dataset's diversity in terms of bird species, geographic locations, and recording conditions is lacking.
* **Cross-validation:**  There's no mention of using cross-validation techniques to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
* **Stratified splitting:**  The text doesn't describe how the dataset was split into training, validation, and testing sets, nor if stratified splitting was employed to maintain class balance. 


Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot definitively say what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the BirdNET model.
