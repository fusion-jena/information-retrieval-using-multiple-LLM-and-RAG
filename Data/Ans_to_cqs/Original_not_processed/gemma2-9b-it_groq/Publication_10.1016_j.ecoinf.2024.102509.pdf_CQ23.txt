Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the development and performance of a Backpropagation Artificial Neural Network (BP-ANN) model, not a deep learning model.  

While the text mentions the importance of dataset quality and quantity for training ANNs, it doesn't specify details about techniques used to ensure the generalizability of the model, such as:

* **Diverse dataset:**  Information about the dataset's diversity (e.g., geographical coverage, range of environmental conditions) is not provided.
* **Cross-validation:** The text doesn't mention the use of cross-validation techniques to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
* **Stratified splitting:**  There's no information about whether the dataset was split into training and validation sets using stratified sampling to maintain class proportions. 


Therefore, based on the given context, it's impossible to determine what specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the BP-ANN model.
