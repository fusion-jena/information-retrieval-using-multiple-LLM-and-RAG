Answer:::
The provided text does not mention any deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. 

It focuses on traditional machine learning models such as:

* Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)
* Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
* Support Vector Machine (SVM) 


Therefore, I cannot answer which deep learning frameworks are used to build the model based on the given context.
