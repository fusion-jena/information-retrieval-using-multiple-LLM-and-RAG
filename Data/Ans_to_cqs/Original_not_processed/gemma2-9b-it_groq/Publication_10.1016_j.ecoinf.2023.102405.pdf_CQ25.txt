Answer:::
The deep learning model described in the text is used for **classification**. 

Specifically, it aims to classify water quality as either "contaminated" or "non-contaminated".  This is achieved by:

1. **Integrating IoT-based real-time data collection and segregation:**  The model uses data from IoT devices measuring parameters like temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and nitrate concentration.
2. **Calculating a water contamination index (WCI):**  This index helps determine the contamination level based on fish-specific acceptable ranges for each parameter.
3. **Segregating data:** The WCI results in classifying the water data into "contaminated" and "non-contaminated" classes.


The deep learning model then learns from this labeled data to accurately predict the contamination status of new water quality readings.
