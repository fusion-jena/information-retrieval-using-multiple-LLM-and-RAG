Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the challenges and potential of using deep learning for fish biomass estimation in turbid environments.  It mentions using deep learning models like YOLO and incorporating techniques like Bidirectional LSTM with GloVe embeddings. 

However, the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., bounding box annotation, instance segmentation) are **not detailed** in this excerpt.
