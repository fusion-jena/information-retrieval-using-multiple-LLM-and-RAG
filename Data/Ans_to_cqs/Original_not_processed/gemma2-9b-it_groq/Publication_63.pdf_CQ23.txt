Answer:::
The text describes several measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model:

* **Stratified sampling:**  A stratified sampling design was used to collect images, ensuring that each species was represented proportionally in the dataset. This helps prevent overfitting to specific species and improves the model's ability to generalize to unseen species.
* **Cross-validation:** The final model performance was assessed using a 3-fold cross-validation. This involves splitting the data into three parts (training, validation, and test) and training the model on different combinations of these parts. This helps to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data and reduce the risk of overfitting.
