Answer:::
The provided text describes the use of several deep learning models, including CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks). 

Specifically, the text mentions:

* **ResNet152-V2:** A type of CNN known for its residual connections, which helps in training very deep networks.
* **VGG16:** Another type of CNN known for its use of multiple convolutional layers.
* **VGGish:** A variant of VGG11A, also a CNN, designed for audio processing.
* **YAMNet:** A MobileNet-V1 based network, which is a type of CNN, pre-trained on audio data.
* **BirdNet:** A CNN trained specifically on bird vocalizations.


Therefore, the pipeline likely utilizes **CNNs** as its primary deep learning model type.
