Answer:::
The provided text describes a non-standard data splitting strategy. Instead of splitting data per image, they vertically divide each image into halves.  

One half of the image is assigned to the training set, while the other half is assigned to the validation set. This alternating assignment is done for each image. 

The text does not mention a separate test set.
