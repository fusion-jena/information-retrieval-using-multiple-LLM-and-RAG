Answer:::

The provided text focuses on ecosystem services and video analysis, and doesn't offer information about deep learning preprocessing techniques for addressing data bias.  

To answer your query about techniques used to address data bias during deep learning preprocessing, here are some common methods:

* **Stratified Splitting:** This technique ensures that the training, validation, and test sets have a similar distribution of target classes as the original dataset. This helps prevent overfitting to specific class distributions and improves model generalization.

* **Oversampling:** This involves duplicating instances from underrepresented classes to balance the class distribution. Techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) can create synthetic samples for minority classes.

* **Undersampling:** This method removes instances from the majority class to balance the class distribution. It's important to choose a suitable undersampling strategy to avoid losing valuable information from the majority class.

* **Diverse Data Collection:**  This is a preventative measure that aims to collect data from a wide range of sources and represent different demographics, viewpoints, and scenarios. A more diverse dataset from the outset can help mitigate bias during training.
