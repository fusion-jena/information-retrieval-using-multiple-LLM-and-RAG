Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the model development process, including variable selection, data splitting, and model training using Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network, and Support Vector Machine algorithms. 

It mentions the use of R2, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to evaluate model accuracy. However, it doesn't delve into post-processing steps like saliency maps, confusion matrices, or other performance metrics beyond the three mentioned.
