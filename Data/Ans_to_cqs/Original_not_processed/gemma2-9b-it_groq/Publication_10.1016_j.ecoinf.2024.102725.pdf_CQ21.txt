Answer:::

The provided text focuses on evaluating the performance of different models (DCT-PLS, ESTARFM, SOWCEM) for reconstructing NDVI time-series data. It doesn't explicitly mention post-processing steps like saliency maps, confusion matrices, or specific metric calculations beyond R2, MAE, and RMSE. 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot definitively list the post-processing steps involved after model training.
