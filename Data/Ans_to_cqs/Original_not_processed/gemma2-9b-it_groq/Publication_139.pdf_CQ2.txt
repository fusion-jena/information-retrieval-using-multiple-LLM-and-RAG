Answer:::
The text states that raw audio data is converted into spectrograms, which are pictorial representations of the audio. These spectrograms are then used as input for the convolutional neural networks (CNNs). 

Therefore, the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are:

* **Raw audio data:** This is the original input.
* **Spectrograms:** These are image-like representations of the audio data used as input for the CNNs.
