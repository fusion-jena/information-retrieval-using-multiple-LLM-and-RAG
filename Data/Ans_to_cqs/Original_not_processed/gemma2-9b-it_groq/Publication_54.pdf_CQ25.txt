Answer: The deep learning model is used for **classification**.  

The text states that the model is trained to learn the features of 27 endemic bird species (source domain) and then transfers those learned features to a second network to train on a new dataset of endemic bird species (target domain). This process is framed as improving the learning of a target predictive function fT (Â·) in the target domain using knowledge acquired from the source domain.  

Predicting a category (in this case, a specific bird species) is the core function of classification.
