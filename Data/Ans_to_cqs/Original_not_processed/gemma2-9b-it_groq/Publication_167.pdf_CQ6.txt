Answer:::
The provided text describes the use of batch normalization as a preprocessing step for the input data. 

Specifically, it mentions:

* **Calculating the mean and variance** of each channel in the current batch.
* **Subtracting the mean** from the input data.
* **Dividing the result by the standard deviation** to normalize the data.
* **Scaling** the normalized output by a learnable parameter γ.
* **Shifting** the scaled output by a learnable parameter β.


The text doesn't mention other common preprocessing steps like scaling, cleaning, or handling missing values.
