Answer:::
The hyperparameters used in the deep learning models are listed in Table II.  

Here's a breakdown:

* **Batch Size:** This varies for each model, ranging from 16 to 48.
* **Learning Rate:**  The learning rate also differs between models,  ranging from 0.001 to 0.05.
* **Number of Epochs:** The number of epochs (passes through the entire dataset)  ranges from 75 to 150.
* **Input Image Size:** All models use an input image size of 224x224 pixels with 3 color channels.

The optimizer used for all four models was Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).
