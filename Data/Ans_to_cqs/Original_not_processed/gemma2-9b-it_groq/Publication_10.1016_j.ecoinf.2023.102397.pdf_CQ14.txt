Answer:::
The provided text does not specify the exact method used to optimize the hyperparameters of the model (e.g., grid search, random search). 

It mentions steps like:

* Choosing the optimal cut-off thresholds based on F-scores.
* Running a random forest model using the best replicate and threshold on the test set. 

However, it doesn't elaborate on how the initial range of hyperparameters was defined or how the search for the optimal values was conducted.
