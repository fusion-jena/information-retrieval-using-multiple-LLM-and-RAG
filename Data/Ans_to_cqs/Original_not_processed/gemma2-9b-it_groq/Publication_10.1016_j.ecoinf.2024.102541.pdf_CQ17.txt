Answer:::
The provided text focuses on deep convolutional neural networks for tasks like object detection and doesn't delve into specific regularization techniques used to prevent overfitting. 

However, common regularization methods in deep learning include:

* **Dropout:** Randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during training. This prevents the network from relying too heavily on any single neuron and encourages the learning of more robust features.

* **L2 Regularization (Weight Decay):** Adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. This discourages the weights from becoming too large, which can lead to overfitting.

Other regularization techniques include L1 regularization, early stopping, and data augmentation.
