Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the process of training a Random Forest (RF) classifier for land cover classification using Sentinel-2 imagery. It discusses data acquisition, preprocessing, and the importance of representative training samples. 

However, it doesn't delve into the specific post-processing steps involved after model training, such as:

* **Saliency maps:** These highlight the regions of an input image that are most influential in the model's decision.
* **Metrics calculation:**  This involves evaluating the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC.
* **Confusion matrix:** This visualizes the model's performance by showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives for each class. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer your query about the post-processing steps.
