Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the architecture and implementation details of a specific deep learning model, particularly its use of attention mechanisms and feature pyramid networks. It doesn't delve into strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. 

However,  randomness is indeed a common element in deep learning, introduced through:

* **Random Initialization:** Weights of neural network layers are often initialized randomly. This prevents all neurons from starting with the same values, promoting diverse learning.

* **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):** This popular optimization algorithm uses random mini-batches of data to update model weights. This introduces noise that can help escape local optima and find better solutions.
* **Dropout:** A regularization technique that randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during training. This prevents overfitting by forcing the network to learn more robust features.

To mitigate the potential negative impacts of randomness:

* **Setting a Random Seed:**  Users can set a specific random seed value. This ensures that the same random numbers are generated each time the code is run, leading to reproducible results.
* **Weight Initialization Techniques:**  Various initialization methods, like Xavier or He initialization, aim to initialize weights in a way that stabilizes training and improves convergence.
* **Careful Hyperparameter Tuning:**  The choice of learning rate, batch size, and other hyperparameters can significantly influence the impact of randomness on training.
