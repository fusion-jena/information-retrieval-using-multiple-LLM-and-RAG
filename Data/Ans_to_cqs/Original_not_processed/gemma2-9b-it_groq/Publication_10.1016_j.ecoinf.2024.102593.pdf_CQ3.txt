Answer:::
The provided text focuses on active learning and the use of embeddings for model training and selection, but it doesn't specify the exact data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. 

Therefore, I cannot answer your question about the data annotation techniques used (e.g., bounding box annotation, instance segmentation) based on the given context.
