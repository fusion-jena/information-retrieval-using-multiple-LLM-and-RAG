Answer:::
The provided text describes a deep learning pipeline that uses **color spectrograms** as input. 

Spectrograms are visual representations of audio signals, showing the frequency content over time.  Since they are derived from audio data and visualized, they can be considered a **hybrid data format**, combining aspects of both audio and image data. 


The text specifically mentions that the input to the ResNet50 model is RGB images of size 224x224x3, indicating that the spectrograms are represented as color images.
