Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the model's training process and architecture, detailing hyperparameters, loss functions, and the impact of different attention mechanisms.  

It does mention the use of several evaluation metrics:

* **Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR):** Used for ranking tasks, particularly in information retrieval.
* **Accuracy (ACC):**  Measures the proportion of correctly classified items.
* **Average Accuracy (avg_ACC):**  Calculates the average accuracy across all class hierarchies.
* **Hierarchical Distance of a Mistake (HDM):**  Quantifies the degree of misclassification, considering the hierarchical relationships between classes.

However, the text doesn't explicitly describe post-processing steps like saliency map generation or confusion matrix construction.
