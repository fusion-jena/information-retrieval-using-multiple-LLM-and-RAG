Answer:::
The provided text describes the dataset used to train a deep learning model for goat vocalization detection. It mentions that the dataset was divided into 70% for training, 10% for validation, and 20% for testing. 

However, it doesn't specify if other measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model, such as:

* **Diverse dataset:**  Information about the diversity of the dataset in terms of goat breeds, ages, environments, or vocalization types is not provided.
* **Cross-validation:** The text doesn't mention the use of cross-validation techniques to evaluate the model's performance on different subsets of the data.
* **Stratified splitting:**  There's no information about whether the dataset was split into training, validation, and testing sets in a stratified manner to maintain the class distribution. 


Therefore, based on the given context, we cannot definitively say what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
