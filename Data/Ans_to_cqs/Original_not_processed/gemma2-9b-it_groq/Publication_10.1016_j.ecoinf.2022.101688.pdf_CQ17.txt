Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the benefits and applications of using pre-trained CNNs for acoustic classification, particularly in the context of limited datasets.  It doesn't delve into specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting. 

While the text mentions overfitting as a potential issue when training CNNs on small acoustic datasets, it doesn't list techniques like dropout or L2 regularization that are commonly employed to address this problem.
