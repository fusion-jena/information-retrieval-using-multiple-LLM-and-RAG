Answer:::
The provided text doesn't specify the exact method used for hyperparameter optimization of the Random Forest model.  

It mentions that the model's hyperparameters are fine-tuned using the validation set, but it doesn't describe the optimization technique employed (e.g., grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization).
