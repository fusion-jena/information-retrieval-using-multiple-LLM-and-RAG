Answer:::
The provided text focuses on data preprocessing steps for image classification using CNNs, but it doesn't explicitly mention techniques to address data bias. 

However, it does highlight the importance of stratified splitting to preserve class ratios during dataset division. This helps mitigate bias that might arise if certain classes are underrepresented in the training or testing sets. 

The text also mentions class imbalance as a potential issue and suggests down-weighting common classes or up-sampling rare classes as possible solutions. These techniques aim to balance the representation of different classes during training, thereby reducing bias. 


It's important to note that the text doesn't discuss diverse data collection as a technique for addressing bias during preprocessing.
