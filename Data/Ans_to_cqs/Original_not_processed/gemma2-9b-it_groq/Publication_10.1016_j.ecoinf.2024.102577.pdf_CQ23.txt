Answer:::

The provided text describes the performance of various machine learning models, including Random Forest, SMO, Multilayer Perceptron, Na√Øve Bayes, SKJ, YFT, BET, and FAL, for predicting fish catches. 

However, it doesn't specify the details about the deep learning model's development process, including the measures taken to ensure its generalizability.  

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
