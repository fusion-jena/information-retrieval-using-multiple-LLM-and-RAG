Answer:::

The provided text describes the methods used to train and improve the deep learning model, but it doesn't mention specific measures taken to ensure its generalizability.  

The text does state that:

* **Data augmentation** was used to enhance sample variation during training. This can help the model learn more robust features and generalize better to unseen data.
* **An ensemble of three models** was used, each with different pooling strategies (max or average). This can help reduce variance and improve generalization.
* **Early stopping** was applied to prevent overfitting. 


However, it doesn't mention techniques like:

* **Cross-validation**
* **Stratified splitting**
* **Using a diverse dataset** 


Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot definitively say what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
