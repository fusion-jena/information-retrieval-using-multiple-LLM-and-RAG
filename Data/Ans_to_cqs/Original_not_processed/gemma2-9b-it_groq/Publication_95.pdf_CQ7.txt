Answer:::
The provided text describes how the data was split for a specific deep learning project, but it doesn't explicitly state the general criteria used to split data for training, validation, and testing in deep learning. 

However, we can infer some criteria based on the text:

* **Independence:** Samples in each set (training, validation, test) must be independent of each other. This means images in the validation set shouldn't be related to images in the training set to avoid information leakage.
* **Similar Class Distributions:** Each set should have a similar distribution of classes as the full dataset. This ensures that the model is evaluated on a representative sample of the data.

Generally, the most common approach is to randomly split the data into these three sets. A typical split ratio is:

* **Training set:** 70-80%
* **Validation set:** 10-15%
* **Test set:** 10-15% 


The specific criteria and ratios may vary depending on the size and nature of the dataset, the complexity of the model, and the goals of the project.
