Answer:::
The provided text states that the deep learning models, specifically CNNs like ResNet and GoogLeNet, are trained for **classification**.  

The text explains that these models are trained to minimize the prediction loss, meaning they learn to assign the correct class label (e.g., Ziziphus lotus shrub or bare soil) to input images.
