Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning for land cover classification using Sentinel-2 imagery and doesn't delve into specific preprocessing steps for training deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps for image data used in deep learning include:

* **Normalization:** Scaling pixel values to a specific range, often between 0 and 1, to improve model training stability.
* **Resizing:** Adjusting image dimensions to match the input requirements of the deep learning model.
* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training dataset by applying transformations like rotation, flipping, and cropping.
* **Cleaning:** Removing noise, artifacts, or irrelevant information from the images. This can involve techniques like median filtering or cloud masking.

The specific preprocessing steps used will depend on the characteristics of the dataset and the requirements of the deep learning model.
