Answer:::
The provided text doesn't explicitly describe the strategy used to monitor model performance during training.  It mentions that training was stopped after 6900 iterations and that the model results demonstrate good performance on both the validation and testing sets. 

However, it doesn't detail how performance was tracked (e.g., using a loss function, accuracy metrics) or at what intervals these checks occurred.
