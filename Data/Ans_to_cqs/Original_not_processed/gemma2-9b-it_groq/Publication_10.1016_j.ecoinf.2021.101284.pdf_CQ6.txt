Answer:::

The provided text focuses on statistical models and data preprocessing techniques like standardization, not deep learning.  

While standardization (as described) is a form of normalization used in both statistical and deep learning models, it's not the only preprocessing step involved in training a deep learning model. 

Here are some common preprocessing steps used for deep learning:

* **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies.
* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones to improve model performance.
* **Normalization/Standardization:** Scaling features to a similar range (e.g., 0 to 1 or -1 to 1) to prevent features with larger scales from dominating the learning process.
* **Encoding Categorical Features:** Converting categorical variables into numerical representations that the model can understand (e.g., one-hot encoding).
* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training data by applying transformations to existing data (e.g., rotations, flips, crops for images).

The specific preprocessing steps will depend on the nature of the data and the deep learning model being used.
