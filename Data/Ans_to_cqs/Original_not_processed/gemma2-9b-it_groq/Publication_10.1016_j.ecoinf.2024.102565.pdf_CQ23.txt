Answer:::

The text describes several measures taken to enhance the generalizability of the deep learning model:

* **K-fold cross-validation:** This technique was used with K=4. Instead of splitting the data into separate training and validation sets, the data was divided into four folds. Each fold served as the validation set once, while the remaining three folds were used for training. This process was repeated four times, ensuring the model was exposed to different subsets of the data during training and evaluation.

* **Stratified sampling:**  The feature set was randomly divided into the four folds using stratified sampling. This method ensures that the proportion of different classes (or categories) is maintained in each fold, preventing bias towards certain classes during training.

* **Random under sampling (RUS):** To address imbalances in the dataset, RUS was applied to the training set. This technique randomly removes samples from the majority class to balance the representation of different classes in the training data.

While the text doesn't explicitly mention using a diverse dataset, the combination of K-fold cross-validation, stratified sampling, and RUS suggests an effort to create a robust and generalizable model by training it on various data subsets and mitigating class imbalances.
