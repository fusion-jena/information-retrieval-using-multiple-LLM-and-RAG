Answer:::
The provided text states that "early stopping was used to prevent overfitting".  It also says that "Typically, the model trained between 10 and 15 epochs before training ceased". 

Therefore, the training is likely stopped based on a combination of epochs reached and a monitoring of the validation loss for signs of overfitting.
