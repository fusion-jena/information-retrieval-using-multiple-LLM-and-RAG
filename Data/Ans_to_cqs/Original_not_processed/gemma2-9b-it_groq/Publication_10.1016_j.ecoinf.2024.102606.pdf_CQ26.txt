Answer:::
The provided text focuses on data augmentation techniques used to increase the size and diversity of the dataset, not on addressing data bias during preprocessing.  

While data augmentation can indirectly help mitigate some biases by exposing the model to a wider range of variations, it doesn't directly address issues like class imbalance or systematic representation issues within the data. 

Techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection are used to address data bias during preprocessing.  These methods aim to create a more balanced and representative training dataset, reducing the impact of bias on the model's performance.
