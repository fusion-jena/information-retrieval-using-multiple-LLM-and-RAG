Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the use of synthetic data for reef modeling and doesn't delve into specific strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines. 

However, it does mention the use of a Variational Autoencoder (TVAE) model, which inherently involves randomness through sampling from probability distributions during the encoding and decoding processes. 

Generally, to address randomness in deep learning, techniques like:

* **Setting a fixed random seed:** This ensures reproducibility by initializing random number generators with a specific value.
* **Dropout:** Randomly "dropping out" (ignoring) a percentage of neurons during training can help prevent overfitting and introduce stochasticity.
* **Batch normalization:** Normalizing activations within each mini-batch can stabilize training and reduce the impact of random initialization.

These strategies are commonly employed to manage randomness and improve the reliability and generalizability of deep learning models.
