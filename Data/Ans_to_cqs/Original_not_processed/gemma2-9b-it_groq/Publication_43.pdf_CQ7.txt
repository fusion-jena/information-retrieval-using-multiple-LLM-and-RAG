Answer:::
The provided text describes the dataset split for a CNN classifier used to map Ziziphus lotus shrubs. 

The dataset of 100 images for each class (Ziziphus lotus and Bare soil with sparse vegetation) was divided as follows:

* **Training:** 80 images per class were used for training the CNN model.
* **Validation:** 20 images per class were used for validating the trained CNN models. 

The text also mentions separate test zones (Test-Zone-1 and Test-Zone-2) for evaluating the model's performance on unseen data. 


It doesn't explicitly state the criteria used for splitting the data into these sets, but it's common practice in machine learning to:

* **Randomly shuffle** the dataset before splitting.
* **Use a consistent split ratio** (e.g., 80/20 for training/validation) to ensure reliable comparisons.
