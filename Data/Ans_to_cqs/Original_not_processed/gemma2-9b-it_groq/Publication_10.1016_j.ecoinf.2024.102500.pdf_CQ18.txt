Answer:::
The provided text describes the use of fivefold cross-validation to evaluate model performance during training. 

Here's how it works:

1. **Data Splitting:** The dataset is divided into five equal-sized folds.

2. **Iterative Training and Validation:** The training and assessment process is repeated five times. In each iteration, one fold is used for testing, while the remaining four folds are used for training.

3. **Performance Averaging:**  The R2 (coefficient of determination) and RMSE (root mean squared error) are calculated for each iteration.  Averaging these values across the five iterations provides a more robust estimate of the model's performance.


This cross-validation approach helps to ensure that the model is not overfitting to the training data and can generalize well to unseen data.
