Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the training and architecture of a deep learning model for insect classification, and doesn't delve into specific preprocessing techniques for addressing data bias. 

While it mentions the challenge of imbalanced datasets in entomology due to the diversity and variable abundance of insects, it doesn't describe methods used to mitigate this bias during preprocessing. 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer your query about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing.
