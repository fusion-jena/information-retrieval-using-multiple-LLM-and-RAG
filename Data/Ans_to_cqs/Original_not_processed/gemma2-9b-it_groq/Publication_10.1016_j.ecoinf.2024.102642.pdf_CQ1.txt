Answer:::

The provided text focuses on annotation methods for cetacean vocalizations, not data collection methods.  

It mentions:

* **Hydrophone recordings:**  Specifically, 7 hours of audio signals recorded in March 2015 at the SWAMS site in the Indian Ocean using a hydrophone deployed at 1000m depth.
* **OHASISBIO program:** This program appears to be the source of the hydrophone recordings used in the study.

The text does not describe other data collection methods like surveys or public datasets.
