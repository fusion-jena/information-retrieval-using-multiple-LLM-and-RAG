Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the training and evaluation of a model, particularly highlighting different attention modules and feature fusion networks.  

While it mentions evaluating the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, recall, F1-score, and mAP, it doesn't delve into specific post-processing steps like:

* **Saliency maps:** These highlight the regions of an input image that are most influential in the model's decision.
* **Confusion matrix:** This visualizes the performance of a classification model by showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot provide information on the exact post-processing steps involved.
