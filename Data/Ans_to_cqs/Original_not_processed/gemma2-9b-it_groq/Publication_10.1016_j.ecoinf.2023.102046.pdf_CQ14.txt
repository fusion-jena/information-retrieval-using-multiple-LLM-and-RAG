Answer:::
The provided text describes the hyperparameter search process but doesn't explicitly state the optimization method used (e.g., grid search, random search). 

It does mention exploring a range of values for each hyperparameter (C for SVC and Î± for ridge regression) and observing the resulting accuracy.  Based on this, it can be inferred that a form of grid search was likely employed, where a predefined set of values was tested.
