The provided text describes a deep learning model used for **semantic segmentation**. 

The text states: "The network consists of an encoder part where the model extracts potential useful features and the decoder part, which up-samples the extracted feature map to produce the final segmentation results." 

Semantic segmentation is a type of image analysis where the goal is to classify each pixel in an image into a specific category.
