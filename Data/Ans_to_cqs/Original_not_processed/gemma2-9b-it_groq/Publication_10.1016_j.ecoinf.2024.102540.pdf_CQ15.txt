Answer:::
The provided text does not specify the exact optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for training the YOLOv5 models.  While it mentions the use of  YOLOv5 models and  a NVIDIA A100 GPU, it doesn't delve into the specific optimization algorithms employed (e.g., SGD, Adam).
