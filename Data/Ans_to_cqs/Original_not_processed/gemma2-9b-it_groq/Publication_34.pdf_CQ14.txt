The provided text describes the use of stochastic gradient descent algorithms to optimize the NN parameters Î¸.  It mentions that the loss function gradient is approximated by the back-propagation algorithm. 

However, it does not specify the exact method used for hyperparameter tuning (e.g., grid search, random search).
