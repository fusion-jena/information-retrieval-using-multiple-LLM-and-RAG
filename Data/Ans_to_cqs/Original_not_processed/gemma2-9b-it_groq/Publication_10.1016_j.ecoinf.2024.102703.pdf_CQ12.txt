Answer:::
The provided text describes the use of a three-layer backpropagation artificial neural network.  While backpropagation is a common training algorithm for neural networks, the text doesn't specify if this is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer. 


It only mentions the network's structure (three layers with a single neuron in the hidden and output layers) and training parameters.
