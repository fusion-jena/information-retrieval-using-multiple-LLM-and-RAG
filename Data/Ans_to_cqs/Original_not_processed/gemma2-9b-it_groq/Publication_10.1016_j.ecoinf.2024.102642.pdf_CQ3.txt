Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the challenges and solutions related to annotating cetacean vocalizations for deep learning models.  

While it discusses the use of multiple annotators and techniques like majority voting and soft labeling to aggregate annotations, it doesn't specify the exact data annotation *techniques* used (e.g., bounding box annotation, instance segmentation). 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what specific data annotation techniques were employed.
