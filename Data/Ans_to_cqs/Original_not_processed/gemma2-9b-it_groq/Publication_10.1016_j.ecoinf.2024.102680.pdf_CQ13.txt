Answer:::
The provided text lists the hyperparameter settings for different object detection algorithms in Table 2.  

It states that SGD (stochastic gradient descent) and AdamW (adaptive moment estimation weight decay) are used as optimizers.  

Unfortunately, the specific learning rates for each algorithm are not detailed in the excerpt.
