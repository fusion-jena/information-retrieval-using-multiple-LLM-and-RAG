Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the development and evaluation of prediction models using artificial neural networks (ANNs) for estimating above-ground biomass. It doesn't delve into the specific optimization techniques employed within the deep learning pipeline. 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what optimization techniques are applied (e.g., SGD, Adam).
