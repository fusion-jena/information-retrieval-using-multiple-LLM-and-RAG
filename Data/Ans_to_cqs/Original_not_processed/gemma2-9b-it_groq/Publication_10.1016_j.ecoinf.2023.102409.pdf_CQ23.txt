Answer:::

The provided text does not specify the exact measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.  

While it mentions the use of a diverse dataset (remote sensing images of the study area), details about data preprocessing, splitting techniques (e.g., cross-validation, stratified splitting), or hyperparameter tuning strategies for enhancing model generalization are not provided.
