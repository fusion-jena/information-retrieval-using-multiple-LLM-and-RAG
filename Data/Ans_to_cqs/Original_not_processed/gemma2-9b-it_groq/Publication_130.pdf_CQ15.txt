Answer:::
The provided text mentions using different hyper-parameter settings, such as the learning rate, to optimize the performance of CNNs.  It also states that other optimization techniques exist but doesn't specify them. 

Therefore, while it mentions hyper-parameter tuning, the specific optimization techniques like SGD or Adam are not mentioned in the text.
