Answer:::
The provided text describes the development and training of a deep learning model for hummingbird detection but doesn't detail the deployment process.  It mentions that a DeepMeerkat executable is available for download for Mac and Windows with a pre-trained hummingbird model. It also states that reproducible scripts for local and Google cloud environments are provided to allow users to train new models. 

Based on this information, we can infer that the model was likely serialized (saved in a format suitable for loading and using in other applications) and that the deployment process involves distributing this serialized model along with the necessary code and instructions for users to run it locally or on Google Cloud.
