Answer:::
The deep learning model is used for **semantic segmentation**. 

The text states: "Therefore, we employed data augmentation strategies to increase the training set size fourfold: horizontal flip, Gaussian noise addition, and contrast reduction. The first two augmentation strategies are fairly common. The contrast reduction strategy was specifically motivated by our application, namely given that we expect the images to contain shadows occluding the vegetation types, contrast reduction helps to simulate areas of low lighting which can be expected in the dataset. **Since the multi-class (i.e. 10 classes) semantic segmentation problem is quite complex, the set of 290 training images was found to be insufficient to obtain satisfactory results, even with the use of the transfer learning framework.**" 


Semantic segmentation is a type of image analysis where each pixel in an image is classified into a specific category.
