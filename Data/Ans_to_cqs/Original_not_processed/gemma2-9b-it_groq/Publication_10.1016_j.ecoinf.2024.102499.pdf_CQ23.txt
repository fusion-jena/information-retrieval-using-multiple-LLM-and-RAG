Answer:::
The text describes a 5-fold cross-validation strategy to assess the model's generalizability.  

Here's how it was implemented:

* **Splitting:** 80% of the dataset (Videoclips) was randomly selected for training, and the remaining 20% for testing in each fold. 
* **Dataset:** The dataset consisted of video clips (Videoclips) and 1-hour videos (Testingstations).

The authors chose to split the data based on videos rather than individual images because images from the same video are highly similar. This could lead to a model that overfits to the training data and performs poorly on unseen data.

The text also mentions training the model on two different sets of species:

* **3 common shark species:**  This likely represents a more focused training set.
* **27 species:** This likely represents a more diverse training set.

The performance of the model on these two different training sets is compared using precision, recall, and F-measure metrics. 


The text does not mention other generalizability techniques like stratified splitting or using a diverse dataset in terms of environmental conditions or video quality.
