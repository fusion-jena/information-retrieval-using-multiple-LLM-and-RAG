Answer:::
The provided text focuses on a decision tree-based model, not a deep learning model. Therefore, it doesn't describe measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. 

The text does mention some techniques used for the decision tree model, which might be relevant for generalizability in general:

* **Multiple seeds:**  Different random seeds were used to select model parameters, aiming for stability and reliability.
* **Grid search:**  A systematic search over a range of parameter values was conducted to find the optimal combination for performance.
* **Cross-validation:**  This technique was used to evaluate the model's performance and prevent overfitting.
* **Stratified random sampling:**  The data was split into training and testing sets in a way that preserves the distribution of AGB values, ensuring the model is representative of the data.
