Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning in analyzing aerial imagery for wildlife conservation.  It specifically mentions:

* **SRF-OCC surveys:**  These are likely aerial surveys using specialized equipment (the "SRF" part might stand for "Spatial Remote Sensing Framework") that capture images over large areas. 

* **High-definition oblique camera systems:** These are cameras mounted on aircraft that capture images at an angle, providing a more three-dimensional view of the landscape.

Therefore, the raw data for deep learning in this context is likely collected through **aerial surveys using specialized cameras**.
