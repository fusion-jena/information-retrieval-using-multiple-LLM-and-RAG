Answer:::
The provided text describes the training process and the chosen parameters but doesn't explicitly state the strategy used to monitor model performance during training. 

It does mention the use of an "early stopping function" which halts the learning process if there's no improvement in accuracy after 20 epochs. This suggests that accuracy is likely the metric used to monitor performance, and the early stopping mechanism prevents overfitting by stopping training when performance plateaus.
