Answer:::
The provided text mentions data augmentation as a technique to prevent overfitting.  

Data augmentation involves artificially increasing the size and variability of the training dataset by applying transformations to existing images, such as:

* Random cropping
* Horizontal/vertical flipping
* Image rotation
* Image translation
* Zooming
* Brightness adjustment
* Contrast adjustment
* Hue and saturation adjustment
* Gaussian noise
* Random erasing

While the text doesn't explicitly list regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization, these are common techniques used in deep learning to prevent overfitting.
