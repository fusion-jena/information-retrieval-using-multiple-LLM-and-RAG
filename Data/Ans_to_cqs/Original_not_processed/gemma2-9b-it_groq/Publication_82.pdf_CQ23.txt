The text states that the model's accuracy is reduced when tested on images taken under different conditions than the training images.  

To address this, the authors mention that "a more diverse set of training data is needed to improve the accuracy" and that "corresponding data collection efforts are underway." 

However, the provided text does not describe the use of techniques like cross-validation, stratified splitting, or other methods to ensure the generalizability of the model during the training process.
