Answer:::
The provided text does not specify the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. It mentions the use of machine learning algorithms like RandomForest, Treenet, CART, and MARS within a Salford Predictive Modeler (SPM) framework. However, it doesn't delve into the specific hyperparameters for these algorithms or any potential deep learning components.
