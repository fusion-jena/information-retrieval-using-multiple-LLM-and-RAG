The provided text focuses on the dataset, model architecture (ResNet50), training process, and performance comparison with PlantNet.  

It doesn't describe any post-processing steps like:

* **Saliency maps:**  Visualizing which parts of the input image the model focuses on for making a prediction.
* **Metrics calculation:**  Quantifying the model's performance beyond accuracy, such as precision, recall, F1-score, etc.
* **Confusion matrix:**  A table showing the counts of correct and incorrect predictions for each class. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what post-processing steps are involved.
