Answer:::

The provided text focuses on image classification of crop pests and doesn't delve into specific strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. 

However, it does mention the issue of "weak validation procedures â€“ like random data splitting" potentially leading to overestimation of model performance. This suggests an awareness of the need to address randomness in data splitting for reliable model evaluation.

Generally, common strategies to mitigate randomness in deep learning include:

* **Setting a fixed random seed:** This ensures that the same random numbers are generated each time the code is run, leading to reproducible results.
* **Stratified sampling:**  When splitting data, stratified sampling ensures that the proportion of each class is maintained in both the training and validation sets, reducing the impact of random chance on class representation.
* **Cross-validation:** Techniques like k-fold cross-validation involve splitting the data into multiple folds and training the model on different combinations of these folds. This helps average out the impact of randomness in data partitioning.
