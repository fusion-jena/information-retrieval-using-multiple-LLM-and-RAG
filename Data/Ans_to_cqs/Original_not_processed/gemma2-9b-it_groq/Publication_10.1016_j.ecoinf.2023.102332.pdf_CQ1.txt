Answer:::
The provided text focuses on analyzing hiker perceptions from crowdsourced text data on the Wikiloc platform.  

It describes the process of:

* **Data Collection:**  Hiker descriptions of their outdoor experiences are gathered from Wikiloc posts.
* **Data Preprocessing:**  
    * Text translation into English using DeepL.
    * Natural language processing (NLP) techniques like tokenization, lemmatization, and stop word removal using R packages `tidytext` and `tm`.

The text doesn't mention the original method used by hikers to provide their descriptions on Wikiloc (e.g., text input through a website or app). 


Therefore, we can't definitively say what methods were used for collecting the raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
