Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the application of active learning in building a deep learning model for bird call recognition, particularly for the southern black-throated finch.  While it mentions using "field recordings" as the training data source, it doesn't delve into the specific methods used for collecting these recordings. 

Therefore, based on the given context, we can infer that **field surveys** likely involved using **audio recording devices** to capture bird vocalizations in their natural habitat. 


It's important to note that the text doesn't explicitly confirm these methods, and other possibilities like using public datasets of bird calls could also be involved.
