Answer:::
The provided text describes the use of a Random Forest (RF) algorithm for burned area (BA) classification. It mentions recursive validation of the BA classification algorithm over independent wildfires to determine the optimal number of trees (500) for computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. 

However, the text does not explicitly detail the specific strategy implemented to monitor model performance *during* training.  It only states that recursive validation was used *after* determining the number of trees.
