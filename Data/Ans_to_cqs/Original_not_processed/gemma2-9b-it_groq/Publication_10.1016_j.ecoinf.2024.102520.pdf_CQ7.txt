Answer:::
The provided text focuses on geospatial analysis and soil property modeling, and doesn't contain information about data splitting criteria for deep learning. 

To answer your query about data splitting for deep learning, here's a common approach:

* **Training Set:** The largest portion of the data (e.g., 70-80%) is used to train the deep learning model. The model learns patterns and relationships within this data.
* **Validation Set:** A smaller portion of the data (e.g., 10-15%) is used to evaluate the model's performance during training. This helps prevent overfitting, where the model learns the training data too well and performs poorly on unseen data.

* **Test Set:**  A separate portion of the data (e.g., 10-15%) is held out entirely from training and used only to assess the final performance of the trained model on unseen data. This provides an unbiased estimate of how well the model will generalize to new examples.
