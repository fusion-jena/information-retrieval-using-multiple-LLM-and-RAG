Answer:::
The text states that three standard metrics were used to evaluate the models: 

* **MSE** (Mean Squared Error)
* **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error)
* **r2** (coefficient of determination) 


It also mentions that the grid search focused on minimizing the MSE to find the optimal hyperparameters.
