Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model described in the text is **classification**. 

The text states that the model "builds on previous successes using CNNs and spectrogram data to classify 984 bird species." It further mentions that the classification block "resulted in probability predictions for all 987 classes per second." This clearly indicates that the model is designed to assign a label (bird species) to an input spectrogram.
