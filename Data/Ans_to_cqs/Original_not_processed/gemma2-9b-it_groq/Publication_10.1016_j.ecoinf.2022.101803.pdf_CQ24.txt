Answer:::

The provided text focuses on ensemble methods, particularly random forests, and doesn't delve into the specifics of randomness handling in deep learning pipelines. 

However, I can offer some general strategies commonly used in deep learning to manage randomness:

* **Random Seed Initialization:**  Deep learning models often rely on random initialization of weights. Setting a fixed random seed ensures that the initial weights are the same every time you run the code, leading to reproducible results.

* **Dropout:** This regularization technique randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during each training step. This prevents overfitting and introduces stochasticity into the model.

* **Batch Normalization:** This technique normalizes the activations of neurons within each mini-batch during training. This helps stabilize training and reduce the impact of random variations in the data.

* **Data Augmentation:**  For image data, techniques like random cropping, flipping, and color adjustments are used to create variations of the training data. This increases the diversity of the training set and helps the model generalize better.
