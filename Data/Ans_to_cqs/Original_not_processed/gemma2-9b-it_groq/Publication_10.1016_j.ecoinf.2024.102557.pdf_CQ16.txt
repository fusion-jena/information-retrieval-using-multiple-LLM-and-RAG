Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the methods used to predict biogeographical patterns of fungal productivity and doesn't specify the criteria used to determine the completion of training for the machine learning models. 

It does mention that hyperparameters were tuned using Bayesian optimization to minimize the root mean squared error (RMSE) of predictions based on environmental cross-validation. This suggests that the training process likely continues until the RMSE on a validation set reaches a satisfactory level. 

However, the exact criteria for determining when training is complete (e.g., validation loss plateau) are not described in the given text.
