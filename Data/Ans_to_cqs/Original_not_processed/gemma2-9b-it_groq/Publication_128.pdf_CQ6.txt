Answer: The provided text describes the training process of six neural network models but doesn't explicitly list all preprocessing steps involved before training. 

However, it does mention the following preprocessing steps:

* **Normalization:** The input data is batch normalized before training. This likely involves scaling the pixel values to have zero mean and unit variance, which can help stabilize training.
* **Resolution:** The input data resolution is fixed to 224x224 pixels. This suggests resizing images to this standard size before training. 


The text doesn't mention other common preprocessing steps like:

* **Data Cleaning:** Removing noise, outliers, or irrelevant data from the dataset.
* **Scaling:**  Scaling pixel values to a specific range (e.g., 0 to 1) to improve model performance.
* **Augmentation:**  Applying random transformations to the data (e.g., rotation, flipping, cropping) to increase the size and diversity of the training set.
