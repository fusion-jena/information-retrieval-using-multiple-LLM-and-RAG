Answer:::
The provided text describes the AODEGRU model architecture and training process but doesn't explicitly state the strategy used to monitor model performance during training. 

We can infer some aspects based on the outlined steps:

* **Loss Calculation:** The text mentions calculating the loss between predicted and true labels for each mini-batch (step 25). This loss function likely serves as a primary metric to track the model's performance.
* **Accuracy Tracking:**  The text refers to "total correct predictions" (step 7) and "training loss and accuracy for each epoch" (step 3). This suggests that accuracy is also monitored during training.
* **Epoch-wise Evaluation:** The training loop iterates over epochs (step 5), implying that performance metrics like loss and accuracy are calculated and potentially visualized at the end of each epoch.

However, the text lacks details on specific techniques like:

* **Validation Set:** Whether a separate validation set is used to evaluate the model's generalization ability during training.
* **Early Stopping:** Whether early stopping is employed to prevent overfitting by monitoring performance on the validation set and stopping training if it starts to decrease.
* **Learning Rate Scheduling:** Whether the learning rate is adjusted during training to optimize convergence.



Therefore, while we can infer some basic performance monitoring practices, the exact strategy employed remains unclear based on the provided information.
