Answer:::
The provided text doesn't explicitly describe a specific strategy for monitoring model performance during training. 

It mentions adjusting parameters like regularization strength, voxel size, and batch size to optimize results. It also states that the "hold-out method" was used to split data into training and test sets, implying that performance was evaluated on the held-out test set. 

However, details about metrics used during training (e.g., loss function, accuracy on a validation set) or techniques like early stopping are not provided.
