Answer:::

The provided text focuses on NDVI reconstruction techniques and doesn't delve into the specifics of handling randomness in deep learning pipelines.  

To answer your query about strategies for handling randomness in deep learning, here are some common techniques:

* **Setting a Random Seed:**  This initializes the random number generator, ensuring that the same "random" values are produced every time you run your code. This is crucial for reproducibility.

* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of your training data by applying random transformations (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) to existing images. This helps the model generalize better to unseen data.

* **Dropout:**  Randomly "dropping out" (ignoring) a percentage of neurons during each training step. This prevents overfitting by forcing the network to learn more robust features.

* **Batch Normalization:**  Normalizes the activations of each layer, reducing internal covariate shift and stabilizing training.

* **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):**  Uses a random subset (batch) of the training data for each update to the model's weights. This introduces randomness and helps escape local minima.
