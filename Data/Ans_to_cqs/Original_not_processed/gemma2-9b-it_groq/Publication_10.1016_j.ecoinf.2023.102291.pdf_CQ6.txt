Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the architecture and training process of convolutional neural networks for animal sound classification. It doesn't specify the exact preprocessing steps taken for the audio data before training. 

However, common preprocessing steps for audio data in deep learning include:

* **Normalization:** Scaling the audio amplitude to a specific range (e.g., -1 to 1) to prevent features with larger magnitudes from dominating the learning process.
* **Windowing:** Dividing the audio signal into smaller segments (windows) to process manageable chunks of data.
* **Feature Extraction:** Transforming the audio signal into numerical features that the model can understand. This could involve techniques like Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) or spectrograms.
* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the dataset by applying transformations like time stretching, pitch shifting, or adding noise to the audio.

The specific preprocessing steps used would depend on the characteristics of the audio data and the chosen deep learning model.
