Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the specific purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated. 

However, the text mentions "deep learning for feature extraction in remote sensing: a case-study of aerial scene classification" (Petrovska et al., 2020). This suggests that the deep learning model is likely used for **classification** in the context of remote sensing imagery.
