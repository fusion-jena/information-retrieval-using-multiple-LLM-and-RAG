Answer:::
The provided text describes the dataset split, deep learning model training process, and experimental setup but doesn't detail the post-processing steps taken after model training.  

Therefore, I cannot answer what post-processing steps were involved, such as saliency map generation, metric calculation, or confusion matrix construction, based on the given context.
