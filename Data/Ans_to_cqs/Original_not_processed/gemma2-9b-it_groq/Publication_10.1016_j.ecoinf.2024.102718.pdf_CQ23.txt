Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the performance of a proposed BEiT model for leaf disease classification and doesn't explicitly mention specific techniques used to ensure its generalizability. 

The text states that the model was evaluated on two datasets: PlantVillage and Dhan-Shomadhan. It also mentions adding noise to the data for robustness testing. However, it doesn't describe methods like:

* **Diverse dataset:**  Information about the diversity of the datasets (e.g., plant species, disease types, environmental conditions) is limited.
* **Cross-validation:**  The text doesn't mention the use of cross-validation techniques (e.g., k-fold cross-validation) to evaluate the model's performance on different data splits.
* **Stratified splitting:**  There's no information about whether the data was split into training and testing sets using stratified sampling to maintain class proportions. 


Therefore, based on the given context, we cannot definitively say what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
