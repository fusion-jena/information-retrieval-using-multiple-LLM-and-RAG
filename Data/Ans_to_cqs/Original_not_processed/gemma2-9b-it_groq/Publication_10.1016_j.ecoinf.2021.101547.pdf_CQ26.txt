Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the challenges and considerations of using deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for image analysis. It discusses topics like mini-batch size selection, computational complexity, and the lack of standardized approaches in deep learning. 

However, the text does not delve into specific techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing stage of a deep learning pipeline.  Therefore, I cannot answer your query based on the given context.
