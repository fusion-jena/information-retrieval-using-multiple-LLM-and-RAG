Answer:::
The provided text describes the model's performance evaluation metrics (MAPE, MSE, RMSE, and correlation coefficient) but doesn't explicitly state the strategy used to monitor performance *during* training. 

It does mention that the number of neurons in the hidden layer was incrementally changed to find the optimal configuration, implying that performance was assessed at each step of this process. However, it doesn't detail the specific metrics or thresholds used to determine if the model was learning successfully.
