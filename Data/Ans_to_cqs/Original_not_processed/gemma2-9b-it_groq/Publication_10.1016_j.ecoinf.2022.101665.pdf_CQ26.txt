Answer:::

The provided text focuses on bias in map accuracy estimates from cross-validation, particularly in the context of environmental mapping with clustered samples. It doesn't discuss techniques for addressing data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. 

However, I can provide some common techniques used for that purpose:

* **Stratified Splitting:** This technique divides the data into subgroups (strata) based on relevant features (e.g., class labels) and ensures that each subgroup is proportionally represented in the training, validation, and test sets. This helps prevent overrepresentation of certain classes and improves model generalization.

* **Oversampling:** This method addresses class imbalance by duplicating instances from the minority class. Techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) can create synthetic instances to further increase the representation of the minority class.

* **Undersampling:** This approach reduces the number of instances in the majority class to balance the dataset. It can involve randomly removing instances or using more sophisticated techniques like Tomek links to remove instances that are close to instances of the minority class.

* **Diverse Data Collection:**  This involves actively seeking out and incorporating data from a wide range of sources and perspectives to ensure the training data is representative of the real-world distribution.
