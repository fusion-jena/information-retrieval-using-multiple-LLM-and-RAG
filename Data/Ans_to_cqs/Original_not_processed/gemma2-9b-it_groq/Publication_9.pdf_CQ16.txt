Answer:::
The provided text does not specify the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete for the Sashimi model.  It mentions that users should anticipate "iteratively training models with different sized training datasets and parameters until suitable performance is achieved." 

It also highlights the importance of evaluating performance using metrics like mean Intersection over Union (IoU) and suggests that users consider their specific needs and desired accuracy for downstream tasks when determining if training is sufficient.
