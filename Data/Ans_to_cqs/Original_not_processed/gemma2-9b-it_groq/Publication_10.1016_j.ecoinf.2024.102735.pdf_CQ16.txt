Answer:::
The provided text describes the methodology used in a study but doesn't specify the exact criteria for determining when training is complete for the machine learning models. 

It does mention:

* **Hyperparameter tuning:** The study uses Optuna to optimize model hyperparameters. This process likely involves evaluating model performance on a validation set and adjusting hyperparameters to improve it.
* **1000 iterations:** The model training and testing processes are repeated for 1000 iterations, each time using distinct sample sets.

However, it doesn't state whether training stops when validation loss plateaus, reaches a minimum, or after a specific number of epochs.
