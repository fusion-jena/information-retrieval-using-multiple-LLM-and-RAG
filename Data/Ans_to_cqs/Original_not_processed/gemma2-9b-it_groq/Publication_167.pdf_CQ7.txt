Answer:::
The provided text describes a data splitting strategy that involves:

* **Training Set:** Used for model fitting. It comprises the majority of the data (5.4% according to the given percentage).
* **Validation Set:** A subset of the data (0.6%) used to adjust model hyperparameters and evaluate the model's performance during training.
* **Testing Set:** A separate portion of the data (1%) used *only* to assess the final model's ability to generalize to unseen data. 

The text also mentions 10-fold cross-validation, where the training and validation sets are further divided into ten parts. Nine parts are used for training, and one is used for validation. This process is repeated ten times, with each part serving as the validation set once. The mean performance across these ten iterations is used to estimate the model's accuracy. 


The text does not explicitly state the criteria used to split the data into these sets.
