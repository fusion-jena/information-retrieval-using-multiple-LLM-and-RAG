Answer:::
The provided text describes the fine-tuning process of a pre-trained deep learning model for wildlife detection in aerial imagery.  

It details the steps taken to enhance the model's performance using a technique called SAL (likely an acronym for a specific method). This involves:

1. Initial training with positive patches (images containing the target species) for 200 epochs.
2.  Incorporating hard negative patches (false positives) into the training data for an additional 50 epochs to reduce false positives.

However, the text does **not** provide information about the process of deploying the trained model, such as:

* Model serialization (saving the trained model for later use)
* Platform selection (where the model will be run, e.g., cloud, edge device)
*  Integration with any specific software or systems 


Therefore, I cannot answer your query based on the given context.
