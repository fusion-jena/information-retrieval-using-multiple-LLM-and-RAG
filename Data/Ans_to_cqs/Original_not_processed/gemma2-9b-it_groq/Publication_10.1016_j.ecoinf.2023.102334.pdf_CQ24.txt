Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the implementation of a specific deep learning model and doesn't delve into general strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. 

However, I can tell you that randomness is inherent in many aspects of deep learning, including:

* **Data Shuffling:** Training data is often shuffled randomly before each epoch to prevent the model from learning patterns specific to a particular data order.
* **Weight Initialization:** Initializing the model's weights with random values is common practice. Different initialization techniques (e.g., Xavier, He) aim to improve training stability.
* **Dropout:** This regularization technique randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during each training step, preventing overfitting and introducing stochasticity.
* **Batch Normalization:** This technique normalizes the activations of each layer across a mini-batch of data, which can introduce some randomness due to the batch sampling.

To mitigate the impact of randomness and ensure reproducibility, practitioners often use:

* **Random Seed Setting:**  Specifying a fixed random seed value ensures that the same random numbers are generated across multiple runs, making the results reproducible.
