Answer:::
The provided text describes the use of 5-fold cross-validation for model evaluation.  

Within each fold of the cross-validation, the data is split into three subsets:

* **Training set (90% of images):** Used to train the deep learning models.
* **Validation set (10% of images):** Used to evaluate the performance of the models during training and guide hyperparameter tuning.
* **Test set:**  While the text describes the training and validation split, it doesn't explicitly mention how a separate test set is used.  It's common practice to hold out a portion of the data for a final test after training and hyperparameter tuning are complete.
