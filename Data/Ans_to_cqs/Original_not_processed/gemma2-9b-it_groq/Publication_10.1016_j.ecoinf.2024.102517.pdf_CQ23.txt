Answer: 

The provided text describes the experimental setup and the architecture of the deep learning model but does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.  

It does state that the model was trained for 50 epochs on an RTX 2080 Ti GPU using the Adam optimizer and a learning rate of 10. It also mentions that the entire training set was presented in a random order in each epoch. However, there is no information about data splitting techniques like cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the use of a diverse dataset to assess the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.
