Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning for **classification** of birdsong. 

Several examples are given:

*  Xie et al. used deep learning to classify 18 species of birds.
* Piczak used deep learning to identify South American birds.
* TÂ´oth et al. used CNN for feature learning in bird classification.
* Bai et al. used deep learning with data enhancement to improve bird sound detection.
* Xie and Zhu used CNN for learning features and classifying 14 bird species.
* Liu et al. used a multi-scale CNN to classify birdsong based on wavelet transform spectra. 


All these examples demonstrate the use of deep learning for categorizing different bird species based on their vocalizations.
