Answer:::
The provided text focuses on acoustic detection of species using deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It doesn't delve into the specific criteria used for splitting data in deep learning model training (train, test, validation). 

To answer your query generally:

Data splitting in deep learning is crucial for evaluating model performance.  A common approach is:

* **Training set:**  The largest portion (e.g., 70-80%) used to train the model, enabling it to learn patterns and relationships in the data.
* **Validation set:** A smaller portion (e.g., 10-15%) used during training to monitor performance on unseen data. This helps prevent overfitting (where the model performs well on training data but poorly on new data).
* **Test set:**  A separate, held-out portion (e.g., 10-15%) used *only* after training is complete to provide an unbiased estimate of the model's performance on completely new data. 

The exact split ratios can vary depending on the dataset size and specific problem.
