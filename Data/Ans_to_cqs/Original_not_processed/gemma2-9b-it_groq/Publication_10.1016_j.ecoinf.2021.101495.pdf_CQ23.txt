Answer:::

The provided text describes the training process and results of two deep learning models for fish segmentation and classification. However, it doesn't explicitly mention specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the models. 

The text states that the models were trained on 14,896 images from 22 fishing sets. It also mentions data augmentation, which can help improve generalizability by increasing the diversity of the training data. 

However, information about:

* **Dataset diversity:**  Whether the 22 fishing sets represent a diverse range of fish species, sizes, environments, and lighting conditions is not provided.
* **Cross-validation:**  Whether techniques like k-fold cross-validation were used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data is not mentioned.
* **Stratified splitting:**  Whether the dataset was split into training and validation sets in a stratified manner to maintain the proportion of different classes is unclear. 


Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively say what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning models.
