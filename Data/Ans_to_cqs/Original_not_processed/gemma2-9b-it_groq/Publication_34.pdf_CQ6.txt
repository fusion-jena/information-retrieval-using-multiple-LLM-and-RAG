Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the use of Batch-Normalization in a specific deep learning model architecture and doesn't describe general preprocessing steps for training deep learning models. 

While it mentions Batch-Normalization as a technique applied to pre-activations (before the ReLU layer), it doesn't detail other common preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning.
