Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the performance of a WT-HMM model in relation to varying dataset sizes and doesn't explicitly mention specific techniques used to ensure the generalizability of the model, such as cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the use of a diverse dataset. 

It does state that the experiments were performed over 10 runs to account for variability introduced by random factors in the model training process (e.g., random weight initialization).
