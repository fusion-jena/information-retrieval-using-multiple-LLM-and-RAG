Answer:::
The provided text describes a pipeline that uses a combination of an Autoencoder and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). 

While the text mentions other deep learning models like CNNs and Diffusion models, it explicitly states that an Autoencoder is used to extract latent representations and an MLP is trained for fish event classification. 


Therefore, the primary deep learning models used in this pipeline are **Autoencoders** and **Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs)**.
