Answer:::
The provided text states that the performance of the models was evaluated using matrices such as precision, recall, and average precision (AP) at various Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds.  

Specifically, AP0.5, which represents the average precision at a 50% IoU, was used as a measure of the overall detection performance. 

The evaluation metrics were calculated after 300 epochs on the validation set. 


Therefore, the strategy implemented to monitor model performance during training involved:

1. **Using evaluation matrices:** Precision, recall, and AP at different IoU thresholds were used.
2. **Focusing on AP0.5:** This metric provided a balanced reflection of the global detection performance.
3. **Regular evaluation:** Metrics were calculated after every 300 epochs on the validation set.
