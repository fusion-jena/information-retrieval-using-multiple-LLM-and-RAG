Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the design and optimization of lightweight deep learning models, particularly the SIAlex model. It doesn't delve into the specific preprocessing steps involved in training deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

* **Normalization:** Scaling the features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1) can improve model performance.

* **Feature Scaling:** Techniques like standardization (subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation) can help features with different scales contribute equally to the learning process.

* **Encoding Categorical Features:** Converting categorical variables into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding) is necessary for most deep learning models.

* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training data by applying transformations (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) can enhance model robustness.
