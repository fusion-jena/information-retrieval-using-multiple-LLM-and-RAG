Answer:::
The provided text does not specify the exact data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for land cover classification.  

While it mentions the training of a neural network using datasets of land cover forms and their spectral signatures, it doesn't delve into the specifics of how these datasets were prepared for training. 

To determine the annotation techniques used (e.g., bounding box annotation, instance segmentation), you would need to consult additional resources such as:

* The original research paper or report describing the study.
* Any publicly available code or documentation related to the project.
* Contacting the authors of the study directly.
