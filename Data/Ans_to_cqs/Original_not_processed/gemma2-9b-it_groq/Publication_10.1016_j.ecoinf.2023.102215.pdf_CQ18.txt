Answer:::
The provided text states that the training process takes approximately 11.5 hours and that the training loss converges after 65K iterations.  

It also mentions using the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss function to measure the difference between the predicted probability and the actual value. Minimizing this difference is presented as indicating a better training effect. 


However, the text does not explicitly describe any specific strategies or metrics used to monitor model performance *during* training beyond the convergence of the training loss.
