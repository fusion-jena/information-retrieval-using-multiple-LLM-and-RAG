Answer:::
The provided text does not specify the exact type of deep learning model used. It only mentions that an "artificial neural network (ANN)" was implemented. 

While ANN is a broad term encompassing various architectures, the text doesn't give details about the specific structure (e.g., number of layers, activation functions) that would allow us to classify it as CNN, RNN, Transformer, or another type.
