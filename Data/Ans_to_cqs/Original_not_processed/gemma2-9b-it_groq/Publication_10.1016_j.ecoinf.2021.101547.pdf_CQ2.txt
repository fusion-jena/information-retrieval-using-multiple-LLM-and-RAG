Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the training of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification. It specifically mentions:

* **Image data:** The CNN processes RGB images with a size of 224 Ã— 224 pixels. 
* **CSV:** While not explicitly stated, it's common for CSV files to be used for storing training labels associated with images.

Therefore, based on the context, the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are likely **image** (specifically RGB images) and **CSV** (for labels).
