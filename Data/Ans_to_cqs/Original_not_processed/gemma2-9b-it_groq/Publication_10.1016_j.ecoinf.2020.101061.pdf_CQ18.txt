Answer:::
The provided text describes the methods used to evaluate model performance, not the strategies used to monitor it during training.  

The text mentions a sensitivity study where models were trained using different proportions of training data (5%, 25%, 50%, 75%) to determine the optimal amount of training data needed for maximum performance. It also discusses the use of ablation curves (Figure 7) to visualize the impact of varying amounts of hand-annotated training data on model performance. 

However, it does not describe any specific strategies or metrics used to monitor model performance *during* the training process itself.
