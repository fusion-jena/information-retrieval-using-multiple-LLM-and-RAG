Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning in remote sensing, particularly for forest analysis. It describes the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and mentions the use of optical images and SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images as input data. 

However, it doesn't specify the exact methods used for collecting these raw data.  It does state that the optical images are selected based on their acquisition year and that SAR images are chosen with acquisition dates near the optical image. 


It's likely that the data is sourced from publicly available remote sensing datasets, but the text doesn't confirm this.
