Answer:::
The provided text describes the following preprocessing steps:

* **Data Splitting:** The data is divided into training (80%), validation (10%), and test sets (10%). 
* **Transformation:**
    * **MinMaxScaler:** This technique is used to scale features to a specific range, often between 0 and 1. It's particularly important for algorithms sensitive to feature scales, like Support Vector Regressor (SVR) and neural networks.
    * **LabelEncoder:** This method transforms categorical data (e.g., soil types, crop varieties) into numerical labels, making it suitable for machine learning algorithms.

The text doesn't explicitly mention other common preprocessing steps like:

* **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies.
* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones to improve model performance.
