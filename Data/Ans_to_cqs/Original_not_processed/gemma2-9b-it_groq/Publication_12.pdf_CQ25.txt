Answer:::
The provided text states that the deep learning model, BatNet, is used for "optimizing the parameters in the model using the reference dataset."  It also says that the network is "specifically for the tropical bats" and is designed to "extract acoustic features from spectrum images." 

Based on this information, the purpose of the deep learning model appears to be **classification**.  It is likely trained to classify bat calls from different species based on the acoustic features extracted from their spectrum images.
