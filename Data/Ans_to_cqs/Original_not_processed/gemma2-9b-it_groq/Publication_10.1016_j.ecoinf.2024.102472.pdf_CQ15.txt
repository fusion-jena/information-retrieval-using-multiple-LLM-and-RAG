Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the description of  a specific deep learning model (MLPNN) and its training process. It mentions the use of backpropagation for weight adjustment during training but doesn't specify the exact optimization algorithm used (e.g., SGD, Adam). 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what optimization techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline.
