Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the hardware aspects of deep learning, particularly comparing the performance of CPUs and GPUs. It doesn't discuss metrics used to evaluate deep learning model performance. 

Common metrics for evaluating deep learning models include:

* **Accuracy:** The percentage of correctly classified instances.
* **Precision:**  The proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions.
* **Recall:** The proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances.
* **F1-score:**  A harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure.
* **Loss Function:**  Measures the difference between predicted and actual values, guiding the model training process.
