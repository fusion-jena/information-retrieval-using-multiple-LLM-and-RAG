Answer:::
The provided text states that the available data is frequently split into a training data set (used for training) and a test data set.  

It mentions that the training of the network is stopped when the accuracy on the test dataset stops increasing. This implies that the test dataset is used to evaluate the performance of the trained model on unseen data. 

The text does not explicitly describe criteria for splitting the data or mention a validation dataset.
