Answer:::

The provided text describes the model tuning and evaluation strategies but doesn't explicitly state the method used to monitor model performance *during* training.  

It mentions:

* **Grid search** for finding optimal parameter values for RF, XGBoost, and SVR.
* **Performance indices** like "percent IncMSE", "IncNodePurity", "Gain", and "Frequency" for assessing variable importance and indirectly evaluating model performance.
* **Evaluation metrics** used after training, but not during.

Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot determine the specific strategy used to monitor model performance during training.
