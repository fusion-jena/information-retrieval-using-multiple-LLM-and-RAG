Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the application of machine learning algorithms (KNN, SVM, PCA-SVM) for analyzing movement patterns in zebrafish and rats within a T-maze. It does not delve into the specifics of deep learning techniques or optimization algorithms commonly used in deep learning pipelines (e.g., SGD, Adam). 


Therefore, I cannot answer your query based on the given context.
