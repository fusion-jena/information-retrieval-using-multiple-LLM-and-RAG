Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the architecture of a deep learning model called YWnet and doesn't describe the criteria used to split data for training, testing, and validation. 

However, a common practice is to split data into these sets based on:

* **Percentage Split:** A common approach is to divide the data into roughly 70-80% for training, 10-15% for validation, and 10-15% for testing. 

* **Stratification:**  If the dataset has imbalanced classes (some classes have significantly more samples than others), stratification ensures that the class distribution is maintained in each split (train, validation, test).

The goal is to have representative subsets of the data for each purpose:

* **Training:**  The model learns patterns and relationships from this largest dataset.
* **Validation:**  Used during training to monitor performance on unseen data and fine-tune hyperparameters.
* **Testing:**  A final evaluation of the trained model's performance on completely unseen data.
