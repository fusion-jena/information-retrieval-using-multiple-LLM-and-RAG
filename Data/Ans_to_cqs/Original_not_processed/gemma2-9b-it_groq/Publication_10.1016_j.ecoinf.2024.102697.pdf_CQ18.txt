Answer:::
The text describes a repeated nested k-fold cross-validation approach to monitor model performance during training. 

Here's a breakdown:

* **Outer 10-fold cross-validation:** The data is initially divided into 10 folds.  The model is trained and tested 10 times, each time using a different fold as the holdout set for testing.
* **Inner 5-fold cross-validation:** For each of the 10 outer folds, the data is further divided into 5 folds. This inner cross-validation is used to tune the model's hyperparameters. The best performing hyperparameters are selected based on the inner cross-validation results.
* **Performance Calculation:** The training performance is calculated based on the inner cross-validated ensemble. This means the model's performance is evaluated on multiple different subsets of the data during the training process.
* **Holdout Data:** The holdout data (from the outer cross-validation) is used to determine the final testing performance. This ensures the model is evaluated on unseen data.

This repeated nested k-fold cross-validation helps to:

* **Reduce bias:** By using multiple folds for both training and testing, the model is less likely to be overfit to a specific subset of the data.
* **Minimize variance:** Repeating the process 15 times with different random samplings further reduces the variance in the performance estimates.
