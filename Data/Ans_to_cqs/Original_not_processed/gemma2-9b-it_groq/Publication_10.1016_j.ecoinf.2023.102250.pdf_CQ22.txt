Answer:::
The text provides a list of metrics used to evaluate the classification performance of a deep learning model. These include:

* **Accuracy:**  Measures the overall correctness of the model's predictions.
* **Precision:**  Focuses on the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all instances predicted as positive.
* **Recall:**  Measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all actual positive instances.
* **F1-score:**  Harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of both.
* **Top-1 accuracy:**  Percentage of instances where the model predicts the correct class as the most likely class.
* **Top-5 accuracy:**  Percentage of instances where the model predicts the correct class within the top 5 most likely classes.
* **Top-1 error:**  Percentage of instances where the model does not predict the correct class as the most likely class.
* **Top-5 error:**  Percentage of instances where the model does not predict the correct class within the top 5 most likely classes.
