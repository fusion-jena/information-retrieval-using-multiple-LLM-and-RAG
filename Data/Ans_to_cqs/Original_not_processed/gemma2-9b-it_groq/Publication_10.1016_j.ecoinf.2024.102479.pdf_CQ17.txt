Answer:::

The provided text focuses on hyperparameter tuning for various machine learning algorithms and doesn't delve into the specifics of regularization methods used in deep learning. 

However, based on general knowledge of deep learning, here are some common regularization methods used to prevent overfitting:

* **Dropout:** Randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during each training step. This prevents the network from relying too heavily on any single neuron and encourages the learning of more robust features.

* **L2 Regularization (Weight Decay):** Adds a penalty to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights. This discourages the weights from becoming too large, effectively preventing overfitting.

* **L1 Regularization (Lasso):** Similar to L2 regularization, but uses the absolute value of the weights. This can lead to some weights being driven to exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection.

* **Batch Normalization:** Normalizes the activations of each layer during training, which can help stabilize training and reduce the risk of overfitting.
