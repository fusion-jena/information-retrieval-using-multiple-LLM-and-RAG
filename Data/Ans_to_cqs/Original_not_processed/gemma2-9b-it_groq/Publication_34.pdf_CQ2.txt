Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the architecture of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and doesn't explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. 

However, it states that CNNs are particularly suited for "input data of large size (typically 2D or 3D arrays, like images)". This strongly suggests that the CNN described in the text is designed to process image data.
