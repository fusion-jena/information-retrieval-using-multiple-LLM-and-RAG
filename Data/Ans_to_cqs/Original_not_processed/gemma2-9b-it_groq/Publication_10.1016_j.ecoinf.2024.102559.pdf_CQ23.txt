Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the performance evaluation of different deep learning models using various feature combinations and window sizes. It details accuracy metrics, including producer's accuracy, user's accuracy, overall accuracy, true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN). 

However, the text does not provide information about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as data diversity, cross-validation techniques, or stratified splitting methods.
