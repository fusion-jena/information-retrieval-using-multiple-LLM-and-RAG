Answer:::
The provided text lists several metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models. These include:

* **Accuracy:**  The proportion of correctly classified instances out of the total instances.
* **Loss:**  Measures the error between predicted and actual values.
* **Area Under Curve (AUC):** Represents the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve.
* **Cohenâ€™s Kappa (CK):**  Measures the agreement between two raters classifying items into mutually exclusive categories.
* **Precision:** The proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions made by the model.
* **Recall (Sensitivity):** The proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive instances in the dataset.
* **F1 Score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall. 


These metrics provide a comprehensive assessment of a model's performance by considering different aspects such as overall correctness, error rate, discrimination ability, and balance between precision and recall.
