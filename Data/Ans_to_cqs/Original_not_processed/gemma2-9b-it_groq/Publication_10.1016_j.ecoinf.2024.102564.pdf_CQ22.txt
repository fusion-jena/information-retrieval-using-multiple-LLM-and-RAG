Answer:::
The provided text mentions the following metrics for evaluating the performance of the machine learning models:

* **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**
* **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**
* **r (Correlation coefficient)**
* **Bias** 


It does not, however, specify whether these metrics are used for all models or just the ANN (Artificial Neural Network) model.
