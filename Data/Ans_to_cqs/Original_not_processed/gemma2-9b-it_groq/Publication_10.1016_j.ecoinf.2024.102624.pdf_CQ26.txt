Answer:::
The provided text focuses on techniques for improving classification accuracy in a remote sensing context, not specifically on addressing data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline.  

Therefore, I cannot answer your question about techniques used to address data bias during deep learning preprocessing (e.g., stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, diverse data collection) based on the given context.
