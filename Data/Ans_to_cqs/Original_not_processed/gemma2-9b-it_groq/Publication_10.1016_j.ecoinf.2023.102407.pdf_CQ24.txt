Answer:::

The provided text focuses on species distribution modeling and machine learning methods, primarily discussing algorithms like MaxEnt, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. It doesn't delve into the specifics of handling randomness in deep learning pipelines. 

However, I can offer some general strategies commonly used in deep learning to address randomness:

* **Setting a Random Seed:**  Deep learning models often involve random initialization of weights and stochastic processes like dropout. Setting a fixed random seed ensures that the same "random" values are used each time you run the code, making the results reproducible.

* **Data Augmentation:**  This technique introduces controlled variations (e.g., rotations, flips, color adjustments) to the training data. It helps the model generalize better and reduces the impact of randomness in the data itself.

* **Batch Normalization:** This technique normalizes the activations within each layer of the neural network, stabilizing the training process and reducing the sensitivity to initial weight values.

* **Ensemble Methods:**  Training multiple models with different random initializations and averaging their predictions can help mitigate the impact of randomness introduced during training.
