The provided text focuses on data augmentation techniques used to increase the size and diversity of training datasets for deep learning models, particularly in the context of remote sensing.  

While it mentions data augmentation as a way to help overcome the limitation of needing a large labeled training set, it doesn't delve into techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing. 

Therefore, I cannot answer your question about specific techniques used to address data bias (e.g., stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, diverse data collection) based on the given context.
