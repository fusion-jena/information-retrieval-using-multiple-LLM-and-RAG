Answer:::
The provided text describes the data splitting for a specific deep learning model but doesn't explicitly state the criteria used. 

However, it does mention:

* **60% for training and 40% for validation and testing:** This indicates a common practice of partitioning data into these three sets. 

Based on this information, we can infer that the data was likely split based on a **percentage distribution**, with the majority allocated to training the model and a smaller portion reserved for validation and testing its performance. 


It's important to note that other criteria, such as chronological order or specific characteristics of the data, could have also been involved in the splitting process.  The text doesn't provide enough detail to confirm these.
