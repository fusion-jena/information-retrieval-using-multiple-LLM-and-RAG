Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the data acquisition and model development phases, particularly detailing the process of training Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) models. 

It doesn't explicitly describe the post-processing steps involved after model training, such as:

* **Saliency maps:**  Visualizing which input features are most influential in a model's prediction.
* **Metrics calculation:**  Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and RMSE.
* **Confusion matrix:**  Analyzing the types of errors made by the model (e.g., true positives, true negatives, false positives, false negatives). 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what post-processing steps are used.
