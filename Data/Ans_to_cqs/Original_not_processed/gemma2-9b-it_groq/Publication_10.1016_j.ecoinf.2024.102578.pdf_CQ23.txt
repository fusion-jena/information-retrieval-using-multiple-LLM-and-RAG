Answer:::
The provided text doesn't specify the exact methods used to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. 

It mentions that region-specific models were trained for Finnmark and Yamal, suggesting some level of data partitioning. However, it doesn't elaborate on:

* **Dataset diversity:** Whether the training data encompassed a wide range of image conditions, lighting, and animal poses to improve the model's ability to handle variations in real-world scenarios.
* **Cross-validation:**  A technique used to evaluate model performance on unseen data by splitting the dataset into multiple folds for training and testing. The text doesn't mention if cross-validation was employed.
* **Stratified splitting:** A method of splitting data to ensure that the proportion of different classes (e.g., "bad" vs. "good" image quality) is maintained in each fold.  The text doesn't explicitly state if stratified splitting was used. 


Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot definitively say what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
