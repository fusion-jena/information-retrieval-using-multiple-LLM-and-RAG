Answer:::
The text mentions the following data augmentation techniques applied to the audio waveform:

* **Changing audio speed:** This involves speeding up or slowing down the audio signal.
* **Pitch shift:** This alters the perceived pitch of the audio.
* **Amplitude scaling (gain modulation):** This adjusts the overall volume of the audio.
* **Adding Gaussian noise:** This introduces random noise to the audio signal. 


The text does not mention image-based data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, or scaling.
