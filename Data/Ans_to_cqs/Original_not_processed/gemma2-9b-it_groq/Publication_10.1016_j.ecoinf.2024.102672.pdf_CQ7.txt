Answer:::
The provided text describes the data split for training a deep learning model as follows:

* **Training Set:**  The first four years of data (2018-2021) were used as the training set. 
* **Test Set:** The last year of data (2022) was used as the test set.

* **Validation Set:**  The data was split into four parts (k-fold cross-validation) where each part was used as a validation set in turn. Each validation set represented approximately one year of data. 


This 80-20% split (training:test) is a common practice in machine learning.
