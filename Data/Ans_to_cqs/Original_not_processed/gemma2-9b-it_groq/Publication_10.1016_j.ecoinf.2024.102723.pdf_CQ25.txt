Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the architecture and implementation of two Bayesian Deep Learning models (MCD and VBI) for predicting the BBCH value.  

While it doesn't explicitly state the overall purpose of the deep learning model, we can infer that it is designed for **regression**. 

This is evident from the following points:

* The output layer is described as a combination of a Dense layer with two nodes and a DistributionLambda layer that maps these values into the parameters of a Gaussian distribution. This structure is typical for regression tasks where the goal is to predict a continuous value (the BBCH value in this case).
* The text mentions that the focus is on "dealing with regression problems." 


Therefore, we can conclude that the deep learning model is used for **predicting a continuous value**, specifically the BBCH value, which likely represents a developmental stage of a plant.
