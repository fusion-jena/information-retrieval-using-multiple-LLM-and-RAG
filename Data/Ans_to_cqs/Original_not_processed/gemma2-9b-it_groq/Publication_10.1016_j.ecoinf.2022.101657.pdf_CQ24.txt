Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning in camera trap analysis and doesn't delve into specific strategies for handling randomness within the deep learning pipeline. 

However, it's common practice in deep learning to address randomness through techniques like:

* **Setting a fixed random seed:** This ensures that the initialization of weights and other random processes are reproducible. 

* **Data augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training dataset by applying random transformations (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) to existing images. This helps the model generalize better and reduces the impact of random variations in the data.

* **Dropout:**  Randomly "dropping out" (ignoring) a percentage of neurons during training. This prevents overfitting and encourages the network to learn more robust features.

For a comprehensive understanding of randomness handling in deep learning, you'd need to consult dedicated resources on deep learning methodologies and best practices.
