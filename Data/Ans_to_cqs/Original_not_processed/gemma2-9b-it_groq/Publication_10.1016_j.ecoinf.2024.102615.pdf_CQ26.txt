Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the application of machine learning, particularly deep learning, to predict total phosphorus concentration in rivers and doesn't delve into specific techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing. 

However, based on general knowledge of deep learning pipelines, here are some common techniques used to address data bias:

* **Stratified Splitting:** This technique ensures that the training, validation, and test sets proportionally reflect the distribution of target classes in the original dataset. This helps prevent bias towards majority classes during training.

* **Oversampling:** This involves duplicating instances from minority classes to balance the dataset and give them more representation during training.

* **Undersampling:** This involves removing instances from the majority class to balance the dataset.

* **Diverse Data Collection:**  This is a preventative measure that aims to collect data from a wide range of sources and representative of all relevant subgroups to minimize bias in the dataset from the outset.

It's important to note that the specific techniques used will depend on the nature of the bias present in the dataset and the goals of the machine learning project.
