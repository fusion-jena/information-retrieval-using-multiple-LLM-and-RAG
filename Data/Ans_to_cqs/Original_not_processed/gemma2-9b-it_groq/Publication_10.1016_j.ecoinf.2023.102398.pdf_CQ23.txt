Answer:::
The provided text mentions that the dataset used for custom training is "sufficiently large" and that the model is tuned with optimized hyperparameters to prevent overfitting and underfitting. 

However, it does not explicitly state whether techniques like cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the use of a diverse dataset were employed to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
