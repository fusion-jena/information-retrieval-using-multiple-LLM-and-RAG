Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning in analyzing camera trap images for wildlife research. It doesn't explicitly mention the general methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. 

However, based on common practices in the field, here are some methods used for collecting raw data:

* **Surveys:** Structured questionnaires or interviews can gather data on various topics, including demographics, opinions, or behaviors.
* **Sensors:**  A wide range of sensors can collect environmental data (temperature, humidity, pressure), physiological data (heart rate, brain activity), or behavioral data (movement, location).
* **Public Datasets:** Many organizations and researchers make their datasets publicly available for use in research and development. These datasets can cover diverse domains like images, text, audio, and numerical data.


Keep in mind that the specific data collection methods depend heavily on the research question and the domain of application.
