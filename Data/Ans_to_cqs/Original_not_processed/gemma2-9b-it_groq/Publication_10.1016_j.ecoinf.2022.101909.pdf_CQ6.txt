Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the specific implementation details of a deep learning model for bird species identification. While it mentions using color spectrograms of two-second durations as input, it doesn't delve into the preprocessing steps applied to these spectrograms before training. 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what specific preprocessing steps (like normalization, scaling, or cleaning) were involved.
