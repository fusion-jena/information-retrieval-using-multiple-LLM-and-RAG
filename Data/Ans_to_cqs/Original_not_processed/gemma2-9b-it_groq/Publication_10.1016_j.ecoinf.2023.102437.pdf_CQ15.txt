Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the application of machine learning models, particularly recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and Random Forests (RF), in environmental science and does not delve into specific optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines. 

Therefore, I cannot answer your query about optimization techniques like SGD or Adam from the given context.
