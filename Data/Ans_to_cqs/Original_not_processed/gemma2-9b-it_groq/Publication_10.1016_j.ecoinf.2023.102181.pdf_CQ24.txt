Answer:::
The provided text focuses on addressing bias in machine learning models, particularly bagging models, when dealing with spatially clustered data. It doesn't discuss strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines. 

To answer your query about randomness in deep learning, here are some common strategies:

* **Setting a random seed:** This initializes the random number generator used throughout the deep learning process. By setting a specific seed, you ensure that the same "random" values are generated each time you run your code, making your results reproducible.

* **Dropout:** This technique randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during each training step. This prevents overfitting by forcing the network to learn more robust features.

* **Batch Normalization:** This technique normalizes the activations of each layer, reducing internal covariate shift and stabilizing training. It introduces randomness during training, but the randomness is controlled and beneficial for convergence.

* **Weight Initialization:** Different methods for initializing the weights of a neural network can introduce randomness. Popular choices include Xavier/Glorot initialization and He initialization.

These are just a few examples, and the specific strategies used will depend on the particular deep learning model and task.
