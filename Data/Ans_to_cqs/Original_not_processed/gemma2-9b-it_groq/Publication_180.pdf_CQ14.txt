Answer:::
The provided text describes the optimization process for the model's hyperparameters but doesn't specify the exact method used (e.g., grid search, random search).  It mentions that the researchers calibrated the models using different numbers of training steps and considered two factors: 1) correct identification rate and 2) processing time.  They aimed to find the optimal number of training steps that balanced these factors.
