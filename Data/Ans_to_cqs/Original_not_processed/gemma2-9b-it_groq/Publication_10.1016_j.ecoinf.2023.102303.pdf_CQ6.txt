Answer:::
The provided text describes the development of two deep learning models for fish detection in turbid waters. It details the dataset creation and model architectures but doesn't explicitly list preprocessing steps applied to the images before training. 

However, it does mention the following augmentations used in the self-supervised contrastive learning phase:

* **Random horizontal flipping**
* **Random ±70 rotation**
* **Random ±40% brightness**

These augmentations are a form of data preprocessing aimed at increasing the model's robustness and generalizability by exposing it to variations of the input images during training. 

Other common preprocessing steps not mentioned in the text but often used in computer vision tasks include:

* **Normalization:** Scaling pixel values to a specific range (e.g., 0 to 1) to improve model stability.
* **Scaling:**  Adjusting the range of pixel values to prevent features with larger magnitudes from dominating the learning process.
* **Cleaning:** Removing noise, artifacts, or irrelevant information from the images.
