Answer:::
The provided text lists several hyperparameters used in training the deep learning model.  These include:

* **Learning Rate:** `lr0` is set to 0.01.
* **Learning Rate Scheduler:** `Lrf` is set to 0.01, suggesting a learning rate scheduler is used.
* **Momentum:** `momentum` is set to 0.937.
* **Weight Decay:** `weight_decay` is set to 0.0005.
* **Warmup:**
    * `warmup_epochs` is set to 3.0
    * `warmup_momentum` is set to 0.8
    * `warmup_bias_lr` is set to 0.1
* **YOLOv5 Specific Hyperparameters:**
    * `box`, `cls`, `cls_pw`, `obj`, `obj_pw`, `iou_t`, and `anchor_t` are hyperparameters specific to the YOLOv5 architecture.

The text also mentions other hyperparameters related to data augmentation (`fl_gamma`, `hsv_h`, `hsv_s`, `hsv_v`, `degrees`, `translate`, `scale`, `shear`, `Perspective`, `flipud`, `fliplr`, `mosaic`, `mixup`, `copy_paste`) but doesn't provide their values. 

The optimizer used is not explicitly stated in the provided text.
