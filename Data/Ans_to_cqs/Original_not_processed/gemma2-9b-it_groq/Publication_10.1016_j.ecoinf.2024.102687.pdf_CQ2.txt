Answer:::
The provided text describes a deep learning pipeline that uses spectrograms as input. Spectrograms are visual representations of sound, typically displayed as a 2D matrix where the x-axis represents time and the y-axis represents frequency.  

Therefore, the data format used in this pipeline is **audio**, which is transformed into **spectrogram images**.
