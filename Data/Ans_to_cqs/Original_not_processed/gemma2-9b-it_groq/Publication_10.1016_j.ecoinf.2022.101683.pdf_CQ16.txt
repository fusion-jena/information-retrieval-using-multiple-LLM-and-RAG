Answer:::
The provided text focuses on evaluating machine learning models and doesn't mention criteria for determining when training is complete.  It discusses metrics like AUC, TPR, TSS, and Kappa used to assess model performance. 

To answer your question about training completion criteria, here are some common ones:

* **Validation Loss Plateau:**  Training is often stopped when the validation loss (performance on unseen data) stops decreasing significantly. This indicates the model might be overfitting (performing well on training data but poorly on new data).
* **Epoch Limit:** A predetermined number of training epochs (passes through the entire dataset) is set. Training stops after reaching this limit.
* **Early Stopping:**  A technique where training pauses if the validation loss doesn't improve for a specified number of epochs. This helps prevent overfitting.
* **Performance Threshold:** Training continues until a desired performance level is reached on the validation set.
