Answer:::

The provided text focuses on species distribution modeling and doesn't contain information about data splitting criteria for deep learning models. 

To answer your query about data splitting for deep learning, here's a common approach:

* **Training Set:** This is the largest portion of the data (typically 70-80%) used to train the deep learning model. The model learns patterns and relationships within this data.

* **Validation Set:**  A smaller portion of the data (around 10-15%) is used to evaluate the model's performance during training. This helps monitor how well the model is generalizing to unseen data and prevents overfitting (where the model performs well on training data but poorly on new data).

* **Test Set:**  A separate, held-out portion of the data (around 10-15%) is used *only* after training is complete to provide a final, unbiased evaluation of the model's performance on data it has never encountered before.

**Key Considerations:**

* **Data Size:** The size of each split depends on the overall dataset size. With smaller datasets, the splits might be less distinct.
* **Stratification:**  If the data has categorical features, it's often beneficial to stratify the splits to ensure that the class distribution is roughly the same in each set.
* **Cross-Validation:** For smaller datasets, techniques like k-fold cross-validation can be used to more thoroughly evaluate the model's performance.
