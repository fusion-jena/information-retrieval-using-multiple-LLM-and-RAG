Answer:::

The provided text focuses on studies related to hydrology, ecology, and fire mapping. It doesn't contain information about preprocessing steps for deep learning models. 

To answer your query, here are some common preprocessing steps used before training a deep learning model:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

* **Normalization:** Scaling the features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1 or -1 to 1) can improve model performance.

* **Feature Scaling:** Techniques like standardization (subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation) or min-max scaling can be used to ensure features have similar scales.

* **Encoding Categorical Variables:** Converting categorical data into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding) is necessary for most deep learning algorithms.
* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training data by applying transformations (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) can improve model generalization.
