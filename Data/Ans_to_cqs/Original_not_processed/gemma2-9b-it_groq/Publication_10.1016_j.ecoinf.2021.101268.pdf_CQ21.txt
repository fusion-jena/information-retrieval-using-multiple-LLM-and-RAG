Answer:::
The provided text focuses on model training and pre-processing techniques, but it doesn't explicitly detail the post-processing steps taken *after* training. 

However, based on common machine learning practices and the mentioned techniques, we can infer some likely post-processing steps:

* **Metrics Calculation:**  The text mentions accuracy scores (Raw, Pre-processed, Train, Validation, Test) which are standard metrics for evaluating model performance. Other common metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC might also be calculated.

* **Confusion Matrix:** The text refers to a confusion matrix for the VGG-19 architecture (Fig. 5). Confusion matrices are visualizations that show the performance of a classification model by breaking down the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

* **Saliency Maps:** The text discusses Integrated Gradients (Sundararajan et al., 2017) for visualizing feature importance. Saliency maps are a type of visualization that highlights the regions of an input image that are most influential in the model's decision.

It's important to note that these are inferences based on the limited information provided. The specific post-processing steps used in this study might include additional techniques not mentioned in the excerpt.
