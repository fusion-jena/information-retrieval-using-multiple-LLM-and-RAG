Answer:::
The text describes several preprocessing steps used before training a deep learning model:

* **Categorical Encoding:** The `categorify` function from the fastai library is used to map categorical columns to distinct categories. 

* **Handling Missing Values:** The `fillMissing` function replaces null values in the dataset with the median value of the respective column.

* **Normalization:** The `normalize` function scales continuous columns by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.

* **Feature Engineering:** The `add datepart` function generates additional predictors based on the date column, such as "Year", "DayofWeek", "DayOfYear", and "IsMonthEnd".
