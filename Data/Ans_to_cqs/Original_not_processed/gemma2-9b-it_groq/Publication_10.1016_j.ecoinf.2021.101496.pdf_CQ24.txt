Answer:::

The provided text focuses on plant physiology and remote sensing techniques, and doesn't offer information about deep learning or strategies for handling randomness within its pipeline.  

To answer your query about randomness in deep learning, here are some common strategies:

* **Setting a Random Seed:**  Deep learning models often use random initialization for weights and random shuffling of data during training. Setting a fixed random seed ensures that these random processes are reproducible. This allows researchers to compare results and debug models more effectively.

* **Data Augmentation:**  This technique introduces controlled variations into the training data (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) to increase its size and diversity. This helps the model generalize better and reduces the impact of randomness in the training data itself.

* **Dropout:**  During training, dropout randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons in each layer. This prevents the model from relying too heavily on any single neuron and encourages the learning of more robust features.

* **Batch Normalization:**  This technique normalizes the activations of neurons within each layer, reducing the internal covariate shift and stabilizing the training process. This can help mitigate the effects of randomness in the input data.
