Answer:::
The provided text states that the data was split into training (60%) and testing (40%) sets.  

The splitting was done by randomly selecting entire audio files for each set.  The key criteria used were:

* **Random Selection:**  Audio files were chosen randomly for both training and testing sets.
* **Mutually Exclusive:** The training and testing sets were designed to be completely separate, meaning no audio file was present in both.
* **Different Days:** Testing files generally came from recordings on different days than the training files. 


The text does not mention a separate validation set.
