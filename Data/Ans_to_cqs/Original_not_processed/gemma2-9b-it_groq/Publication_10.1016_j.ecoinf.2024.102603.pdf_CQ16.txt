Answer:::
The provided text describes the XGBoost algorithm and its training process but doesn't specify the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete. 

It mentions that XGBoost trains a series of trees, with each subsequent tree learning from the residuals of the previous tree.  The process continues iteratively until the model achieves a satisfactory level of performance. 

However, the text doesn't explicitly state whether this is based on a validation loss plateau, a specific number of iterations, or other criteria.
