Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the EfficientNetV2 model and its efficiency improvements, and doesn't mention the criteria used to split data for deep learning model training.  

To answer your query, data for deep learning is typically split into three sets:

* **Training set:** This is the largest portion of the data used to train the model. The model learns patterns and relationships from this data.
* **Validation set:** This set is used to evaluate the model's performance during training. It helps to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting (where the model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data).
* **Test set:** This set is held out entirely from the training process and is only used to evaluate the final model's performance on unseen data. It provides an unbiased estimate of how well the model will generalize to new data.

The typical split ratio is 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. However, this can vary depending on the size and nature of the dataset.
