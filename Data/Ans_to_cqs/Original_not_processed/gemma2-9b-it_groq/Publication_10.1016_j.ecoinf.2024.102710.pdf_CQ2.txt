Answer:::
The provided text describes a deep learning pipeline for audio event classification.  

The data formats used are:

* **Audio:** The core input is audio data, segmented into three-second samples. 
* **Spectrograms:**  Audio data is converted into spectrograms for use with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Spectrograms are visual representations of audio, showing frequency content over time.
