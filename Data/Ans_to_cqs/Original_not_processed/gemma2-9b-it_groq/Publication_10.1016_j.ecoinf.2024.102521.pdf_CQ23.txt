Answer:::

The provided text does not specify the exact measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.  

While it mentions the use of a large-scale dataset called "Pest24" for training, it doesn't elaborate on the dataset's diversity, the specific techniques used for splitting the data (e.g., cross-validation, stratified splitting), or any other methods employed to enhance the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.
