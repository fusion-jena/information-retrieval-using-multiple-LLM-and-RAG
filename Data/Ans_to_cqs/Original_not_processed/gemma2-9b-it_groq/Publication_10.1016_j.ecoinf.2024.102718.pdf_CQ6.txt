Answer:::
The provided text describes the BEiT model architecture and training process but doesn't explicitly detail the preprocessing steps applied to the dataset before training. 

However, it does mention:

* **Augmentation:** The dataset is augmented, which likely involves techniques like rotating, flipping, or cropping images to increase diversity and improve model robustness.
* **Normalization:** The text states that images are normalized using a mean of [0.485, 0.456, 0.406] and a standard deviation of [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]. This is a common preprocessing step to scale pixel values to a standard range, which can help with model convergence.

Based on these clues, we can infer that the preprocessing steps likely include:

* **Data Cleaning:** Removing any corrupted or irrelevant data points.
* **Augmentation:**  Applying transformations to existing images to create new training examples.
* **Normalization:** Scaling pixel values to a standard range.


It's important to note that this is an educated guess based on limited information. The specific preprocessing steps used might vary depending on the dataset and the model's requirements.
