Answer:::

The provided text focuses on a Random Forest (RF) model, not a deep learning model. Therefore, it doesn't describe any measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. 


The text does mention that the RF model's performance was evaluated using a validation set to assess its "generalization power."  It states that the models showed "satisfactory generalization power," indicated by similar precision results between observed and estimated data.
