Answer:::
The provided text focuses on mangrove tree segmentation using deep learning and doesn't delve into specific strategies for handling randomness within the deep learning pipeline. 

However,  randomness is inherent in many aspects of deep learning, such as:

* **Initialization:**  Weights and biases in neural networks are often initialized randomly.

* **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):** This common optimization algorithm uses random mini-batches of data to update model parameters.
* **Dropout:** A regularization technique that randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during training to prevent overfitting.

To mitigate the impact of randomness and ensure reproducibility, practitioners often employ the following strategies:

* **Setting a Random Seed:**  Specifying a fixed random seed value ensures that the random number generator produces the same sequence of random numbers each time the code is run. This makes experiments reproducible.
* **Data Shuffling:** Randomly shuffling the training data before each epoch helps prevent the model from learning patterns specific to the order of data samples.
* **Batch Normalization:** This technique normalizes the activations of neurons within each mini-batch, reducing the internal covariate shift and stabilizing training.
