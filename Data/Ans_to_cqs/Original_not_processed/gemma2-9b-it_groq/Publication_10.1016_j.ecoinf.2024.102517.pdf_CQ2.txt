Answer:::
The provided text explicitly mentions "audio" data being used in the deep learning pipeline.  

The context describes a bird noise reduction network trained using an audio classification loss network. It also mentions training data derived from a study involving "audio files" for acoustic scene classification and audio labeling tasks. 


Therefore, the data format used in this deep learning pipeline is **audio**.
