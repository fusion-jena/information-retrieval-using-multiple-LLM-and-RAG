Answer::: The deep learning model is used for **detection** of moths. 

The text states: "We then trained a standard deep learning classifier (ResNet-50 pre-trained on ImageNet [30]) on the cropped bounding box images of the detected moths and achieved an average accuracy of 89.00% on an held-out test set." 


This indicates that the model first detects moths in images (likely using a separate detection algorithm) and then uses a classifier to identify the specific species of moth.
