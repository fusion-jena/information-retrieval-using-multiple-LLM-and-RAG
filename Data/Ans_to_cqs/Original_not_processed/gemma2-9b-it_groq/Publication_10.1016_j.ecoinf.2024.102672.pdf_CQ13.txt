Answer:::
The provided text states that the following hyperparameters were used in the deep learning model:

* **Learning rate:** Not specified in the text.
* **Optimizer:** Adam (a stochastic gradient descent method)
* **Batch size:** Not specified in the text.
* **Number of epochs:** 500 (initially) and adjusted based on loss curve stabilization during cross-validation. 


The text also mentions that the architecture of the ANN was defined by the number of layers and the number of neurons, but it doesn't provide specific values for these hyperparameters.
