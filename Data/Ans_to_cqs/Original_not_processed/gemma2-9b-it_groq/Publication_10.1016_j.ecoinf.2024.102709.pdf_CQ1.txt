Answer:::
The provided text describes a study using a dataset for digit recognition. It mentions the use of:

* **Stationary TLS ( Terrestrial Laser Scanning)**: A ground-based system for capturing 3D point cloud data.
* **Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS)**: Another ground-based system for acquiring 3D point cloud data while moving.

* **PLS (Point-based Laser Scanning)**:  Likely a specific type of MLS.

The text focuses on processing this point cloud data to extract clusters of numbers, which are then used for training deep learning models. 

It does not explicitly mention other data collection methods like surveys or public datasets.
