Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the challenges and solutions related to few-shot learning in image classification, particularly for fish species identification. It doesn't discuss the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.  

To answer your question, data collection methods for deep learning can vary widely depending on the task. Some common methods include:

* **Surveys:**  Like the dive visual censuses mentioned in the text, surveys can involve manual observation and recording of data.
* **Sensors:**  Various types of sensors can collect data, such as cameras, sonar, lidar, and acoustic sensors. 
* **Public Datasets:** Many publicly available datasets contain images, text, audio, and other types of data that can be used for training deep learning models. 


Let me know if you have other questions about few-shot learning or image classification.
