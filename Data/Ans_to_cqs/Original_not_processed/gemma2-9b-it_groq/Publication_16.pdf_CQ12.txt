Answer:::
The text states that "CNN approaches require a large corpus of high-quality annotated data".  It also mentions that "given that there is limited availability of publicly available data that satisfy this requirement there are currently no viable models capable of classifying within species animal types". 

Therefore, we can infer that a **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)** is the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
