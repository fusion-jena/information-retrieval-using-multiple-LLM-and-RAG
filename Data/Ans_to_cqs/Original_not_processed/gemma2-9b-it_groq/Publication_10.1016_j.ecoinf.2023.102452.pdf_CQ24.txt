Answer:::

The provided text focuses on genetic programming and its application in streamflow forecasting and water quality management. It doesn't offer information about strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines. 

To answer your query about randomness in deep learning, here are some common strategies:

* **Setting a Random Seed:**  Deep learning models often use random initialization for weights and random shuffling of data during training. Setting a fixed random seed ensures that the same "random" values are used each time you run the model, making the results reproducible.

* **Data Augmentation:**  This technique introduces controlled variations (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) to the training data, effectively increasing the dataset size and helping the model generalize better to unseen data.

* **Dropout:**  During training, dropout randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons in each layer. This prevents overfitting by forcing the network to learn more robust features.

* **Batch Normalization:**  This technique normalizes the activations of each layer, reducing internal covariate shift and stabilizing training.
