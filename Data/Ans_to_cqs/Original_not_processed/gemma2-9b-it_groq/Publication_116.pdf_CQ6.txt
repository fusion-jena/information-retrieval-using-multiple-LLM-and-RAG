Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the architecture and implementation details of a deep learning model, particularly a modified GoogleNet, for plant classification. It doesn't explicitly describe the preprocessing steps involved before training. 

However, based on common practices in deep learning, we can infer some likely preprocessing steps:

* **Image Resizing:** The text mentions using images of 224 Ã— 224 resolution, suggesting resizing input images to this standard size.
* **Data Augmentation:** "Simple crop and resize data augmentation" is mentioned, indicating techniques like random cropping and flipping to increase the diversity of the training data.
* **Normalization:** While not explicitly stated, the use of Batch Normalization within the model architecture implies that the input data is likely normalized (e.g., mean-centered and scaled) to improve training stability and speed.

Other common preprocessing steps that might be involved but are not mentioned include:

* **Cleaning:** Removing noise, artifacts, or irrelevant parts from the images.
* **Color Space Conversion:** Transforming images to a different color space (e.g., HSV or YCbCr) that might be more suitable for the model.
* **Contrast Adjustment:** Enhancing the contrast of images to improve feature visibility.



It's important to note that the specific preprocessing steps used would depend on the characteristics of the dataset and the requirements of the model.
