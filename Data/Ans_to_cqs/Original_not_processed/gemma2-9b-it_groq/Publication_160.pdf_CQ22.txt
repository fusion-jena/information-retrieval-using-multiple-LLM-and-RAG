Answer:::
The provided text states that the performance of the deep learning models was assessed using precision, recall, and F1-score. 

These metrics were calculated at both the micro and macro levels. Micro-F1, precision, and recall are computed across all classes, considering their distribution in the dataset. Macro-F1, precision, and recall give equal weight to all classes, meaning class-wise performance differences have a greater impact on the scores.
