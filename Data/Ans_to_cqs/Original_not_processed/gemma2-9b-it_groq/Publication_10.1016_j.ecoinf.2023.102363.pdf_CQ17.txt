Answer:::
The provided text mentions two regularization methods used to prevent overfitting:

* **Dropout:** Randomly discards the output of hidden nodes during training. This prevents the model from relying too heavily on any single neuron.

* **DropConnect:** Randomly discards the input of the hidden layer during training. This is similar to dropout but operates on the input side of the neurons.
