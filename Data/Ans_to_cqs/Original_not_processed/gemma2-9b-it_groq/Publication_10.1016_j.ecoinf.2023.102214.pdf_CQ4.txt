Answer:::
The text specifically mentions "left-right mirroring data augmentation techniques" as a method used to reduce overfitting and improve the algorithm's ability to match individuals based on pelt patterns rather than background.  

It also states that this mirroring method is a configuration setting that can be enabled or disabled during the training process.  

The text does not mention other data augmentation techniques like rotating or scaling.
