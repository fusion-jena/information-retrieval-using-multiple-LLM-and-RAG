Answer:::
The provided text does not describe the specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline.  It focuses on image segmentation and classification methods within the eCognition software, mentioning techniques like multi-resolution segmentation and multi-threshold segmentation. 

While the text alludes to the use of machine learning in image classification, it doesn't delve into the details of how training data is prepared for these models, which would include information about data annotation techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.
