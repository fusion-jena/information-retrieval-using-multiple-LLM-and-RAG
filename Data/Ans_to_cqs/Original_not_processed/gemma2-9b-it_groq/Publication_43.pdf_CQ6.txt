Answer:::
The provided text focuses on fine-tuning pre-trained CNNs (like ResNet and GoogLeNet) for specific tasks and doesn't delve into the general preprocessing steps involved in training deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps before training a deep learning model generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.
* **Normalization:** Scaling the features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1 or -1 to 1) can improve model performance.
* **Feature Scaling:** Techniques like standardization (subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation) can help features with different scales contribute equally to the learning process.
* **Encoding Categorical Data:** Converting categorical variables into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding) is necessary for most deep learning algorithms.
* **Image Preprocessing (for computer vision):** This can include resizing images to a fixed size, converting them to RGB format, and applying data augmentation techniques (e.g., rotation, flipping, cropping) to increase the size and diversity of the training data. 


Keep in mind that the specific preprocessing steps will vary depending on the nature of the data and the chosen deep learning model.
