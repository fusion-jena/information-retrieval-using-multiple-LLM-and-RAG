Answer:::
The provided text describes preprocessing steps specific to a Chinese text analysis task using the ERNIE model.  While it mentions some general text preprocessing techniques like stop word removal and Chinese text segmentation, it doesn't detail  preprocessing steps commonly used in deep learning model training, such as normalization or scaling. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I can't definitively answer what preprocessing steps are involved before training a deep learning model.
