Answer:::

The text mentions the use of six different commercial cameras to collect the dataset, aiming to ensure variability and the development of a flexible solution for real-world conditions. This suggests an attempt to capture diverse image characteristics, which could contribute to the model's generalizability. 

However, the text does not explicitly describe the use of techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting, which are common practices for evaluating and improving model generalizability.
