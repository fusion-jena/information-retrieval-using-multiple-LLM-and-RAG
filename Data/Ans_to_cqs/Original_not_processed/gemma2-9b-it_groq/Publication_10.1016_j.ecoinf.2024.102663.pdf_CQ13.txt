Answer:::
The text mentions the following hyperparameters used in the deep learning model:

* **Learning rate:** The text discusses different initial learning rates (0.005 vs. 0.01 vs. 0.02) and final learning rates (0.005 vs. 0.01 vs. 0.02). 
* **Optimizer:** The text compares three different optimizers: RMSProp, SGD, and AdamW.
* **Cosine learning rate scheduler (cos_lr):** The text investigates the impact of using a cosine curve for the learning rate scheduler.
* **Number of epochs:** The text shows the effect of changing the number of epochs from 10 to 50 on the model's performance. 


The provided text does not specify other potential hyperparameters like batch size, network architecture, or regularization techniques.
