Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the comparison of different machine learning algorithms for predicting aboveground biomass and doesn't delve into the specifics of preprocessing steps for deep learning models. 

Therefore, I cannot answer your query based on the given context. 

However, I can generally tell you that common preprocessing steps for deep learning models often include:

* **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies.
* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1) to prevent features with larger magnitudes from dominating the learning process.
* **Standardization:** Transforming features to have zero mean and unit variance.
* **Encoding Categorical Variables:** Converting categorical data into numerical representations that deep learning models can understand (e.g., one-hot encoding).
* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones to potentially improve model performance.
