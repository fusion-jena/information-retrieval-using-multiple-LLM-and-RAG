Answer:::
The provided text states that the algorithms use "numerical ‘features’ extracted from, and representing attributes of, those pictures."  It also mentions that Inovtaxon was used to extract these features. 

Therefore, the deep learning pipeline uses **image** data as input, and converts it into numerical feature data for training the algorithms.
