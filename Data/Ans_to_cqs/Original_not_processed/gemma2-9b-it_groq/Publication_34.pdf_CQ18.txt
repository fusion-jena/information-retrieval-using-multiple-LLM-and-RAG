Answer:::
The provided text describes the evaluation metrics used *after* training to assess model performance, not the strategy used to monitor performance *during* training.  It mentions that the optimization method for neural network parameters uses stochastic gradient descent algorithms with back-propagation to approximate the loss function gradient. However, it doesn't detail how performance is tracked during the training process itself.
