Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the types of algorithms used for DO concentration prediction (like genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization, and various neural networks) and doesn't delve into the specific hyperparameter optimization techniques employed. 

Therefore, I cannot answer how hyperparameters are optimized for these models based on the given context.
