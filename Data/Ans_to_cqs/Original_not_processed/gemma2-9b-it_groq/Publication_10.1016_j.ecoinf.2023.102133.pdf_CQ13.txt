Answer:::
The provided text describes the hyperparameters used in a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model, not a general deep learning model. 

Here are the hyperparameters mentioned for the MLP:

* **Solvers:** Limited-Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (L-BFGS), Adam, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with constant learning rate, SGD with adaptive learning rate.
* **Number of neurons in the hidden layers:** from 1 to 100.
* **Regularization factor “alpha” (L2 penalty):** 10
* **Activation function:** identity, logistic, tanh, ReLU.
* **Learning Rate:** constant, invscaling, adaptive.
