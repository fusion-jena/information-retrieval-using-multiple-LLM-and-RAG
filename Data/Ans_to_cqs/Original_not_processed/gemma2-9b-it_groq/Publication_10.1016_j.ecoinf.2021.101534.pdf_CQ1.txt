Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the processing and analysis of audio data using deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs).  It describes how mixed audio clips are transformed into spectrograms for model training. 

However, the text does **not** specify the methods used for *collecting* the raw audio data in the first place.  It's possible the data comes from:

* **Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM):** This method is mentioned as having advantages in terrestrial ecology and is used for recording sounds in the environment.
* **Surveys:** The text mentions "call-based identification" as a potential tool for monitoring, suggesting surveys involving recording animal calls might be a source.
* **Public datasets:**  It's also possible the data is obtained from publicly available acoustic datasets. 


Without further information, we cannot definitively say what methods are used for collecting the raw data.
