Answer: The provided text focuses on the architecture and training details of the D-Mask R-CNN model, but it doesn't mention specific measures taken to ensure its generalizability.  

The text states that the model was evaluated on deer instances, which are the most common species in their RGB-D dataset. It also mentions normalizing input channels and using pre-trained weights for the RPN classifier and mask head. However, there's no information about data augmentation, cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the diversity of the dataset beyond mentioning deer as the primary target.
