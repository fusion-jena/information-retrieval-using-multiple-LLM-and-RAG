Answer:::
The provided text focuses on comparing XGBoost and deep learning models, but it doesn't specify the criteria used to split data for deep learning model training. 

Generally, in deep learning, data is split into three sets:

* **Training set:** Used to train the model. This is the largest portion of the data.
* **Validation set:** Used to evaluate the model's performance during training and to tune hyperparameters.
* **Test set:** Used to assess the final performance of the trained model on unseen data.

Common criteria for splitting data include:

* **Percentage-based split:** Dividing the data into fixed percentages (e.g., 70% training, 15% validation, 15% test).
* **Stratified sampling:** Ensuring that the distribution of target classes is maintained in each split.
* **Time-based split:** Using chronological data, where earlier data is used for training and later data for testing.
