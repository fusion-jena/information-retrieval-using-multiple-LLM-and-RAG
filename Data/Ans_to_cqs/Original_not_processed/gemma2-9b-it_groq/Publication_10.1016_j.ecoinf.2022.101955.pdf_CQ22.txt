Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the performance evaluation of kNN and RF classification models, not a deep learning model.  Therefore, it doesn't list the metrics used for deep learning models. 

However, it does mention the following metrics for the kNN and RF models:

* **Overall accuracy:** The percentage of correctly classified samples.
* **95% Confidence Interval (95% CI):** A range within which the true accuracy is likely to fall.
* **Kappa statistics:** A measure of agreement between the predicted and actual classifications, taking into account chance agreement.
* **p-value:**  Indicates the statistical significance of the results. 


Metrics commonly used to evaluate deep learning models include:

* **Accuracy:** Similar to the kNN and RF evaluation, it measures the percentage of correct predictions.
* **Precision:**  The proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions.
* **Recall:** The proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive cases.
* **F1-score:**  The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure.
* **AUC (Area Under the Curve):**  Evaluates the model's ability to distinguish between classes. 
* **Loss function:**  Measures the difference between predicted and actual values, used to optimize the model during training.
