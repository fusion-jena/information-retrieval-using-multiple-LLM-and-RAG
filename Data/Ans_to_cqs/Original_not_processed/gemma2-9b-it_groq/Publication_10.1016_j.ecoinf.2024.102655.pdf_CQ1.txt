Answer:::
The provided text focuses on water quality monitoring and analysis using machine learning, particularly a method called Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS).  

It doesn't specify the exact methods used for collecting the raw water quality data.  

However, based on the context, we can infer that the data likely comes from:

* **Sensors:** The text mentions "online water quality monitoring" and "monitoring sites," suggesting the use of sensors deployed in the river to measure various water quality parameters. 
* **Laboratory Analysis:**  The list of water quality parameters (e.g., "Biological Oxygen Demand," "Total Suspended Solids") implies that some data might be obtained through laboratory analysis of water samples collected at the monitoring sites. 


The text doesn't provide details about surveys or public datasets being used in this specific study.
