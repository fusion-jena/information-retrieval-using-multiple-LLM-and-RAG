Answer: 

The text mentions several strategies used to enhance the generalizability of the deep learning model:

* **Diverse Dataset:** The authors aimed to avoid bias in the classification process by maintaining consistent ratios of samples across different groups.  Different samples are present across groups, suggesting a diverse dataset was used for training.

* **Validation and Test Sets:** Separate validation and test sets were used to fine-tune the model's hyperparameters. This practice helps ensure the model performs well on unseen data, a key aspect of generalizability.

* **Hierarchical Classification:** The model employs a hierarchical classification approach, which may contribute to its ability to generalize. 

The text does not explicitly mention techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting.
