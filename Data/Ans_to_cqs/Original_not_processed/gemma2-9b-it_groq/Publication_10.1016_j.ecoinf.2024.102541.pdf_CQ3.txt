Answer:::
The provided text describes several visualizations used to understand and analyze datasets, but it doesn't explicitly state the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. 

However, based on the descriptions, we can infer the following techniques were likely employed:

* **Bounding Box Annotation:** The text mentions "instance maps" and "label maps" with unique colors corresponding to object bounding boxes. This strongly suggests bounding box annotations were used to define the location of objects within images.

* **Instance Segmentation:** The text also refers to "mask maps" which reveal segmentation masks for each object. This indicates instance segmentation, a technique that not only locates objects but also precisely delineates their boundaries within the image.

* **Heatmaps:** The presence of "heatmaps" suggests that confidence scores were assigned to each pixel, indicating the network's certainty about the presence of an object at that location. This is a common technique used in object detection and segmentation. 


It's important to note that these are inferences based on the visualizations described.  The text doesn't definitively confirm the specific annotation techniques used.
