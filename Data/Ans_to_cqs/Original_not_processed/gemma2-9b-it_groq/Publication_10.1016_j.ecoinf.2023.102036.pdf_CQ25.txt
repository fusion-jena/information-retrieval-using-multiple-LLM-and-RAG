Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning in fisheries, particularly for image-based tasks.  

While it mentions deep learning's use in tasks like sorting fish, it doesn't explicitly state the specific purpose of the deep learning model described in the excerpt. 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot definitively say what the purpose of the deep learning model is.
