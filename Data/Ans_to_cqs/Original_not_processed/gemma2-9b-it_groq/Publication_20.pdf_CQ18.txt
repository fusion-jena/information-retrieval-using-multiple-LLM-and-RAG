Answer:::
The provided text describes the performance evaluation of trained models, not the strategies used to monitor performance *during* training.  It details how the models were tested against different datasets and how their outputs were refined using decision rules. 

There's no information about specific metrics tracked during training (e.g., loss function, accuracy on a validation set), nor about techniques used to prevent overfitting beyond stopping training after 70 epochs and using a dropout rate of 50%.
