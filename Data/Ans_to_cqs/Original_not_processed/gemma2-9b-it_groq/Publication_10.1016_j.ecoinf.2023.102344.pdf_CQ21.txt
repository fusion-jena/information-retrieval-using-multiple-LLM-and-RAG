Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the model training process and doesn't explicitly detail the post-processing steps after training.  

However, it does mention the following, which are common post-processing steps in machine learning:

* **Metrics Calculation:** The text states that the model performance was evaluated using metrics like accuracy, fall-out, precision, specificity, and F1-score (Table 1). These metrics are calculated after training to assess the model's effectiveness.
* **Confusion Matrix:** Figure 8 shows confusion matrices for different models. Confusion matrices are visualization tools used to analyze the performance of a classification model by showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

It's likely that other standard post-processing steps were also employed, such as:

* **Model Saving:**  The trained model would have been saved for future use.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  Further fine-tuning of the model's hyperparameters might have been performed based on the initial evaluation results.


The text doesn't provide information about saliency maps.
