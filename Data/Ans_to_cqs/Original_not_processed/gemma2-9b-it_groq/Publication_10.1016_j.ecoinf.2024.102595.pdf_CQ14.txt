Answer:::
The provided text states that hyperparameter tuning in this study was performed using **GridSearchCV**.  

GridSearchCV is a technique that systematically searches a predefined grid of hyperparameter values. For each model, a unique parameter grid was defined, targeting specific model characteristics. 

The process ensures that the final choice of hyperparameters is not arbitrary but is data-driven and aims to minimize bias in the model predictions.
