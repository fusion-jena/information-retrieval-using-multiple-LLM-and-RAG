Answer:::
The text explicitly states that a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** is used in the pipeline. 


This is mentioned in the section titled "2.4. Convolutional neural network setup and training" where it says: "Among the deep learning architectures, convolutional neural networks (CNN) are particularly suitable for image analysis due to their ability to extract spatial features."
