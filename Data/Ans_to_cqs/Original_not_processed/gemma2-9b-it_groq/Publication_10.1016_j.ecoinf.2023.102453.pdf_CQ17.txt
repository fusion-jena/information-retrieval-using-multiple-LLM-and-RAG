Answer:::
The provided text mentions progressive learning as a method used to improve model performance in EfficientNetV2, but it doesn't specify the exact regularization techniques used within that progressive learning framework. 

The text does, however, mention dropout as a common hyperparameter for DNNs.  Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during each training step. This prevents the model from relying too heavily on any single neuron and encourages the learning of more robust features, thus reducing overfitting. 


L2 regularization is another common technique not explicitly mentioned in the text. L2 regularization adds a penalty to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. This penalty discourages the model from learning weights that are too large, which can lead to overfitting.
