Answer:::
The deep learning model described in the context is used for **classification**. 

It is trained to classify  "Potential Change Factors (PCF)" land based on satellite imagery.  The model learns to recognize patterns in the imagery that correspond to different land cover types.  

The text states: "In the classification part, a deep learning model was trained based on the results of previous steps. The target PSI, which has the same format as the trained PSI, can be classified using the trained model."
