Answer:::
The provided text states that the experiments were performed on a "small-size dataset without data augmentation."  It also mentions that determining the model's generalizability to "other various complex images" would require more experiments with images from different sources. 

Therefore, based on the information given, we can conclude that no specific measures like diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting were mentioned to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
