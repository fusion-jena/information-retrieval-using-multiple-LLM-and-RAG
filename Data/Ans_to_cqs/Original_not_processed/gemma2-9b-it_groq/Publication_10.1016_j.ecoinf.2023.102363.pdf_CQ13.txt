Answer:::
The provided text describes the hyperparameters used in both the initial training of the EfficientNet base model and its fine-tuning for the Gulf of Mexico data. 

**For the base model training:**

* **Optimizer:** Adam
* **Learning rate:** 0.001
* **Decay factor:** 0.75
* **Step size:** 2.2 (This value is not explicitly stated as a hyperparameter, but it's likely related to the Adam optimizer's step size.)

**For fine-tuning the base model on Gulf of Mexico data:**

* **Optimizer:** Adam (presumably with the same parameters as the base model)
* **Learning rate:** Cyclical learning rate of 0.0004
* **Epochs:** 50
* **Early stopping:**  Deployed if validation loss doesn't improve within 10 epochs
* **Dropout rate:** 0.2
* **DropConnect:** Employed
