Answer:::
Based on the provided text, the deep learning pipeline primarily uses image data. 

Several references mention:

* **Hyperspectral imagery:**  Ca, et al. (2008) and Khan, et al. (2022) discuss using hyperspectral imagery for agricultural applications.
* **Multispectral imagery:** Cao, et al. (2020) and Yue, et al. (2019) utilize multispectral images from UAVs and satellites for vegetation analysis.
* **Visible light images:** Yin, et al. (2020) employ visible light images from UAVs for vegetation extraction.
* **Sentinel-2 data:** Akcay, et al. (2021) and You, et al. (2021) work with Sentinel-2 data, which is a type of satellite imagery.

While the text focuses on image data, it's possible that other data formats like CSV (for ancillary data) are also used in the broader context of the research.
