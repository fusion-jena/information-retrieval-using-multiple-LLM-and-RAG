Answer:::

The provided text focuses on using deep learning for sentiment analysis and urban environment analysis. It doesn't delve into strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. 

However,  randomness is a common element in deep learning, often introduced through:

* **Random Initialization:**  Weights and biases in neural networks are typically initialized randomly. This prevents all neurons from starting in the same state, promoting diverse learning.

* **Dropout:**  A regularization technique where a percentage of neurons are randomly "dropped out" (ignored) during each training step. This prevents overfitting and encourages the network to learn more robust features.

* **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):**  A popular optimization algorithm that uses a random subset (mini-batch) of the training data to calculate the gradient at each step. This introduces noise and helps the network escape local minima.

**Strategies to Handle Randomness:**

* **Setting a Random Seed:**  Fixing the random seed ensures that the same random numbers are generated each time you run your code. This allows for reproducibility of results.

* **Using Techniques Like Batch Normalization:**  These techniques help stabilize training and reduce the impact of random fluctuations in the data.

* **Ensemble Methods:**  Training multiple models with different random initializations and averaging their predictions can reduce the variance introduced by randomness.
