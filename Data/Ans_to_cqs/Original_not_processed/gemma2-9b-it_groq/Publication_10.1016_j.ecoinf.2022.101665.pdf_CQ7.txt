Answer:::
The provided text focuses on cross-validation methods for evaluating thematic maps, not deep learning model training.  It doesn't specify criteria for splitting data for train, test, and validation sets in deep learning. 

However, common practices in deep learning generally involve:

* **Random Splitting:**  Data is randomly divided into three subsets: training, validation, and test. 
* **Proportions:**  Typical splits are 70% training, 15% validation, and 15% test. This can be adjusted based on dataset size and complexity.
* **Stratification:**  If the data has imbalanced classes, stratification ensures each subset maintains a similar class distribution as the original data. This helps prevent bias during training.
