Answer:::
The deep learning model described in the text is used for **detection**. 

Specifically, it is a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained to automatically detect the calls of Northern Bobwhite birds. The text mentions using the model to detect "Northern Bobwhite *Colinus virginianus* covey calls" and converting peak powers obtained from the CNN to distances for each detected call.
