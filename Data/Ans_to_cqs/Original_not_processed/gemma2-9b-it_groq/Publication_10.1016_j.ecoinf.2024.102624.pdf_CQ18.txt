Answer:::
The text describes a strategy for monitoring model performance during training using 10-fold cross-validation with three repetitions. 

Here's how it works:

1. **Splitting the Data:** The training dataset is divided into 10 equal folds.

2. **Iterative Training and Testing:**  Nine folds are used for training the model, while the remaining fold serves as the testing set. This process is repeated ten times, with each fold acting as the testing set once.

3. **Repetitions:** This entire 10-fold cross-validation process is repeated three times using different random splits of the data.

4. **Accuracy Assessment:**  The performance of the model is evaluated on each testing fold using a metric called Overall Accuracy (OA).  

By averaging the OA values across all folds and repetitions, the authors obtain a more robust estimate of the model's performance and identify the best-performing models.
