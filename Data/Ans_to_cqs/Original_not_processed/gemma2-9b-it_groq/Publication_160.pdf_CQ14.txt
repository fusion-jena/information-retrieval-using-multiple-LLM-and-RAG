Answer:::
The provided text states that a grid search was used to optimize the hyperparameters.  Specifically, it mentions:

"5 Grid search: C = {10−4; 10−3; 10−2; 10−1;1;10;100}; solver = {sag; saga; lbfgs}" 

This indicates that the hyperparameters C and solver were varied across a predefined set of values using a grid search method.
