Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the challenges and techniques of training deep learning models for audio enhancement, particularly in bioacoustics. It doesn't explicitly detail the preprocessing steps involved before training such models. 

However, based on common practices in deep learning, we can infer some likely preprocessing steps:

* **Noise Reduction:** The text mentions using spectral subtraction to approximate "clean" ground-truth data by removing noise from field recordings. This suggests that noise reduction is a crucial preprocessing step.
* **Data Augmentation:**  To increase the size and diversity of the training dataset, techniques like adding random noise to clean recordings might be employed.
* **Feature Extraction:**  While the text discusses using raw waveforms, it also mentions spectrograms.  Feature extraction techniques like Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) or spectrograms might be used to represent the audio data in a way that's more suitable for deep learning models.
* **Normalization/Scaling:**  Deep learning models often benefit from input data that has a consistent range. Normalization or scaling techniques, like min-max scaling or standardization, could be applied to the audio features.

It's important to note that the specific preprocessing steps would depend on the chosen deep learning architecture, the characteristics of the audio data, and the specific task (e.g., noise reduction, source separation, classification).
