Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the architecture and hyperparameters of various deep learning models, but it doesn't specify the preprocessing steps involved in training them. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

* **Feature Scaling:**  Scaling features to a similar range (e.g., 0 to 1 or -1 to 1) can improve model performance. Common techniques include min-max scaling and standardization (z-score normalization).

* **Normalization:**  Similar to scaling, normalization transforms features to have zero mean and unit variance. This can be beneficial for algorithms sensitive to feature scales.

* **Encoding Categorical Features:**  Categorical variables (e.g., text, labels) need to be converted into numerical representations that the model can understand. Techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding are commonly used.

* **Data Splitting:**  The dataset is typically split into training, validation, and testing sets to train the model, evaluate its performance during training, and assess its generalization ability on unseen data.
