Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the training process of a specific deep learning model for plant cover prediction and doesn't delve into the general preprocessing steps for training deep learning models. 

However, based on common practices in deep learning, here are some preprocessing steps often involved:

* **Normalization:** Scaling pixel values to a specific range (e.g., 0 to 1) can improve training stability and speed.
* **Data Augmentation:** Techniques like horizontal flipping, rotation, and cropping can increase the size and diversity of the training dataset, helping the model generalize better.
* **Cleaning:** This might involve removing noise, outliers, or irrelevant information from the data. For image data, it could include removing artifacts or inconsistencies.

Remember that the specific preprocessing steps depend on the nature of the data and the chosen deep learning model.
