Answer:::
The provided text describes a workflow for identifying red kite sightings in social media data using both textual metadata and image content.  

While it mentions using pre-trained algorithms for identifying classes like "buildings, people, or birds," it doesn't specify the exact data annotation techniques used to train these algorithms. 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what data annotation techniques were used in the deep learning pipeline.
