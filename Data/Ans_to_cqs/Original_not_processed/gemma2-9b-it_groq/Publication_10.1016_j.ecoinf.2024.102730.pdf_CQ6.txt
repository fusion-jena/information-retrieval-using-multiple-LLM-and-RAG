Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the application of machine learning, specifically artificial neural networks, for vegetation studies. It doesn't delve into the specific preprocessing steps involved in preparing data for training a deep learning model. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.
* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1) to prevent features with larger magnitudes from dominating the learning process.
* **Scaling:**  Similar to normalization, but often involves standardizing features to have zero mean and unit variance.
* **Encoding categorical variables:** Converting categorical data into numerical representations that the model can understand (e.g., one-hot encoding).
* **Feature engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones to potentially improve model performance.


Remember that the specific preprocessing steps will depend on the nature of the data and the chosen deep learning model.
