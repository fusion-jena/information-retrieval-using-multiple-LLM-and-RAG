Answer:::
The provided text states that the deep learning model is used to "Monitoring ecosystem service change in the City of Shenzhen".  

While it doesn't explicitly state the specific type of deep learning task (classification, segmentation, detection),  the context suggests it's likely used for **classification**. 

Ecosystem service change often involves categorizing land cover types (e.g., forest, urban, agricultural) which aligns with image classification tasks commonly performed by deep learning models.
