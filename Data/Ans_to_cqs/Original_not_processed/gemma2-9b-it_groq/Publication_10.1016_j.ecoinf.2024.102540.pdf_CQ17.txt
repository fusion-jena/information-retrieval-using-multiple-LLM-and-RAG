Answer:::
The provided text does not mention any specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.  It focuses on the dataset split, model architecture (YOLOv5 family), hyperparameter tuning (epochs and batch size), and evaluation metrics. 


Therefore, I cannot answer your question about regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization based on the given context.
