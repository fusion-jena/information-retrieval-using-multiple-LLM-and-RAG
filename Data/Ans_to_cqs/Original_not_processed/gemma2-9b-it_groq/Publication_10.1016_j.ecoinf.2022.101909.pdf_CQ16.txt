Answer:::
The training process was stopped using the early stopping method.  This method monitors the validation loss and terminates training when the validation loss plateaus or starts to increase for a specified number of epochs (patience = 5).  

Optimal training was achieved at the end of the ninth epoch, when the validation loss reached a minimum.
