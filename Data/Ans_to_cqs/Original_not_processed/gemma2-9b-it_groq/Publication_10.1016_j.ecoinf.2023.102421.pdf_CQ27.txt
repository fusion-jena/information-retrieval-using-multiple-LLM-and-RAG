Answer:::
The provided text does not describe the process of deploying the trained deep learning model. It focuses on the data used, the model selection process (XGBoost and LightGBM), hyperparameter optimization techniques (Bayesian optimizers and TDO), and the evaluation metrics (RMSE, MAE, R2).  There is no information about model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related steps.
