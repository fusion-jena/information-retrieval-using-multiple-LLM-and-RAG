Answer:::
The provided text states that the training process was run for 150,000 iterations.  It also mentions that the learning rate was reduced after 100,000 iterations.  

The text indicates that the models generally reached stable performance and minimum loss values around 100,000 iterations.  

However, it doesn't explicitly state that training completion is determined by a validation loss plateau.
