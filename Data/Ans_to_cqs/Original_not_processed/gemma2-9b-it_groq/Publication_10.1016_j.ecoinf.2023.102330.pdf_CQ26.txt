Answer:::

The provided text focuses on data augmentation techniques used to estimate the detection bias of a CNN model for identifying Northern bobwhite calls.  

Specifically, it describes adding "known 'non-detections' with distance of NA" to the dataset. This helps model the probability of false positive detections (NFPi) in relation to the data augmentation parameter (Ïˆ) and the true detection outcomes (yi,j).

The text does not mention other bias mitigation techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection during the preprocessing stage of the deep learning pipeline.
