Answer:::
The provided text mentions using a **class-weighted technique** to address data imbalance during preprocessing. 

It states: "First, the dataset is balanced using the class-weighted technique. This step is important as the deep learning models have a bias towards classes with a large number of images."

The text explains that this technique involves calculating weights for each class based on their frequency in the dataset. These weights are then used during the training process to give more importance to the minority classes. 


While the text doesn't explicitly mention other techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling, it focuses on class weighting as the chosen method for handling data imbalance in this specific work.
