Answer:::
The provided text mentions the use of 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate the deep learning models.  

Cross-validation is a technique used to assess how well a model will generalize to new, unseen data. It involves splitting the data into multiple folds, training the model on some folds, and evaluating its performance on the remaining fold. This process is repeated multiple times, with different folds used for training and evaluation each time. 

However, the text does not specify if a diverse dataset was used or if stratified splitting was employed.
