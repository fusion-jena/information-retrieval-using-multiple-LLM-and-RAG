Answer:::
The provided text focuses on comparing XGBoost and deep learning models, highlighting their differences in areas like training time, interpretability, and data requirements.  

However, it doesn't specify the exact metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model.  The text does mention using the leave-one-out cross-validation procedure and calculating metrics like the coefficient of determination (R2), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Relative Root Mean Square Error (RRMSE).
