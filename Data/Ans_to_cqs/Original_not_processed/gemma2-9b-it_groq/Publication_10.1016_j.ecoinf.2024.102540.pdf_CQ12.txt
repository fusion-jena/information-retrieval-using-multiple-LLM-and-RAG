Answer:::
The text states that the YOLOv5 family of models, which are built on the PyTorch machine learning framework, are used in the pipeline.  It also mentions that CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) are deep neural networks that can process grid-patterned data, including imagery data, and have been successfully used for pattern recognition in insect images. 

Therefore, the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.
