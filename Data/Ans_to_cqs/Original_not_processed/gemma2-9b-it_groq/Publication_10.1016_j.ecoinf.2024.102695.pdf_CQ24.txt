Answer:::

The provided text focuses on machine learning models for predicting dissolved oxygen levels and doesn't delve into the specifics of handling randomness within deep learning pipelines. 

However, I can offer some general strategies commonly used to address randomness in deep learning:

* **Setting a Random Seed:**  Assigning a fixed random seed value at the beginning of the training process ensures that the random initialization of weights and the shuffling of data occur in a reproducible manner. This helps in making experiments repeatable and comparing results consistently.

* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training dataset by applying random transformations (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) to existing data samples can reduce the impact of randomness in the data itself.

* **Dropout:** This regularization technique randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during each training step. This prevents the model from relying too heavily on any single neuron and encourages the learning of more robust features.

* **Ensemble Methods:** Training multiple models with different random initializations and averaging their predictions can help to mitigate the effects of randomness introduced during the training process.
