Answer:::
The provided text describes data preprocessing steps involving normalization. 

Here's what it says about normalization:

* **Purpose:** To reduce the impact of large differences in magnitude values of various parameters in the dataset. This helps address issues like noise interference, fluctuations, and difficulty in data handling.

* **Formula:** The text provides a formula for min-max normalization:

   ```
   Yi' = (Yi - Ymin) / (Ymax - Ymin)
   ```

   Where:
    * Yi' is the normalized value
    * Yi is the original value
    * Ymax is the maximum value
    * Ymin is the minimum value

**Other Common Preprocessing Steps:**

While the text focuses on normalization, other common preprocessing steps for deep learning models include:

* **Scaling:** Similar to normalization, but often uses standardization (subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation) to center data around zero with unit variance.
* **Cleaning:** Handling missing values (imputation or removal), removing outliers, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.
* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones to potentially improve model performance.
