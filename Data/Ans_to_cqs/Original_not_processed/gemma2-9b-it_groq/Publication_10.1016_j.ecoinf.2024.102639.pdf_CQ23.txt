Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the methodology used for a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, not a deep learning model. Therefore, it doesn't offer information about measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. 


The text does mention techniques used for the SVM model, such as:

* **Dimensionality reduction:**  Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the dataset's dimensionality while retaining most of the original variance.
* **Hyperparameter tuning:** The regularization parameter ('C') and kernel type (linear) were optimized using grid search and cross-validation to balance model complexity and generalization ability. 



Let me know if you have any other questions about the SVM model described in the text.
