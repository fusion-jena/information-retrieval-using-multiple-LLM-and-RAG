Answer:::
The text states that the performance of the classifiers is expressed in terms of the average F1-scores computed for each individual class. 

It further explains that the F1-score is the harmonic mean of Precision (Pc) and Recall (Rc). 

Precision is calculated as the number of true positives (tp) divided by the sum of true positives and false positives (fp).

Recall is calculated as the number of true positives (tp) divided by the sum of true positives and false negatives (fn).
