Answer:::
The provided text describes the optimization process but doesn't explicitly state the method used (grid search, random search, etc.). 

It mentions that the optimal model was determined by:

*  Using feature classes 'L', 'Q', 'LQ', and 'LQP'.
*  Varying the regularization multiplier from 0.5 to 5.
*  Selecting the model with the minimum delta.AICc value (delta.AICc = 0).

The text focuses on the criteria used for optimization (delta.AICc) rather than the search algorithm itself.
