Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the application of machine learning algorithms for land use and land cover classification. It mentions the use of "weighted decay" and "size" as tuning parameters within the "nnet" package for an MLP ANN model to counter overfitting. 

However, it does not delve into specific regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization, which are commonly used in deep learning to prevent overfitting.
