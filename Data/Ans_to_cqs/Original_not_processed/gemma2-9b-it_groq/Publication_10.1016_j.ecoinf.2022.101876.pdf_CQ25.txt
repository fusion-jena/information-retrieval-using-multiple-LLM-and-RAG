Answer:::
The deep learning model described in the text is designed for **object detection**. 

Specifically, it uses a technique called Faster R-CNN. This model first identifies potential objects within an image by drawing bounding boxes around them. Then, it analyzes the characteristics of those regions to classify the objects as either an animal, a human, or a truck.
