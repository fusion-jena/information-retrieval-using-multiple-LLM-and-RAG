Answer:::
The provided text mentions several metrics used to evaluate the deep learning model's performance:

* **Accuracy:**  Represents the ratio of correct classifications to all classifications.
* **mIoU (mean Intersection over Union):**  A measure of overlap between the predicted segmentation and the ground truth segmentation.
* **Precision:**  Measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all instances predicted as positive.
* **Recall:**  Measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all actual positive instances.
* **F1-Score:**  The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of both.
