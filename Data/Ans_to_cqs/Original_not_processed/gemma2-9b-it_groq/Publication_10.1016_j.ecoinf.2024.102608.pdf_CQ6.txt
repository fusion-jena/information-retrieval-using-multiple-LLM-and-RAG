Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the structure of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and their application in freshwater ecology, as well as model performance assessment techniques. It doesn't delve into the specific preprocessing steps involved in training deep learning models. 

However, based on general knowledge of deep learning, here are some common preprocessing steps:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

* **Normalization/Scaling:**  Scaling features to a similar range (e.g., 0 to 1) can improve model performance. Common techniques include min-max scaling and standardization.

* **Feature Engineering:**  Creating new features from existing ones can sometimes enhance model accuracy.

* **Encoding Categorical Variables:**  Converting categorical data into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding) is necessary for most deep learning algorithms. 


Let me know if you have other questions about ANNs or deep learning concepts covered in the text.
