Answer:::
The text describes the use of a test set to evaluate the performance and generalizability of the optimal model.  

The data was randomly shuffled and then divided into training, validation, and test sets with a ratio of 8:1:1. This partitioning was repeated ten times to reduce the impact of random splitting and ensure consistent performance. 

While the text mentions techniques like random shuffling and repeated partitioning, it doesn't explicitly state the use of  diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.
