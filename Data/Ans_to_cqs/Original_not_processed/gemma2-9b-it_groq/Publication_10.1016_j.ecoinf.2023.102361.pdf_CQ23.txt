Answer:::

The provided text describes the dataset split into training, validation, and testing sets (60%, 20%, and 20% respectively) but doesn't mention specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model beyond this split. 

The text doesn't discuss:

* **Dataset diversity:**  Whether the dataset represents a wide range of image variations relevant to the classification task.
* **Cross-validation:**  Techniques like k-fold cross-validation, which involve partitioning the data into multiple folds for training and validation, were not mentioned.
* **Stratified splitting:**  A method to ensure that the class distribution is maintained in each split (training, validation, testing) was not explicitly stated. 


Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot definitively say what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
