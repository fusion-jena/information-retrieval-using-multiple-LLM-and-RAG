Answer:::
The provided text describes the criteria used for annotating fish in images for a deep learning project.  It mentions:

* **Bounding boxes:** While not explicitly stated, the requirement that fish occupy at least 80% of their bounding box implies the use of bounding boxes to define the fish's location in each image.

* **Species identification:** The annotation process focuses on identifying fish to the species level.

* **Size filtering:**  Fish smaller than 3000 squared pixels are excluded, suggesting a size-based filtering technique.

The text does not mention instance segmentation, which would involve outlining each individual fish in an image.
