Answer:::
The provided text focuses on evaluating the performance of machine learning models (RF, GBDT, LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost) rather than deep learning models. 

The metrics used to evaluate these models are:

* **R-squared (R2):**  A measure of how well the model fits the data.
* **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE):**  The square root of the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values.
* **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** The average of the absolute differences between the predicted and actual values.
* **Slope:**  In linear regression, the slope indicates the relationship between the predicted and actual values. 


Let me know if you have any other questions about these models or metrics.
