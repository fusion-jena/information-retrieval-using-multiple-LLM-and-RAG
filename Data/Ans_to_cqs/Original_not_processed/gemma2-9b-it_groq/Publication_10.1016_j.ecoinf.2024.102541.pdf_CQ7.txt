Answer:::
The provided text focuses on technical aspects of deep learning model architectures and doesn't specify the criteria used to split data for training, testing, and validation. 

However, a common practice is to split the data into these sets based on:

* **Percentage Split:** A typical split is 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. 
* **Stratification:**  Ensuring that the class distribution in each set (train, validation, test) is representative of the overall dataset. This is crucial for accurate model evaluation and generalization.
* **Randomization:**  Shuffling the data randomly before splitting to avoid any unintentional bias introduced by the order of data points.
