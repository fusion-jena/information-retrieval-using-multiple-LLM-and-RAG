Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the processing of bioacoustic data using deep learning, particularly in the context of passive acoustic monitoring (PAM).  

While it mentions that digital recorders are used in the field to collect sound data (bioacoustic recordings), it doesn't delve into other methods of data collection like surveys or public datasets. 


Therefore, based on the given context, we can only say that **digital recorders** are used for collecting raw data in this specific deep learning pipeline.
