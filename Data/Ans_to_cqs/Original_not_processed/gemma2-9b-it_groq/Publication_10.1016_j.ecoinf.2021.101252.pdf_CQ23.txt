Answer:::
The provided text describes the process of using an AutoML tool called mcfly to select and train a deep learning model. It details how candidate models are generated, trained, and evaluated using internal validation data sets (At, Av, and Bt). 

However, the text does not mention specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the final deep learning model, such as:

* **Diverse dataset:**  Whether the training data represents the diversity of real-world scenarios the model will encounter.
* **Cross-validation:**  Techniques like k-fold cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance on different subsets of the data.
* **Stratified splitting:**  Ensuring that the training and validation sets have a similar distribution of classes, especially if dealing with class imbalance. 


Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot determine what specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
