Answer:::
The provided text focuses on challenges and methods in bioacoustic event detection using deep learning, particularly in scenarios with limited data. It doesn't specify the criteria used to split data for training, testing, and validation in deep learning models. 

Generally, data is split into these sets using the following criteria:

* **Training set:** This is the largest portion of the data used to train the deep learning model. The model learns patterns and relationships within this data.
* **Validation set:** This set is used to evaluate the model's performance during training. It helps in tuning hyperparameters and preventing overfitting (where the model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data).
* **Test set:** This set is held out entirely from the training process and is used only once at the end to provide an unbiased evaluation of the final model's performance. 

The exact proportions of each set can vary depending on the size of the dataset and the specific task.
