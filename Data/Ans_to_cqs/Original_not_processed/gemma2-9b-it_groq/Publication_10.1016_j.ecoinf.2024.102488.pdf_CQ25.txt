Answer:::
The provided text focuses on a machine learning approach called stacked generalization for wetland classification, not deep learning.  It describes using multiple base models (TKNN, TRF, TAdaBoost, TXGBoost, TLightGBM) and combining their predictions with a meta-model (RF algorithm) to improve classification accuracy. 

There is no mention of a deep learning model or its purpose within this text.
