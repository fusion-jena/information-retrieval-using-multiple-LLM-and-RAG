Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the use of audio data for detecting ungulate vocalizations.  

It mentions:

* **Sound recordings:** These are the primary data source used in the study.
* **ROIs (Regions of Interest):** These are likely extracted from the sound recordings and represent segments containing potential vocalizations.
* **CSV:**  The text refers to a "cluster.csv" parameter, suggesting that CSV files are used for storing data related to the clustering of sound segments.


Therefore, the deep learning pipeline likely uses **audio data** in the form of sound recordings and **CSV files** for storing metadata about the extracted ROIs.
