Answer:::
Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline primarily utilizes **image** data. 

Several references mention the use of satellite imagery (Sentinel-2, Landsat-8) for tasks like water body extraction, water quality estimation, and suspended sediment concentration prediction.  

While the text focuses on image data, it's possible that other data formats like **CSV** (for numerical data related to wind speed, for example) could be incorporated into the pipeline as well.
