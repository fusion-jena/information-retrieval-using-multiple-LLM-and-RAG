Answer:::
The provided text states that the dataset is split into training and validation sets with an 80/20% ratio for each class.  

It also mentions a test set of 500 segments (187 possum vocalizations and 313 noise samples) used to evaluate model performance. 

The text doesn't specify the exact criteria used to initially divide the data into these sets, only that the 80/20 split is maintained for each class.
