Answer:::
The provided text mentions the use of `keras image_data_generator` for image augmentation, which includes random operations like rotation, width/height shift, shear, zoom, horizontal flip.  

These operations introduce randomness during the training process to increase the model's robustness and prevent overfitting. 

However, the text doesn't explicitly state any strategies for handling randomness in other aspects of the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value for reproducibility.
