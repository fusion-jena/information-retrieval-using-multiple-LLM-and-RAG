Answer:::

The provided text focuses on techniques for addressing unbalanced training data in the context of land use and land cover (LULC) mapping, particularly using Random Forest (RF) models.  While it mentions oversampling and undersampling, it doesn't delve into the specifics of these techniques or their application in deep learning preprocessing. 

The text also highlights the use of a hexagonal random-sampling strategy and a tile model, which are more related to data partitioning and model architecture than direct bias mitigation during preprocessing.

Therefore, based on the given information, I cannot provide a comprehensive answer about techniques used to address data bias during deep learning preprocessing.
