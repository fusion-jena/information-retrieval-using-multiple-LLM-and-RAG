Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the challenges and techniques used for high spatial resolution LAI estimation, particularly concerning data quality and training sample selection.  

It doesn't delve into specific bias mitigation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline's preprocessing stage, such as:

* **Stratified splitting:**  Ensuring class distribution balance in training and testing sets.
* **Oversampling:**  Increasing the representation of minority classes.
* **Undersampling:**  Reducing the representation of majority classes.
* **Diverse data collection:**  Actively gathering data from various sources and representing different scenarios to minimize bias. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer your query about bias mitigation techniques in a deep learning pipeline.
