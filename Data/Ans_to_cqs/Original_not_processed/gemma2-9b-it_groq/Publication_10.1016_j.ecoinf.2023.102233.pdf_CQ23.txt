Answer:::

The provided text does not explicitly mention the use of techniques like cross-validation, diverse datasets, or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. 

The text describes the use of active learning with a random selection approach for data augmentation to address class imbalance. However, it acknowledges that this approach alters the data distribution and may not allow for generalizing evaluation metrics to unlabeled data. 

Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot definitively say what measures were taken to ensure the model's generalizability.
