Answer:::
The provided text focuses on describing the structure and implementation of different machine learning models, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Random Forests (RFs), but it doesn't explicitly state the specific purpose of the deep learning model used in the study. 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what the purpose of the deep learning model is.
