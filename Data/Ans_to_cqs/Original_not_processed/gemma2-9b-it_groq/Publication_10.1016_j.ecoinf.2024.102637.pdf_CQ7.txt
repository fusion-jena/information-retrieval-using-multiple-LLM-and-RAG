Answer:::
The provided text focuses on architectural improvements and comparisons of deep learning models, particularly AlexNet, and doesn't delve into data splitting criteria for training. 

Generally, in deep learning, data is split into three main sets:

* **Training set:** This is the largest portion of the data used to train the model. The model learns patterns and relationships within this data.
* **Validation set:** This set is used to evaluate the model's performance during training. It helps in tuning hyperparameters and preventing overfitting (where the model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data).
* **Test set:** This set is held out entirely from the training process and is used only once at the end to provide an unbiased evaluation of the final model's performance.

The specific proportions for these splits can vary depending on the dataset size and the problem being addressed. A common split is 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing.
