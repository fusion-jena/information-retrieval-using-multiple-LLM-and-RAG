Answer:::
The provided text does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. 

It states that the weights were obtained from a pre-trained DeeplabV3+ model trained on the COCO dataset. However, it doesn't elaborate on the diversity of the COCO dataset or any techniques used to evaluate or improve the model's generalizability.
