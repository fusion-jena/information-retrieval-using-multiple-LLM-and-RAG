Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the architecture and efficiency of the EfficientNetV2 model and doesn't delve into specific regularization methods used during training to prevent overfitting. 

While it mentions that EfficientNetV2 employs an "improved progressive learning approach that dynamically adjusts the regularization method based on the training image size," it doesn't specify the exact regularization techniques used. 

Common regularization methods used in deep learning to combat overfitting include:

* **Dropout:** Randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during each training step, forcing the network to learn more robust features.
* **L2 Regularization (Weight Decay):** Adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. This discourages the model from assigning excessively large weights to any single feature.
* **Early Stopping:** Monitors the model's performance on a validation set and stops training when performance on the validation set starts to decrease.
