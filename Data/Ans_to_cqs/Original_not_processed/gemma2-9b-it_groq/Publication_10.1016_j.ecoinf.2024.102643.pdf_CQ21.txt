Answer:::
The provided text describes the model training process and evaluation metrics but doesn't detail specific post-processing steps like saliency maps or confusion matrices. 

It mentions the following evaluation methods:

* **AUC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve):**  A measure of the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes.
* **TSS (True Skill Statistic):**  Another metric for assessing model accuracy, ranging from -1 to +1 with positive values indicating a good fit. 


Therefore, based on the given information, we can conclude that the text focuses on the training and evaluation aspects but doesn't elaborate on post-processing techniques like saliency maps or confusion matrix construction.
