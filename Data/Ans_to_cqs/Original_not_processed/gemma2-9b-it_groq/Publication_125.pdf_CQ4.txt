* **Rotation:** Images are rotated by up to 90 degrees.
* **Zoom:** Images are zoomed in or out by up to 20%.
* **Shear:** Images are sheared, meaning one side is shifted relative to the other. The shear range is also 20%.
* **Horizontal shift:** Images are shifted horizontally by up to 20% of their width.
* **Vertical shift:** Images are shifted vertically by up to 20% of their height.
* **Brightness:** The brightness of images is adjusted within a range of 0.2 to 1.0.
* **Horizontal flip:** Images are flipped horizontally.
