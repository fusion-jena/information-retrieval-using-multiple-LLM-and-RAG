Answer:::
The provided text doesn't specify the exact measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. 

While it mentions the importance of a representative dataset and the influence of atmospheric correction algorithms on model performance, it doesn't detail specific techniques like cross-validation, stratified splitting, or data augmentation used to enhance the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.
