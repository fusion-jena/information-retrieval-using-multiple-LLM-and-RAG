Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the XGBoost algorithm's features and performance evaluation metrics in landslide risk assessment. It doesn't specify the criteria used to determine when training is complete for XGBoost or any other model. 

Generally, training is considered complete when a model achieves a satisfactory performance on a validation set, which is a separate dataset used to evaluate the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. 

Common criteria for determining training completion include:

* **Validation loss plateau:** If the validation loss (the error the model makes on the validation set) stops decreasing or increases, it might indicate that the model is overfitting (memorizing the training data instead of learning general patterns).
* **Reaching a predefined number of epochs:** An epoch is one complete pass through the training dataset. Training might be stopped after a certain number of epochs, even if the validation loss hasn't plateaued.
* **Validation performance reaching a target:** If the model achieves a desired level of performance on the validation set (e.g., a specific F1-score or AUC-ROC), training can be stopped.
