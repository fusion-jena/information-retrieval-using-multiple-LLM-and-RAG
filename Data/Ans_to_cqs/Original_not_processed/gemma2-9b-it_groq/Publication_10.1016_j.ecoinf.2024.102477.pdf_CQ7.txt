Answer:::
The provided text focuses on describing Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Seasonal Long Short-Term Memory (SLSTM) models for time series prediction, particularly in the context of agricultural product sales. It doesn't offer details about data splitting criteria for deep learning model training. 

Generally, in deep learning, data is split into three sets:

* **Training set:** Used to train the model, allowing it to learn patterns and relationships in the data.
* **Validation set:** Used to evaluate the model's performance during training and fine-tune hyperparameters.
* **Test set:** Used to assess the final performance of the trained model on unseen data, providing an unbiased estimate of its real-world capabilities.

The specific proportions for each set can vary depending on the dataset size and the problem being addressed. A common split is 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing.
