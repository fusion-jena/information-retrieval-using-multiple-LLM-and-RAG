Answer:::
The provided text focuses on fine-tuning pre-trained language models for text classification and details the specific preprocessing steps taken for this task.  

It mentions the following preprocessing steps:

* **Tokenization:**  Text is broken down into smaller units (tokens) using the NLTK word-tokenizer for web articles and the BERT tokenizer for both web articles and social media posts.
* **Chunking:** Longer web articles are split into chunks of 300 tokens to accommodate the BERT model's 512 token limit. Chunks containing relevant keywords (bat-related or exploitation-related terms) are retained.
* **Truncation:**  Text is truncated to a maximum of 400 tokens for social media posts and 512 tokens for web articles.

The text does not discuss other common preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning.
