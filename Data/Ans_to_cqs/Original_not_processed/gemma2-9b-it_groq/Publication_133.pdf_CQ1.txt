Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning in insect ecoinformatics and doesn't specify the exact methods used for collecting raw data. 

It mentions several sources of existing ecological data, such as:

* **Long-term ecological monitoring:** This likely involves systematic observations and data collection over extended periods.
* **Citizen science projects:** These projects rely on contributions from the public to gather data, which could involve observations, photographs, or other forms of recording.
* **Museum catalogs:** These contain historical records of insect specimens, potentially including data on location, date, and other relevant information. 


The text doesn't delve into the specifics of how these data are collected, such as the use of surveys, sensors, or other techniques.
