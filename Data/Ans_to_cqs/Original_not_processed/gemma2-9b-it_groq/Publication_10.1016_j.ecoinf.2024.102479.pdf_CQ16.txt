Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the hyperparameter tuning process using Gradient Search Cross-Validation (GSCV) and k-fold cross-validation for model performance evaluation.  

It doesn't specify the criteria used to determine when training is complete.  

Possible criteria for training completion (not mentioned in the text) include:

* **Validation loss plateau:** Training stops when the model's performance on a validation set stops improving significantly.
* **Maximum number of epochs:** Training is limited to a predefined number of passes through the entire dataset.
* **Early stopping:** Training is stopped if the performance on a validation set starts to decrease after a certain number of epochs.
