Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the development and validation of a CNN model for classifying environmental conditions. It describes the model architecture (VGG16), training process, and performance evaluation using confusion matrices. 

However, it does not offer details about the deployment process of the trained model.  Therefore, I cannot answer your question about the specific process followed for model deployment (e.g., serialization, platform selection) based on the given context.
