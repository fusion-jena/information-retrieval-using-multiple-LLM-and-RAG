Answer:::
The text states that the performance of the neural network was assessed using the Intersection over Union (IoU) metric and overall accuracy.  

It provides the formulas for calculating both:

* **IoU:**  IoU = TP / (TP + FP + FN) 
* **Accuracy:** Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + FN + FP + TN)

Where:

* TP = True Positive
* TN = True Negative
* FP = False Positive
* FN = False Negative
