Answer:::
The provided text describes the process of training and evaluating machine learning models (Random Forest and Maxent) for predicting the occurrence of pine wilt disease.  

However, it doesn't specify the criteria used to determine when training is complete.  The text mentions that the dataset is randomly split into training and testing sets (7:3 ratio) in each iteration, and that the models are repeated 10 times with different random datasets. 

To determine when training is complete, machine learning practitioners typically use criteria like:

* **Validation loss plateau:**  Monitoring the loss function on a validation set (separate from the training set) and stopping training when the loss on the validation set stops improving or starts increasing.
* **Number of epochs:**  Setting a predefined number of training iterations (epochs) and stopping after that number is reached.
* **Early stopping:**  Similar to validation loss plateau, but stopping training if the validation loss doesn't improve for a certain number of epochs.


The specific criteria used in this study are not detailed in the provided text.
