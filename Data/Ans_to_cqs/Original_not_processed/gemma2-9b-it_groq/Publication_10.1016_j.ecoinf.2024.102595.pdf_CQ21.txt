Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the data preprocessing, model training, and hyperparameter tuning stages of a study. It doesn't describe the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as:

* **Saliency maps:** These are visualizations that highlight the input features most influential in the model's prediction for a specific instance.
* **Metrics calculation:**  This involves evaluating the model's performance using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC, depending on the task (e.g., classification or regression).
* **Confusion matrix:**  A table that summarizes the performance of a classification model by showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer your query about the postprocessing steps.
