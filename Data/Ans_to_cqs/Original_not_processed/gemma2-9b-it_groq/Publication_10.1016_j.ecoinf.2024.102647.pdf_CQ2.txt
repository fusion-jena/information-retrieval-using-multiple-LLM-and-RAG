Answer:::
Based on the provided context, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is likely **image**. 

Here's why:

* The context mentions "satellite imagery" in relation to soil salinity, soil moisture, and soil pH analysis.
* The research paper cited by Ghazali et al. (2020) focuses on generating soil properties from satellite imagery.
*  Deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are commonly used for image analysis tasks.


Therefore, it's reasonable to infer that the deep learning pipeline in this context utilizes image data derived from satellite imagery.
