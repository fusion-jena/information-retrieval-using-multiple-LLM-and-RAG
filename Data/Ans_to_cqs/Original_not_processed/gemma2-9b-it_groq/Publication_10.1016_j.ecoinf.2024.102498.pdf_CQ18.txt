Answer:::
The provided text states that hyperparameter tuning for the machine learning models was performed using validation data (10% of the training data).  

While it doesn't explicitly describe the strategy for *monitoring* model performance *during* training, it implies that the performance was likely evaluated on the validation set at various points during the training process. This is a common practice to prevent overfitting and select the best performing model.
