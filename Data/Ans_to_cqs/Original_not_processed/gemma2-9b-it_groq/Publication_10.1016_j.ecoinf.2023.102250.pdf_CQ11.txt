Answer:::
I cannot provide a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline described in the text. The provided context focuses on the challenges and solutions related to birdsong classification using deep learning, particularly addressing the issue of limited data availability. 

It mentions techniques like data augmentation and dynamic convolution but does not specify a particular repository for the datasets or the trained models.
