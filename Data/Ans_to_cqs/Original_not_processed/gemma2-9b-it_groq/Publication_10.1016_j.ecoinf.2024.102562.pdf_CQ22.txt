Answer:::
The provided text states that two standard metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model: 

* **Mean average precision (mAP)**: This metric represents the average of the weighted mean of precision for each class. 
* **Recall**: This metric is the percentage of correctly detected objects out of all the correct targets.  

In simpler terms, recall measures how well the model can find all the instances of a target, while mAP indicates the reliability of the identified results.
