Answer:::
Based on the provided text snippets, the purpose of the deep learning models discussed is primarily **prediction**. 

Several papers mention using deep learning to predict water quality parameters like chlorophyll-a (a proxy for algal biomass) and outflow temperature from stratified reservoirs.  

For example, the study by Wai et al. (2022) focuses on "Applications of deep learning in water quality management: A state-of-the-art review," suggesting a broad aim of using deep learning for forecasting water quality. 

The text also highlights the use of Random Forest (RF) modeling, an ensemble learning method, for prediction tasks.  

While the text doesn't explicitly state other purposes like classification or segmentation, the focus on prediction strongly suggests that deep learning is being applied in this domain.
