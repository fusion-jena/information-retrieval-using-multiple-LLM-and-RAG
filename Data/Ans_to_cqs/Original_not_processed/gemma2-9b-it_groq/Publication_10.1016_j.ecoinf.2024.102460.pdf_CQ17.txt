Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the LSTM-PLUS-FMOP model for land use/cover change prediction and doesn't delve into specific regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline.  Therefore, I cannot answer your question about regularization techniques like dropout or L2 regularization from this context.
