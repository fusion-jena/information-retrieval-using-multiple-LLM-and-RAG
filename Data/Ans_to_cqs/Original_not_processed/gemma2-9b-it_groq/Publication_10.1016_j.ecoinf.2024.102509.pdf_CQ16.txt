Answer:::
The provided text focuses on describing the development and performance of an artificial neural network (ANN) model for predicting AGB (aboveground biomass). It doesn't explicitly state the criteria used to determine when training is complete. 

However, it does mention that:

* **Repeated training and testing are necessary** to develop an optimal neural network.
* The selection of hidden layers and neurons is done through **trial and error** to optimize the network's structure.
* The training process aims to **minimize the gap between the anticipated output and the actual target values** using a loss function.

Based on common practices in neural network training, it's likely that the training process would be stopped when one or more of the following criteria are met:

* **Validation loss plateau:**  If the loss function on a separate validation dataset stops decreasing significantly, it could indicate that the model has reached a point of diminishing returns and further training might lead to overfitting.
* **Maximum number of epochs:** A predefined limit on the number of training iterations (epochs) could be set to prevent excessive training time.
* **Early stopping:**  This technique monitors the validation loss and stops training if it starts to increase, indicating potential overfitting.



It's important to note that these are general practices, and the specific criteria used in this particular case would need to be found in the supplementary material or the original research paper.
