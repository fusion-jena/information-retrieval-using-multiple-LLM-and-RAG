Answer:::
The provided text does not specify the exact method used to optimize the model's hyperparameters (e.g., grid search, random search). 

It only mentions that the authors trained several models on the insect TL (TLm) benchmark dataset to find the optimal value for the hyperparameter α, which was in the range of 1.0⋅10<sup>-6</sup> to 1.0. They observed marginal changes in accuracy across different α values and ultimately chose α = 0.5 for their study.
