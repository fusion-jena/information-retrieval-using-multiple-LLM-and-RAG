Answer:::
The provided text focuses on convolutional neural networks for land cover classification and doesn't delve into specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting.  

While it mentions training by optimizing filter weights using a loss function (like categorical cross-entropy) and backpropagation, it doesn't explicitly name techniques like dropout or L2 regularization.
