The provided text focuses on the application of Elastic Net in improving the performance of a deep learning model for fish species classification. It doesn't discuss preprocessing steps for deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps before training a deep learning model include:

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1 or -1 to 1) to prevent features with larger scales from dominating the learning process.
* **Scaling:** Similar to normalization, but the goal is to reduce the range of feature values to have zero mean and unit variance.
* **Cleaning:** Handling missing values (e.g., imputation or removal), removing duplicates, and addressing outliers.
* **Encoding categorical features:** Converting categorical variables into numerical representations that the model can understand (e.g., one-hot encoding or label encoding).
