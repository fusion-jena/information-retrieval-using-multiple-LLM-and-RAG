Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the performance evaluation of a deep learning model for digit recognition and doesn't delve into the strategies used to handle randomness within the deep learning pipeline. 

However, I can provide some general information about how randomness is handled in deep learning:

* **Random Initialization:**  Weights and biases in neural networks are often initialized randomly. This prevents all neurons from starting in the same state and allows the network to learn diverse representations.

* **Dropout:**  A regularization technique where a percentage of neurons are randomly "dropped out" (ignored) during each training step. This prevents overfitting by forcing the network to learn more robust features.

* **Batch Normalization:**  A technique that normalizes the activations of neurons within each mini-batch. This can help stabilize training and reduce the impact of random fluctuations in the data.

* **Random Data Augmentation:**  Techniques like random cropping, flipping, and rotation are applied to training data to increase its diversity and improve the model's generalization ability.

* **Random Seed:**  Setting a random seed ensures that the random number generator produces the same sequence of numbers each time the code is run. This allows for reproducibility of experiments.
