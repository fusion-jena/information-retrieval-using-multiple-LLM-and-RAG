Answer:::
The text states that the authors used two data augmentation techniques:

1. **Random changes of RGB channels:**  The intensity of each color channel (Red, Green, Blue) was randomly adjusted by up to 0.1. This was applied simultaneously to all channels.

2. **Random vertical and horizontal flips:** The images were randomly flipped either vertically or horizontally. 


The authors also considered using small random rotations but found that it did not improve the network performance.
