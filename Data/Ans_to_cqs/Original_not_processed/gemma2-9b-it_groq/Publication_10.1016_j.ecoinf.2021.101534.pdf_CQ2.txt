The provided text describes a deep learning pipeline that uses the following data formats:

* **Audio:** The pipeline starts with mixed audio clips.
* **Spectrogram (Image):** Audio clips are converted into spectrograms, which are visual representations of audio data and are treated as images for model training. 
* **CSV:**  The text doesn't explicitly mention CSV format, but it refers to a labeled database, suggesting that some metadata or labels associated with the audio clips might be stored in a structured format like CSV.
