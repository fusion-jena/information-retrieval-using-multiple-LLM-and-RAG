Answer:::
Based on the provided text snippets, the deep learning models are primarily used for **segmentation**. 

Several papers discuss using deep learning for segmenting objects in LiDAR data:

* **Chen et al. (2021)** use PointNet for individual tree crown segmentation directly from UAV-borne LiDAR data.
* **Martins et al. (2021)** employ machine learning and SLIC for tree canopy segmentation in urban areas.
* The text excerpt discussing Yin and Wang (2019) highlights the use of deep learning (specifically 3D convolutional neural networks) for individual plant segmentation in maize plots using ground-based LiDAR data.
*  Wang et al. (2019a) utilize the R-CNN method for individual rubber tree segmentation based on ground-based LiDAR data.


These examples demonstrate the common application of deep learning in segmenting individual objects (trees, plants, etc.) within LiDAR datasets.
