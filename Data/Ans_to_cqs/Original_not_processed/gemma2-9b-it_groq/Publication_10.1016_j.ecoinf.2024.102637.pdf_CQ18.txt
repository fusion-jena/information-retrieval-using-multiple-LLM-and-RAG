Answer:::
The provided text describes the model architecture, training process, and evaluation metrics but doesn't explicitly state the strategy used to monitor model performance *during* training.  

We can infer some information:

* **Evaluation indicators:** The text lists testing accuracy, inference time, precision, recall, specificity, F1 score, and sensitivity as evaluation metrics. These are typically calculated on a validation set (separate from the training and testing sets) and used to track performance over time.
* **Hyperparameter tuning:** The text mentions adjusting the hyperparameter Î» based on the number of training iterations. This suggests that performance on a validation set is likely monitored to guide this adjustment.

However, without explicit statements about the monitoring process, we cannot definitively say what specific techniques were used (e.g., plotting loss and accuracy curves, early stopping based on validation performance).
