Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the implementation of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms for modeling and doesn't delve into specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. 

Therefore, I cannot answer your query about data annotation techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation based on the given context.
