Answer:::
The deep learning model is used for **classification**. 

Specifically, it aims to differentiate between "boatwhistles" and "other" signals.  The model takes spectrograms of acoustic signals as input and uses a pre-trained ResNet-50 convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features. These features are then fed into a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, which learns to distinguish between the two classes.
