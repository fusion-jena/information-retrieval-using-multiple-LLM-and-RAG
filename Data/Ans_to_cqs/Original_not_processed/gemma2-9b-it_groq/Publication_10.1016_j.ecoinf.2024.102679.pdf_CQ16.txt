Answer:::
The provided text states that the model selection was based on the epoch that gave the best performance on the validation set.  It also mentions that the training procedure for the fine-tuning iterations consisted of a set number of epochs (200 for the first step and 50 for the second step). 

However, the text does not specify any criteria for determining when training is complete beyond these set epoch numbers and the validation performance.
