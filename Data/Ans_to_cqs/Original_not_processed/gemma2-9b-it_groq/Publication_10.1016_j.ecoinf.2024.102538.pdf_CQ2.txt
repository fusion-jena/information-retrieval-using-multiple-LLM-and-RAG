Answer:::
The provided text focuses on deep learning models for bird sound recognition.  It mentions that these models typically map sound amplitude onto a 2-D mel-scale spectrogram. 

Therefore, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is **audio**. This audio data is then transformed into a spectrogram, which is a visual representation of the sound's frequency content over time.
