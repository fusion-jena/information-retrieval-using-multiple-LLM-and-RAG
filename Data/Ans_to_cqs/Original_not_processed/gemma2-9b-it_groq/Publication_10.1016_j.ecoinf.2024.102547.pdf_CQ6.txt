Answer:::

The provided text focuses on functional data analysis (FDA) techniques and doesn't discuss preprocessing steps for deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values (imputation or removal), removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies.
* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1 or -1 to 1) to prevent features with larger magnitudes from dominating the learning process.
* **Feature Scaling:**  Similar to normalization, but often involves techniques like standardization (subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation) to ensure features have zero mean and unit variance.
* **Encoding Categorical Features:** Converting categorical variables into numerical representations that deep learning models can understand (e.g., one-hot encoding, label encoding).
* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones to potentially improve model performance. This can involve combining features, transforming them, or extracting relevant information.
