Answer:::

The provided text focuses on comparing different machine learning algorithms, particularly tree-based methods like Random Forest, LightGBM, and XGBoost. It doesn't discuss techniques for addressing data bias in deep learning pipelines. 

However, I can provide some information on common techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of deep learning pipelines:

* **Stratified Splitting:** This technique ensures that the training, validation, and test sets have a similar distribution of target variable classes as the original dataset. This helps prevent bias towards certain classes during training.

* **Oversampling:** This involves duplicating instances from underrepresented classes to balance the dataset and give them more weight during training.

* **Undersampling:** This involves removing instances from overrepresented classes to balance the dataset.

* **Diverse Data Collection:**  This is a proactive approach that aims to collect data from a wide range of sources and demographics to minimize biases present in the initial dataset.

* **Reweighing:** Assigning different weights to data points based on their class distribution can help mitigate bias.
