Answer:::
The text provides information about the following metrics used to evaluate the deep learning model:

* **Precision:**  Defined as the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positive observations.
* **Recall:**  Defined as the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total actual positive observations.
* **F-measure:**  A harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of the model's performance.
* **IoU (Intersection over Union):** Used to compare the predicted bounding box with the ground truth bounding box. A threshold of 0.3 is used to determine correct or incorrect detection results.
