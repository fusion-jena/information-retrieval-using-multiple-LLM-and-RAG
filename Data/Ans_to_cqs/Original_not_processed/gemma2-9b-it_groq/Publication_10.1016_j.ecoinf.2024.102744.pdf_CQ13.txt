Answer:::
The provided text does not specify the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning models.  It focuses on describing the model architectures and comparing their performance on the pollen-bearing bee detection task. 

To find the specific hyperparameters (like learning rate, optimizer), you would need to consult the full research paper or code repository associated with this work.
