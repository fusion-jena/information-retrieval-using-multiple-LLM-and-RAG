Answer:::

The provided text focuses on using deep learning for fractional vegetation coverage (FVC) mapping and doesn't delve into the specifics of handling randomness within the deep learning pipeline. 

However,  it's common practice in deep learning to address randomness through techniques like:

* **Setting a random seed:**  Initializing the random number generator with a specific seed ensures that the same "random" values are generated each time you run your code. This is crucial for reproducibility.

* **Data augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of your training data by applying random transformations (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) to existing images. This helps the model generalize better and reduces the impact of random variations in the data.

* **Dropout:**  Randomly "dropping out" (ignoring) a percentage of neurons during each training step. This prevents the model from relying too heavily on any single neuron and encourages the learning of more robust features.

* **Batch normalization:**  Normalizing the activations of neurons within each mini-batch during training. This helps stabilize the learning process and reduce the impact of internal covariate shift.
