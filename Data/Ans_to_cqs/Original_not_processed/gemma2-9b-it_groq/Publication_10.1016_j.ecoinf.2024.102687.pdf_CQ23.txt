Answer: 

The provided text focuses on the fine-tuning process of a pretrained CNN backbone and doesn't mention specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. 

It does highlight that the pretrained DenseNet performed well on the Darksound dataset but cautions that this doesn't guarantee similar performance on other datasets. 

The text suggests using features extracted from models trained on bird sound-specific datasets could improve the model's generalizability. However, it doesn't describe any techniques like diverse dataset creation, cross-validation, or stratified splitting used during the training process.
