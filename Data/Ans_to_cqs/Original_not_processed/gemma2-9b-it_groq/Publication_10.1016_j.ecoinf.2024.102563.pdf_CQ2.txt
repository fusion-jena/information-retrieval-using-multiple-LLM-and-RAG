Answer:::
Based on the provided text, the deep learning pipeline uses **image** data. 

The text mentions studies using remote sensing imagery (e.g., GF-1, Sentinel-1/2 SAR and MSI) for tasks like land type and tree species identification, crop classification, and soybean identification.  These are all applications that rely on image data as input for deep learning models.
