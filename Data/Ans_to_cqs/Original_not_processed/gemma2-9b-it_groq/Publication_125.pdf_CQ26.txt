Answer: The provided text focuses on the architecture of CNN models and data augmentation techniques used to increase training data. It doesn't discuss methods for addressing data bias during preprocessing. 

To answer your query about techniques to address data bias, here are some common methods:

* **Stratified Splitting:**  Dividing the data into training, validation, and test sets while preserving the proportion of different classes. This helps ensure that each subset reflects the distribution of the original data.

* **Oversampling:**  Increasing the number of instances in underrepresented classes. Techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) create synthetic samples to balance the dataset.

* **Undersampling:**  Reducing the number of instances in overrepresented classes. This can help prevent the model from being overly influenced by the majority class.

* **Diverse Data Collection:**  Actively seeking out and including data from a wide range of sources and perspectives to minimize biases introduced by a limited or homogenous dataset.
