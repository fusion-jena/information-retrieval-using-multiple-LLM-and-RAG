Answer:::
The provided text does not describe a specific strategy for monitoring model performance during training. 

It does mention the use of accuracy and F1-score as metrics to evaluate the performance of the trained models. Additionally, it discusses the use of an ensemble of models to improve performance and shows confusion matrices for the ensemble model and EfficientNetB3 to visualize classification errors. 


However, it doesn't detail how these metrics were tracked during the training process itself.
