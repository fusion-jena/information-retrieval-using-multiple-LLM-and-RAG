Answer:::
The provided text states that the evaluation of model performance was based on the accuracy metric.  It also mentions training accuracy and validation accuracy being plotted in figures. 

Therefore, the strategy implemented to monitor model performance during training was likely to:

1. **Track training accuracy:** This measures how well the model performs on the data it has already seen during training.
2. **Track validation accuracy:** This measures how well the model generalizes to unseen data, held out from the training set. 

By comparing training and validation accuracy, the researchers could identify if the model was overfitting (performing well on training data but poorly on validation data) or underfitting (performing poorly on both training and validation data).
