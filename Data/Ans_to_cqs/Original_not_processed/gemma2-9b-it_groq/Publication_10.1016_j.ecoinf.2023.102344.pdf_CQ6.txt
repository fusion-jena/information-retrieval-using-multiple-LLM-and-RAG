Answer:::
The provided text focuses on different network architectures and their applications in image classification, particularly for bivalve identification. It doesn't delve into the specific preprocessing steps involved in training deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps generally include:

* **Normalization:** Scaling pixel values to a specific range (e.g., 0 to 1) to improve model training stability.
* **Scaling:**  Adjusting the range of features to have zero mean and unit variance, which can help algorithms converge faster.
* **Cleaning:** Removing noise, outliers, or irrelevant data from the dataset. This could involve techniques like removing blurry images, correcting pixel errors, or handling missing values. 

Remember that the specific preprocessing steps depend on the dataset and the chosen deep learning model.
