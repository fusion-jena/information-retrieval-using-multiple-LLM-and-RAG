Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the training process of multitask learning models for biological organism classification. It describes the model architecture, training methodology, and performance evaluation metrics (average precision, recall, and F1-score) but doesn't delve into specific post-processing steps. 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what post-processing steps are involved after model training.
