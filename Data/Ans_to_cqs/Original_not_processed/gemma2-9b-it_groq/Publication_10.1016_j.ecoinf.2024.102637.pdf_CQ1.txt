Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the design and performance of a lightweight deep learning model called SIAlex. It doesn't offer details about the methods used to collect the raw data for training this model. 

However, it does mention that the data used in the study comes from two Kaggle datasets:

*  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/llll00/urbansound8k 
*  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/llll00/birdsdata 

These datasets likely contain audio recordings of urban sounds and bird vocalizations, respectively.  It's common for publicly available datasets like these to be compiled from various sources, which could include:

* **Citizen science projects:** Individuals contribute recordings through platforms or apps.
* **Sensor networks:**  Audio sensors deployed in the field capture soundscapes.
* **Existing sound libraries:**  Researchers may use pre-recorded sounds from established collections. 


Without further information from the original research paper, it's impossible to say for sure which specific data collection methods were employed.
