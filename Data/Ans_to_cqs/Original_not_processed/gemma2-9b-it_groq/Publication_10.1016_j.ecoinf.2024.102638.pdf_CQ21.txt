Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the hyperparameter optimization process and model selection. It doesn't describe any post-processing steps performed after model training, such as:

* **Saliency maps:**  Visualizing feature importance.
* **Metrics calculation:**  Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.
* **Confusion matrix:**  Analyzing the performance of a classification model by showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what post-processing steps are involved.
