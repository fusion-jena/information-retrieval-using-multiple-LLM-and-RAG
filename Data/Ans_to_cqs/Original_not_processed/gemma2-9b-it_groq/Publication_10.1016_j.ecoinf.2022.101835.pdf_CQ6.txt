Answer:::

The provided text focuses on hyperparameter optimization for machine learning models (RF, ANN, and GBDT) and doesn't delve into the preprocessing steps involved in training deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values (imputation or removal), removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies.
* **Feature Scaling:**  Scaling numerical features to a similar range (e.g., standardization or normalization) to prevent features with larger magnitudes from dominating the learning process.
* **Encoding Categorical Features:** Converting categorical variables into numerical representations that the model can understand (e.g., one-hot encoding, label encoding).
* **Normalization:**  Scaling data to a specific range, often between 0 and 1, to improve model performance.
* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training data by applying transformations (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) to existing data points.

The specific preprocessing steps will depend on the nature of the data and the chosen deep learning model.
