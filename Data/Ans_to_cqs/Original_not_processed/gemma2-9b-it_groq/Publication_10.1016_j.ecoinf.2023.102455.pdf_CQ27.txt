Answer:::

The provided text focuses on describing the deep learning models used (CNN-BiGRU, RVFL, KELM, CNN-BiRNN) and their hyperparameters, but it doesn't mention the process of deploying the trained model. 

Therefore, based on the information given, I cannot answer what process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
