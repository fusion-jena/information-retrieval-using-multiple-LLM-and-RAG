Answer:::
The provided text does not specify the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer.  It only mentions the following:

* **GPU acceleration** was used for computations.
* **Pre-trained weights** from the 'imagenet' dataset were used for initialization.
* **Training epochs:** 10
* **Batch size:** 32
* **Class mode:** 'categorical' (one-hot encoding for multi-class classification) 


Therefore, I cannot answer your query about the specific hyperparameters used.
