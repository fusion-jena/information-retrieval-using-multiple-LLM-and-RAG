Answer:::
The provided text describes the use of deep learning models for both **segmentation** and **classification** of fish. 

* **Segmentation:**  The model identifies and outlines individual fish within an image. Figure 3 illustrates this by showing segmented fish.

* **Classification:** The model categorizes fish into different species.  The text mentions a ResNet50V2 model pre-trained on ImageNet and fine-tuned for fish species classification.
