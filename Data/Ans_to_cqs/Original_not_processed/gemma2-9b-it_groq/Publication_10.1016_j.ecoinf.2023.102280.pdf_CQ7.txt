Answer:::
The provided text does not specify the exact criteria used to split data for training, testing, and validation in deep learning models. 

It does mention that fine-tuning audio enhancement models often requires training data and that a subset of 100 training examples can achieve similar performance.  It also suggests data augmentation techniques like superimposing noise samples. 

However, it doesn't delve into the specific proportions or methods used to divide the dataset into the different sets.
