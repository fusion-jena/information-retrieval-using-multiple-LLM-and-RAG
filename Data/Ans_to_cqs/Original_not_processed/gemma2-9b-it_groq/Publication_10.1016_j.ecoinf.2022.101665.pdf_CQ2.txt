Answer:::
Based on the provided text, the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline include:

* **Image:** The text mentions "spatially exhaustive Earth observation imagery" being used as predictors. This strongly suggests the use of image data.
* **Climatic data:**  While the specific format isn't stated, climatic data is mentioned as a predictor, and common formats for this type of data include CSV, NetCDF, or GRIB.
* **Terrain variables:** Terrain variables derived from digital elevation models (DEMs) are also mentioned as predictors. DEMs are typically stored in raster format, which could be considered a type of image data. 


The text doesn't explicitly mention audio or video data formats.
