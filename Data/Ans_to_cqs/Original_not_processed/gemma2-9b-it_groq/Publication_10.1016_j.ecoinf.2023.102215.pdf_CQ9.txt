Answer:::
I do not have access to real-time information, including details about data repositories for specific research projects.  The provided text focuses on the U2-Net model and its applications, but it doesn't mention where the associated data is hosted. 

To find the data repository, I recommend:

* **Checking the references:** The provided citations might list the data source or repository.
* **Looking for supplementary materials:** Research papers often have supplementary materials online that include links to datasets.
* **Contacting the authors:** The authors of the paper would be the best source of information about their data.
