Answer:::
The provided text describes the process of training a species assemblage predictor using a deep neural network but doesn't specify the exact preprocessing steps applied to the data before training. 

It mentions using:

* **64 Ã— 64 2D tensors** sampled at a kilometer-scale resolution centered on each observation.
* **Predictors** including bioclimatic variables, pedological variables, human footprint rasters, terrestrial ecoregions, and longitude/latitude.

Based on common practices in deep learning, we can infer that some likely preprocessing steps include:

* **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing outliers.
* **Feature Scaling:** Normalizing or standardizing numerical features to have a similar range, which can improve model performance.
* **Encoding Categorical Features:** Converting categorical variables (like ecoregions) into numerical representations suitable for the model.

However, without explicit information from the text, we cannot confirm the precise preprocessing techniques used.
