Answer:::
The text describes the following criteria for splitting the data:

* **Training set:** 80% of the total number of tiles were used as the training set. This set is used to train the deep learning model.
* **Validation set:** 10% of the total number of tiles were randomly selected as the validation set. This set is used during training to fine-tune hyperparameters and select the best model.
* **Test set:** Another 10% of the total number of tiles were randomly selected as the test set. This set is used to evaluate the performance of the final model after training is complete. 


The splitting process aims to ensure that the model is trained on a large enough dataset (80%) while also having separate sets for validation (10%) and testing (10%) to accurately assess its performance.
