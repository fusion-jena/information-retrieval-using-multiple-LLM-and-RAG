Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the architecture and training process of an artificial neural network (ANN) and doesn't delve into specific preprocessing steps for deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.
* **Feature Scaling:**  Transforming features to have a similar scale. This can involve techniques like standardization (z-score normalization) or min-max scaling to prevent features with larger magnitudes from dominating the learning process.
* **Normalization:**  Scaling features to a specific range, often between 0 and 1. This can improve the convergence speed of training.
* **Encoding Categorical Features:** Converting categorical variables (e.g., text, labels) into numerical representations that the model can understand. Techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding are commonly used.
* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones to potentially improve model performance. This can involve domain expertise and creative transformations of the data. 


Keep in mind that the specific preprocessing steps will depend on the nature of the data and the chosen deep learning model.
