Answer:::
The provided text mentions that data augmentation was used in previous studies but doesn't specify the exact techniques applied. 

It states that data augmentation, particularly noise addition, was helpful in those studies where training data was mainly based on monodirectional recordings of single species. This suggests that noise addition was used to emulate the conditions of soundscape recordings. 

However, the text doesn't mention other common data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, or scaling.
