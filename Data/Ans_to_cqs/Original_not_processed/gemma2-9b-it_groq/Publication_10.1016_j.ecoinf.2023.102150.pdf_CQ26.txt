Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning in ecological image analysis and doesn't delve into specific data bias mitigation techniques used during preprocessing. 

However, based on general knowledge of deep learning practices, here are some common techniques used to address data bias:

* **Stratified Splitting:** This involves dividing the dataset into training, validation, and test sets while ensuring that the class distribution in each set reflects the overall distribution of the data. This helps prevent overrepresentation or underrepresentation of certain classes during training.

* **Oversampling:** This technique increases the number of instances in underrepresented classes by duplicating existing samples or generating synthetic samples.

* **Undersampling:** This involves reducing the number of instances in overrepresented classes to balance the dataset.

* **Diverse Data Collection:**  Actively seeking out and incorporating data from a wide range of sources and environments can help reduce bias introduced by limited or skewed data collection practices.


It's important to note that the specific techniques used will depend on the nature of the bias present in the dataset and the goals of the deep learning project.
