Answer:::
The provided text focuses on describing the architecture and improvements made to a deep learning model called UODN (presumably for Underwater Object Detection). 

Based on the context, the purpose of the deep learning model is **object detection**. 

The text mentions:

*  "object detection network"
*  "extract the feature information of objects from images"
*  "replace the SPPF module" (SPPF is likely related to object detection)
