Answer:::
The text states that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are highly effective for LULC classification.  It also mentions Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) as being able to learn and adapt to evolving LULC patterns. 

While the text highlights the effectiveness of both CNNs and RNNs, it doesn't specify which particular type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline.
