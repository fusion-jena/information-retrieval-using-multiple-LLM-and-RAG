Answer:::
The provided text describes an iterative modeling process inspired by the Bayesian workflow.  It outlines the selection of model types (less flexible: Bayesian logistic regression and MLE logistic regression; more flexible: Bayesian GAM and random forest) and the general cycle of inspecting model outputs, analyzing effects, and adjusting configurations or switching models based on observations. 

However, the specific strategies used to *monitor* model performance during training are not detailed in this excerpt.
