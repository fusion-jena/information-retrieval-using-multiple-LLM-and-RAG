Answer:::
The provided text focuses on using machine learning and deep learning models for oil palm yield prediction.  It doesn't specify the exact type of deep learning model used (e.g., Convolutional Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network) or its specific purpose beyond yield prediction. 

Therefore, based on the context, we can infer that the deep learning model is used for **regression**, a type of machine learning task that aims to predict a continuous numerical value (in this case, oil palm yield).
