Answer:::
The provided text describes the use of both bounding box annotation and instance segmentation for data annotation in the deep learning pipeline. 

Specifically, it states: "For standalone object detection, annotation typically focuses solely on the recognition and marking of bounding boxes. However, in the context of this research, our detection module has been seamlessly integrated with instance segmentation, necessitating the inclusion of mask annotations that precisely align with the segmented contours during the dataset preparation." 


This indicates that while bounding boxes are used for basic object detection, instance segmentation with accompanying masks is employed to provide more detailed information about the objects within the images.
