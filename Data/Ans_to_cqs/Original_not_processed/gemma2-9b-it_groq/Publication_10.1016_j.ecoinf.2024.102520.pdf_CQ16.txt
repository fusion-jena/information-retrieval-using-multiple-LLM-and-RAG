Answer::: 

The provided text focuses on soil and site parameters related to total soil nitrogen and phosphorus. It doesn't contain information about training completion criteria in machine learning. 

To answer your query about training completion criteria, here are some common ones:

* **Validation Loss Plateau:**  As a model trains, its performance on a validation set (separate from the training data) is monitored. Training is often considered complete when the validation loss stops decreasing significantly and plateaus.

* **Epoch Limit:** A predetermined number of training epochs (passes through the entire dataset) is set. Training stops after this limit is reached.

* **Early Stopping:**  This technique monitors validation performance and stops training if it doesn't improve for a specified number of epochs. This helps prevent overfitting.

* **Metric Threshold:** Training might stop when a desired performance metric (e.g., accuracy, F1-score) on the validation set reaches a predefined threshold.
