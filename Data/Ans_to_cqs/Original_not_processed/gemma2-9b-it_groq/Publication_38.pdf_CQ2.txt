Answer: The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for environmental sound classification and bat call detection.  

It mentions the use of spectrograms, which are visual representations of sound frequencies over time.  Therefore, the data format used in this deep learning pipeline is **audio**.
