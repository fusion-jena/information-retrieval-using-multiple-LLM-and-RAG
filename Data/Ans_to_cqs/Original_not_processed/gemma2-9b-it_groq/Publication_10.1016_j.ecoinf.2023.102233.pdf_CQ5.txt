Answer:::
The provided text describes the use of a training/validation dataset and a test dataset for training a CNN model to recognize SBTF calls. 

The training/validation dataset consisted of 6363 hours of audio from ten independent sites (five solar-powered bioacoustic recorders and five Audiomoth recorders). The test dataset comprised 2735 hours of audio from nine independent sites (four solar-powered bioacoustic recorders and five Audiomoth recorders) that were different from the training/validation dataset. 

The text does not specify the names of these datasets (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet).
