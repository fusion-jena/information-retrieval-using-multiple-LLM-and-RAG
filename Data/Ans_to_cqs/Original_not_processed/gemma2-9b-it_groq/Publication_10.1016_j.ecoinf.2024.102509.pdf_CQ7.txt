Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for prediction tasks and doesn't delve into the specific criteria used for splitting data in deep learning. 

However,  general practices in deep learning commonly involve the following data splits:

* **Training Set:** This is the largest portion of the data used to train the deep learning model. The model learns patterns and relationships within this data.

* **Validation Set:** A separate subset of data used during training to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. It helps in tuning hyperparameters and preventing overfitting (where the model performs well on training data but poorly on new data).

* **Test Set:** Held out entirely from the training process. This set is used only once at the end to provide an unbiased evaluation of the final model's performance.

The typical split ratios are:

* 70-80% for training
* 10-15% for validation
* 10-15% for testing

The exact split ratios can vary depending on the size and nature of the dataset.
