Answer:::
The provided text describes the study's methodology for training and evaluating forest AGB models but doesn't specify the criteria used to determine when training is complete.  

It mentions:

* **Training-and-test approach with stratification splitting:**  The data was divided into training and test sets for model training and evaluation.
* **100 different splits:**  Multiple random splits were used to ensure robust evaluation.
* **Hyperparameter tuning:**  The optimal hyperparameter settings were found for each split.
* **Model training:**  Models were trained using the optimal hyperparameters.
* **Evaluation metrics:**  Various metrics like R2, RMSE, and accuracy were used to assess model performance.


The text focuses on the data preparation, model selection, and evaluation process but doesn't delve into the specific training procedure or stopping criteria.
