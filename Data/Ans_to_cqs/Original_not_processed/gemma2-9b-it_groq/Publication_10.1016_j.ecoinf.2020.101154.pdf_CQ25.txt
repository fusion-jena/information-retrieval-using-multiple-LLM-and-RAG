Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the hyperparameter tuning and model training process for a Gradient Boosting Regression Tree (GBRT) model.  

It doesn't explicitly state the specific purpose of the model, but it does mention:

* **Identifying potential drivers of changes in growth across two herring populations.**
* **Using a learning algorithm to find patterns in the data.**

Based on this information, we can infer that the deep learning model is likely used for **regression**, aiming to predict changes in growth based on the explanatory variables.
