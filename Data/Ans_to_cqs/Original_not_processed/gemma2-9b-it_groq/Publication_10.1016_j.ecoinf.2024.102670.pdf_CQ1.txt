Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning in image analysis, particularly in the context of biological imaging.  It mentions crowd-sourcing for manual annotation of karyotyping images as a method for obtaining ground truth data. 

However, the text doesn't discuss the broader range of data collection methods used in deep learning pipelines. 

To answer your query more comprehensively, here are some common data collection methods used in deep learning:

* **Surveys:** Used for collecting structured data from individuals, often through online questionnaires.
* **Sensors:**  Gather real-time data from physical environments, such as temperature, pressure, or motion.
* **Public Datasets:**  Collections of data made available by organizations or researchers for use by the general public. These can cover a wide range of domains, including images, text, audio, and numerical data.
* **Web Scraping:**  Automatically extracting data from websites.
* **APIs:**  Application Programming Interfaces allow developers to access and retrieve data from software applications and services.
