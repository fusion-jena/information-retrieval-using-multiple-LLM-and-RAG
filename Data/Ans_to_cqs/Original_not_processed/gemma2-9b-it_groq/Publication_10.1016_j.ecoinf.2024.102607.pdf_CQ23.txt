Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the impact of tile size on the accuracy of the SSA-TPRF model and describes different experimental groups with varying classification approaches and tile sizes. 

It does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as:

* **Diverse dataset:**  Whether the dataset used to train the model was diverse in terms of the features it covered.
* **Cross-validation:**  Techniques like k-fold cross-validation used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
* **Stratified splitting:**  Methods used to ensure that the training and testing sets have a similar distribution of classes, especially if dealing with imbalanced datasets. 


Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot determine what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
