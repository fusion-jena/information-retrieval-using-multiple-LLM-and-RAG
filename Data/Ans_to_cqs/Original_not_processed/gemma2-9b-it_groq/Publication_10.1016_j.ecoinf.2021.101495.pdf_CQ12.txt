Answer:::
The provided text states that a **residual neural network (ResNet)** is used for fish classification.  

More specifically, the implementation is ResNet50V2 from TensorFlow and is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. 


ResNet is a type of **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** known for its ability to learn deeper networks effectively by using skip connections.
