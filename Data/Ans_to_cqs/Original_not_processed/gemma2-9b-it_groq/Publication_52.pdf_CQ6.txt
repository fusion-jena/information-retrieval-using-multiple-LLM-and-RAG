The provided text focuses on Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) and their applications in Big Data analysis. It doesn't offer information about preprocessing steps for deep learning models.  

To answer your question about preprocessing steps for deep learning models, here are some common ones:

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a similar range (e.g., 0 to 1) can improve model performance.
* **Scaling:**  Similar to normalization, scaling adjusts the range of features.
* **Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.
* **Encoding:** Categorical features often need to be converted into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding). 
* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones can sometimes enhance model accuracy. 


Let me know if you have any other questions about ELMs or Big Data analysis.
