Based on the provided text, the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**. 

The text mentions:

* **"a CNN pre-trained on ImageNet"**: This directly states the use of a CNN.
* **"CNNs work by creating feature maps across multiple layers"**: This further confirms the use of a CNN architecture.
* **"Deep learning with CNNs has become the dominant approach for mostly any computer vision task requiring object detection/recognition"**: This highlights the prevalence of CNNs in computer vision tasks.
