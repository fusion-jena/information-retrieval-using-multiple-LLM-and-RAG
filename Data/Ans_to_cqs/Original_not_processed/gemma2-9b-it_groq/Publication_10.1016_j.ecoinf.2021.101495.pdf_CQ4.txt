Answer:::
The text describes the following data augmentation techniques:

* **Rotation:**  Each fish image is rotated by 90 degrees in both clockwise and counter-clockwise directions. This creates four variations of each image, ensuring the model sees the fish in different orientations.
* **Brightness and Contrast Adjustment:**  A random change in brightness and contrast is applied to each of the rotated images.  The brightness is altered by adding a random integer value between 4 and 4 to each pixel. The contrast is adjusted by multiplying each pixel by a random value between 0.9 and 1.1.
