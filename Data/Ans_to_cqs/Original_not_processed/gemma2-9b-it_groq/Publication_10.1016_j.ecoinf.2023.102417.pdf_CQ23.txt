Answer:::
The provided text doesn't specify the exact measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. 

It does mention the challenge of  "insufficient transferability of deep learning models between datasets obtained with different camera sensors" and the related field of "domain adaptation" aimed at improving model transferability. 

However, it doesn't detail the specific strategies employed in this study to address these challenges, such as:

* **Diverse dataset:**  Whether the training dataset included images captured with various camera types, lighting conditions, and acquisition geometries.
* **Cross-validation:**  If techniques like k-fold cross-validation were used to evaluate the model's performance on different subsets of the data.
* **Stratified splitting:** Whether the dataset was split into training and testing sets in a way that proportionally represents the distribution of classes (e.g., biocrust and non-biocrust pixels). 


To know the specific measures taken for generalizability, you would need to refer to the full study.
