The provided text does not specify the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete. 

It does mention that model parameters are updated after each batch during training and that the training process involves passing the full image dataset through the model multiple times (epochs). 

However, it doesn't describe specific metrics or thresholds used to signal the completion of training, such as validation loss plateauing.
