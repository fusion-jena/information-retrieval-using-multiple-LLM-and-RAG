Answer:::
The provided text mentions the use of random frame selection for training and testing data. It states: "The frame selection process was carried out using a Python script which randomly selected the frames using a uniform distribution." 

However, the text does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in other aspects of the deep learning pipeline, such as:

* **Random seed value:**  Setting a random seed ensures reproducibility of results by initializing random number generators in a deterministic way. 
* **Data augmentation:** Techniques like random cropping, flipping, or rotation are often used to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset, introducing randomness.
* **Weight initialization:**  Different methods for initializing the weights of the neural network can introduce randomness.

Therefore, based on the given information, we can only confirm the use of random frame selection and cannot comment on other randomness handling strategies employed in the pipeline.
