Answer:::
The provided text describes the use of species observation data from GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) and environmental data (ET, WS, C, T, and P) as input for a deep learning model. 

It doesn't specify the exact data formats used. However, given that GBIF provides occurrence records with associated geographic coordinates and other metadata, it's likely that the species observation data is stored in a structured format like CSV or a similar tabular format. 

The environmental data (ET, WS, C, T, and P) could also be in a tabular format, representing values for each year and location. 


Without further information, it's impossible to definitively say what specific data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline.
