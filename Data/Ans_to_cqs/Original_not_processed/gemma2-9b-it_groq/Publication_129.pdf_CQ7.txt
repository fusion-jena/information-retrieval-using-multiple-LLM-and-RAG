The provided text focuses on the Faster R-CNN model for object detection and doesn't mention the criteria used to split data for training, testing, and validation.  

To answer your question generally:

Data for deep learning models is typically split into three sets:

* **Training set:** This is the largest portion of the data used to train the model. The model learns patterns and relationships within this data.
* **Validation set:** This set is used to evaluate the model's performance during training. It helps determine if the model is overfitting (performing well on training data but poorly on unseen data) and allows for adjustments to the training process.
* **Test set:** This set is held out entirely from the training process and is only used to evaluate the final model's performance on unseen data. It provides an unbiased estimate of how well the model will generalize to new examples.

Common splitting ratios are 70/15/15 (training/validation/test) or 80/10/10. The specific split depends on the size of the dataset and the complexity of the problem.
