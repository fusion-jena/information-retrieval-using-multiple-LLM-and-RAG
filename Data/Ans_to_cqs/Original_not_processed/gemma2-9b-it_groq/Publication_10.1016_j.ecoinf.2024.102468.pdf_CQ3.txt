Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the training and evaluation of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for blue whale vocalization detection. It doesn't describe the specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. 

The text mentions "manual detections" of "Bm-Ant-A calls" and "Bm-Ant-Z calls" within an annotated library. This suggests some form of manual labeling, but it doesn't specify if it's bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, or another technique.
