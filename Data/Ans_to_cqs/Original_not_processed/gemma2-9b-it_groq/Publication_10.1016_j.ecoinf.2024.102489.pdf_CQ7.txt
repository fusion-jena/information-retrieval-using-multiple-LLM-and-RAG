Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the Random Forest (RF) model and doesn't offer information about the specific criteria used for splitting data in deep learning models. 

Generally, in deep learning, data is split into three sets:

* **Training set:** Used to train the model. This is the largest portion of the data.
* **Validation set:** Used to evaluate the model's performance during training and to tune hyperparameters.
* **Test set:** Used to assess the final performance of the trained model on unseen data.

The exact proportions of these sets can vary, but a common split is 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. 

The choice of splitting criteria often depends on the specific dataset and the goals of the project.
