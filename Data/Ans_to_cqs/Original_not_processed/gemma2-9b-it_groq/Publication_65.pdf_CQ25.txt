Answer:::
The deep learning models described in this text are used for **semantic segmentation**. 

The text states: "deep learning-based approaches designed to tackle this task receive, as input, an image and return as output, another image, generally with the exact size of the input data with each pixel associated with one class." This definition aligns with semantic segmentation, where the goal is to classify each pixel in an image into a specific category.
