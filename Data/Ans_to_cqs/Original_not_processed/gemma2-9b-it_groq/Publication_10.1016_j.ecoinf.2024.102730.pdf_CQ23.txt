The text states that the data was divided into a training set (80%) and a test set (20%) prior to conducting the grid search. This split ensures that the models are trained on one portion of the data and tested on a separate, previously unseen portion, allowing for the assessment of their ability to generalize to new, unseen data accurately. 


The text does not mention the use of diverse datasets or cross-validation.
