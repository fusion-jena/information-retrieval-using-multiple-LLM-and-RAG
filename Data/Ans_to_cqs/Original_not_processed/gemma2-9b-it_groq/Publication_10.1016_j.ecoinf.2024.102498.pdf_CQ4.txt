Answer:::
The provided text does not specify the exact data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.  While it mentions that deep learning techniques are effective for LULC classification and that CNNs are particularly good at recognizing intricate patterns, it doesn't delve into the specific preprocessing steps applied to the satellite imagery. 


Therefore, I cannot answer what data augmentation techniques (like flipping, rotating, or scaling) are used.
