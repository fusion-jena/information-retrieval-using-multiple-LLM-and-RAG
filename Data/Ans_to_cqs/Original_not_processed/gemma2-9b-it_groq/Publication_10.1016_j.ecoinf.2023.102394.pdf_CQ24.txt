Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning in ecological informatics and doesn't delve into the specific strategies used to manage randomness within the deep learning pipeline. 

However, it's common knowledge in the field of deep learning that randomness is inherent in several stages, including:

* **Initialization of Weights:** Deep learning models have numerous parameters (weights) that are initially assigned random values. This randomness helps the model explore different solutions during training.

* **Activation Functions:** Some activation functions, like dropout, introduce randomness during training to prevent overfitting.

* **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):** This popular optimization algorithm uses random mini-batches of data to update model weights, introducing an element of randomness in the learning process.

To mitigate the potential issues caused by this randomness, practitioners often employ techniques like:

* **Setting a Random Seed:**  Specifying a fixed random seed ensures that the random number generator produces the same sequence of random numbers each time the code is run. This allows for reproducibility of results.

* **Weight Initialization Techniques:**  Specific methods like Xavier or He initialization aim to initialize weights in a way that promotes faster and more stable training.

* **Regularization Techniques:** Techniques like dropout and weight decay help prevent overfitting by introducing noise and penalizing complex models.



Keep in mind that a certain degree of randomness is often beneficial in deep learning, as it helps the model generalize better to unseen data.
