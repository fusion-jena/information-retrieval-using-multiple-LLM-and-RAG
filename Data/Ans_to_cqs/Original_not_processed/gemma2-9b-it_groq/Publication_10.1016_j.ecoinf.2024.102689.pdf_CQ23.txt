Answer:::
The text states that the dataset was partitioned into ten equal sections, known as folds, for conducting rigorous folded cross-validation. This method involves training the model on nine folds and testing it on the remaining fold, repeating this process with each fold serving as the test set once.  

This cyclical training and testing process helps ensure the model's generalizability by exposing it to different subsets of the data and preventing overfitting to a specific training set.
