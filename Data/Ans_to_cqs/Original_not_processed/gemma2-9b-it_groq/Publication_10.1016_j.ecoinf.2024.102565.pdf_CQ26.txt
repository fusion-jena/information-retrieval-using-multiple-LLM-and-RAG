Answer:::
The provided text describes the use of stratified sampling and random under-sampling (RUS) to address data imbalance, not necessarily data bias in general. 

Here's a breakdown:

* **Stratified Sampling:** This technique ensures that the representation of different classes in the dataset is maintained in both the training and validation sets. This helps prevent scenarios where one class dominates the training data, leading to biased model performance.

* **Random Under-sampling (RUS):** This method reduces the number of samples from the majority class to balance the dataset. While it can help mitigate class imbalance, it might inadvertently discard valuable information from the majority class.

The text doesn't mention other techniques for addressing data bias, such as:

* **Oversampling:** Increasing the number of samples from the minority class.
* **Diverse Data Collection:**  Actively seeking out data from a wider range of sources and demographics to represent the real-world distribution more accurately.
