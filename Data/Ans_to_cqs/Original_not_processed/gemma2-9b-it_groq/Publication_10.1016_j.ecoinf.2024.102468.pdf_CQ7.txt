Answer:::
The provided text focuses on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and doesn't offer information about data splitting criteria for deep learning models. 

Generally, for deep learning, data is split into three sets:

* **Training set:** Used to train the model, allowing it to learn patterns and relationships in the data.
* **Validation set:** Used to evaluate the model's performance during training and fine-tune hyperparameters.
* **Test set:** Used for a final evaluation of the trained model's performance on unseen data, providing an estimate of how well it will generalize to new examples.

The specific proportions for each set can vary, but a common split is 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing.
