Answer:::
The provided text states that the input to the deep learning model is a "single channel mel spectrogram of size 64 Ã— 384".  Mel spectrograms are a visual representation of audio data. 

Therefore, the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are:

* **Audio:** The original data is audio recordings.
* **Mel Spectrogram:**  The audio is converted into a mel spectrogram, which is a 2D image-like representation.
