Answer:::

The provided text focuses on ecological informatics and statistical methods for modeling, particularly shrinkage estimation and variable selection. It doesn't contain information about data splitting criteria for deep learning models. 

To answer your query about data splitting for deep learning, here's a common approach:

* **Training Set:** This is the largest portion of the data (typically 70-80%) used to train the deep learning model. The model learns patterns and relationships within this data.
* **Validation Set:** A smaller portion of the data (around 10-15%) used to evaluate the model's performance during training. It helps in tuning hyperparameters (settings that control the learning process) and preventing overfitting (when the model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data).
* **Test Set:**  A separate, held-out portion of the data (around 10-15%) used only once at the end of the training process to provide an unbiased estimate of the model's performance on unseen data. 

The goal is to split the data in a way that ensures the training set is representative of the overall data distribution, while the validation and test sets remain independent for accurate performance evaluation.
