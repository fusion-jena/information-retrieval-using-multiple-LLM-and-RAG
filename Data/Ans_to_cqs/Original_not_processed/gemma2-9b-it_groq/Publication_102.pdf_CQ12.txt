Answer: The text primarily discusses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). 

Several CNN architectures are mentioned, including:

* **UNet:** Used for its encoder-decoder structure to handle image segmentation.
* **VGG16:**  The basis for Model-K, with its feature extractor removed.
* **ResNeXt:**  Combined with CCNN in one of the referenced studies.
* **EfficientNet:**  Used as a feature extractor in Model-2, known for its accuracy and efficiency.
* **Inception:**  The type of module used in the Count-ception network.
