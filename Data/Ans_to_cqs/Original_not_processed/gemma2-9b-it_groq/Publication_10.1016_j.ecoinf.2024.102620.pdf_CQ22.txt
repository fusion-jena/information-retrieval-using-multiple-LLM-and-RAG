Answer:::
The provided text focuses on evaluating the performance of the PLUS model, which is a land use change prediction model, not a deep learning model.  It mentions metrics like Pearson correlation coefficient (R), RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), and MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) for assessing the accuracy of the PLUS model's predictions. 

The text does not discuss deep learning models or the metrics typically used to evaluate their performance (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).
