Answer:::
Based on the provided text, the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is **images**. 

The text repeatedly mentions camera trap images and the use of computer vision models to process and analyze them.  It also discusses the need for well-labeled image sets to verify the accuracy of these models. 


While the text doesn't explicitly mention other data formats like audio or video, it's possible they could be involved in a broader context given the discussion of AI and machine learning applications.
