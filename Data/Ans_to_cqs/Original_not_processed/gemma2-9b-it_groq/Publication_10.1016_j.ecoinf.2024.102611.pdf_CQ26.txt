Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the hierarchical classification model and the Random Forest classifier used, but it doesn't explicitly mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. 

While the text states that "consistent ratios across groups are maintained in the sampling process to avoid any potential bias during classification," it doesn't detail the exact methods employed to achieve this balance. 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot definitively say what specific bias mitigation techniques are used in the deep learning pipeline.
