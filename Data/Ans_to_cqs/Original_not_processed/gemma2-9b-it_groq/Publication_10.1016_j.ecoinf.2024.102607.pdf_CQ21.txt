Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the challenges of unbalanced training data in Land Use Land Cover (LULC) classification and the proposed solutions using tile models and probabilistic classification methods.  

It doesn't delve into the post-processing steps involved after model training, such as:

* **Saliency maps:**  These highlight the regions of an input image that are most influential in the model's decision.
* **Metrics calculation:**  Various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC are used to evaluate the model's performance.
* **Confusion matrix:** This visualizes the performance by showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer your query about post-processing steps.
