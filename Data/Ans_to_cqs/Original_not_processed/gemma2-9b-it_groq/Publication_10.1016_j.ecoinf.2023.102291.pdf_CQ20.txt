Answer:::
The text states that the CNNs were implemented using TensorFlow and Python 3 on Microsoft Azure using instance NV12s v3 with 12 vCPUs and 112 GB RAM.  

Since the instance type is NV12s v3, it is likely that the training used GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) as these are commonly used for deep learning tasks due to their parallel processing capabilities.
