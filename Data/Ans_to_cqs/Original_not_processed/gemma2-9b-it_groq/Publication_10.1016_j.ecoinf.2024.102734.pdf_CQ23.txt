Answer:::

The provided text describes the dataset used to train and evaluate the deep learning models but doesn't explicitly mention specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model beyond the dataset used. 

Here's what we can infer:

* **Dataset Diversity:** The text states the dataset includes 1130 possum vocalizations and 1870 noise samples, suggesting an attempt at diversity in the data.
* **Manual Review:**  Each segment was manually reviewed by a human, which could help ensure the quality and accuracy of the data.
* **Test Set:** A separate test set (500 segments) was created, which is a standard practice to evaluate model performance on unseen data.

However, the text doesn't mention:

* **Cross-validation:**  A technique to train and evaluate models on different subsets of the data, which helps assess model robustness.
* **Stratified splitting:** A method to ensure class distribution is maintained in the training and test sets, important for imbalanced datasets.


Therefore, while some steps were taken to curate the dataset, the text doesn't provide information about specific generalizability measures like cross-validation or stratified splitting.
