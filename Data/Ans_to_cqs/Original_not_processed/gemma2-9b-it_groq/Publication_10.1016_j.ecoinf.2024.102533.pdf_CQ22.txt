Answer: 

The provided text focuses on evaluating the performance of a K-Means clustering algorithm, not a deep learning model.  Therefore, it doesn't mention metrics typically used for deep learning models like accuracy, precision, or recall. 

The text does describe the use of these metrics for evaluating K-Means:

* **Distortion:**  Calculates the sum of squared distances of data points to their nearest cluster center. Lower distortion indicates better cluster cohesiveness.
* **Silhouette:**  Measures how similar a data point is to other points in its cluster compared to points in other clusters. 
* **Calinski-Harabasz:**  Determines the ratio of dispersion between clusters to dispersion within clusters.
