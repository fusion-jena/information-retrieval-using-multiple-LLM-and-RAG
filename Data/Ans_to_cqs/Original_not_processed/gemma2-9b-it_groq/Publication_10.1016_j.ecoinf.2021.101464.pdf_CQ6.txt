Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the application of random forest models and doesn't delve into the preprocessing steps specific to deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values (imputation or removal), removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies.
* **Feature Scaling:**  Transforming features to a similar scale (e.g., standardization, normalization) to prevent features with larger magnitudes from dominating the learning process.
* **Encoding Categorical Features:** Converting categorical variables into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding, label encoding) that deep learning models can understand.
* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a specific range, often between 0 and 1, to improve model stability and convergence.
* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training data by applying transformations (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) to existing data points.
