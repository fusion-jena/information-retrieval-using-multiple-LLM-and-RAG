Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the challenges of manual seabed image annotation and the development of automated analysis tools using deep learning.  

It doesn't, however, specify the exact data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for this specific application. 

Therefore, I cannot answer your question about the data annotation techniques used (e.g., bounding box annotation, instance segmentation) based on the given context.
