Answer:::
The provided text describes the training process but doesn't specify the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete.  

It mentions using a validation set to evaluate the model's performance and tune hyperparameters like the number of hidden units and regularization. It also talks about iteratively retraining the model and swapping misclassified training and validation data to improve accuracy. 

However, it doesn't explicitly state whether training stops when validation loss plateaus, reaches a minimum, or based on a predefined number of epochs.
