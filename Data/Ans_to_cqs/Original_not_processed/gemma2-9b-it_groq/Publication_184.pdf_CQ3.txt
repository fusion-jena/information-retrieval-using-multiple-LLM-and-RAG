Answer:::
The text states that the model was trained using bounding box data.  

It says: "In order to train the model, it is important to provide not only the class of the object but also the bounding box data of the object as the correct answer. In this context, we parsed the x, y coordinates, width and height of the fish in the annotation of the imageâ€™s dataset." 


Therefore, the data annotation technique used is **bounding box annotation**.
