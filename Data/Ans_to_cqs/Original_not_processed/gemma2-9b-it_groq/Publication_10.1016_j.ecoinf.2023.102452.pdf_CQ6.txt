Answer:::

The provided text focuses on specific deep learning applications and model comparisons, and doesn't delve into the specifics of preprocessing steps for deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values (imputation or removal), identifying and removing outliers, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1) can improve model performance.

* **Feature Scaling:** Techniques like standardization (subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation) can help features with different scales contribute equally to the model.
* **Encoding Categorical Variables:**  Converting categorical data into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding) is necessary for most deep learning algorithms.

The specific preprocessing steps will depend on the nature of the data and the chosen deep learning model.
