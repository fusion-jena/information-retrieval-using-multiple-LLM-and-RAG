Answer:::
The provided text focuses on image classification techniques using remote sensing data and doesn't explicitly mention the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. 

However, based on the context, we can infer that **image data** is the primary format used.  

The text discusses:

* **Spectral bands:**  (green, red, red edge, NIR) which are components of an image.
* **Spectral indices:** (NDVI, vNDVI, NDRE) calculated from image data.
* **Texture indices:** Derived from image patterns.
* **Digital Surface Model (DSM):**  A type of image data representing the surface elevation.
* **UAS (Unmanned Aerial System):**  A platform commonly used for acquiring aerial images.


Therefore, it's highly likely that the deep learning pipeline involves image data in various formats, potentially including multispectral or hyperspectral images.
