Answer:::
The provided text describes the model's training process and evaluation metrics but doesn't explicitly state the strategy used to monitor performance *during* training.  

We know:

* **Loss and accuracy were tracked:** Figures S2 and S3 show this development.
* **Adversarial training:** The model was trained to minimize the loss of both the taxon prediction and dataset prediction classifiers.

However, the text doesn't detail how frequently these metrics were checked or if any other monitoring strategies were employed.
