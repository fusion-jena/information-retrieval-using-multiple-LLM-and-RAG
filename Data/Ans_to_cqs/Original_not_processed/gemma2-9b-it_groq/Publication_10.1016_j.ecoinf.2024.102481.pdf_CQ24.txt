Answer:::

The provided text focuses on using Random Forest machine learning for classifying fish maturity stages and doesn't delve into the specifics of randomness handling in deep learning pipelines. 

To answer your query about strategies for handling randomness in deep learning, here are some common techniques:

* **Setting a Random Seed:**  Deep learning models often involve random initialization of weights and stochastic optimization algorithms. Setting a random seed ensures that the same "random" numbers are generated each time you run the code, leading to reproducible results.

* **Data Augmentation:**  This involves introducing controlled variations into the training data (e.g., rotations, flips, color adjustments) to increase its size and diversity. This helps the model generalize better and reduces the impact of randomness in the data itself.

* **Dropout:**  A regularization technique where a percentage of neurons are randomly "dropped out" (ignored) during each training step. This prevents overfitting and introduces some randomness into the network's structure.

* **Batch Normalization:**  A technique that normalizes the activations of each layer during training. This helps stabilize the learning process and reduces the sensitivity to the initialization of weights.
