Answer:::
The provided text does not specify the exact criteria used to split the data into training, validation, and test sets. 

It mentions:

* A training set used to train the deep learning model.
* A validation set used to select the best model based on minimal validation loss.
* An independent test set of 2060 images used to evaluate the final model performance.


However, the text does not provide details on the proportions of the dataset allocated to each set or the specific methods used for splitting.
