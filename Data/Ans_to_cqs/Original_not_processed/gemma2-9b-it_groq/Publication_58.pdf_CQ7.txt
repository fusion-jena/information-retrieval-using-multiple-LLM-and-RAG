Answer:::
The data was split into three mutually exclusive sets:

* **Learning set:** Used to train the deep learning models.
* **Validation set:** Used to tune the hyperparameters of the models during training.
* **Test set:**  A completely independent set used to evaluate the final performance of the trained models. 

Four of the five study areas were used for the learning and validation sets, while the remaining isolated scene served as the test set.
