Answer:::
The provided text focuses on hyperparameter tuning and AutoML techniques, and doesn't delve into the specific preprocessing steps involved in training deep learning models. 

However, based on general knowledge of deep learning, here are some common preprocessing steps:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., between 0 and 1) can improve model performance.

* **Feature Scaling:** Techniques like standardization (subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation) can help features with different scales contribute equally to the learning process.

* **Encoding Categorical Features:** Converting categorical variables into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding) is often necessary for deep learning models.

* **Data Augmentation:**  For image data, techniques like rotation, flipping, and cropping can be used to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset. 


Keep in mind that the specific preprocessing steps will depend on the nature of the data and the chosen deep learning model.
