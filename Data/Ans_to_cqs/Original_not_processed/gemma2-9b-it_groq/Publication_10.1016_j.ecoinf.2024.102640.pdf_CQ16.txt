Answer:::
The provided text describes the architecture and training process of EPDNet, a neural network for estimating eye-phone distance. It mentions the use of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function and the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001.  

However, the text does not specify the criteria used to determine when training is complete. It only states that the model achieves an R2 of 0.95 after training, indicating a good fit to the observed data.
