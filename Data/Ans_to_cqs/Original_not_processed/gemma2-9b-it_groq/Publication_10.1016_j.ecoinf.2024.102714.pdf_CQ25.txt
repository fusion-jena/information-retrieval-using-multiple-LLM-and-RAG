Answer:::
The deep learning model is used for **classification**. 

The text states that the model was used to "classify the VTs" and that "data-driven algorithms can capture the spectral variations embedded within the EO-data reasonably well". This indicates that the model is designed to assign each pixel in the VHR images to a predefined category (the target vegetation types).
