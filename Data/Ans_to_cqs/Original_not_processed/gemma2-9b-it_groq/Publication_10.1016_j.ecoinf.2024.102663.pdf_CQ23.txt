Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the results of different preprocessing methods applied to a fish image dataset for biomass estimation using a YOLOv8 model.  

It does not offer details about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as:

* **Dataset diversity:**  Information about the diversity of the fish species, environments, and image conditions within the dataset is lacking.
* **Cross-validation:**  There's no mention of cross-validation techniques used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
* **Stratified splitting:**  The text doesn't describe whether the dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets using stratified sampling to maintain class proportions. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer how the researchers ensured the generalizability of the deep learning model.
