Answer:::
The provided text describes the following preprocessing steps:

* **Image Augmentation:** Rotations between 0 and 360 degrees, vertical reflections, and vertical shifts of +/- 5 pixels were applied to the training images. This helps increase the diversity of the training data and improve the model's robustness.
* **Image Normalization:** The 8-bit pixel values were mapped to floating-point values between 0 and 1. This is a common practice in deep learning to scale the pixel values and improve training stability.
* **Data Splitting:** The dataset was randomly split into training, validation, and test sets with proportions of 70%, 15%, and 15%, respectively. This allows for training, validation of model performance, and final evaluation of the trained model. 


The text does not mention other preprocessing steps like scaling, cleaning, or handling missing values.
