Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the model design, training process, and hyperparameter tuning for both classification and regression tasks.  

It doesn't explicitly detail the post-processing steps involved after model training, such as:

* **Saliency maps:**  These are used to visualize which input features are most influential in the model's prediction.
* **Metrics calculation:**  Various metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score for classification; MAE, RMSE for regression) are calculated to evaluate the model's performance.
* **Confusion matrix:** This is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification model by showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what specific post-processing steps were used.
