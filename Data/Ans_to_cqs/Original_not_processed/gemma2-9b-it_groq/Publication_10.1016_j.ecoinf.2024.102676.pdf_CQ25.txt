Answer:::
The provided text focuses on using deep learning models for footprint identification and doesn't explicitly state the specific purpose of the model mentioned in the context of classifying three sympatric otter species. 

However, based on the information given and common applications of deep learning in image analysis, it's highly likely that the model was used for **classification**. 

The text mentions that a model trained on images of all qualities (including imperfect ones) was only marginally outperformed by a model trained on high-quality prints. This suggests a classification task where the model aims to assign each footprint image to one of the three otter species.
