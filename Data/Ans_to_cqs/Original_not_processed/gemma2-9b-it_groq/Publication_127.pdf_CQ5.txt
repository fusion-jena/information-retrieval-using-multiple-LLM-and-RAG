Answer:::
The text mentions the use of two datasets:

* **ImageNet:** A large-scale dataset containing 1.3 million labeled images across 1,000 categories. It's commonly used in computer vision research, including transfer learning.

* **A simulated camera-trap dataset:** This dataset was created by the authors and used for further training after initial training on ImageNet. The text states that it was created from SS data and split into training and test sets. 


The specific details about the simulated camera-trap dataset (e.g., its size, the types of images it contains) are not provided in the given text.
