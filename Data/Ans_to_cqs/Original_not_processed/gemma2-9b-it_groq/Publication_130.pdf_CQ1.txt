The provided text focuses on using RFID tags and cameras to collect data on bird species for training deep learning models.  

Specifically, it mentions:

* **RFID tags:** These are attached to birds and can be read by RFID readers, automatically identifying individual birds.
* **Cameras:**  Cameras are used to take pictures of the birds, which are then labeled with the bird's identity based on the RFID data. 


The text doesn't discuss other methods for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline, such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets.
