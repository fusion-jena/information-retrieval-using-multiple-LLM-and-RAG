Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the application of LSTM models for land use prediction and doesn't specify the exact metrics used to evaluate the model's performance.  

While the text mentions that LSTM models have "better performance" compared to traditional machine learning models and Markov chain models, it doesn't delve into the specific metrics used to quantify this performance. 

Common metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models for prediction tasks include:

* **Accuracy:** The percentage of correct predictions.
* **Precision:** The proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions.
* **Recall:** The proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive cases.
* **F1-score:** A harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure.
* **Mean Squared Error (MSE):**  A measure of the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
* **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** The square root of MSE, providing an error measure in the same units as the target variable.


To determine the specific metrics used in this context, you would need to refer to the original research paper or source material cited in the text.
