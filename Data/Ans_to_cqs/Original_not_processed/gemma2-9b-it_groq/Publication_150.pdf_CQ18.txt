Answer:::
The provided text doesn't describe the specific strategy used to monitor model performance during training. It mentions using a training and test dataset split (80/20) and that the models were trained for 150 epochs.  It also states that the learning rate was reduced by a factor of 10 after 30 epochs. 

However, it doesn't detail how the performance was tracked (e.g., accuracy, loss function) or if any specific metrics were used to evaluate the model's progress during training.
