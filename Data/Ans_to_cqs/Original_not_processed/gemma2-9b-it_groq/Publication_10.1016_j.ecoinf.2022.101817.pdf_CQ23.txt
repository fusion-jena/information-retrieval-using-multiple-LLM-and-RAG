Answer:::
The provided text describes the development and validation of a CNN model for environmental condition classification.  It mentions the use of a confusion matrix during cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance. 

However, the text does not specify details about the dataset used for training and validation, such as its size, diversity, or whether stratified splitting was employed. 


Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively say what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
