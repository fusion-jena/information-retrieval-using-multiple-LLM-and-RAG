Answer:::

The provided text describes the model development process but doesn't explicitly mention specific techniques used to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as:

* **Diverse dataset:** While the text mentions different window sizes and DPI for image creation, it doesn't elaborate on the diversity of the dataset in terms of species, recording locations, or environmental conditions. 
* **Cross-validation:** The text doesn't describe the use of cross-validation techniques to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
* **Stratified splitting:**  There's no mention of stratified splitting of the dataset to maintain class proportions in the training and testing sets. 


Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot definitively say what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
