Answer:::

The provided text does not specify the exact measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. 

While it mentions the use of training and validation data for the U-Net model, it doesn't elaborate on techniques like:

* **Diverse dataset:**  Whether the dataset used to train the model encompassed a variety of land cover types and geographical regions within North Korea.
* **Cross-validation:**  If techniques like k-fold cross-validation were employed to evaluate the model's performance on different subsets of the data, thus reducing the risk of overfitting.
* **Stratified splitting:**  Whether the dataset was split into training and validation sets in a way that proportionally represented the different land cover classes.


Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot definitively say what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.
