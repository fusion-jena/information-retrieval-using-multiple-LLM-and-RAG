Answer:::
The provided text focuses on Support Vector Regression (SVR) and doesn't explicitly mention criteria for determining training completion. 

However, it does state that the regularization parameter C "controls error tolerance during training and determines the maximum deviation that the model permits for any individual training example."  

Generally, in machine learning, training is considered complete when one or more of the following criteria are met:

* **Validation Loss Plateau:**  The loss function on a validation set (separate from the training data) stops decreasing or decreases very slowly. This indicates the model might be overfitting, meaning it's learning the training data too well and not generalizing to new data.
* **Maximum Epochs:** A predetermined number of training iterations (epochs) is reached.
* **Early Stopping:**  Training is stopped if the validation loss starts to increase, suggesting overfitting.

The specific criteria used depend on the model, dataset, and the goals of the project.
