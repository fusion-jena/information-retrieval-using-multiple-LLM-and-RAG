Answer:::
The deep learning models described in the text are primarily used for **object detection** and **classification**. 

The researchers aim to identify and classify animals, humans, and vehicles within images captured by time-lapse cameras in the Arctic. They achieve this through a two-pronged approach:

1. **Region-specific models:** These models, built using the ResNet-50 architecture, are trained on data specific to each location (Finnmark and Yamal) to improve accuracy.

2. **MegaDetector:** This pre-trained, high-performance open-source model is used in conjunction with the region-specific models to enhance the overall detection and classification process.

The text highlights the use of object cropping and classification by object type (rock, bait, empty, and species) as part of the workflow. This indicates a focus on identifying and categorizing individual objects within the images.
