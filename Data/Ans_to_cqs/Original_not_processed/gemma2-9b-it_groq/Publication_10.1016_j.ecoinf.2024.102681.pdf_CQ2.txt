Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the methodology and technical details of a deep learning model for drought propagation analysis.  While it mentions using a dataset spanning from 1950 to 2020, it doesn't explicitly state the data formats used. 

We can infer some possibilities based on the context:

* **Time series data:** The text repeatedly discusses "drought propagation time series" and uses a sliding window method to process data over time. This strongly suggests that time series data is a core component.
* **Gridded data:** The text mentions Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) which are well-suited for processing gridded data like satellite imagery or climate model outputs. 

It's possible the dataset includes:

* **Climate data:**  Temperature, precipitation, soil moisture, etc., often come in gridded formats.
* **Remote sensing data:** Satellite imagery could provide information about vegetation health, which is relevant to drought analysis.

However, without further information from the source, we cannot definitively say what specific data formats are used.
