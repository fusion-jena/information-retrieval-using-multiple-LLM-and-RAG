Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the use of deep learning for camera trap image analysis in ecology and doesn't delve into specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. 

While it mentions tools like AIDE that facilitate image annotation and training of machine learning models, it doesn't explicitly describe the types of annotations employed (e.g., bounding box annotation, instance segmentation).
