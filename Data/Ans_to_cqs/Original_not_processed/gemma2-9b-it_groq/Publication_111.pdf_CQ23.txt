Answer: The text states that the training data was separated into training and validation groups to track the generalization performance of the deep learning model.  It also mentions the use of the early stopping strategy, which stops training when generalization performance starts to degrade. 

However, the text does not specify if a diverse dataset was used, or if cross-validation or stratified splitting techniques were employed.
