The text states that the CNN algorithm was trained on a dataset using "manual annotations of the moths".  It also mentions that these annotations "do not surround the moths as closely as the bounding boxes placed by the blob segmentation". 

Based on this information, we can infer that the primary data annotation technique used was **bounding box annotation**.
