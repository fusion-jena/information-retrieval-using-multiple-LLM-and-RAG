Answer:::

The provided text focuses on soil degradation research and doesn't delve into the specifics of data collection methods used in a deep learning pipeline for that particular task. 

However, it does mention the following data sources:

* **High-resolution remotely sensed imagery:** This suggests the use of satellite or aerial imagery as a primary data source.
* **Public datasets:** The text references the "High-resolution China Soil Information Grids" and the "World Soil Database" as potential sources of data.
* **Direct acquisition and reclassification:** This implies that some data might be collected directly through field surveys or other means and then classified using tools like ArcGIS.


Therefore, based on the information given, we can infer that the deep learning pipeline likely utilizes a combination of remotely sensed imagery, publicly available datasets, and potentially some direct data acquisition methods.
