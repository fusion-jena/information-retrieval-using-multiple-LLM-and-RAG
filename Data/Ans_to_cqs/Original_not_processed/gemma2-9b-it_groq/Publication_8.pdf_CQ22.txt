Answer:::
The text states that the performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the average precision metric (AP).  

It also mentions AP50, AP75, and AP, which are variations of the average precision calculated at different Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds. 

IoU is a metric used to measure the overlap between the predicted bounding boxes and the ground truth bounding boxes.
