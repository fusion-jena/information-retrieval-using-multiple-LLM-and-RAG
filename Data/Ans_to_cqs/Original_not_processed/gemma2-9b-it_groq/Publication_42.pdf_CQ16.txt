The provided text does not specify the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete.  It does mention that a validation F1-score of 96.6% was achieved using transfer learning on ResNetV50 with pretrained weights.  It also states that larger deep learning networks (ResNetV50 and InceptionNetV3) showed overfitting, suggesting that training was stopped before reaching optimal performance.
