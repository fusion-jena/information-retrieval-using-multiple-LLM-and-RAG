Answer:::
The provided text focuses on active learning strategies within a deep learning pipeline, particularly for audio classification using transfer learning models. It doesn't discuss data preprocessing techniques for addressing data bias. 

Therefore, I cannot answer your question about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing (e.g., stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, diverse data collection) based on the given context.
