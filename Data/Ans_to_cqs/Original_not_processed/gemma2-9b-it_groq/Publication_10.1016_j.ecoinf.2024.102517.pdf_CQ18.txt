Answer:::

The provided text describes the training process of a bird sound denoising model but doesn't explicitly state the strategy used to monitor its performance during training. 

We know the model is trained using a loss function: 

m=1

λm‖Φm(β) (cid:0) Φm(g(x; θ) ) ‖1,

(3)  

This loss function likely quantifies the difference between the clean bird sound signal (β) and the processed signal (g(x; θ)) generated by the noise reduction network. 

The text mentions that the weight λm is adjusted based on the backpropagation of this loss value. This suggests that the performance is monitored by tracking the changes in the loss function over training iterations. 


However, without further details, we cannot definitively say what specific metrics are used to evaluate the model's performance during training.
