Answer:::
The provided text describes the use of several deep learning models, including:

* **CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks):**  EfficientNet-B0, ResNet101, MobileNetV2, and InceptionV3 are all mentioned as CNNs used in Approach 1. 
* **RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks):**  LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit), and BiLSTM (Bidirectional LSTM) are all types of RNNs used in Approach 3 to build the BivalveNet model.

Therefore, the pipeline utilizes both CNNs and RNNs.
