Answer:::

The provided text mentions the use of the following data collection methods in the context of deep learning for tree and mangrove analysis:

* **UAV-mounted LiDAR sensor:** This is specifically mentioned in Yin and Wang (2019) and You et al. (2018) for collecting high-resolution LiDAR data of mangrove forests and coniferous forests, respectively. 
* **Airborne LiDAR:**  This is mentioned in several papers, including Marasigan et al. (2019), Yin and Wang (2019), and Windrim and Bryson (2020), indicating its use for collecting data on mangrove forests, individual trees, and forests in general.
* **Ground-based LiDAR:** Jin et al. (2018) used ground-based LiDAR data for segmenting individual plants in maize plots.
* **High spatial resolution imagery:** Xu et al. (2021) used this type of imagery for individual tree crown detection.

The text doesn't explicitly mention the use of surveys or public datasets.
