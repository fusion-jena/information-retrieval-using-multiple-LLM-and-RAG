Answer: The provided text states that the model was trained using a fine-tuned neural network. It also mentions using Google Cloud DataFlow to extract features in parallel.  

While it doesn't explicitly name the deep learning framework used (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch), it heavily implies the use of a framework capable of:

*  Fine-tuning pre-trained layers
*  Parallel feature extraction 

Given the context and the mention of Google Cloud DataFlow, TensorFlow is a strong possibility.
