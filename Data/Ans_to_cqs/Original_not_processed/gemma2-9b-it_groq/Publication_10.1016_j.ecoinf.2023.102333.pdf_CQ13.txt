Answer:::
The provided text mentions several hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, but it doesn't list a complete set including the optimizer. 

Here are the hyperparameters explicitly named:

* **Number of layers and nodes:** This refers to the architecture of the neural network, determining its depth and width.
* **Learning rate:**  A crucial parameter controlling how much the model's weights are adjusted during training.
* **Dropout rate:**  A regularization technique that randomly "drops out" neurons during training to prevent overfitting.

The text also states that a search grid of "several hyperparameters" was used, but it doesn't specify which ones besides those listed above.  The optimizer used is not mentioned in the provided context.
