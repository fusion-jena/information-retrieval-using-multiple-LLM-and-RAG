Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the model architecture and training process of a deep learning model for image classification, particularly using TensorFlow and transfer learning with the Inception v3 model.  

It doesn't delve into the specific preprocessing steps involved before training. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Normalization:** Scaling pixel values to a specific range (e.g., 0 to 1) to improve model stability and convergence.
* **Scaling:**  Adjusting the range of features to have zero mean and unit variance. This can help algorithms converge faster.
* **Data Cleaning:** Removing noise, outliers, or irrelevant data from the dataset.
* **Image Resizing:**  Converting images to a consistent size required by the model.
* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training dataset by applying transformations like rotations, flips, and crops.
