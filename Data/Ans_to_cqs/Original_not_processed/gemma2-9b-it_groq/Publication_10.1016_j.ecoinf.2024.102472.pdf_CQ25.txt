Answer:::
Based on the provided text, the deep learning model is used for **classification**. 

The text describes a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network used to estimate carbon stocks.  It mentions training the network on data and then using it for "feed-forward predictions on continuous spatial data." This suggests a classification task where the model categorizes or predicts the carbon stock levels based on the input spatial data.
