Answer:::
Based on the provided text, the specific purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated. 

However, we can infer some information:

* **Table 4 shows a "Classification table"**: This strongly suggests the model is used for **classification**. 
* **The table includes metrics like "Correct percentage" and "Overall percentage"**: These are common evaluation metrics for classification tasks.

Therefore, it's highly likely that the deep learning model is designed for **classification**,  but without further context, we cannot determine the specific classes it classifies.
