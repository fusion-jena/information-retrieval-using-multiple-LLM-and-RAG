Answer:::
The deep learning model described in the text is primarily used for **classification**. 

The text states that the model is employed to "accurately differentiate between healthy and unhealthy plant leaf images." This task clearly falls under the category of classification, where the model aims to assign each input image (plant leaf) to one of two predefined categories (healthy or unhealthy).
