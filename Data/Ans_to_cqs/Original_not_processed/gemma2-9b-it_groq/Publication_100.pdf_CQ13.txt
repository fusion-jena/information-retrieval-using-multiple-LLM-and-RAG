Answer:::
The deep learning model uses the Adam optimizer with the following hyperparameters:

*  𝛽1 = 0.9
*  𝛽2 = 0.999
*  𝜖 = 10−8

The base learning rate is 𝛼 = 10−4 and is automatically reduced by a factor of 0.1 when the validation loss doesn't improve for 15 consecutive epochs. 

Weight decay with a magnitude of 10−3, inversely proportional to the hyperparameter 𝜆 from Equation (1), is applied to control the strength of the unit Gaussian prior.
