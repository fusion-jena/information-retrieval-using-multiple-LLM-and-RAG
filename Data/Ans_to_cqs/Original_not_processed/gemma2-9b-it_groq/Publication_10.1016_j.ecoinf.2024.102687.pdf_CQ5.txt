Answer:::
The text mentions the use of the following datasets:

* **ImageNet:** A large dataset of 1000 object classes with over 1.2 million images, used for pre-training the CNN backbones (ResNet18, VGG16, DenseNet121, and AlexNet).

* **Darksound:** The primary dataset used for fine-tuning the pre-trained CNNs. 

The text also discusses the potential benefits of using bird sound spectrograms from datasets like **BirdNET** for initializing UML algorithms within the MEC method. However, it doesn't explicitly state if these spectrograms are used in the described deep learning pipeline.
