Answer:::
The provided text focuses on deep learning applications in remote sensing and mentions the use of "RS data".  It specifically discusses  "Sentinel-2 time series" which are likely in a geospatial raster format.  

While the text doesn't explicitly list all data formats used in the deep learning pipeline, it strongly suggests:

* **Raster data:** This is the standard format for geospatial imagery like Sentinel-2.
* **Time series:**  The text refers to "Sentinel-2 time series", indicating that data is collected and processed over time. 


It's possible that other formats like CSV (for ancillary data) could be involved, but the primary focus is on geospatial imagery.
