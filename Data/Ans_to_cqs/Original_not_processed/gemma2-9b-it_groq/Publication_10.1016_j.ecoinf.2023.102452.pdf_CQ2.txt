Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it's not possible to definitively say what data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline. 

The papers discuss various techniques and models related to deep learning, including:

* **LSTM, CNN, and ConvLSTM for streamflow forecasting:** This suggests the data likely involves time series data, which could be represented in a numerical format like CSV.
* **Data-driven multi-model methodology with deep feature selection for wind forecasting:**  This implies numerical data related to wind patterns and possibly other meteorological variables.
* **Genetic programming approach to system identification of rainfall-runoff models:** This could involve numerical rainfall and runoff data, potentially in a CSV format.

However, the context doesn't explicitly mention the specific data formats used in these pipelines.
