Answer:::
The provided text focuses on describing the architecture and performance of a deep learning model for image enhancement, and it doesn't mention the specific criteria used to split the data for training, testing, and validation. 

To answer your query generally, data splitting for deep learning models typically follows these common practices:

* **Training Set:** This is the largest portion of the data (usually 70-80%) used to train the model. The model learns patterns and relationships within this data.
* **Validation Set:** A smaller portion (around 10-15%) used to evaluate the model's performance during training. It helps monitor how well the model is generalizing to unseen data and prevents overfitting (where the model performs well on training data but poorly on new data).
* **Test Set:**  Held out completely from the training process (around 10-15%). This set is used only once at the end to provide a final, unbiased evaluation of the trained model's performance.

The specific split ratios can vary depending on the dataset size and the complexity of the problem. 

Data is often split randomly to ensure representativeness.
