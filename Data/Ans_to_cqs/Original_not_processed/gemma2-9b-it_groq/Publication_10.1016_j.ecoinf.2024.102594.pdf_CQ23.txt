Answer:::

The provided text describes the dataset preparation and training process for the DeepLabV3+ model but doesn't explicitly mention techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting to ensure the model's generalizability. 

It does state:

* **Dataset Split:** 70% of the dataset was used for training, and the remaining 30% for validation. 
* **Data Augmentation:**  Several techniques were used to increase the size and diversity of the training data:
    * Flipping images and labels
    * Exchanging image channels
    * Randomly rotating images and labels
    * Adding noise to images

While data augmentation helps improve model robustness, the absence of information about cross-validation or stratified splitting techniques makes it impossible to definitively say whether these measures were taken to enhance the model's generalizability.
