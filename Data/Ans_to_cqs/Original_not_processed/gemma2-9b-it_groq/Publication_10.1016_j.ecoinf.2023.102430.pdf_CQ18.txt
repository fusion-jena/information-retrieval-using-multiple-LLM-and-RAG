Answer:::
The provided text describes the training and testing process but doesn't explicitly state the strategy used to monitor model performance *during* training. 

It does mention:

* **Stochastic gradient descent with momentum optimizer:** This is an optimization algorithm used to update the model's parameters during training.
* **Initial learning rate of 0.001:** This controls the step size taken during parameter updates.
* **Maximum number of epochs set to 15:**  An epoch is one complete pass through the training data.

While these elements are part of the training process, they don't directly reveal a specific strategy for monitoring performance *in real-time* during each epoch.
