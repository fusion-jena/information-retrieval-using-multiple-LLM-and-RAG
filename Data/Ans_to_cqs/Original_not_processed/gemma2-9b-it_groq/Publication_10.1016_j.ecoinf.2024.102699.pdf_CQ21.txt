Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the model training process, particularly the use of ViT models and data augmentation techniques. It doesn't delve into the post-processing steps involved after training, such as:

* **Saliency maps:** These highlight the regions of an input image that are most influential in the model's decision.
* **Metrics calculation:**  Common metrics for classification tasks include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC. These are used to evaluate the model's performance.
* **Confusion matrix:** This visualizes the performance of a classification model by showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what post-processing steps are involved.
