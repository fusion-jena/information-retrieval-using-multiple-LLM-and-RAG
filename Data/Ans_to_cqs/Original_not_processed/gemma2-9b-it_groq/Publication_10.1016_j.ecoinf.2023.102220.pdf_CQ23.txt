Answer:::

The provided text describes the methodology used to develop and evaluate a predictive model for outbreaks, but it doesn't explicitly mention specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. 

The text does mention the following:

* **Training-test splits:** The authors used training-test splits of the time series data to evaluate the performance of the models.
* **Cross-validation:** They propose using k-fold cross-validation to optimize the values of certain hyperparameters (cluster and Î±) to improve the model's accuracy.

However, it doesn't state whether they used techniques like:

* **Data augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the dataset.
* **Stratified splitting:** Ensuring that the training and testing sets have a similar distribution of outbreak occurrences.
* **Using a diverse dataset:**  Collecting data from various sources and time periods to represent different outbreak scenarios.



Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot definitively say what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
