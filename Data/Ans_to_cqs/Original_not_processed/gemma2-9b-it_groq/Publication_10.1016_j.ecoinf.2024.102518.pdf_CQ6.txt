Answer:::

The provided text focuses on species distribution modeling and doesn't delve into the preprocessing steps for deep learning models.  

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values (imputation or removal), removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

* **Feature Scaling:**  Scaling features to a similar range (e.g., 0 to 1 or -1 to 1) can improve model performance. Common techniques include min-max scaling and standardization (z-score normalization).

* **Normalization:**  Similar to scaling, normalization aims to bring feature values to a common distribution.  

* **Encoding Categorical Features:**  Categorical variables (e.g., colors, categories) need to be converted into numerical representations that deep learning models can understand. Techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding are often used.

* **Feature Engineering:**  Creating new features from existing ones can sometimes enhance model performance. This might involve combining features, extracting patterns, or transforming data.

* **Data Splitting:** Dividing the data into training, validation, and test sets is crucial for evaluating model performance and preventing overfitting.
