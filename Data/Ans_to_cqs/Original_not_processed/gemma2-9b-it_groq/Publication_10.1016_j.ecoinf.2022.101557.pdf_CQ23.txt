Answer: 

The text describes several measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model:

* **10-fold cross-validation:** The model was trained and evaluated using a 10-fold cross-validation strategy. This involves splitting the data into 10 subsets and iteratively using 9 subsets for training and the remaining one for evaluation. This helps to assess the model's performance on unseen data and reduce the risk of overfitting.

* **Non-uniform data splitting:** The data was split into 10 subsets by placing a 3x3 grid over the map, with the central cell containing more area than the others. This grid was designed to create subsets that vary in terrain type and map style, simulating real-world scenarios and challenging the model's ability to generalize to diverse areas.
