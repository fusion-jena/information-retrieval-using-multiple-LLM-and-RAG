Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the efficiency of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and doesn't delve into the preprocessing steps involved in training deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps before training a deep learning model generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the dataset.

* **Normalization:** Scaling the features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1 or -1 to 1) can improve model performance.

* **Feature Scaling:** Techniques like standardization (subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation) can help features with different scales contribute equally to the model.
* **Encoding Categorical Features:** Converting categorical variables into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding) is necessary for most deep learning algorithms.

* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the dataset by applying transformations like rotations, flips, and crops can enhance model robustness.
