Answer:::

The provided text focuses on the model training process and data evaluation strategies. It describes experiments using different proportions of training data and various model setups (within-site, cross-site, transfer learning) but doesn't delve into specific post-processing steps like saliency maps, metric calculation, or confusion matrix construction. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what post-processing steps are involved after model training.
