Answer:::
The provided text focuses on the methodology and experimental design of a model, but it doesn't explicitly detail the post-processing steps after model training. 

While it mentions "evaluation" and "results," it doesn't specify the exact post-processing techniques used, such as:

* **Saliency maps:**  These highlight the regions of an input image that are most influential in the model's decision.
* **Metrics calculation:**  This involves calculating performance measures like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC to assess the model's effectiveness.
* **Confusion matrix:** This visualizes the performance of a classification model by showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. 


Therefore, based on the given context, we cannot definitively list the specific post-processing steps employed.
