Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning models in this study is **object detection**. 

The abstract states that the researchers "employed 8 deep learning algorithms for bird **object detection**" and the conclusion mentions using these approaches to "detect wild birds in camera traps".  Object detection is a type of computer vision task that involves identifying and locating specific objects within an image.
