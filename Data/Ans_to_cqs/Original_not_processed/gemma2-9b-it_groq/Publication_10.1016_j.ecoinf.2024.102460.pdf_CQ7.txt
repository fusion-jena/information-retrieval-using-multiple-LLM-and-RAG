Answer:::
The provided text focuses on land use modeling and doesn't contain information about data splitting criteria for deep learning model training.  

To answer your question generally:

Data for deep learning models is typically split into three sets:

* **Training set:** Used to train the model, allowing it to learn patterns and relationships in the data. This is usually the largest portion of the data.
* **Validation set:** Used to evaluate the model's performance during training and fine-tune hyperparameters. It helps prevent overfitting, where the model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data.
* **Test set:** Used only once at the end of the training process to provide an unbiased evaluation of the final model's performance on unseen data. 

The specific split ratios (e.g., 70% train, 15% validation, 15% test) can vary depending on the dataset size and the specific problem being addressed.
