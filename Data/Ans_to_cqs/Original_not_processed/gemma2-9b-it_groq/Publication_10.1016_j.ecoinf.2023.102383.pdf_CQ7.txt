Answer:::
The provided text describes how the dataset is split to address the imbalance in the number of deer instances per image. 

It states:

1. **Initial Split:** The dataset is first divided into subsets based on the number of deer in each image.

2. **Subsequent Split:** Within each subset, the images are further partitioned into three sections using a 75:15:15 ratio.

The text does not specify how the initial subsets are determined or what the final train, test, and validation splits are.
