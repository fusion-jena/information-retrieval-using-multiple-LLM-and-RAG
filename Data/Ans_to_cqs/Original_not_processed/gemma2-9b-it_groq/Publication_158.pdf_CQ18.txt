Answer:::
To monitor model performance during training, the authors tracked the validation data performance across epochs.  They specifically kept track of the network weights that produced the best performance.  

The training process also included an early stopping criterion. If no improvement was observed in the validation data for 50 consecutive epochs, the training was stopped.
