Answer:::
The provided text mentions the use of convolutional neural networks to model species distribution based on remote sensing imagery. This suggests that **image data** is used in the deep learning pipeline. 

The text also discusses applications of UMAP in analyzing bird song features, indicating the use of **audio data**. 


It's possible that other data formats like **CSV** (for bioclimatic variables) are also used, but the text doesn't explicitly state it.
