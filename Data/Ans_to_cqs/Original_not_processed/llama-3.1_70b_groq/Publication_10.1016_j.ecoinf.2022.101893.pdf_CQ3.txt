Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on feature extraction methods, classification models, and their performance on bird species recognition tasks. It does mention labeling for various features, as shown in Table 4, but it does not provide details on the annotation techniques used. Therefore, I don't know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
