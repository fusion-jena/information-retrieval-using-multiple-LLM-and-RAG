Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the optimization of machine learning models (RF, ANN, and GBDT) for predicting flowering dates, and the evaluation metrics used to assess their performance. It does not provide information on the input data formats used in the pipeline.

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the input data is likely to be in a tabular format, such as CSV, since the models are being used for regression tasks (predicting flowering dates) and the context mentions the use of Optuna for hyperparameter tuning, which is typically used with tabular data. Nevertheless, without explicit information, it is impossible to confirm the exact data formats used in the pipeline.
