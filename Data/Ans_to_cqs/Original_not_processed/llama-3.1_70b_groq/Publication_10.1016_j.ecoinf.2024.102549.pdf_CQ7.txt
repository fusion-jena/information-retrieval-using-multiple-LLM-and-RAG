Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, its parameters, and the training process. It also discusses the study area, water quality monitoring, and the use of remote sensing techniques. However, it does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation. Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used for data splitting in this study.
