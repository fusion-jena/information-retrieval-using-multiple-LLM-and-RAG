Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is primarily for classification, specifically taxonomic classification of insects. The model is designed to classify insects into different species or classes based on their images. Additionally, the model is also used for object detection, which involves detecting the presence of insects in images. The model is integrated into a web-based portal and database called STARdbi, which allows users to contribute new images, query existing ones, and annotate, search, count, and morphologically characterize trapped insects. The model is also used to assess percentage cover, which is a measure of the proportion of an area covered by a particular class or species.
