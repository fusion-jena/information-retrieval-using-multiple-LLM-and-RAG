Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the processing and analysis of the data, rather than its collection.

However, it can be inferred that the data is likely collected from remote sensing sources, as the context mentions "Remote Sens." and includes references to land use types, soil, topography, elevation, slope, aspect, and distance to settlements, roads, and rivers. This suggests that the data may be collected through satellite or aerial imagery, but the exact methods used for data collection are not specified.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to the query.
