Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be focused on the application of deep learning methods for image segmentation, specifically in the fields of remote sensing and ecology. It discusses various studies and techniques used for individual tree segmentation, mangrove crown diameter measurement, and wetlands classification, but does not provide information on data splitting criteria.

However, in general, common practices for splitting data for deep learning model training include:

* Random splitting: dividing the data into training, validation, and testing sets using random sampling.
* Stratified splitting: dividing the data into training, validation, and testing sets while maintaining the same class distribution in each set.
* K-fold cross-validation: dividing the data into k folds, using k-1 folds for training and 1 fold for testing, and repeating the process k times.

Without more specific information, it is not possible to determine the exact criteria used to split the data in the context provided.
