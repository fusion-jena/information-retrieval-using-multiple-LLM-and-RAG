Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context appears to be related to the use of LiDAR GEDI data and machine learning models for forest ecosystem monitoring, but it does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps used.

The context mentions the use of machine learning models to fuse GEDI samples with passive optical images, and the computation of a global forest canopy height map using machine learning algorithms. However, it does not provide details on the postprocessing steps involved in these models.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to the query, and I cannot provide any information on the postprocessing steps involved after model training.
