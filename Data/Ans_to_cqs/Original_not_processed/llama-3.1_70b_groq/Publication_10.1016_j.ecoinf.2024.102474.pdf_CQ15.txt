Answer: The optimization technique applied in the deep learning pipeline is AdamW, which is a variant of the standard Adam optimizer. According to the text, AdamW is used because it decouples the weight decay and has shown to improve generalization. The learning rate is set to 0.0003 and the batch size is set to 4. Additionally, the hyperparameters were tuned using an Optuna-based hyperparameter optimization procedure.
