Answer:::
The provided context does not mention specific criteria for determining when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The text describes a two-step process involving a Least Squares (LS) algorithm and a Genetic Algorithm (GA), but it does not provide information on how the training process is terminated or what criteria are used to determine convergence. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
