Answer:::

To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the dataset was divided into 70% for training, 10% for validation, and 20% for testing purposes. This division was kept the same when experimenting with different models, such as RF and YAMNet-based models. This suggests that cross-validation was used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

Additionally, the dataset was collected from four different farms (A, B, C, and D), which suggests that the dataset is diverse in terms of the environment and conditions. The distribution of annotations, audio files, and durations across the four farms is also shown in the provided context, which suggests that the dataset is representative of different scenarios.

However, it is not explicitly mentioned whether stratified splitting was used to split the dataset. Stratified splitting is a technique used to split the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same proportion of classes in both sets. Without this information, it is unclear whether stratified splitting was used to ensure that the model is generalizable to different classes.

Overall, the use of cross-validation and a diverse dataset suggests that measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, more information is needed to confirm whether stratified splitting was used.
