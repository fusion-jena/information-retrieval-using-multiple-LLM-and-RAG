Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of image augmentation techniques to introduce randomness in the training data. Specifically, the keras image_data_generator function is used to apply random transformations to the images, including:

* Rotation: 0-40 degrees
* Width and height shift range: 20%
* Shear range: 0-0.2 radians
* Zoom range: 0-0.2 scalar range
* Horizontal flip
* Fill mode with the nearest pixel

These techniques likely help to reduce overfitting and increase the robustness of the model by exposing it to a diverse set of images during training. However, without further information, it is unclear whether a random seed value is used to ensure reproducibility of the results.
