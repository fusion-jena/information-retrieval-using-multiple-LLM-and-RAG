Answer: The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows:

* Optimizer: Adam optimizer algorithm (Kingma and Ba, 2015)
* Batch size: 10
* Number of epochs: 100
* Learning rates: The learning rates were chosen from empirical trials over 100 epochs, with two values mentioned: 10^-4 and 10^-6.

Note that the specific learning rate values used for each model are not explicitly stated in the provided context, but it is mentioned that the learning rates were chosen from empirical trials.
