Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or the use of random seed values. The context appears to be focused on the use of machine learning algorithms, specifically Random Forest and XGBoost, for burned area detection and the importance of different features in these models. It does not provide information on deep learning pipelines or randomness handling strategies.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
