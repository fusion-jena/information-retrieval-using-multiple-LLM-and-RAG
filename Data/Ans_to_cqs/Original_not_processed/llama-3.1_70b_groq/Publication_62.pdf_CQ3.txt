Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the architecture and layers of the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used for image classification, as well as the supplementary materials provided for the notebooks used to define and train the CNNs. There is no mention of bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, or any other data annotation techniques. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
