Answer:::
The provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. It mentions the use of deep convolutional neural networks, citing Krizhevsky, A., I. Sutskever, and G. E. Hinton's 2012 paper "ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks" and LeCun, Y., Y. Bengio, and G. Hinton's 2015 paper "Deep learning", but it does not specify the frameworks used in the study.
