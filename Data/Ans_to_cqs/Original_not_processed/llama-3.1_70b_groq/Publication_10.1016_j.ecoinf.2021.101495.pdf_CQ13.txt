Answer:

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are listed in Table 2. The hyperparameters for the segmentation model are:

* Epochs: 15,000
* Batch size: 500
* Learning rate: 0.008
* Activation: Softmax
* Train/test split: 0.9/0.1

The hyperparameters for the classification model are:

* Epochs: Not specified
* Batch size: 4
* Learning rate: 0.0001
* Activation: Softmax
* Train/test split: 0.8/0.2

Note that the optimizer is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the base implementation of TensorFlow is used for the classification model, which suggests that the Adam optimizer may be used by default. But this is not explicitly stated.

Additionally, the search space for the hyperparameters is also provided in Table 2, which shows the range of values that were explored during the hyperparameter tuning process.
