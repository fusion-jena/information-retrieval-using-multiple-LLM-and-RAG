Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of the BirdNET-Analyzer deep learning model for monitoring bird species by their vocalizations, and references various research papers related to deep learning and bird species monitoring.

While the context mentions the use of deep learning models and the application of the BirdNET-Analyzer model, it does not provide information on data preprocessing techniques or methods used to address data bias. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.

However, I can suggest that common techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of deep learning pipelines include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, as mentioned in the query. These techniques are often used to ensure that the training data is representative of the population and to reduce bias in the model. But without further information, I cannot confirm if these techniques are used in the specific context of the BirdNET-Analyzer model.
