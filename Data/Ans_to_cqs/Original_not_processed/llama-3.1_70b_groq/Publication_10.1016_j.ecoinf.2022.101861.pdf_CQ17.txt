Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a study on detecting the Band-tailed Nighthawk using the Kaleidoscope Pro software, and mentions the use of machine learning and convolutional neural networks in future studies, but does not provide information on specific regularization methods used.
