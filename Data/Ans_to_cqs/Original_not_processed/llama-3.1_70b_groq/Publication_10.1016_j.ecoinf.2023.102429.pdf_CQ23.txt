Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a study on soil nutrient concentration analysis using various machine learning models, including PLSR (Partial Least Squares Regression), but it does not specifically discuss deep learning models or their generalizability. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
