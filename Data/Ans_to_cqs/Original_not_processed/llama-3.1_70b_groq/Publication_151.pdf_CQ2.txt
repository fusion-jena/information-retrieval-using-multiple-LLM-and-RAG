Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it appears that the pipeline is designed for phylogenetic placement, which involves analyzing DNA or protein sequences. 

The context mentions "query sequences" and "sites with gaps in the query sequences," which suggests that the pipeline is working with sequence data. However, the specific data format used to store or input this sequence data is not mentioned. It is likely that the pipeline uses a format such as FASTA, which is a common format for storing biological sequences, but this is not explicitly stated.
