Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. It mentions the use of deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and a pre-trained VGGnet, but it does not specify the framework used to implement these models. Therefore, I do not know which framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) is used to build the deep learning model.
