Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific datasets used in deep learning pipelines such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on bioacoustic classification, particularly in the field of marine mammal research, and discusses the use of deep neural networks for classification tasks. However, it does not provide information on the specific datasets used in these pipelines.

The context does mention the use of image data augmentation for deep learning, citing a survey by Shorten and Khoshgoftaar (2019), but it does not provide information on the specific datasets used in this context.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
