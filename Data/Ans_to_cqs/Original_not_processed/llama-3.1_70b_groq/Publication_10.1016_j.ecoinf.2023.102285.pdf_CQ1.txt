Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention various data collection methods in different contexts. For instance, it mentions aerial surveys as a cost-effective way to collect environmental information over large areas in a short amount of time (Davis et al., 2022). It also mentions the use of underwater imagery, robots, or sonography to detect underwater man-made objects (Abu et al., 2022).

Additionally, the context mentions the use of optical and SAS (Synthetic Aperture Sonar) data for classification of man-made underwater objects (Abu et al., 2022). It also mentions the use of 3D posture data to detect human activity types using deep learning models (Çalıs¸kan, 2023).

However, it does not provide a comprehensive list of methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, the answer to this query is incomplete based on the provided context.

It is worth noting that the context does mention the use of airborne camera systems to monitor ISMMMOs (In-Service Shipborne Mine Countermeasures Mine Monitoring Objects) and the processing of images as they are streamed from these systems. However, this is a specific application and may not be representative of the broader methods used for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines.
