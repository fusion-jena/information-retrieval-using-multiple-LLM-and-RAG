Answer:::

The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics, including:

1. Classification Accuracy (ACC): This measures the proportion of correctly classified instances out of all instances in the test dataset.
2. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): This measures the square root of the average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values.
3. Precision: This measures the proportion of true positives among all predicted positive instances.
4. Recall: This measures the proportion of true positives among all actual positive instances.
5. F-Score: This is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, calculated as 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall).
6. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve: This is a graphical plot that illustrates the diagnostic ability of the classifier system.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the DELMF (Deep Extreme Learning Machine) algorithm and compare it with the SCNN (Spiking Convolutional Neural Network) algorithm. The results are presented in Tables 2 and 3 for the mammals_dataset and fishes_dataset, respectively.
