Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context primarily focuses on the hyper-parameters used for training, the performance of different models on the IP102 dataset, and the architecture of the models. It does not provide information on data splitting or the train-test-validation set ratios. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
