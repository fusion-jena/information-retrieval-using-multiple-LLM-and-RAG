Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention a few approaches that could be related to managing randomness:

1. **Weighted random sampling**: The text mentions using a weighted random sampler as a baseline to evaluate the performance of regression CNNs. This approach takes into account the occurring frequency of classes, which could help reduce the impact of randomness in the sampling process.
2. **Ensemble methods**: The text suggests using an ensemble of architectural similar or identical CNNs to produce more reliable predictions. This approach can help reduce the effect of randomness in individual models by averaging their predictions.
3. **Shuffling the sequence of data**: The text mentions shuffling the sequence of data as a way to alter the training process slightly, which could help reduce overfitting and improve the robustness of the models.

While these approaches might be related to handling randomness, they do not specifically address the use of random seed values or other strategies for managing randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a more detailed answer to this question based on the provided context.
