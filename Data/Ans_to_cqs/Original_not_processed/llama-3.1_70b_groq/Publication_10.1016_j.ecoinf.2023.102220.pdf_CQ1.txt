Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on comparing the performance of different machine learning methods, including the PBP method, Support Vector Machines, Deep Neural Networks, Long Short Term Memory, and Random Forests, in a specific case study. It also mentions the implementation of these methods in Python using libraries such as TensorFlow and Scikit-learn.

However, it does not provide information on how the raw data was collected, whether through surveys, sensors, public datasets, or other means. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
