Answer: The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not traditional computer vision datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the datasets used are specific to the task of cetacean vocalization detection and are composed of audio signals. 

Two specific datasets are mentioned: the SWAMS dataset, which contains 7 hours of audio signals recorded during the OHASISBIO program, and a dataset containing blue whale's Dcall vocalizations. The SWAMS dataset was recorded in the Indian Ocean's oceanic zone between Kerguelen and Amsterdam Island, and it contains 102 manually annotated vocalizations. 

These datasets are used to evaluate the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on different annotation sets, and to assess the impact of annotation variability on model performance.
