Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context primarily focuses on the EfficientNet series, particularly EfficientNetV2, and its improvements in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and training speed. It also mentions the use of a backbone to improve training speed while ensuring detection accuracy and speed, but it does not provide information on data splitting criteria.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context. Data splitting criteria, such as the proportion of data allocated to training, testing, and validation sets, are typically dependent on the specific problem, dataset, and experimental design, and are not mentioned in the given text.
