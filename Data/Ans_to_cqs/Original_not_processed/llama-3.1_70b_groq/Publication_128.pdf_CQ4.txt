Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and training parameters of various neural network models, including AlexNet, MobileNet, and ResNet. It discusses the input data resolution, batch normalization, batch size, activation functions, and training epochs, but does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
