Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning in ecological informatics, soil carbon mapping, and agriculture-related elements. It discusses the use of deep learning models, such as those implemented in Keras, and their potential for improving prediction accuracy in these fields.

However, it does mention the use of multi-source data integration for soil mapping using deep learning, as discussed in Wadoux et al. (2019). This suggests that the data used in these studies may have undergone some form of preprocessing or annotation, but the specific techniques used are not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query about data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
