Answer:::

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows:

- Learning rate: 0.01
- Optimizer: Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2015), which is a variant of the stochastic gradient optimization where the learning rate is adjusted automatically.
- Number of epochs: 150
- Batch size: 2500

These hyperparameters were set empirically, and the model was trained on an Inter Core i7 machine with NVIDIA GeForce 1080 GPU.
