Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The text focuses on the comparison of different object detection models, such as YOLOv5 and Faster R-CNN, and their performance on detecting Pacific oysters, but it does not provide information on the preprocessing steps. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
