Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model. The context only discusses the architecture of the three-layer back propagation (BP) artificial neural network, the data used for calibration and validation, and the performance metrics used to evaluate the model. It does not provide any information on data preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this case.
