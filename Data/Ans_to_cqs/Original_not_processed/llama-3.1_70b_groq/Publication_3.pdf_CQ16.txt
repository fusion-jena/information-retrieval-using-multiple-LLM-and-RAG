Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that the authors explored different numbers of training steps and compared results to find an optimum balance between computing time and classification efficiency. They also mention that they considered two factors to find optima for training TensorFlow: correct identification rate and processing time. 

It is mentioned that for all challenges except Challenge 3, 4000 training steps were chosen as the optimum number, and for Challenge 3, 8000 training steps proved to be the optimum number. However, the exact criteria used to determine these optimum numbers are not specified.
