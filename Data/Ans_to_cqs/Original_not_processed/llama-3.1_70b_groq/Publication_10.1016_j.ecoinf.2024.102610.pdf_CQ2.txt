Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the references provided, we can make some inferences.

The context mentions the use of remote sensing techniques, mid-infrared spectroscopy, and machine learning approaches for predicting infectious diseases and analyzing vector-borne diseases. This suggests that the data formats used may include:

* Image data (e.g., satellite or aerial images, spectroscopy images)
* Spectral data (e.g., mid-infrared spectroscopy data)
* CSV data (e.g., for storing and processing tabular data, such as disease incidence rates or environmental variables)

However, without more specific information, it is difficult to determine the exact data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The context also mentions the use of R packages such as caret, VSURF, and pdp, which are commonly used for machine learning and data analysis tasks, but these packages can handle a variety of data formats.

Therefore, while we can make some educated guesses about the possible data formats used, we cannot provide a definitive answer without more information.
