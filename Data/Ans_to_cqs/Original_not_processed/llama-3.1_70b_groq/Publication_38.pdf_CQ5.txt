Answer:::
The provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention that the detection algorithm was tested on the "3.2 minutes of full spectrum iBats Romania and Bulgaria test dataset". This suggests that the dataset used is a custom or specialized dataset for bat acoustic signal detection, rather than a widely used benchmark dataset like MNIST or ImageNet.
