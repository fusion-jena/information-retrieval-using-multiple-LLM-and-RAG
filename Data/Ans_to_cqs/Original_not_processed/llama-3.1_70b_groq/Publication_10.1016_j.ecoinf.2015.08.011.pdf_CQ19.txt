Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context only discusses the development of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model, including the selection of the number of layers, neurons, learning rates, and epochs, but it does not provide information on the specific framework or tool used to implement the model.
