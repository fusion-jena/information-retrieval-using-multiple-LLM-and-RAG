Answer:::

The provided context does not specifically discuss strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline or the use of random seed values. However, it does mention the use of random forests, a type of ensemble learning method, which inherently involves randomness in the generation of decision trees.

In the context of random forests, the randomness is managed through the use of multiple decision trees, where each tree is generated based on a random subset of the input features. The results from each tree are then averaged to produce a more reliable result. This approach helps to reduce the impact of randomness and improves the overall performance of the model.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of Bayesian Optimization for hyperparameter optimization, which involves minimizing a 5-fold cross-validation loss during model development. This approach may help to reduce the impact of randomness in the model development process, but it is not specifically related to handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a detailed answer to the query about strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline or the use of random seed values.
