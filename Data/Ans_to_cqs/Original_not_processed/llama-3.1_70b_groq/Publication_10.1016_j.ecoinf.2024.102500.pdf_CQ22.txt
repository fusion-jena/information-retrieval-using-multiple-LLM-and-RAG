Answer:::

The provided context does not specifically mention the evaluation metrics used for a deep learning model. However, it does mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models for water quality prediction.

According to the context, the performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as:

* Coefficient of determination (R2)
* Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
* Mean Bias Error (MBE)
* Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
* Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE)

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of various machine learning models, including Random Forest (RF), Extra Trees (ET), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), Gradient Boosting (GB), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), for predicting water quality parameters such as nitrate and dissolved oxygen (DO).

It is worth noting that the context does not mention accuracy, precision, or recall as evaluation metrics, which are commonly used in deep learning models. Therefore, I do not know if these metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this specific context.
