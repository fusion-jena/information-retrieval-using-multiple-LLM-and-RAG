Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on landscape visual quality assessment, 3D landscape indexes, and restorative potential mapping using various methods, including convolutional neural networks. However, it does not delve into the specifics of the deep learning pipeline or optimization techniques used. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
