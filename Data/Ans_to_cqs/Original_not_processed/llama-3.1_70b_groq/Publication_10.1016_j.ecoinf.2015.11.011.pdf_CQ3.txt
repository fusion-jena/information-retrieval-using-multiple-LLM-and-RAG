Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on segmentation and classification strategies in eCognition, a software for object-based image analysis, and mentions techniques such as multi-resolution segmentation, multi-threshold segmentation, and the use of texture measures. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline.
