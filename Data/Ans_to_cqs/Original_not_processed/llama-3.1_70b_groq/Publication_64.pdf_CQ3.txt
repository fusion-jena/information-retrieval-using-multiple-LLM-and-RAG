Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. It mentions that the Google Image Search dataset was created by automatically retrieving the top 10 images for each label, which might result in some minor mislabeled or corrupt examples. However, it does not provide information on how the data was annotated or if techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation were used.

The context does mention that the model was trained on images that were downscaled to the ResNet standard 224x224 input size, and that standard data augmentation techniques such as shear, translation, and mirroring were applied during training. However, this does not provide information on the annotation techniques used.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know what data annotation techniques were used in the deep learning pipeline.
