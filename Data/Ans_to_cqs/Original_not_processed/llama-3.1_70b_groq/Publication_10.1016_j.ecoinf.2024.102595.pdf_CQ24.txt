Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning and deep learning models for predicting oil palm crop yields, highlighting the importance of these techniques in agriculture. It discusses the benefits of using models like Neural Networks, Random Forest, and LSTM for yield forecasting, but it does not delve into the details of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
