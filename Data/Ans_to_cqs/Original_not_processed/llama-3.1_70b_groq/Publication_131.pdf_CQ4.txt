Answer:::
The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context as flipping, rotating, or scaling. However, it is mentioned that data augmentation was carried out using the sound database, and the transformations were made on the audios, which were later reflected in the mel-spectrogram images.

It is stated that for each of the 865 audio samples in the database, 10 additional audios were generated, but the specific techniques used to generate these additional audios are not mentioned. Therefore, I do not know the exact data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
