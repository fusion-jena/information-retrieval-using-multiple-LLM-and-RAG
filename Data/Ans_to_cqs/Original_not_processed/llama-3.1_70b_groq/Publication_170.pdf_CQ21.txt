Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention the evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance. 

The context mentions that the model error evaluation used three metrics: overall error, commission error, and omission error, which were defined by equations (2), (3), and (4). The commission error and omission error are calculated using the following equations:

Commission error = FP / (FP + TP)
Omission error = FN / (FN + TP)

These equations suggest that the model's performance is evaluated using a confusion matrix, which is a common postprocessing step in machine learning. However, the context does not explicitly mention the calculation of a confusion matrix or other postprocessing steps such as saliency maps.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the only postprocessing step that can be confirmed is the calculation of evaluation metrics, specifically overall error, commission error, and omission error. Other postprocessing steps, such as the calculation of a confusion matrix or the generation of saliency maps, are not explicitly mentioned.
