Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context only mentions the use of a 1D-CNN (one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network) algorithm for pest damage identification, but it does not provide details on the optimization techniques employed. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
