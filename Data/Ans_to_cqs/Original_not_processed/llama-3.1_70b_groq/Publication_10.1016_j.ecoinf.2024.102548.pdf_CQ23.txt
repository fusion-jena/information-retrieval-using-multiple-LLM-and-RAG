Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the evaluation of model performance was based on the accuracy metric, and each model underwent training for 10 epochs with a batch size of 32. The class mode was set to 'categorical,' indicating that the labels were encoded using one-hot encoding for multi-class classification tasks.

Additionally, the context mentions that the generalized parameter settings were consistently applied across all models, ensuring comparability and standardization throughout the study experiments. This suggests that the authors may have taken steps to ensure that the models were trained and evaluated in a consistent manner, which could help to improve the generalizability of the results.

However, without further information, it is not possible to determine whether measures such as cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the use of a diverse dataset were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.
