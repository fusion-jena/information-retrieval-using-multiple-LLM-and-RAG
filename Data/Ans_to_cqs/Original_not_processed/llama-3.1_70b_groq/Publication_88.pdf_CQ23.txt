Answer:::

To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. 

Firstly, the dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets. This is evident from Tables 1 and 2, which show the number of samples in each set for the Amazon and Cerrado databases, respectively. This splitting of data helps in evaluating the model's performance on unseen data and prevents overfitting.

Secondly, the training set was further divided into different scenarios with varying numbers of tiles (1, 2, 3, and 4 tiles) to evaluate the influence of the number of training samples on the model's performance. This is shown in Tables 6 and 7 for the Amazon and Cerrado databases, respectively.

Thirdly, early stopping was used to prevent overfitting. The model was trained for 100 epochs, and early stopping was applied after 10 epochs with no improvement on the validation set. This helps in preventing the model from overfitting to the training data.

Lastly, the use of dropout (with a dropout rate of 0.2) in the final fully connected layer also helps in preventing overfitting by randomly dropping out neurons during training.

However, it is not clear from the provided context whether the dataset was diverse or if stratified splitting was used. The context does not provide information on the diversity of the dataset or the splitting strategy used.
