Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. Specifically, it is used for large-vocabulary bird species classification from flight calls. The model is designed to automatically classify migrating birds' flight calls into different species, which can yield new biological insights and conservation applications for birds that vocalize during migration.
