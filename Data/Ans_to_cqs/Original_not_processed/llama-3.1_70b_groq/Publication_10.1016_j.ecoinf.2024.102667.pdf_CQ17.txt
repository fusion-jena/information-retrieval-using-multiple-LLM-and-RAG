Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. The context appears to be related to ecological and environmental research, discussing topics such as desertification, land use/cover datasets, and vegetation health indices. It does not provide information on deep learning or regularization methods.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. If you have any further questions or context related to the topic, I would be happy to try and assist you.
