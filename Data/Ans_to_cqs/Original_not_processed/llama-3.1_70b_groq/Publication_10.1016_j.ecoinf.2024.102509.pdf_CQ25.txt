Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the Backpropagation Artificial Neural Network (BP-ANN) model, is regression analysis. The model is designed to predict continuous values, such as biomass, based on input variables. The model operates by modifying the weights and biases of the network's neurons to minimize the gap between the anticipated output and the actual target values. The model is trained using the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function and the backpropagation training algorithm, which is widely used for regression applications. The model's purpose is to analyze complex datasets and make predictions in a simulated environment.
