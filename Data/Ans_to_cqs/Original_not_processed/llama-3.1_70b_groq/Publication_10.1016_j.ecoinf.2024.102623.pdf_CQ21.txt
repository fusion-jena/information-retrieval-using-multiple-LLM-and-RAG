Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context appears to be a snippet from a research paper discussing the architecture and training of a deep learning model, specifically a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with residual connections, batch normalization, and the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function. It also presents some experimental results in the form of a table.

However, it does not provide any information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as the calculation of metrics, creation of saliency maps, or the construction of a confusion matrix.

Therefore, I must answer that I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training based on the provided context.
