Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to remote sensing and land use/cover change analysis, but it does not provide specific information on deep learning model preprocessing.

However, I can mention that the context does discuss the use of random forest algorithm for land use classification and the application of post-classification processing to correct misclassifications. Additionally, it mentions the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform for analysis, but it does not provide details on the preprocessing steps involved in the deep learning model.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
