Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context appears to be a list of references and a brief description of a study area, but it does not provide information on the methodology used to develop or evaluate the deep learning model. Therefore, I don't know what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.
