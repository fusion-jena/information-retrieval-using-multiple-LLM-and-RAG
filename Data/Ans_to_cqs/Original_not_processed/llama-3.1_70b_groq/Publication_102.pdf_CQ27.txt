Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only discusses the training and evaluation of the models, including the architecture, optimizer, loss function, and hardware used, but it does not provide information on the deployment process. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
