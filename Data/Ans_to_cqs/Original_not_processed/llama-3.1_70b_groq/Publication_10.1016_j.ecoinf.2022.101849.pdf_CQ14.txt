Answer: I don't know. The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the performance of predictive models, data massaging strategies for handling structural incompleteness, and evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques like grid search or random search.
