Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily discusses the concept of hard negative mining, IoU thresholds for evaluating bounding box predictions, and the performance of different models. It does mention "based on trials and errors" in the training phase, but this is not a clear indication of a specific stopping criterion. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
