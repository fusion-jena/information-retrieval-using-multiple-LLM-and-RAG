Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model in the pipeline. It appears to be discussing a statistical modeling approach, specifically a penalized loss function with an L1 penalty for variable selection and shrinkage estimation. The context mentions the use of a gradient ascent method for computing the L1 penalized estimates, but it does not mention any deep learning models such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer.
