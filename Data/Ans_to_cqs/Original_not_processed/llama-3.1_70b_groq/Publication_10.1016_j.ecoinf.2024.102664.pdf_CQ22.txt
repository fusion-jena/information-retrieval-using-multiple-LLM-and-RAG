Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models in this study are R2 (coefficient of determination) and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error). These metrics are used to assess the accuracy of the models in forecasting Chl (chlorophyll) concentrations. R2 values measure the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s), while RMSE measures the average distance between predicted and actual values. The study uses these metrics to compare the performance of different deep learning models, including CNN, LSTM, and hybrid CNN-LSTM models.
