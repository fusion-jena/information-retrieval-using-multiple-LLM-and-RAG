Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be focused on the application of machine learning and deep learning models to predict temperature profiles in water masses and detect stratification in reservoirs.

However, it does mention a feature augmentation process, which involves including lagged features to provide the model with information about previous days. Specifically, the input features of the 1 to 5 previous days were added to each observation, which means that each row of the dataset contains the information of the same day as well as the information of the five previous days.

Therefore, the only data augmentation technique mentioned in the context is the inclusion of lagged features, but it is not related to image or signal processing techniques like flipping, rotating, or scaling.
