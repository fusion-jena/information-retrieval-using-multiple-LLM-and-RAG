Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses the use of YAMNet for extracting embeddings, the classification algorithm, and the performance of the model, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
