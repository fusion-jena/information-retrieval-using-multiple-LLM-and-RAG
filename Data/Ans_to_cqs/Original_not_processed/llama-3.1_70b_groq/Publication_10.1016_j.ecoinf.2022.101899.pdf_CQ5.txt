Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to focus on wildfire event predictions in Australia, using deep learning technology and analyzing environmental conditions, NDVI data, and forest vulnerability. It does not provide information on the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
