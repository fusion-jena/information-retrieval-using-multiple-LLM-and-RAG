Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention that the authors randomly selected species to constitute the ensembles E1000, E200, and E50. This suggests that randomness is indeed a factor in the data selection process.

However, the context does not provide information on how the randomness is controlled or handled in the deep learning pipeline. It does not mention the use of random seed values, nor does it discuss any other strategies for managing randomness, such as data shuffling or batch normalization.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a detailed answer to the query.
