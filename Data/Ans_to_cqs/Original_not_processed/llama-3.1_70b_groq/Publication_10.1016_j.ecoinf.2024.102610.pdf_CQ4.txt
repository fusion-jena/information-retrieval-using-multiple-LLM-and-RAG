Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be focused on the use of machine learning and deep learning approaches for predicting infectious disease and tsetse density, as well as the use of various data sources and methods for data collection and analysis. However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
