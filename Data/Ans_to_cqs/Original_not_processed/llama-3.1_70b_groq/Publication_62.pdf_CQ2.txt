Answer:::
Answer: The data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the information given, it can be inferred that the pipeline involves image classification, as the context mentions "digitized natural history collections" and "image classification." Additionally, the supplementary materials include Mathematica notebooks and PDF files with names that suggest they are related to image classification tasks, such as "stained_unstained_RGB256" and "clubmoss_spikemoss_RGB256." These names imply that the pipeline involves RGB images, but the exact format (e.g., JPEG, PNG, TIFF) is not specified.
