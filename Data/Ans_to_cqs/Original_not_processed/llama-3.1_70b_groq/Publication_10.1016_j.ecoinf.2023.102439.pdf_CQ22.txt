Answer: 

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, specifically the NARX ANN model, are:

1. Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE)
2. Mean Square Error (MSE)
3. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
4. Correlation coefficient (R)

These metrics provide insights into the accuracy and predictive capability of the model by measuring the deviation between the predicted EVI values and the actual observed values.
