Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be focused on a study using machine learning ensemble predictions to analyze the habitat preferences of Short-billed Gulls, and it discusses the use of various machine learning algorithms and the incorporation of socio-economic and geographic data. However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline.
