Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on machine learning for predicting soil classes, spatial sampling, and habitat mapping, but it does not provide information on data collection methods.

However, based on the references provided, it can be inferred that some of the studies mentioned may have used data from sensors, such as multibeam echosounders (Calvert et al., 2015), or environmental measurements (Gislason et al., 2006). Additionally, some studies may have used public datasets or existing data sources, such as digital soil maps (Brus et al., 2011).

But without more specific information, it is difficult to provide a comprehensive answer to the query. Therefore, I must conclude that I don't know the exact methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
