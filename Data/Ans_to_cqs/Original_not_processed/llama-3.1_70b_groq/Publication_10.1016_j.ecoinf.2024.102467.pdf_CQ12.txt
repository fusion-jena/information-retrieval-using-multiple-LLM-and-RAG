Answer:::
The pipeline uses a combination of different deep learning models. The backbone of the pipeline is based on the EfficientNetV2 series, which is a type of lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN). Specifically, it uses the MBConv block from EfficientNetV1, which is a linear bottleneck layer with inverted residuals and depth-wise separable convolutions.

Additionally, the pipeline also incorporates a bottleneck transformer structure, which is a type of transformer model. The transformer model is used in conjunction with the CNN to improve the training speed and accuracy of the network. The transformer model is specifically used to replace the 3 Ã— 3 spatial convolutions in the last three bottleneck blocks of the ResNet model with multi-head self-attention (MHSA).

Therefore, the pipeline uses a combination of CNN and transformer models.
