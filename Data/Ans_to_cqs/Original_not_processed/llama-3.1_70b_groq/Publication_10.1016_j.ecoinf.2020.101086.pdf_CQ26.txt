Answer:

The provided context does not specifically discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention methods used to minimize the effects of sampling bias in species distribution models.

According to the context, four approaches can be used to transform the model input data to minimize sampling bias. These approaches can be categorized into two criteria: i) the dataset concerned with the transformation (presence sites or background sites), and ii) the implementation spaces of the transformation (geographical or environmental space).

When the presence dataset is considered, the authors aim to modify its distribution to tend toward a uniform distribution, and the background set is obtained via a uniform random selection. This approach can be implemented in either geographical space or environmental feature space.

When the background set is considered, it is built according to a selection bias that reflects the same sampling bias as the presence dataset.

While these methods are not specifically mentioned in the context of deep learning pipelines, they do provide some insight into techniques used to address data bias in species distribution models. However, I do not know if these methods are directly applicable to deep learning pipelines or if other techniques such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection are used to address data bias in this context.
