Answer:::
The data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are primarily audio and mel spectrograms. The input to the models is 3-second sound frames converted into mel spectrograms using a fast Fourier transform window size of 1024, hop length of 896, and 128 mel filterbanks. The mel spectrograms are then used as input to the models, including VGGish, BirdNET, and the custom-trained ResNet152-architecture models. There is no mention of image, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
