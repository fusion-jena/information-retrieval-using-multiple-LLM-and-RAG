Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the information provided, it appears that the model is being used for regression tasks, specifically for estimating evapotranspiration (ETa) and reference evapotranspiration. The context mentions the use of metrics such as root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2) to evaluate the performance of the model, which is consistent with regression tasks. Additionally, the context mentions the use of features such as soil water content, weather, and satellite data, which suggests that the model is being used to predict a continuous value (ETa) based on these input features.
