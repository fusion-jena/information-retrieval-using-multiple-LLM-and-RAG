Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the data format used is likely image data, specifically satellite images. This is because the context mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and semantic segmentation, which are commonly used techniques for image classification and segmentation tasks. Additionally, the context mentions the use of satellite bands, such as NIR, yellow, and red-edge bands, which are typically used in remote sensing applications involving satellite imagery.
