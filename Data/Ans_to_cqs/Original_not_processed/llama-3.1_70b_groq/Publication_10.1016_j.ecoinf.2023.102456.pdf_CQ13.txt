Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context primarily focuses on the use of the Gumbel-Softmax function, the update criterion, and the neighborhood relationship in the model. It also references various papers and studies related to machine learning, epidemiology, and forest fires, but does not provide information on the specific hyperparameters used in the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
