Answer: I don't know.

The provided context appears to be a collection of research papers and academic references related to remote sensing image classification, object-based image analysis, and species identification. However, none of the provided text mentions criteria for determining when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context seems to focus on the application of remote sensing and image analysis techniques, rather than the specifics of machine learning training processes. Therefore, I couldn't find any relevant information to answer the query.
