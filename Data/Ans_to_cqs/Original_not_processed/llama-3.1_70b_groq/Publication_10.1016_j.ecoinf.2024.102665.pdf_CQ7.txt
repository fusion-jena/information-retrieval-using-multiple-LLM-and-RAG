Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be focused on the use of Minimum Weight Spanning Tree (MWST) for clustering and network analysis, rather than deep learning model training.

However, one of the references mentioned, "Do, A.N.T., Tran, H.D., 2023. Combining a deep learning model with an optimization algorithm to detect the dispersal of the early stages of spotted butterfish in northern Vietnam under global warming. Eco. Inform. 78, 102380," suggests that deep learning models are used in the study, but the context does not provide information on how the data was split for training.

Therefore, I do not know the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training based on the provided context.
