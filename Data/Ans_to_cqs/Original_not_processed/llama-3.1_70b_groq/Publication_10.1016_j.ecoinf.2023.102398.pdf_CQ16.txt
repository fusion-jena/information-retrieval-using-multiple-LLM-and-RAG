Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that the effort to over-train the model has been avoided and graded MSE convergence (Figs. 7 to 11) has been adopted to fine-tune the model. This suggests that the training process may be monitored and stopped when the model's performance on the validation set stops improving, but the exact criteria used to determine this is not specified.
