Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific frameworks used to build deep learning models, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and applications of deep neural networks, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), but does not provide information on the frameworks used to implement these models.
