Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the hyperparameters of the UMAP method, such as the number of neighbors and minimum distance, were maintained at fixed levels for the study. It also suggests that further analysis should be done to assess how hyperparameter calibration affects the performance of the model. Therefore, I do not know how the hyperparameters are optimized.
