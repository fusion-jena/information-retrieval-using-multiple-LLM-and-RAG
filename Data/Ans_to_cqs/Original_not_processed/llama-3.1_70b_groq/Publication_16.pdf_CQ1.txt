Answer:::
The methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline include the use of acoustic sensors and a Samsung S10 smartphone. The acoustic sensors are used to collect audio data, which is then automatically uploaded to the platform for classification. Additionally, the Samsung S10 smartphone is used to record garden birds and upload the acquired audio to the platform using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). It is also mentioned that the system can interface with a variety of sensors for real-time inference, suggesting that other types of sensors may be used for data collection as well. However, the specific types of sensors are not specified.
