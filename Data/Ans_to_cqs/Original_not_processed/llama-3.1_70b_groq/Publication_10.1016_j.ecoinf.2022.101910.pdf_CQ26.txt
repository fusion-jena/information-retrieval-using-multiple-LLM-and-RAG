Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically address techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the use of BirdNET, a research project for automated detection and classification of bird vocalizations, and its application in ecological informatics. It discusses the settings that can be adjusted in BirdNET, such as detection sensitivity, overlap of prediction segments, and minimum confidence threshold, but does not delve into techniques for addressing data bias.

However, it does mention the use of a low confidence threshold, which may result in increased recall and false positive rates, but this is not directly related to addressing data bias. The context also mentions the use of a deep neural network in BirdNET, but does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
