Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or the use of random seed values. The context appears to be related to a study on the use of machine learning (ML) bounding box models to accelerate the data labeling process for wildlife monitoring using camera trap images. It discusses the experiment design, results, and findings, but does not touch on the topic of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a meaningful answer to this question.
