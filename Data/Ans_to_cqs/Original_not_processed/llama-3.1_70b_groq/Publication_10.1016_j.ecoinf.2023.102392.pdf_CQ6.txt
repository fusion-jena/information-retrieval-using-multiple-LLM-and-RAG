Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on the application of deep learning models in various studies, such as predicting forest fires vulnerability, classifying land use/land cover, and detecting the dispersal of fish. However, it does not provide information on the specific preprocessing steps used in these studies.

The only mention of data processing is in the section on "Unmanned aerial vehicle data processing", which describes the steps involved in processing UAV data using CATALYST PROFESSIONAL image processing software. These steps include camera parameter correction, setting up connection points, point fine-tuning, and editing ground control points. However, these steps appear to be specific to UAV data processing and may not be directly applicable to the preprocessing of data for deep learning models.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query on preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model.
