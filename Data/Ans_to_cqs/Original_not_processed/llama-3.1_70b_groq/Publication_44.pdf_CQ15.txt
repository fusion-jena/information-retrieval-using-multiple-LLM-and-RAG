Answer:::
The provided context mentions the use of the Adam optimizer in the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, it is mentioned that the YOLOv5s network was trained using an Adam optimizer for 300 epochs. Additionally, the Faster R-CNN model was trained with a threshold during training for 3000 iterations, but the optimizer used is not explicitly mentioned. However, it is mentioned that the model was adapted from a pre-trained VGG16 network, which was trained on the ImageNet dataset, but the optimizer used for the VGG16 network is not specified.

There is no mention of SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) being used in the provided context. However, it is worth noting that the use of other optimization techniques, such as learning rate schedulers or weight decay, is not mentioned in the provided context.
