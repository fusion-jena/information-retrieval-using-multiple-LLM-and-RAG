Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention anything about training or validation loss plateau. The context appears to be related to forestry and ecological informatics, discussing topics such as continuous cover forestry, sample plots, and diversity indices. There is no mention of machine learning or training processes.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not related to the provided context.
