Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily discusses the workflow's ability to compensate for biases through data classification and spatio-temporal aggregation, as well as the importance of using statistically significant data and suitable spatial resolution for analysis.

However, it does mention that the workflow implements a FAIR approach, which tests FAIR data principles' practicability, and that the workflow is open-source and integrated with the DataMiner Cloud computing platform. Additionally, the context notes that the precision of the workflow's output depends on the completeness of the input vessel data, the update rate of the GRSF, the completeness of the OBIS data, and the suitability of the selected spatial resolution for the analysis.

Regarding the deep learning model specifically, the context only mentions that the Global Fishing Watch (GFW) data were aggregated at 0.01Â° resolutions with fishing activity cells already classified through a machine learning model. However, it does not provide information on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of this model.
