Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. The context only mentions that the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) algorithm was used to optimize the hyperparameters of the machine learning models, but it does not provide details on the specific hyperparameters that were optimized. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
