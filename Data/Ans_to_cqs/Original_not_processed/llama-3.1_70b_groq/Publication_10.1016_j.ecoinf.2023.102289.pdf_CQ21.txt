Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of LaDeco, its components, and the computational workflow, but it does not delve into the specifics of postprocessing steps.

However, it does mention the following steps after the model produces a pixel count for 150 objects:

(2) The SS model produced a pixel count for 150 objects.
(3) Any data that fell below a certain threshold were assigned a value of zero.
(4) Finally, the percentages of each element and category were calculated based on a visual landscape classification framework.

These steps seem to be related to data processing and filtering, but they do not specifically address the postprocessing steps mentioned in the query.

Therefore, I must conclude that the provided context does not provide enough information to answer the query about the postprocessing steps involved after model training.
