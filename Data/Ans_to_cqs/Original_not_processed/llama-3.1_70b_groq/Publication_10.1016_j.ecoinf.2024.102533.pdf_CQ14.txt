Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the clustering approach used to determine the number of freshness classes, the use of the elbow method for evaluation, and the consideration of Euclidean distance as a metric. However, it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
