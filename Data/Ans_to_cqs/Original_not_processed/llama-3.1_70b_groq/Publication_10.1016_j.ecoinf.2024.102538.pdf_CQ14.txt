Answer: The text does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the hyper-parameter λ in Eq. (4) was set to 0.8, Mk in Eq. (5) was defined as 2k+1(k = 1, 2, …K), and β in Eq. (6) was set to 0.4, but it does not provide information on how these values were chosen. It also mentions that the learning rate was initially set at 0.001 and was subsequently reduced by a factor of 0.1 in a step-wise manner whenever the validation loss remained constant for five epochs, but this is a specific learning rate schedule rather than a general hyperparameter optimization strategy.
