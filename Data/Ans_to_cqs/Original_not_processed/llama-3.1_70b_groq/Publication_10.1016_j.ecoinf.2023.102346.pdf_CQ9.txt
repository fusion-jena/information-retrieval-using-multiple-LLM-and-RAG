Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific data repository of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that occurrence records of selected denitrifiers were downloaded from GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) using the "rgbif" package in RStudio. But it does not explicitly state that the deep learning pipeline's data repository is hosted on GBIF. 

The context also mentions various other sources and repositories, such as QGIS, PLOS One, mBio, and CRAN, but it does not provide information about the specific data repository of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not know the exact data repository of the deep learning pipeline.
