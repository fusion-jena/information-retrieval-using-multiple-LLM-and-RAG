Answer:::
The provided context does not specifically mention the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. However, it does mention that the learning rate is one of the hyperparameters that is optimized using the grid search method. The tuning range for the learning rate is specified as 0.001, 0.0001, and 0.00001. This suggests that the optimization technique used is likely a variant of gradient descent, but the specific type (e.g., SGD, Adam) is not mentioned.
