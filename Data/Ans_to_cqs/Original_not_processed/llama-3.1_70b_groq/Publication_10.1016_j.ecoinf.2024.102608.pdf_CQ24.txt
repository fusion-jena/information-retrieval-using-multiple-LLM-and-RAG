Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on randomized grid search methods for hyperparameter tuning and the use of random forest algorithms for ensemble learning. It does not delve into the topic of managing randomness within the deep learning pipeline.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of randomized grid search methods, which involves randomly selecting a subset of the parameter grid to explore. This approach is used to reduce computational cost and find optimal solutions, but it does not directly relate to handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

If you're looking for information on strategies for handling randomness in deep learning, you may want to explore other resources that specifically address this topic.
