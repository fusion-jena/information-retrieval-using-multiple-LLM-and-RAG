Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of remotely sensed imagery and satellite imagery for wildlife counts and population assessments. 

For example, Laliberte and Ripple (2003) mention the use of remotely sensed imagery for automated wildlife counts. LaRue et al. (2017) discuss the feasibility of using high-resolution satellite imagery to assess vertebrate wildlife populations. Leblanc et al. (2016) also mention the use of spectral reflectance of polar bear and other large arctic mammal pelts for remote sensing surveys.

It can be inferred that the raw data for the deep learning pipeline may be collected through remote sensing technologies such as satellite or aerial imagery. However, the exact methods used for collecting raw data are not explicitly stated in the provided context.
