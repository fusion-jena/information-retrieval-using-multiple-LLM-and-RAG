Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It only mentions that the hardware servers capable of training deep learning models are prepared to deploy the YWnet network, but it does not provide further details on the deployment process.

Therefore, I must say that I don't know the answer to this query.
