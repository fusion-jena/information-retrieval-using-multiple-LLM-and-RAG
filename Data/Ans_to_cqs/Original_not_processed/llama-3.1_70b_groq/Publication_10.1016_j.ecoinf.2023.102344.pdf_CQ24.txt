Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and performance of various pre-trained networks, including EfficientNet-B0, ResNet101, MobileNetV2, and InceptionV3, as well as the use of optimization algorithms like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and its variants. It does mention the use of an "every-epoch shuffle technique" in the training configuration, which may help reduce the impact of randomness in the training process. However, it does not provide further details on how randomness is handled in the pipeline. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to this question.
