Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the technique used to address data bias during preprocessing is Stratified splitting. The context mentions that the training data is split into 80% of each dialect class, and the test data is split into 20% of each dialect class. This suggests that the data is being split in a way that maintains the same proportion of each dialect class in both the training and test sets, which is a characteristic of Stratified splitting.

There is no mention of oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection techniques being used to address data bias. It's worth noting that the context does mention that the goal was to do the least amount of preprocessing possible, which may suggest that other techniques to address data bias were not used.

It's also worth noting that the context does not provide information on how the data was collected, so it's unclear if Diverse data collection techniques were used during data collection. However, based on the provided context, it appears that Stratified splitting is the technique used to address data bias during preprocessing.
