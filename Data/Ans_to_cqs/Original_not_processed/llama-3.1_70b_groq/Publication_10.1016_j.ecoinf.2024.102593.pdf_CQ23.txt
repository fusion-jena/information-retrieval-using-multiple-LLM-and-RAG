To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. 

Firstly, the model was trained on a diverse dataset, specifically the BirdCLEF 2020 dataset, which is a large-scale audio classification dataset. This dataset is diverse in terms of the variety of bird species it includes, which helps to improve the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

Secondly, the model was evaluated on a separate dataset, the Brazil extract of the BirdCLEF 2020 dataset, which was not included in the training data. This is an example of unseen data, and the model's performance on this dataset helps to assess its ability to generalize to new data.

Thirdly, dimensionality reduction techniques such as UMAP were used to analyze the embeddings generated by the model. This helps to visualize the high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space, which can help to identify patterns and relationships in the data that may not be immediately apparent.

Lastly, the model was compared to other models, such as VGGish and BirdNET, which were trained on different datasets. This comparison helps to assess the model's performance relative to other models and identify areas for improvement.

However, the text does not mention the use of cross-validation or stratified splitting specifically. It does mention that embeddings were generated for a randomly selected 40% sample of the dataset, but it is not clear if this was used for cross-validation or some other purpose.
