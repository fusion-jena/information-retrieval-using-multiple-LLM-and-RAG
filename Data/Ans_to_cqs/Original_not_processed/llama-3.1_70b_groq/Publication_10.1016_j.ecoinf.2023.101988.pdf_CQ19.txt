Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The context mentions the use of deep learning for modelling animal biodiversity using acoustic monitoring (Chalmers et al., 2021), but it does not provide information on the specific frameworks used.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions the use of software such as Bird Song Id Australia and Raven Lite for birdsong identification, but it does not provide information on the underlying frameworks used to build these software.

Therefore, I do not know which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model.
