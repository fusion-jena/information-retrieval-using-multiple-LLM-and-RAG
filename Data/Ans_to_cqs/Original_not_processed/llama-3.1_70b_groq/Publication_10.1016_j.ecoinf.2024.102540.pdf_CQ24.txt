Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models, specifically the YOLOv5 model family, for detecting and counting alates on sorghum leaves. It discusses the dataset splitting ratio, model architecture, and performance metrics, but does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness in the pipeline.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions training five different versions of the YOLOv5 model family, which may imply some form of experimentation or hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, the use of a fixed dataset splitting ratio (80:10:10) for training, validation, and testing sets may help reduce randomness in the model's performance evaluation. Nevertheless, without explicit information on random seed values or other strategies for handling randomness, it is difficult to provide a more detailed answer.
