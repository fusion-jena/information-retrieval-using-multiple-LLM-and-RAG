Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the model development, training process, and evaluation metrics, but it does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

However, it does mention that the model was evaluated using a cross-validation approach with 80% training data and 20% validation data, and that the training was stopped after 100 epochs to avoid overfitting. Additionally, the context mentions that the model was trained to reach a high classification accuracy on labeled biocrust images and to adapt to an unknown data subset.

But, it does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps that were performed after the model training. Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed answer to this query based on the provided context.
