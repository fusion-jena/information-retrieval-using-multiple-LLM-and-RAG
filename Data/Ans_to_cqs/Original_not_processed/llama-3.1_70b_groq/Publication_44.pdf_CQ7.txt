Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that the best-performing model based on the validation loss was saved and used as the Faster R-CNN model during testing. This implies that the data was split into at least three sets: training, validation, and testing.

In general, common practices for splitting data in deep learning include:

* Random splitting: dividing the data randomly into training, validation, and testing sets.
* Stratified splitting: dividing the data into training, validation, and testing sets while maintaining the same class distribution in each set.
* K-fold cross-validation: dividing the data into k folds, using k-1 folds for training and one fold for validation, and repeating the process k times.

However, without more information, it is impossible to determine the specific criteria used in this case.
