Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The text appears to focus on the methodology, datasets, and results of a study, but it does not delve into the specifics of the preprocessing steps.

However, it does mention that the model was designed to detect specific marine small natural objects (e.g., birds) in images, and that the images were processed using a camera system explained in Section 3. It also mentions that the model was evaluated using a new dataset independent from the first and second datasets, but it does not provide details on the preprocessing steps involved.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. If you have any additional context or information, I would be happy to try and help further.
