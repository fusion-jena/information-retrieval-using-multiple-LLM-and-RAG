Answer:::

According to the provided context, one technique used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline is data augmentation. Data augmentation is a technique for expanding a data set without acquiring additional data. By applying transformations to the existing data, new images are generated that are slightly different while maintaining the same class. This technique is used to allow for the training of larger networks and to balance the data. When the training set is unbalanced (classes with a significantly larger number of examples), the trained models will become biased towards larger classes. Augmentation can be used to increase the data for the classes with less representation, which allows all classes to be learned in a uniform manner.

Additionally, the context mentions that data augmentation was used to modify the class balance by increasing the number of examples for the underrepresented classes, which led to an improvement in the overall accuracy of the deep learning networks.

There is no mention of stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that diverse data collection can lead to higher degrees of accuracy, suggesting that collecting more unique data samples can help address data bias.

It is worth noting that the context does not provide an exhaustive list of techniques used to address data bias, and other techniques may be used in addition to data augmentation.
