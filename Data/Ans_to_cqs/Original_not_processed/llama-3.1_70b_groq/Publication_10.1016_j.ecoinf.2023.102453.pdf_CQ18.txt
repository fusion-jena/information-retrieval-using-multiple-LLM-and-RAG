Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on hyperparameter optimization, model performance improvement, and the results of hyperparameter tuning for specific models. It does not provide information on the monitoring strategy used during the training process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
