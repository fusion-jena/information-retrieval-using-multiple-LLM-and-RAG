Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, we can infer some information from the context.

From Table 2, we can see that the data is split into training and test sets for each experiment. The sizes of the training and test sets vary across experiments, but the context does not provide information on how the data was split.

In the text, it is mentioned that the initial experiments used a training set with 21 different individuals (classes) each having 4 different 320 Ã— 320 pixels images, and a test size included 99 other labeled images of the individuals that appeared in the training set. However, it is not clear if this is the same data split used for the experiments in Table 2.

There is no mention of a validation set in the provided context. Therefore, we cannot determine the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, including the train, test, and validation sets.
