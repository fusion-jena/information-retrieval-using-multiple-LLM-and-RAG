Answer::: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context only mentions that a deep learning approach using convolutional neural networks was used to create the high-resolution CHM of the Earth (Lang10m) at 10 m resolution using Sentinel-2 optical images. It does not provide details on the optimization techniques employed in the pipeline.
