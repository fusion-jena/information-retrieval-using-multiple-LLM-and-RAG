Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model. The text only mentions that manual annotations were used to generate training, validation, and testing datasets, and that the annotations included label name, center x, center y, etc. However, it does not provide information on any preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning that may have been performed on the data before training the model.

It is possible that the preprocessing steps were performed, but they are not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question based on the available information.
