Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It mentions the use of the random forest algorithm for land use classification, but it does not provide information on the deep learning model used. The context does mention a study by Lassalle et al. (2022) that uses deep learning-based individual tree crown delineation in mangrove forests, but it does not specify the type of deep learning model used in that study.
