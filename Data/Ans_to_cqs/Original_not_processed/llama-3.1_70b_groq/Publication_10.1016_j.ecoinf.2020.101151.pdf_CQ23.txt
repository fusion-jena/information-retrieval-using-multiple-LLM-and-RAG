Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a study on forest fire danger prediction, but it does not mention deep learning models or any specific measures to ensure generalizability. It discusses the use of different weighting approaches, spatial resolution, and the combination of factors, but it does not provide information on the generalizability of a deep learning model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
