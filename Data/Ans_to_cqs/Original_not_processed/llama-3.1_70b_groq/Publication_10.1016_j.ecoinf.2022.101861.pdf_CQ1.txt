Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention a few studies and papers that utilize different methods for collecting data.

For example, the paper by Lambert and McDonald (2014) mentions a "low-cost, yet simple and highly repeatable system for acoustically surveying cryptic species." This suggests that acoustic surveys may be one method used for collecting raw data.

Additionally, the paper by LeBien et al. (2020) mentions using "tropical soundscape recordings" as input data for their convolutional neural network. This implies that soundscape recordings may be another method used for collecting raw data.

The context also mentions the use of citizen science participation through the BirdNET app, which suggests that public datasets or crowdsourced data may also be used as a source of raw data.

However, without more specific information, it is difficult to provide a comprehensive answer to the query. Therefore, the answer is that the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline may include acoustic surveys, soundscape recordings, and public datasets or crowdsourced data, but the exact methods used are not explicitly stated in the provided context.
