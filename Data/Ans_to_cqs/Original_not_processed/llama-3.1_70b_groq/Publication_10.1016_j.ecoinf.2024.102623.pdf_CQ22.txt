Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are Mean AUC (Area Under the Curve) and Mean AUPRG (Area Under the Precision-Recall Gain Curve). Specifically, the provided context mentions that the Mean AUC performance of different loss functions is compared in Table B.4, and the Mean AUPRG over different species is compared in Table C.8.
