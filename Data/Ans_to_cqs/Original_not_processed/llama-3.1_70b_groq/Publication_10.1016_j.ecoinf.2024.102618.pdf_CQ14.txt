Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses the performance of various models, including ensemble models, and their accuracy and F1-scores on the New PlantVillage dataset. However, it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process, such as whether grid search, random search, or other methods were used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
