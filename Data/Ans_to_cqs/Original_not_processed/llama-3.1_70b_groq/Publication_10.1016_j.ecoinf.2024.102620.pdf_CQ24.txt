Answer: The provided context does not mention the deep learning pipeline or strategies for handling randomness in it. However, it does mention the use of random forest algorithm in the LEAS module of the PLUS model to obtain development probabilities of each land use type. Additionally, the context mentions a multi-type random patch seed mechanism (CARS) in the CA model, which suggests that randomness is being handled through the use of random patch seeds. However, the specific strategy for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline is not mentioned in the provided context.
