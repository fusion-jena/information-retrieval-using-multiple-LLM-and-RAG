Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to landslide vulnerability assessment using machine learning models, including ensemble techniques and deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN). However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques.
