Answer: I don't know. The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the evaluation index, knowledge distillation methods, and the performance of the refined model compared to YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 models, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search.
