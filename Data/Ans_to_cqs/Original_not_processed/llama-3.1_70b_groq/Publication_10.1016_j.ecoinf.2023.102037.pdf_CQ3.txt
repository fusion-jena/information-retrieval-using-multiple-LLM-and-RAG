Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the development and application of deep learning models for pest detection and classification, but it does not delve into the details of the data annotation process.

However, it is mentioned that Wang et al. (2020a, 2020b, 2020c) obtained a mean Average Precision (mAP) score of 63.54% using YOLOv3, which suggests that bounding box annotation might have been used, as YOLOv3 is an object detection algorithm that typically requires bounding box annotations. Nevertheless, this is an indirect inference, and the specific annotation techniques used are not explicitly stated.

Similarly, Rustia et al. (2021a) mention the use of a multi-stage deep learning method, including object detection, insect vs. non-insect separation, and multi-class insect classification, but the annotation techniques used for these tasks are not specified.

In summary, while the context provides insights into the development and application of deep learning models for pest detection and classification, it does not provide explicit information on the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
