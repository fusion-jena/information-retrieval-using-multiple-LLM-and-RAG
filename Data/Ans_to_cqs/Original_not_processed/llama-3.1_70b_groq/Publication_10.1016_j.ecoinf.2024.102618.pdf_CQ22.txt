Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are:

1. Accuracy: This metric measures the overall percentage of correct predictions. It is calculated as the sum of true positives (TP) and true negatives (TN) divided by the sum of TP, TN, false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN).

2. Precision: This metric measures the number of positive predictions that are actually correct. However, the formula for precision is not provided in the given context.

3. Recall: This metric measures the number of positive predictions that are actually correct, and it is calculated as TP divided by the sum of TP and FN.

4. F1-score: This metric is also used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, but its formula is not provided in the given context.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of different deep learning models, including DenseNet201, EfficientNetB0, EfficientNetB3, InceptionResNetv2, and ResNet50v2, as well as various ensembles of these models.
