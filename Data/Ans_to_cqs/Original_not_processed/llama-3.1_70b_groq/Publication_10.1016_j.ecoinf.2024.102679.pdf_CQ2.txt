Answer: 

The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is JPEG format for images. According to the provided context, 190,686 images were saved in 6000 Ã— 4000 pixels JPEG format. These images were then processed through the use of the deep learning model, specifically the HerdNet architecture, which is a single-stage fully convolutional neural network. The images were also georeferenced in UTM coordinates using the GeoSetter2 software, but the primary data format used in the pipeline is JPEG. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV formats being used in the pipeline.
