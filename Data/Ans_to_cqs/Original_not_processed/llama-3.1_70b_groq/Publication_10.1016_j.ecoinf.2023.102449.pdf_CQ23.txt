Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and design of the model, including the use of residual networks, batch normalization, and rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation functions. It also mentions the use of a pre-processing block and a wide residual network with a width scaling factor and depth scaling factor.

However, it does mention that the architecture draws on the layout of BirdNet's encoder, which suggests that the model may have been designed with some consideration for generalizability. Additionally, the context mentions that the model is intended to support global conservation efforts, which implies that it may have been designed to be applicable to a wide range of environments and species.

Despite these hints, the context does not provide explicit information on measures such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question based on the provided context.
