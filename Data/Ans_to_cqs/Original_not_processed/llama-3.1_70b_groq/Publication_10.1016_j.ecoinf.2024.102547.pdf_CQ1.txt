Answer:

The provided context does not specifically mention the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of scientific echosounders in the West African water to collect multifrequency acoustics data, and a towed multiparameter system to collect environmental data at a fine scale. Additionally, it mentions the use of fisheries acoustics techniques, which facilitate the collection of high-resolution spatial and temporal data concerning marine organisms at various depths and spatial scales.

It also mentions the use of other data collection methods in various studies, such as electronic recorders deployed on marine predators, remote sensing data, and nets. However, these methods are not specifically mentioned as part of a deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the methods utilized for collecting raw data that can be inferred are:

* Scientific echosounders
* Towed multiparameter systems
* Fisheries acoustics techniques
* Electronic recorders
* Remote sensing data
* Nets

However, it is not clear if these methods are used in a deep learning pipeline or not.
