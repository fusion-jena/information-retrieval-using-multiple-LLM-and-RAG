Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The context only provides information about the model's architecture (VGG-based with 12 layers), performance metrics, and hardware specifications of various devices used for testing. It does not provide details about the training process or hyperparameters used in the model.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
