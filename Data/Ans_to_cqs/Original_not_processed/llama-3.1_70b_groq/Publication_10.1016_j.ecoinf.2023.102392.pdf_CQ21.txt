Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the processing of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) data, land use/land cover classification accuracy, and forest types accuracy using XGBoost. It does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix.

However, it does mention the calculation of various metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1, Overall Accuracy (OA), and Kappa in Tables 7 and 8. These metrics are commonly used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models. But it does not provide information on how these metrics are calculated or if any other postprocessing steps are involved.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
