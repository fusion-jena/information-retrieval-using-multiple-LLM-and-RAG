Answer:::

The provided context mentions a few hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. 

1. Learning decay rate: The learning decay rate is set to 0.7, which means the learning rate gradually decays as the training progresses.

2. Regularization strength: The regularization strength is adjusted to explore its influence on the experimental results. The results show that a regularization strength of 0.2 produces better results.

3. Voxel size: The voxel size is the voxelization subsampling size, and it is adjusted along with the regularization strength and batch size to explore its influence on the experimental results.

4. Batch size: The batch size is the batch number of point cloud samples in training, and it is adjusted along with the regularization strength and voxel size to explore its influence on the experimental results.

However, the context does not mention the learning rate or the optimizer used in the model.
