Answer:

To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, the research team employed several techniques. 

One of the techniques used was data augmentation, which involved using image rotation or overlapping plots to standardize the number of samples of each forest type to the same. This helped to balance the dataset and reduce bias.

Another technique used was data reduction, which involved using sampling methods to limit the number of samples of various forest types to the same. However, this approach had a problem of different sampling ratios.

The research team also considered using the original data, where the number of samples of each type varied, and the size of the sample depended on the area of each forest type.

There is no mention of stratified splitting, oversampling, or diverse data collection as techniques used to address data bias in the provided context.
