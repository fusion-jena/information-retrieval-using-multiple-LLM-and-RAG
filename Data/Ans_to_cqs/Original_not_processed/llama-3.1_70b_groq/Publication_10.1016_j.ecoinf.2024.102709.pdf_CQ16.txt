Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it does mention "early stopping: 270" in Table 7, which suggests that early stopping was used as a criterion to stop training. Early stopping is a common technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting, where training is stopped when the model's performance on the validation set starts to degrade. The exact criteria used to determine when to stop training, such as a specific number of epochs or a threshold for validation loss, are not specified in the provided context.
