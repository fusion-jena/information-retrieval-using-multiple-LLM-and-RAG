Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention the "data preprocessing process" in Fig. 2, but it does not provide details about the specific steps involved.

However, it does mention "spectral normalization" as a technique used to stabilize the training process of the discriminator in the DR-ACGAN model. Spectral normalization is a technique used to normalize the weights of the neural network to ensure Lipschitz continuity.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of "LeakyReLU" as an activation function, but it does not provide information about other preprocessing steps such as scaling, cleaning, or normalization.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the only preprocessing step that can be confirmed is spectral normalization. Other preprocessing steps may be involved, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.
