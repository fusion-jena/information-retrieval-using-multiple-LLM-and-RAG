Answer:::

The provided context mentions that the deep learning pipeline employs a few strategies to handle randomness. 

Firstly, the model parameters are learned using stochastic gradient descent, starting from a random initialization. This means that the initial weights of the model are randomly set, which introduces randomness into the training process.

Secondly, in each iteration, a batch of 64 reference data patches is randomly sampled from the training data. This random sampling of training batches also contributes to the randomness in the training process.

Lastly, the context mentions the use of a deep ensemble, which is a method specifically developed for deep neural networks that can be understood to perform approximate Bayesian inference. In this approach, an ensemble of M independent models is trained on the same data, each initialized with a different set of random weights. The randomness inherent in the weight initialization, as well as random sampling of training batches, causes each model to converge to a different local minimum in the solution space. This approach is used to handle the randomness in the training process and to provide a more robust and reliable model.
