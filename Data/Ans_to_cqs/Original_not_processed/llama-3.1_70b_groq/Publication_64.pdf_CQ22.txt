Answer:::
The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, specifically the ResNet50, are top1 and top5 accuracy. 

Top1 accuracy measures how often the correct label is the highest probability label, while top5 accuracy measures how often the correct label is among the five labels with the highest probability. 

These metrics are used to compare the performance of the ResNet50 model with the PlantNet tool on three test datasets: Google Image Search, Portuguese Flora, and iNaturalist. The results are presented in Table 1, which shows the top1 and top5 accuracy results for all three datasets.
