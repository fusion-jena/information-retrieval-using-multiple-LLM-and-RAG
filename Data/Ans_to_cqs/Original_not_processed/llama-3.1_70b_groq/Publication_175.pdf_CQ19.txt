Answer:::
None of the provided pieces of context mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context only mentions that the ResNet architecture was used, which is a type of convolutional neural network (CNN), but it does not specify the framework used to implement it.
