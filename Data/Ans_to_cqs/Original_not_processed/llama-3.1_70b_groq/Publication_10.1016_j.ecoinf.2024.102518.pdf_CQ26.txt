Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a study on Asian elephants, specifically discussing the use of MaxEnt modeling to identify suitable habitats and the importance of input variables. It mentions metrics such as AUC-ROC, CBI, percent contribution, and permutation importance, but does not touch on data preprocessing techniques for deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, I don't know what techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline in this specific context.
