Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The text discusses the use of a multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithm for soil organic carbon stock (SOCS) modeling and mentions that deep learning has been shown to improve prediction accuracy in various studies. However, it does not provide details on the evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance. Therefore, I don't know the specific metrics used to evaluate the model's performance.
