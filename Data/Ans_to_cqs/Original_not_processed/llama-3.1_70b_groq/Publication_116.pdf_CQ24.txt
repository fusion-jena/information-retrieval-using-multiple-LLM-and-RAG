Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily discusses the creation of biased and unbiased datasets for plant identification, as well as the architecture of a deep neural network. It does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness in the pipeline.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of random selection when creating the biased dataset, where 70% of the data is randomly chosen for training and 30% for testing. This suggests that randomness is indeed a factor in the pipeline, but the context does not provide further information on how this randomness is handled or controlled.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know what specific strategies are employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
