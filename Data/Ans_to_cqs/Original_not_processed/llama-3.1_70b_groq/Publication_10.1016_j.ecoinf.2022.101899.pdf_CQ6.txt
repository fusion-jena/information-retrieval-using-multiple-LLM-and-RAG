Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to focus on the application of deep learning to predict wildfire events in Australia, and the discussion of prior distributions in a model. It does not provide information on the preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning that are typically involved before training a deep learning model.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions that Halgamuge et al. (2020) developed an algorithm to collect data automatically, which may involve some preprocessing steps. But the specific details of these steps are not provided.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
