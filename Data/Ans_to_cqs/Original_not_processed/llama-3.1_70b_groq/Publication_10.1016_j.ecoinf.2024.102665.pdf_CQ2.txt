Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the references to underwater spectral images and automatic underwater fish species classification, it can be inferred that image data is likely used in the pipeline.

The paper "Automatic underwater fish species classification with limited data using few-shot learning" by Villon et al. (2021) suggests that image data is used for fish species classification. Additionally, the use of underwater spectral images for dense taxonomic mapping of benthic habitats implies that image data is used in this context as well.

However, it is unclear if other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV are used in the pipeline. The context does not provide enough information to determine this. Therefore, the answer to the query is that image data is likely used, but the use of other data formats is unknown.
