Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The text discusses the impact of data split on the final accuracy of wetland mapping, the architecture of the proposed model, and the cost of computation in terms of time, but it does not provide information on the stopping criteria used during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
