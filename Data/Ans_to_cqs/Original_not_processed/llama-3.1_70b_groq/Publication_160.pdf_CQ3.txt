Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does mention that the dataset consists of annotated photographic quadrats, which suggests that some form of annotation was used to label the images.

The context also mentions that the dataset was annotated by human annotators, and that the reliability of these annotators was assessed using the F1-score. This suggests that the annotation process involved some form of classification or labeling of the images, but the specific techniques used are not specified.

Additionally, the context mentions that the dataset was used to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify coralligenous species or their broader taxonomical group. This suggests that the annotation process may have involved labeling the images with the corresponding species or taxonomical group, but again, the specific techniques used are not specified.

Overall, while the context provides some information about the annotation process, it does not provide enough information to determine the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
