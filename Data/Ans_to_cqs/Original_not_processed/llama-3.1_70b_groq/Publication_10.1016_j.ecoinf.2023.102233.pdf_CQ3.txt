Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does mention that the study used an active learning approach to iteratively train and improve the CNN model.

The context suggests that the annotation process involved labeling sounds, as it mentions the use of a classification approach that allowed the CNN model to classify sounds into an 'uncertain' category. It also mentions that the model's predictions most closely reflected the primary annotator's labels, which suggests that the model is replicating biases of the training data.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a grid search technique to tune hyperparameters of the final model, but it does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used. Therefore, I cannot provide a more detailed answer to the query.
