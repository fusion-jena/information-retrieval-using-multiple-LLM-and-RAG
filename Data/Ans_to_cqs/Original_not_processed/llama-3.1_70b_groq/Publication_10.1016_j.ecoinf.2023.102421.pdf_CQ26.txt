Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on machine learning models, particularly XGBoost and LightGBM, and their application to a specific problem, rather than discussing data preprocessing techniques.

However, it does mention that 10-fold cross-validation was used during the training process to eliminate bias. This suggests that the authors were aware of the potential for bias in their dataset and took steps to mitigate it, but the specific techniques used for data preprocessing are not discussed.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query. If you have any further questions or would like me to clarify any points, please let me know.
