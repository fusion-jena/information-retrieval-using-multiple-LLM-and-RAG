Answer:

The provided context mentions several metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. These metrics include:

1. Sensitivity (Se): Also known as recall or true positive rate, it measures the proportion of true positives correctly identified by the model.
2. Specificity (Sp): It measures the proportion of true negatives correctly identified by the model.
3. Positive Predictive Value (PPV): It measures the proportion of true positives among all positive predictions made by the model.
4. Negative Predictive Value (NPV): It measures the proportion of true negatives among all negative predictions made by the model.
5. Accuracy (ACC): It measures the overall proportion of correct predictions made by the model.
6. Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC): It measures the correlation between the predicted and actual classes.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the model in different phases, including test, evaluation, and validation. The context also provides detailed confusion matrices and summary results for each phase, which include these metrics.

Note that precision is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, but it can be calculated using the PPV and NPV values. Recall is mentioned as sensitivity (Se).
