Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper or article discussing the use of a pre-trained ResNet-50 convolutional neural network (CNN) for automated cataloging of oyster toadfish calls, but it does not provide any information about the code repository or a link to access the code.
