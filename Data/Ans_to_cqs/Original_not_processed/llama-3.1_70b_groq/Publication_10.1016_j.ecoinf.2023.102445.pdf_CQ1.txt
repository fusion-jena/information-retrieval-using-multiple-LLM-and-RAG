Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the architecture and design of deep learning models, particularly in the field of pest detection and counting, rather than data collection methods.

The context mentions the use of deep learning models such as YOLOv5s, YOLOv7/8, and CSPDarknet53, as well as various techniques for feature extraction and fusion. However, it does not provide information on how the raw data was collected or sourced.

Therefore, I do not know the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, as this information is not provided in the context.
