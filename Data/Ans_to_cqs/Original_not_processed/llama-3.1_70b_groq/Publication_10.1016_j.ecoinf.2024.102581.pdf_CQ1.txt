Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the optimization of hyperparameters for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the performance of various CNN models on specific classification tasks. It does not provide information on data collection methods such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
