Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the Faster R-CNN model, MegaDetector, and its application in wildlife image classification, but it does not delve into the details of the optimization techniques used during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
