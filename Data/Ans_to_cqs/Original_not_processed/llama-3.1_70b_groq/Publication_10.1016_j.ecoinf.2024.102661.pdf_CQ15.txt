Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the TPEBO (Tree of Parzen Estimators Bayesian Optimization) algorithm for hyperparameter optimization in LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. It discusses the TPEBO algorithm's approach to hyperparameter optimization, its benefits, and its application in fine-tuning LSTM models. However, it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
