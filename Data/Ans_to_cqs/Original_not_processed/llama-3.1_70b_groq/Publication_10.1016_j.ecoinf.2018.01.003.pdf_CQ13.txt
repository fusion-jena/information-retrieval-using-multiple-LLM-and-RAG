Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. The text only mentions that deep learning algorithms broke the limitation of traditional neural networks on the number of layers and that the number of network layers was chosen and trained by large-scale data to obtain deeply hidden characteristic information and features. However, it does not provide information on the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
