Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context mainly focuses on the training process, explaining how the model is trained using annotated data and how it can capture statistics and relationships directly from the data. It also mentions the importance of having a large and accurate dataset for training the model, but it does not provide information on how the trained model is deployed.

Therefore, I don't know the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection.
