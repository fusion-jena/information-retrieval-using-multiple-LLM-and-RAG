Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific deep learning model used in a pipeline. It mentions various topics such as land use and land cover classification, hyperspectral remote sensing, and image processing, but it does not provide information about a specific pipeline or deep learning model used in it. Some of the papers mentioned in the context discuss deep learning models, such as Vali et al. (2020) which reviews deep learning for land use and land cover classification, but it does not mention a specific pipeline or model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
