Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model is detection and annotation of plant organs from digitised herbarium scans. The model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, specifically the Detectron2 library in PyTorch framework, to extract image features and detect plant organs. The model is trained to identify and annotate specific parts of the plant, but the exact type of annotation (e.g., classification, segmentation) is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the mention of a Region Proposal Network and non-maximum suppression, it appears that the model is primarily used for object detection, specifically detecting and localizing plant organs within the digitised herbarium scans.
