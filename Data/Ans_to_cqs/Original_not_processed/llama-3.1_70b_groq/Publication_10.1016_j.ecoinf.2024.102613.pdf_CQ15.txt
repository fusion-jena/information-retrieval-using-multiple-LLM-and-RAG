Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of deep learning techniques in various studies, such as Zhang et al. (2024) who used a deep neural network for fish biomass estimation, and Taneja et al. (2020) who used machine learning based fog computing for early lameness detection in dairy cattle.

While the specific optimization techniques used in these studies are not mentioned, it is common in deep learning pipelines to use optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, or other variants of gradient descent. However, without explicit mention in the provided context, I cannot confirm the use of these techniques in the mentioned studies.

Therefore, I can only provide a general answer that deep learning pipelines often employ optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam, but the specific techniques used in the mentioned studies are not specified in the provided context.
