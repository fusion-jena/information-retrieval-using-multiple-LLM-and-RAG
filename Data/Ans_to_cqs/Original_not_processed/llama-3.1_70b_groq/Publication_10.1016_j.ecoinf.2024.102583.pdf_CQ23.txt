Answer: The provided context does not specifically mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, it does mention that heterogeneous ensemble techniques were used to optimize the performance of five base learners and mitigate potential overfitting. This suggests that the authors may have taken steps to address issues related to model generalizability, but the specific measures used are not explicitly stated.

The context does mention the use of various machine learning models, including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), but it does not provide information on how these models were trained or validated.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of a research workflow (Fig. 2), but the details of this workflow are not provided. It is possible that the workflow includes steps related to model validation and generalizability, but this cannot be confirmed based on the provided information.

Therefore, while the context suggests that the authors may have taken steps to address model generalizability, the specific measures used are not explicitly stated.
