Answer: The provided context does not specifically mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. However, it does mention the validation metrics used in the context of the PLUS model, which include the Pearson correlation coefficient (R), RMSE, and MAPE. These metrics are used to evaluate the correlation between predicted and actual values, and to assess the credibility of predicted values.

Additionally, the context mentions that the Pearson correlation coefficient is used to evaluate the correlation between predicted and actual values, with a higher value indicating a stronger correlation. RMSE and MAPE are used to assess the accuracy of predictions, with specific ranges indicating high, good, acceptable, and low accuracy.

It is worth noting that the context does not specifically mention accuracy, precision, and recall as metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. However, the mentioned metrics (Pearson correlation coefficient, RMSE, and MAPE) can be used to evaluate the performance of a model in terms of its ability to make accurate predictions.
