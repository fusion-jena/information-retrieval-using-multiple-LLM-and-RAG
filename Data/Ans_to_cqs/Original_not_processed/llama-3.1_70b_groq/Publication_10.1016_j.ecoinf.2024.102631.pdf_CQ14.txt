Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context appears to be focused on presenting the results of the model's performance on various datasets, using metrics such as UIQM, UCIQE, and NIQE. It does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process, such as whether grid search, random search, or other methods were used. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
