Answer:::
The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the proposed models were based on the most typical type of neural network, using pixel-wise inputs due to the characteristics of the data used in this study. This suggests that the data format is likely image-based, as pixel-wise inputs are typically used for image data.
