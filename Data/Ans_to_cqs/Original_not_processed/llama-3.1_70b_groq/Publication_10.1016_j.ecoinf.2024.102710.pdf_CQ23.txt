Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the model was trained on a diverse dataset, as the context mentions the use of transfer learning models (BirdNet-1) and the evaluation of the model on focal and citizen-science datasets.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of UMAP plots to visualize the embedding space of the model, which suggests that the authors may have explored the structure of the data to ensure that the model is generalizing well. However, there is no explicit mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of a batch size of 20 samples and the selection of 5% of the samples at random, which may be related to the evaluation of the model, but it is not clear if this is related to ensuring generalizability.

Overall, while the context provides some hints about the diversity of the dataset and the evaluation of the model, it does not provide a clear answer to the question of what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
