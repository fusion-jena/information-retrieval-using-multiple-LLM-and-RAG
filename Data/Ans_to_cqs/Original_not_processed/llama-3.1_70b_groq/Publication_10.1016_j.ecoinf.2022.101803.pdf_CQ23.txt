Answer:::
To ensure the generalizability of the model, specifically the XGBoost model, a nested k-fold cross-validation scheme was employed. The dataset was split into three subsets: the tuning set (k-2 folds), validation set (1-fold), and test set (1-fold). This approach allowed for the evaluation of the model's performance on unseen data and helped to prevent over-fitting. 

The use of k-fold cross-validation enabled the model to be trained and validated on multiple subsets of the data, which helped to increase the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data. The performance of the model was evaluated on the validation set by calculating the out-of-sample prediction accuracy, and the median of k-1 folds was taken. This process was repeated for each choice of the number of iterations, as outlined in Algorithm 1. 

While the text does not explicitly mention the use of a diverse dataset or stratified splitting, the employment of a nested k-fold cross-validation scheme suggests that the model's performance was evaluated on multiple subsets of the data, which can help to ensure generalizability. However, without further information, it is unclear whether the dataset was diverse or whether stratified splitting was used.
