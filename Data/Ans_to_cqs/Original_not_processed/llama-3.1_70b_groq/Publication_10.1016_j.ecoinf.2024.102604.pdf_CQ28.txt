Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a deep learning model or the platform used for deployment. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, species distribution models, and environmental covariates, but it does not provide information about the deployment of a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
