Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate and optimizer. The context only mentions that an automated deep learning convolutional neural network algorithm was applied for soil salinity distribution mapping, but it does not provide any information about the specific hyperparameters used in the model.
