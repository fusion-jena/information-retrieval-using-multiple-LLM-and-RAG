Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Flipping, Rotating, or Scaling. However, it does mention "Random Erasing" as a data augmentation technique in the paper by Zhong et al. (2020). 

Random Erasing is a data augmentation technique that randomly erases a rectangular region of an image, which can help improve the robustness of the model to occlusions and other forms of noise. 

It is worth noting that the context primarily focuses on transformer-like and MLP-like models, their architectures, and their applications in computer vision, rather than data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
