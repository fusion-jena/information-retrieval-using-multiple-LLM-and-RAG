Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on comparing the performance of different regression models, including their training and prediction times, variance, R2 scores, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). It does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
