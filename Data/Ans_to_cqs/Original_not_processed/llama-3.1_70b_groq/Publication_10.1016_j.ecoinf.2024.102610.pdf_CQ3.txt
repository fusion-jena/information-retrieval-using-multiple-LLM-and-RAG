Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on machine learning and deep learning approaches for predicting infectious diseases, tick distribution, and climate-related topics. It mentions feature elimination techniques like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) but does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the provided context.
