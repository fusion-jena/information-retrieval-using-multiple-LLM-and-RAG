Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only discusses the data collection and curation phases, the generation of ground-truth data, and the challenges of the dataset, but it does not provide information on the deployment of the model.

The context mentions the training step and the test split, but it does not elaborate on how the trained model was deployed. It also references several research papers, but it does not provide information on the deployment process.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
