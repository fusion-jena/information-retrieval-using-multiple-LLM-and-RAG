Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only discusses the preprocessing of the bird song data, the creation of the metadata .csv file, and the training of the CNN and k-NN models. It also mentions the ability to retrain the network using human-classified data, but it does not provide information on how the trained model is deployed. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
