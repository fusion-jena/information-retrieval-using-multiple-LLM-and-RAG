Answer:
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model, specifically a feedforward neural network with no intermediate layers (i.e., a simple neural network with an input layer followed by an output layer). The model uses the ReLU activation function and the Adam optimizer. There is no indication of the use of CNN, RNN, or Transformer models in the provided context.
