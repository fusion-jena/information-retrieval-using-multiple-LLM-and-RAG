Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context appears to be a collection of references and snippets of text related to bat calls detection and classification, statistical modeling, and software development. 

However, it can be inferred that the study may have used a diverse dataset, as it mentions "including all observations in statistical modeling, rather than excluding observations." This suggests that the study may have attempted to use a comprehensive dataset to train and test the model.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of Bayesian algorithms, which can be used for cross-validation and model evaluation. However, it is not explicitly stated whether cross-validation was used to evaluate the model's performance.

There is no mention of stratified splitting in the provided context.

Overall, while some measures may have been taken to ensure the generalizability of the model, the specific details are not provided in the context.
