Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context appears to be focused on species distribution modeling, ecological informatics, and conservation biology, with discussions on topics like MaxEnt, ensemble models, and niche analysis. It does not touch on deep learning or machine learning pipelines.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
