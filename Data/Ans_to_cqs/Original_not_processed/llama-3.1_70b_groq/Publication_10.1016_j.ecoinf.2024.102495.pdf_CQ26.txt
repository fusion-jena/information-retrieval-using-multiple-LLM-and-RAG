Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the use of deep learning algorithms, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for voice feature extraction and classification. It discusses the automatic feature extraction process, the use of spectrograms, and the optimization of model parameters.

However, it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection. These techniques are commonly used in machine learning pipelines to handle imbalanced datasets and ensure that the model is trained on a representative sample of the data.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query based on the provided context.
