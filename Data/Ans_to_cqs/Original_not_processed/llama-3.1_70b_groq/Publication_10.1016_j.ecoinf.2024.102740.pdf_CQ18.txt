Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the "out-of-bag" (OOB) samples. According to the text, the Random Forest (RF) generates an impartial internal estimate of the generalization error by the "out-of-bag" (OOB) samples, which are those not included in the training subset. In this case, the total number of samples used for validation is 8.
