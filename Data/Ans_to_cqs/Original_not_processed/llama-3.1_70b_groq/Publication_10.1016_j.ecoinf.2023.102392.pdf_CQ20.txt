Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. The context appears to be focused on the results of the model, including accuracy metrics and spatial distribution of forest types, as well as the processing of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data. However, it does not provide information on the computational resources used for training the model.
