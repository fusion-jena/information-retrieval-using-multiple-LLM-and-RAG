Answer: 
The hyperparameters of the model are not fine-tuned on any data set. Instead, preselected values are used due to computational reasons. However, it is suggested that in practice, on real data, it is possible to fine-tune all the hyperparameters using a validation set. This can be done by randomly selecting a subset of the reference species as the validation set, using these as testing data to tune the parameters for the given data set, and then training one last time with all the data with the fine-tuned parameters.
