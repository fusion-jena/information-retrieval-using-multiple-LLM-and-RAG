Answer:::

The optimization technique applied in the deep learning pipeline is the Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2015). This is mentioned in the context as being used during the training of both the Autoencoder model and the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for classification of fish events. Additionally, a scheduler is used to adjust the learning rate when the network reaches a plateau, which helps to improve the convergence of the model. There is no mention of other optimization techniques such as SGD being used in the pipeline.
