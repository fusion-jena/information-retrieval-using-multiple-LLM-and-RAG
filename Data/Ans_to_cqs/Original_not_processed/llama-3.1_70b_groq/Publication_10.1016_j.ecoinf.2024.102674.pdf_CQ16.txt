Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be focused on the performance metrics used to evaluate the models (e.g., pbias, MAE, RMSE) and the hyperparameters used for the different machine learning algorithms (e.g., RFs, GBMs, ANNs). It does not provide information on the stopping criteria used during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
