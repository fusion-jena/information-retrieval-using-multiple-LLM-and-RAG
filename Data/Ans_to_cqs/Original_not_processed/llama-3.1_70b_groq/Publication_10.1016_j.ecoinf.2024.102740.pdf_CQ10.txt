Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. The context appears to be related to remote sensing, geographic information systems, and machine learning, but it does not provide any information about a specific deep learning pipeline or its code repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other code repository.
