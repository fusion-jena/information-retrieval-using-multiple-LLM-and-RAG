Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is object detection, specifically bird detection in camera trap images. The researchers employed 8 deep learning algorithms to detect wild birds in images acquired by camera traps in China's Northeast Tiger and Leopard National Park. The goal is to evaluate the performance of these models in detecting birds and to explore the potential of deep learning-based approaches for efficient wildlife monitoring.
