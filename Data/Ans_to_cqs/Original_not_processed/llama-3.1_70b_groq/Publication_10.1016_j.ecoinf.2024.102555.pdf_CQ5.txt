Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to research papers on topics such as flood susceptibility mapping, dry-wet variations in the LÃ¼liang Mountains, and burned area mapping accuracy. The datasets mentioned in the context are NDVI data from AVHRR sensors and MODIS daily burned area data, but these are not typically used in deep learning pipelines for image classification tasks.
