Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. It mentions that the backend neural network classifier uses pre-trained weights from image classification, but it does not specify which dataset was used for pre-training (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet). The context also mentions that the experiment is related to bird species recognition and bioacoustics analysis, but it does not provide information about the specific datasets used.
