Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the context is object detection, specifically target detection and tracking in a scene with high dynamic density and low training data. The model used is YOLOv7, which is a real-time object detection model that aims to balance accuracy and speed. The model is designed to detect and track target objects in a scene, and it is mentioned that it is used for tasks such as estimating the population size of migrating animals using unmanned aerial vehicles.
