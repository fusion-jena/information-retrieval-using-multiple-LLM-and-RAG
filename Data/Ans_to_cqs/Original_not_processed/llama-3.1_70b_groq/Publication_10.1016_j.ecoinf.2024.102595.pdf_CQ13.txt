Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. It only mentions that hyperparameter tuning was performed via GridSearchCV with cross-validation for both deep learning algorithms (e.g., Deep Neural Networks) and traditional machine learning approaches.

However, it does mention some hyperparameters that were tuned for traditional machine learning models, such as 'max_depth' in tree-based models and 'learning_rate' in boosting models. Additionally, it mentions that the number of estimators or iterations was also a crucial parameter for model optimization.

But for deep learning models specifically, the context does not provide information on the hyperparameters used.
