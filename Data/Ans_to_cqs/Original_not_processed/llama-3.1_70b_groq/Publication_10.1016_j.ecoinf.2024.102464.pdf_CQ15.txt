Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on species distribution modeling using machine learning techniques, and it discusses the use of various models such as Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Random Forest (RF), and Classification and Regression Tree (CART). However, it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
