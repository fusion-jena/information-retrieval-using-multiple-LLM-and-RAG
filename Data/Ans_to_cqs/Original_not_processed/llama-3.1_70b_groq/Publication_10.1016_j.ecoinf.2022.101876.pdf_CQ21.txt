Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context appears to be a snippet from a research paper, specifically a table (Table A2) that presents performance measures for a MegaDetector model at different detection thresholds. The table includes metrics such as True Negative Rate (TNR), False Positive Rate (FPR), False Negative Rate (FNR), Positive Predictive Value (PPV), and Negative Predictive Value (NPV).

However, it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as the creation of saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
