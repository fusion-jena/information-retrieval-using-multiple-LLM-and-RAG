Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be related to environmental and ecological studies, and it discusses various topics such as soil erosion, drought, and lake salinity. It also mentions the use of machine learning algorithms and signal processing techniques, but it does not provide information on data splitting criteria for deep learning model training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
