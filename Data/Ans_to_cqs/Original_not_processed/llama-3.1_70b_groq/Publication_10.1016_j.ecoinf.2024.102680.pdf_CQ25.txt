Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is object detection. The text mentions that the model is used for "underwater object detection" and that the backbone of the network is designed to "extract the feature information of objects from images". Additionally, the text discusses the use of a new module called LKSP to replace the SPPF module in the original YOLOv8 network, which is a real-time object detection system. The goal of the model is to improve the accuracy of object detection in underwater optical images, which have limited visibility due to complex imaging environments.
