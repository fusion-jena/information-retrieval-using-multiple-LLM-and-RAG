Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context appears to focus on the evaluation metrics, model selection, and feature importance for a species distribution modeling task, but it does not provide information on the preprocessing steps. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
