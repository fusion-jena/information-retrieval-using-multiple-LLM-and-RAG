Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. It discusses the development of deep learning methodologies, the application of EfficientNet-B7, and the creation of two novel deep learning networks using semi-supervised contrastive learning and weakly-supervised learning. However, it does not provide information on the specific hyperparameters used in these models.
