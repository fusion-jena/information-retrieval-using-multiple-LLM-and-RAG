Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context only provides information on the architectures of the deep learning models used (e.g., DeepConvLSTM, CNN) and the performance of these models, but does not delve into the specific hyperparameters used.

However, the context does provide information on the hyperparameters used in the classical machine learning models (Table 3), such as the number of rounds, maximum depth, and learning rate (Eta) for the xgbTree and RF models, but this is not relevant to the deep learning models.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query regarding the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
