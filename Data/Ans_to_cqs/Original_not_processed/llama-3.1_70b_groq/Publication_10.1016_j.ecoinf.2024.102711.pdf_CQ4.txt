Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Flipping, Rotating, or Scaling. The context primarily focuses on Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), with a detailed explanation of AutoGluon, an open-source AutoML library. It discusses the library's approach to automating feature engineering, data pre-processing, model training, and ensembling, but does not delve into data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
