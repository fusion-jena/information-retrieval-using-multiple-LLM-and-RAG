Answer:::

The text does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the models were trained and validated on the TLm dataset, which suggests that some form of data splitting was used. Additionally, the text mentions that the dataset is "more comprehensive" and has a "lower image resolution" compared to another study, which may imply that the dataset is diverse. However, there is no explicit mention of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or other techniques to ensure generalizability.

It is also worth noting that the text mentions the use of dropout regularization during training, which can help prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data. However, this is not a direct measure to ensure generalizability.

Overall, while the text provides some hints about the dataset and training process, it does not provide a clear answer to the question about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
