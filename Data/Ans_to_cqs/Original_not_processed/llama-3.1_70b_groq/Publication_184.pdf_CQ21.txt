Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the training process, data augmentation, and hyperparameters used for the Yolo model. It also discusses the performance of the model during training, including the loss and average loss, but does not provide information on postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.
