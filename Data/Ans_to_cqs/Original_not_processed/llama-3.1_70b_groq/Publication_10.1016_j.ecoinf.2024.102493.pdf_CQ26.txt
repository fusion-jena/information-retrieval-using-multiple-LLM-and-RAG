Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, specifically discussing the Q value, factor detector, and PLS-SEM, which are not directly related to deep learning pipelines or data bias preprocessing techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
