Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. It only mentions that Jamali et al. (2023) used a variety of machine learning algorithms, including deep neural networks, to estimate leaf parameters, but it does not provide information on the frameworks used.
