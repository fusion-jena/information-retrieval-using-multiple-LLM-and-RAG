Answer:::
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the dataset was divided into training (60%), validation (20%), and testing (20%) subsets for model evaluation and hyperparameter search. This approach was chosen to obtain an unbiased estimation of error. Data augmentation was only applied to the training data to avoid overlapping the same data in different partitions.

Additionally, the model's performance was evaluated using the coefficients of determination (R2) and the root mean squared error (RMSE) metric. The R2 measures the percentage of variation in the response variable explained by the model, while the RMSE measures the difference between the actual and predicted values.

The model's generalization was also assessed by comparing its performance on the training, validation, and testing datasets. This was done to avoid overfitting and to ensure that the model was not biased towards the training data.

However, it is worth noting that cross-validation was not used in this study due to the high computational costs associated with deep learning-based models. Instead, a simple data partitioning strategy was employed, which may overlook the diversity of heterogeneous spatial information in remotely sensed data.

Overall, while several measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model, there is still a risk that the model may not generalize well to new sites or areas with unique spatial variability.
