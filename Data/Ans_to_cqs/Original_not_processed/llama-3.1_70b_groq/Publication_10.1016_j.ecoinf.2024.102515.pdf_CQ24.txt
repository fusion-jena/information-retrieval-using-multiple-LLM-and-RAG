Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention anything about deep learning pipelines or strategies for handling randomness in such pipelines. The context appears to be related to a project that uses Twitter API to search for tweets containing observations of biodiversity, and discusses the methodology used to filter and process the tweets. There is no mention of deep learning or randomness in the context.
