Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to remote sensing and land use/land cover (LULC) classification, with discussions on spectral indices, vegetation indices, and classification methodologies. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline.
