Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be related to a study on marine organism acoustics and functional data analysis, and it includes various tables of results, references, and citations. However, it does not provide information on the specific training process or the criteria used to determine its completion. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
