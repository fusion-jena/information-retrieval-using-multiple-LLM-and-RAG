Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the model is a "self-supervised (red, green, blue (RGB) deep learning model." This suggests that the model is likely a type of convolutional neural network (CNN) that is designed to process RGB images, but the specific architecture is not specified.
