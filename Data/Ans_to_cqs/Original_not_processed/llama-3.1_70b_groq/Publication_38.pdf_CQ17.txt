Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the performance of deep learning networks, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), in acoustic signal classification tasks, such as bat call detection and environmental sound classification. It highlights the advantages of CNNs over other supervised learning methods and commercial systems but does not delve into the specifics of the regularization techniques employed.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the creation of a smaller CNN model, referred to as CNNFAST, which includes fewer model weights and can be run in a fully convolutional manner. This could be interpreted as a form of regularization, as reducing the number of model weights can help prevent overfitting. Nevertheless, this is not explicitly stated as a regularization method, and other common techniques like dropout and L2 regularization are not mentioned.

In summary, the provided context does not provide information on the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
