Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. Specifically, it is used for automated species identification of Triatominae, also known as triatomine bugs, which are vectors of Chagas disease. The model is trained on digital images of Mexican and Brazilian triatomine species to classify and identify the species. The goal is to improve the accuracy of species identification, which is crucial for public health efforts to control the spread of Chagas disease.
