Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention "MLOps - model maintenance in the production environment" in section 4.4, which suggests that the model was deployed in a production environment, but the specifics of the deployment process are not provided.

It is mentioned that MLOps encompasses automation and monitoring steps such as continuous integration, deployment, and training on data collected in production, but it does not provide details on how the model was serialized or which platform was selected for deployment.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this query.
