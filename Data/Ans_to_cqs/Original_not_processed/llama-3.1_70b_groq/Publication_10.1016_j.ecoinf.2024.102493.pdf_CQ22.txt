Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a research study on spatial variability of kNDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) and the use of an Optimal Parameter-based Geographical Detector (OPGD) to identify driver factors. The metrics mentioned in the context, such as Q value, slope, and significance level (P value), are related to the OPGD analysis, but not to the evaluation of a deep learning model.
