Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any deep learning pipeline or optimization techniques such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be focused on a study that analyzed a multifrequency acoustics dataset using functional data analysis (FDA) and spatial-functional data analysis, but it does not mention deep learning or any related optimization techniques.
