Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as the proportions for train, test, and validation sets. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the proposed CNN-LSTM model, its performance, and the experimental setup, but it does not provide information on data splitting. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
