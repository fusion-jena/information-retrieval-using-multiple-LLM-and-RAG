Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline is Dropout. The Dropout layer is integrated into the network to mitigate overfitting. 

Additionally, the context mentions the use of Focal Loss, which is a technique designed to mitigate imbalance problems in object detection networks by assigning higher weights to samples that are challenging or prone to misclassification. However, Focal Loss is not a traditional regularization method like Dropout or L2 regularization, but rather a loss function that helps to address class imbalance issues.

There is no mention of L2 regularization in the provided context. Therefore, the answer to the query is that Dropout is the regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, and Focal Loss is used to address class imbalance issues.
