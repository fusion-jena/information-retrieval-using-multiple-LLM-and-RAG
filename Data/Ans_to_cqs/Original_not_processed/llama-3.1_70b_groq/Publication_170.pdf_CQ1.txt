Answer:::

Based on the provided context, one method utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is camera traps. Camera traps are widely used in wildlife surveys because they are non-invasive, low-cost, and highly efficient. They are deployed in the wild and can produce large datasets of images. The context mentions specific examples of camera-trap image datasets, such as the Colombian llanos camera-trap image dataset and a mountainous ecological monitoring system in Northwest China.

Additionally, the context mentions that camera traps can produce a large number of empty images, which can make manual classification difficult. However, it does not provide information on other methods for collecting raw data, such as surveys or public datasets.

It is worth noting that the context does mention the use of the ImageNet dataset in the paper "ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks" by Krizhevsky et al. (2012), but it does not provide information on how the data was collected for this dataset.
