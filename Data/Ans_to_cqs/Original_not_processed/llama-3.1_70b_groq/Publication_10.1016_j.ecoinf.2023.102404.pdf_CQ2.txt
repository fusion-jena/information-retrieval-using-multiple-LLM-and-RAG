Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the references to remote sensing and geospatial applications, it can be inferred that the data formats used are likely to be related to image and spatial data.

Some of the papers mentioned in the context, such as those by Tamiminia et al. (2021) and Leite et al. (2022), use data from satellite and airborne sensors, such as Landsat, Sentinel-2, and GEDI Spaceborne LiDAR. These data sources typically provide image data in formats such as GeoTIFF, JPEG, or other raster formats.

Additionally, some papers, such as those by Ma et al. (2019) and Li et al. (2013), mention the use of machine learning and deep learning techniques for image classification and change analysis. In these cases, the data formats used are likely to be image formats such as JPEG, PNG, or TIFF.

However, it is also possible that other data formats, such as CSV or other tabular formats, may be used in the deep learning pipeline, particularly if the research involves integrating data from multiple sources or performing data fusion.

Overall, while the exact data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly stated in the provided context, it is likely that image formats such as GeoTIFF, JPEG, and TIFF are used, along with possible use of CSV or other tabular formats for data integration and fusion.
