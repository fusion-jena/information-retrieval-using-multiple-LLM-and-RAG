Answer: Unfortunately, the provided text does not mention the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. It only mentions that a grid search was performed to optimize the number of trees in the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, but it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used for the deep learning model (YAMNet).
