Answer:::
The deep learning pipeline uses audio data formats. According to the provided context, the acquired audio files are transmitted over 4G using SMTP and then segmented into 15-second windows for feature extraction using Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC). 

Additionally, the context mentions the use of visual data in Figure 12, "Bird Classification Using Visual Data", which suggests that image data formats may also be used in the pipeline, possibly in conjunction with audio data for a more holistic analysis of the habitat. However, the primary focus of the pipeline appears to be on audio data.
