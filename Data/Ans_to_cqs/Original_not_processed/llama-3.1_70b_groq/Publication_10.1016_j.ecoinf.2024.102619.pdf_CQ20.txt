Answer:

According to the provided context, the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model are:

* NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) with 8GB VRAM
* Intel Core i7â€“9700 CPU

It is mentioned that the CNN training required, on average, 387.09 minutes more when using a GPU, and that training each CNN with only a CPU was still faster than training each CNN with a GPU. This suggests that both GPU and CPU were used for training the model, but the GPU was used for the more computationally intensive tasks.
