Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily discusses the training process, including the optimizer used (SGD), the learning rate, batch normalization, and the hardware used (Nvidia Tesla K80 or P100 GPUs). It also provides information about the models used, their architectures, and their performance metrics. However, it does not provide any information about model serialization, platform selection, or the deployment process.
