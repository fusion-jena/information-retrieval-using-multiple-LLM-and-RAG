Answer:::
Answer: TensorFlow. According to the provided context, the reference list includes a paper titled "TensorFlow: A system for large-scale machine learning" by Abadi et al. (2016), which suggests that TensorFlow is used to build the deep learning model. Additionally, the text mentions "training the fine-tuned neural network" and "feature extraction of the fixed inception layers", which are consistent with TensorFlow's capabilities. There is no mention of PyTorch or any other deep learning frameworks in the provided context.
