Answer:::
 
The provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline of Pl@ntNet. However, it does mention that the CNN architecture used is the inception model extended with batch normalization. Batch normalization is a technique used to normalize the input data for each layer, which can help improve the stability and speed of training. 

While batch normalization is mentioned, the specific optimization algorithm used (e.g., SGD, Adam) is not mentioned in the provided context.
