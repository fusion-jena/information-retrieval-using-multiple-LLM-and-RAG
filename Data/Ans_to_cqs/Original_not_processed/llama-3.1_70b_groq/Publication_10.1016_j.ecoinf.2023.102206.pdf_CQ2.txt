Answer:::
The provided context mentions various data formats used in different applications, including:

* Acoustic data: used to identify oestrus and non-oestrus sounds of sows
* EEG signals: used for driver drowsiness estimation
* Image data: mentioned in the context of texture image segmentation and Brodatz texture dataset
* Audio data: mentioned in the context of marine mammal sounds detection and classification
* CSV data: not explicitly mentioned, but mentioned in the context of datasets such as housing dataset and synthetic dataset

It can be inferred that the deep learning pipeline may use various data formats including audio, image, and possibly CSV data. However, the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
