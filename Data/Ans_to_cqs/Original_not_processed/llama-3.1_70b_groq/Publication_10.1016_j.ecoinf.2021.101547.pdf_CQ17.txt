Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the importance of selecting an optimal mini-batch size to prevent overfitting, but it does not provide information on other regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization.

However, it does mention that too large a mini-batch size may cause the network to overfit to the training images, implying that the authors are aware of the issue of overfitting and are taking steps to mitigate it. Additionally, the text mentions that the network updates its internal parameters based on the loss scores of the images in the mini-batch, which could potentially be related to regularization methods.

Unfortunately, without more information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query.
