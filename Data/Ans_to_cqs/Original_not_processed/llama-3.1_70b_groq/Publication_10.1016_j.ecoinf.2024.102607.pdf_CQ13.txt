Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. The context primarily discusses land use and land cover (LULC) mapping, sampling techniques, and machine learning algorithms, including random forests, support vector machines, and artificial neural networks. However, it does not provide specific information about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model.
