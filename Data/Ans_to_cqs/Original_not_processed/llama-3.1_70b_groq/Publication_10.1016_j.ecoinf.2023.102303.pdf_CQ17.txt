Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the application of deep learning methodologies to underwater fish video processing, the use of weak supervision and transfer learning, and the development of novel deep learning networks. However, it does not provide information on the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
