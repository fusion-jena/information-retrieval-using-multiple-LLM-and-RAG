Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be focused on the process of building a classification model for species distribution modeling, including feature selection and model training using different methods like Random Forest, SMO, Multilayer Perceptron, and Na√Øve Bayes. However, it does not provide information on the specific stopping criteria used for training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
