Answer:::
The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, it is a variant of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model, called YOLO_MRC, which is designed for object detection tasks. The model uses a backbone network called CSPDarknet53, which is a type of CNN architecture. The pipeline also employs various modules such as the SPPF (Spatial Pyramid Pooling Fusion) module, the C2f module, and the C2flite module, which are all part of the CNN architecture. There is no mention of RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) or Transformer models in the provided context.
