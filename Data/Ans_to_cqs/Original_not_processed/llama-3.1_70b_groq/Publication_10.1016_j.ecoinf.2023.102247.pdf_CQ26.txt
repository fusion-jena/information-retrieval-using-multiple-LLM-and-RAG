Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deep learning pipelines, data bias, or preprocessing techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling, climate scenarios, and ensemble modeling using R and the BIOMOD2 package. It discusses the use of cross-validation, Area Under the Receiving Operator Characteristics Curve (AUC), and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) for predicting climate change, but does not touch on deep learning or data preprocessing techniques.
