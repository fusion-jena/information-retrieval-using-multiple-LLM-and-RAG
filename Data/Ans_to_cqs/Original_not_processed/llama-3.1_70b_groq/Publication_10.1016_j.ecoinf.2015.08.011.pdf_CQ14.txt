Answer: The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a trial-and-error method. Specifically, the number of nodes in the hidden layer was varied between 5 and 23, and the learning rate was varied from 0.01 to 1.0 in increments of 0.05. For each configuration, the mean square error (MSE) between the model output and the measured data was calculated, and the optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer and the optimal learning rate were selected based on the maximum model performance as indicated by MSE. This approach is mentioned in the text as being known to be the best method to determine the appropriate number of neurons and learning rate (Shamseldin, 1997; Hill and Minsker, 2010).
