Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context only discusses the configuration of parameters for Random Forest (RF) training and the architecture of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), specifically a multilayer perceptron (MLP). It does not provide information on preprocessing steps. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
