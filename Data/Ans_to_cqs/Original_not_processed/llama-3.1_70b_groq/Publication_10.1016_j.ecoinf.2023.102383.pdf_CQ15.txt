Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of object detection models, feature map construction, and the use of Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN) to improve detection performance. It does not delve into the optimization techniques used for training the models.

Therefore, I don't know the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, as this information is not provided in the given context.
