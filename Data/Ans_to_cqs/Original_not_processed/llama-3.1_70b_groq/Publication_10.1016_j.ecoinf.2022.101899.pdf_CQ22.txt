Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The context discusses the use of deep learning for wildfire event predictions in Australia, the calculation of NDVI scores, and the analysis of model uncertainty using Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA). However, it does not provide information on the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the deep learning model, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or others. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
