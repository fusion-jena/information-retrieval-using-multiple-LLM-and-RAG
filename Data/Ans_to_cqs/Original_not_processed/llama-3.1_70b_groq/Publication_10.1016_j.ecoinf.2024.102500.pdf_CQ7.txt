Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be focused on hyperparameter tuning for machine learning models, such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and LightGBM, using techniques like grid search and cross-validation.

However, it does mention that the dataset is split into five equal-sized folds using fivefold cross-validation, which is a common technique used in machine learning to evaluate the performance of a model. But it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to split the data into training, testing, and validation sets.

Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training based on the provided context.
