Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything related to training, validation loss, or plateau. The context appears to be about land use and land cover changes, with data on forest area, grassland area, cropland area, and orchard area over different time periods. There is no mention of any criteria used to determine when training is complete.
