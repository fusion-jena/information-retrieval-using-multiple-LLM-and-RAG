Answer:::

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in the provided context are accuracy and classification rate. The accuracy of the model is measured by its correct classification rate, which is the proportion of correctly classified fish thumbnails out of the total number of thumbnails. The correct classification rate achieved by the best model is 94.9% with a standard deviation of 3.3%. The accuracy of the model is also compared to that of human classifiers, who achieved a mean correct classification rate of 89.3% with a standard deviation of 6%. 

Additionally, the performance of the model is also evaluated by its ability to correctly classify different species of fish. The correct classification rate by the best model ranged from 88.2% (Abudefduf sparoides) to 98.2% (Abudefduf vaigiensis). 

It is worth noting that precision and recall are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context as metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model.
