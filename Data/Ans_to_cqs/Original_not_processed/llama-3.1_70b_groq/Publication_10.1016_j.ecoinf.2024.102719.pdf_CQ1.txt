Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on machine learning and deep learning models, ensemble methods, and their applications to ecological data, particularly in the context of river and stream ecosystem health assessment.

However, it can be inferred that the data collection methods might involve sensors, as mentioned in the context of river quality assessment (Schuwirth et al., 2023). Additionally, public datasets might be used, as suggested by the mention of machine learning algorithms and their applications to ecological data (Crisci et al., 2012).

Surveys are not explicitly mentioned as a data collection method in the provided context. However, it is possible that surveys could be used to collect data on ecosystem health or other related factors.

In summary, while the context does not provide a comprehensive answer to the question, it suggests that sensors and public datasets might be used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Surveys might also be a possible method, but this is not explicitly mentioned in the context.
