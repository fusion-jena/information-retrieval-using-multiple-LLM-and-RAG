Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It mentions that there is still work to be done on a quick automated procedure for tuning optimization hyper-parameters, especially the initial learning rate, but it does not specify the method used for hyperparameter optimization. It does mention that the optimization method for NN parameters Î¸ is based on stochastic gradient descent algorithms, but this refers to the optimization of the model parameters, not the hyperparameters.
