Answer:

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are A30 and MSA30. 

A30 measures the percentage of test observations for which the correct label is returned among the first 30 species. In other words, it measures how often the model returns the correct species within its top 30 predictions. According to the text, the model achieves an A30 of 0.87, meaning that it returns the correct species among its top 30 predictions 87% of the time.

MSA30, on the other hand, is a macro-average metric that measures the performance of the model across all classes (species). It calculates the success rate for each class individually and then averages them together. This metric is suitable for highly imbalanced datasets, where some species may be much rarer than others. The model achieves an MSA30 of 0.48, indicating that the correct label is within the first 30 classes returned almost half the time.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the model in predicting species assemblages, which is the task of returning a set of likely species for a given input. The model is trained on presence-only data and is optimized using a cross-entropy loss function.
