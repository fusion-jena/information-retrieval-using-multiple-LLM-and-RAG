Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The text only discusses the training efficiency gain, model training on specific hardware, and the data used for the EarthNet2021 Challenge. It does not provide information on the postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training based on the provided context.
