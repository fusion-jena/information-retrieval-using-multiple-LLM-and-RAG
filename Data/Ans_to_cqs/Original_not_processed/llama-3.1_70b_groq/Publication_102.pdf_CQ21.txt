Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, it does mention the evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance, such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). These metrics are calculated and compared for different models (Model-1, Model-2, and Model-K) on the test data set.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model's performance is visualized using a plot of actual vs. predicted number of animals (Figure 4), which can be considered a form of visualization or analysis of the model's output. However, there is no mention of saliency maps or confusion matrices.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the only postprocessing steps that can be confirmed are the calculation of evaluation metrics (RMSE and MAE) and the visualization of the model's performance using a plot of actual vs. predicted values.
