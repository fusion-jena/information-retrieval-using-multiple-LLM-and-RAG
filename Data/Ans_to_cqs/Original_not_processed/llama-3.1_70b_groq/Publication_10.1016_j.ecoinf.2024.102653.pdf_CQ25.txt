Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. The text mentions that the model is used to classify animal behavior, specifically to analyze and classify flight activity recordings. It also mentions that the model is trained to evaluate the number of recordings necessary to yield satisfactory classification metrics, such as accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, and Cohen Kappa. Additionally, the text mentions that the model is used to classify fruit fly pupae as parasitized or healthy, and to recognize insect pest species. Overall, the model is used for classification tasks, specifically in the context of animal behavior and entomology.
