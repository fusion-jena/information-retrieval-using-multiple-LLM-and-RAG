Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the integration of deep learning-based submodels into process-based modeling frameworks, the training phase of a DNN, and the importance of network architecture in determining prediction accuracy.

However, it does mention that the available data is frequently split into a training data set and a test data set to gauge the accuracy of predictions for new input data. This suggests that some form of evaluation or metrics calculation may be involved in the postprocessing steps, but the specific details are not provided.

The context also mentions that more information on deep learning is available in other sources, such as Angermueller et al. (2016), LeCun et al. (2015), and Nielsen (2015), which may provide more information on postprocessing steps. However, based on the provided context alone, the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, and Confusion matrix, are not mentioned.
