Answer: The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics, including:

1. Accuracy
2. Precision
3. Recall
4. F1-Score
5. Area Under the Curve (AUC) Score

These metrics are used to assess the model's ability to classify mosquitoes into different categories. The model's performance is also evaluated using a confusion matrix and model training time for both binary and multiclass classifications.
