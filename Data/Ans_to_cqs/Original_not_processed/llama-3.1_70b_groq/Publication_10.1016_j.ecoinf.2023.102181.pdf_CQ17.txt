Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to focus on machine learning models, specifically bagging and random forests, and their application to environmental data. It discusses the challenges of dealing with clustered data and the potential benefits of using covariance-weighted bagging to reduce bias. However, it does not delve into deep learning or regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
