Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of deep learning methods, including convolutional neural networks (CNN), autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks (GAN), but it does not specify the optimization techniques applied.

However, it does mention "backpropagation" in the context of training a GAN model, which is a common optimization technique used in deep learning. Backpropagation is an algorithm used to update the model parameters by minimizing the loss function. But it does not provide information on specific optimization algorithms like SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam.

Therefore, I can only confirm that backpropagation is used in the context of GAN, but I do not know the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
