Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention a specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context appears to be focused on a workflow that combines vessel tracking data with environmental, biodiversity, and fishery data to estimate fishing pressure on stocks and other species. It discusses the importance of data quality, completeness, and spatial resolution, but does not provide information on model training or performance monitoring. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
