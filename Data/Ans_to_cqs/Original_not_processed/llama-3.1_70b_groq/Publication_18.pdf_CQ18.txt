Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention the use of accuracy as an indicator to assess the performance of the model, as shown in Table 3. This suggests that accuracy might be used as a metric to monitor the model's performance, but the specific strategy or method used to do so is not provided.
