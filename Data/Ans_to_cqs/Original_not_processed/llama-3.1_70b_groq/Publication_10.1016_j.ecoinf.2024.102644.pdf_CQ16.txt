Answer: I don't know. The provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be discussing the use of MaxEnt for species presence prediction, including the omission rate of training presence locations and the determination of an optimal decision threshold for dichotomic classification. However, it does not provide information on the training process or the criteria used to determine its completion.
