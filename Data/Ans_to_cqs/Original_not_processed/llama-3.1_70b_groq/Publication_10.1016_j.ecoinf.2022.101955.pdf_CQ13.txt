Answer:::
The provided context does not specifically mention a deep learning model, but it does discuss an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model, which is a type of machine learning model. According to the text, the ANN model used is a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) type, and it uses a backpropagation learning algorithm during the training phase.

The hyperparameters mentioned for the MLP ANN model are:

* Size: used to define the primary model tuning parameters
* Decay: used to define the primary model tuning parameters, and to counter the effects of model overfitting
* Number of neurons in the hidden layer: 6 neurons were defined for the model inputs
* Number of neurons in the input layer: equal to the number of used bands (6)
* Number of neurons in the output layer: 8 neurons (representing 8 LULC classes)

There is no mention of a learning rate or optimizer in the provided context.
