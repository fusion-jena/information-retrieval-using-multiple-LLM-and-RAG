Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention data-augmentation, which is a technique used to artificially increase the volume of the training dataset by applying specific transformations to the training images. These transformations simulate the deformations that data could suffer in real-world scenarios, such as scaling, rotations, translations, different illumination conditions, and cropping parts of the image.

Additionally, the context mentions that data-augmentation increases the robustness and generalization capacity of CNNs, but it does not provide information on other preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I can only confirm that data-augmentation is a preprocessing technique used in deep learning, but I do not have information on other preprocessing steps.
