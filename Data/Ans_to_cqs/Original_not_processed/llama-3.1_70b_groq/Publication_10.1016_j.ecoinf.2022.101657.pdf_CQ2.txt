Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the pipeline primarily deals with video data, as it is mentioned that the GBIF database contains over 2300 videos of animals, and the pipeline is expected to receive input from static cameras. Additionally, the context mentions the use of video encoding standards such as H.264 and the extraction of motion vectors from the video stream.

It is also mentioned that every frame from each video has been manually annotated, indicating whether or not it contains an animal. This suggests that the pipeline may also involve image data, as frames from videos are essentially images.

There is no mention of audio or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline. Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the pipeline likely involves video and image data formats.
