Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning models, such as XGBoost, LSTM-CNN, and ERNIE, in various fields like built environment research, sentiment analysis, and urban vitality. It also mentions the use of SHAP value analysis for interpretable results, but it does not discuss data preprocessing techniques for addressing data bias.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions the use of multi-source data and crowdsourcing, which could potentially help in collecting diverse data and reducing bias. Nevertheless, specific techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
