Answer: The provided context does not explicitly state the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention that the best-performing model based on the validation loss was saved and used as the Faster R-CNN model. This suggests that the validation loss is being monitored during training, and the model with the lowest validation loss is selected. It can be inferred that the training process may have been stopped when the validation loss reached a certain point or plateau, but the exact criteria used to determine the completion of training are not specified.
