Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. However, it does mention the evaluation and validation phases of the model.

According to the context, the model is evaluated and validated through three phases: 

1. Test: The model is tested on a dataset.
2. Evaluation: The model is evaluated on another dataset.
3. Validation: The model is validated by field experts on a completely new dataset.

The context also provides the results of these phases in Tables 10 and 11, which include metrics such as True Positives (TP), False Negatives (FN), True Negatives (TN), False Positives (FP), Sensitivity (Se), Specificity (Sp), Positive Predictive Value (PPV), Negative Predictive Value (NPV), and Accuracy (ACC).

While the context does not explicitly mention Saliency maps, it does provide a detailed confusion matrix in Table 10, which is a common postprocessing step in machine learning. However, it does not provide information on other postprocessing steps such as Metrics calculation or Saliency maps.
