Answer:::
I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific deep learning model used in a pipeline. The context appears to be a list of references related to remote sensing, digital soil mapping, and land cover classification, but it does not provide information about a specific pipeline or deep learning model. Some of the references mention techniques such as artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), and random forests (RF), but these are not deep learning models. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
