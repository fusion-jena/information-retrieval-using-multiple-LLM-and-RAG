Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the U-Net model implemented within the arcgis.learn module of the ArcGIS API for Python is used for pixel-level labeling of each pixel in the training data. This suggests that the data annotation technique used is likely pixel-level annotation or semantic segmentation, where each pixel in the image is labeled with a specific class or category. 

Additionally, the context mentions that abundant data are needed for training deep neural networks, and that a pre-trained network can reduce the amount of training data needed. This implies that the data annotation process may involve manual annotation of a large number of images, but the specific techniques used for annotation are not mentioned.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of a U-Net model with a ResNet-50 backbone that was pre-trained on ImageNet, which is a large-scale image classification dataset. However, this does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used in the pipeline.
