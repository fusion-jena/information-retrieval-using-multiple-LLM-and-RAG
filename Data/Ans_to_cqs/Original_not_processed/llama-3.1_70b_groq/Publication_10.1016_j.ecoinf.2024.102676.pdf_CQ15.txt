Answer:::
I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the missForest algorithm for imputing missing values, the Footprint Identification Technique (FIT), and the use of imperfect footprints in field surveys. It also mentions a study using deep learning models to classify otter species, but it does not provide any information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
