Answer: The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned as popular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it is mentioned that the researchers used a dataset of images from environmental samples, specifically soil samples from three contrasting locations (Greenland, Sweden, and Kenya). They also used a daily common objects dataset (COCO) for transfer learning, but this is not the primary dataset used for training the model. The primary dataset is a custom dataset created from the soil samples, which was split into 65 images for training and 16 images for validation.
