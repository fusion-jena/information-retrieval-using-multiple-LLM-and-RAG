Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention that the network was trained until reaching a target minimal error, and that the trained network was subsequently used for feed-forward predictions on continuous spatial data. Additionally, it mentions that the network featuring two hidden neurons and the lowest error was chosen during validation.

It can be inferred that the model performance was monitored through the computation of error during the training phase, and that the model with the lowest error was selected. However, the specific strategy or metrics used to monitor the model performance during training are not mentioned in the provided context.
