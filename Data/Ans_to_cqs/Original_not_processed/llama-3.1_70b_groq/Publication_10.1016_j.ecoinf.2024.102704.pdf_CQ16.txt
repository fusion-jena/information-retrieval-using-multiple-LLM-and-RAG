Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be focused on the performance evaluation of a model, specifically LigObNet, on an underwater fish species identification task, and the optimization of its architecture for improved detection accuracy and inference speed. It does not provide information on the training process or the stopping criteria used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
