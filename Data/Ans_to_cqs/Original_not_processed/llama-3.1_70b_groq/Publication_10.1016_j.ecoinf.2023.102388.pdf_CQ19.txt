Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The text mentions the architecture of VGG16 and the use of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) as the optimization algorithm, but it does not provide information about the framework used to implement the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
