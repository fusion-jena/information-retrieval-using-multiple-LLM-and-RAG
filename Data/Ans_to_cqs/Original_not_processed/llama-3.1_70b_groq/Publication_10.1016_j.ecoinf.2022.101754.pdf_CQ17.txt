Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the use of machine learning methods for estimating above-ground biomass (AGB) in forests, including random forest, AdaBoost, multilayer neural network, and Bayesian ridge regression. However, it does not delve into the specifics of the deep learning pipeline or regularization methods used.

One of the references mentioned, Zhang et al. (2019), is related to deep learning, but the context does not provide enough information to answer the query. Therefore, I do not know the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
