Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of airborne imagery, LiDAR-based unsupervised algorithms, and RGB imagery. It also mentions the use of hand-annotations for training and evaluation.

From the context, it can be inferred that the raw data is collected through airborne remote sensing, possibly using sensors such as cameras and LiDAR. The context also mentions the use of NEON sites, which suggests that the data may be collected from a network of sensors or cameras installed at these sites.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of pretraining data generated by overlaying predicted trees from a LiDAR-based unsupervised algorithm onto RGB imagery. This suggests that the raw data may be collected through a combination of LiDAR and RGB imaging sensors.

However, the context does not provide information on whether surveys or public datasets are used for collecting raw data. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a complete answer to the query based on the provided context.
