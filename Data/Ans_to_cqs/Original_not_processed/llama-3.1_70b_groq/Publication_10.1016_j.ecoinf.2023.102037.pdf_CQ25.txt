Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is object detection, specifically insect detection. The model is trained to detect and classify insects in images. The text mentions that the model is based on the YOLOv5 architecture, which is a popular object detection algorithm. Additionally, the text mentions that the model is trained on a dataset of insect images and is evaluated on its ability to detect and classify insects accurately.
