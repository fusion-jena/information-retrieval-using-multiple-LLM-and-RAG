Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not provide any information on strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context appears to be focused on various topics such as fixed point theorem, mean value methods, animal behavior, and image acquisition and processing technologies, but does not mention deep learning or randomness in the context of deep learning.

However, I can suggest that in general, deep learning pipelines often employ strategies such as:

* Setting a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results
* Using techniques such as dropout and batch normalization to reduce overfitting and improve generalization
* Employing ensemble methods to combine the predictions of multiple models trained with different random seeds
* Using techniques such as Monte Carlo methods to estimate uncertainty in model predictions

But these strategies are not mentioned in the provided context, and I couldn't find any relevant information to provide a more specific answer.
