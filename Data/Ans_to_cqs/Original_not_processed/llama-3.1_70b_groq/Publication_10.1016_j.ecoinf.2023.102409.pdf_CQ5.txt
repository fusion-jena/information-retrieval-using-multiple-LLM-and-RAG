Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention that the VGG11 Encoder was pre-trained on ImageNet for image segmentation tasks, as mentioned in the paper "TernausNet: U-Net with VGG11 Encoder Pre-Trained on ImageNet for Image Segmentation" by Iglovikov and Shvets (2018). 

Additionally, the context mentions various applications of deep learning algorithms, including geographical and ecological challenges, but it does not provide information on the specific datasets used for these tasks. Therefore, I cannot provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
