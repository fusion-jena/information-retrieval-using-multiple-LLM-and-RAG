Answer:::
The text does not specifically mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. In fact, the text mentions that the results of the study can be used as a baseline for future LULC analysis performed with other methodologies, such as deep learning CNN, but it does not describe the implementation of a deep learning model in the study.

However, the text does describe the measures taken to ensure the representativeness of the training and validation points. The authors used the vegetation types described by Gertenbach (1983) to guide the placement of their sampling plots, from which they then collected the training and validation points. They also created several small sampling plots within each vegetation type, instead of using one large area, to speed up the sampling process and ensure that the training/validation points were representative of the diverse vegetation within each boundary.

The text also mentions the use of random Forest classification in Google Earth Engine, but it does not provide information on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of this model.
