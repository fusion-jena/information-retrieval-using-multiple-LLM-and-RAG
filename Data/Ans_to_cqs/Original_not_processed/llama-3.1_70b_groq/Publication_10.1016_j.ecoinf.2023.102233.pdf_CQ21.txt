Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the active learning approach, hyperparameter tuning, and the annotation process. It does mention that the final model's predictions most closely reflected the primary annotator's labels, but it does not provide any information on the specific postprocessing steps taken after the model training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
