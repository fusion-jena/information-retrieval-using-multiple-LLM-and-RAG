Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on land use and land cover (LULC) classification using remote sensing images and deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It mentions a few datasets, such as So2Sat LCZ42, but these are specific to LULC classification and not general deep learning datasets like MNIST or ImageNet. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
