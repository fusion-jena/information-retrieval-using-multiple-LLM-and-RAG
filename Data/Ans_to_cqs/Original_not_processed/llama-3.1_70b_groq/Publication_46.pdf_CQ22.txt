Answer:::
The performance of the deep learning model (CNN) is evaluated using several metrics, including:

1. Area Under Curve (AUC) evaluation metrics: The AUC value is used to assess the model's performance across all thresholds. The AUC value for the CNN model is 0.917, indicating its superiority over the BIOCLIM model, which has an AUC value of 0.68.

2. Kappa: The kappa value is used to evaluate the model's performance, with higher values indicating better performance. The kappa value for the CNN model is 0.94, while the BIOCLIM model has a kappa value of 0.76.

3. True Skill Statistic (TSS): The TSS value is also used to evaluate the model's performance. The TSS value for the CNN model is 0.652, while the BIOCLIM model has a TSS value of 0.44.

These metrics indicate the superiority of the CNN model over the BIOCLIM model in predicting species distribution. However, accuracy, precision, and recall are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context as evaluation metrics for the deep learning model.
