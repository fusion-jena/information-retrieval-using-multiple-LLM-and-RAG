Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The context appears to focus on the performance metrics of the image quality model on the test data, camera trap setup, data collection, and image quality classification.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
