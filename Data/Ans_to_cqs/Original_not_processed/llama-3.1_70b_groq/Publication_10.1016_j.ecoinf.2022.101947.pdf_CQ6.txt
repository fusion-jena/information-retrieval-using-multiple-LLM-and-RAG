Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be discussing the use of a pairwise comparison model called FIT for sex classification of Amur tigers based on footprint images, but it does not provide information on the preprocessing steps used.

However, it does mention that the images were captured using a digital camera or smartphone with a minimum recommended resolution of 1600 Ã— 1200 pixels, and that a metric scale was required. This suggests that the images may have been resized or rescaled to a standard size before being used for analysis, but this is not explicitly stated.

Additionally, the context mentions that the FIT model was trained using data from captive Amur tigers and that the process was iterated multiple times to generate the fewest misclassifications. This suggests that some form of data validation or optimization may have been performed, but the specific preprocessing steps used are not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model used in this study.
