Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context appears to focus on the performance of different deep learning models and ensemble methods for plant disease classification, but it does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions "offline data balancing" was applied to the source dataset, which might imply some form of data preprocessing or normalization to reduce the impact of randomness. Nevertheless, this is not directly related to handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I must conclude that the provided context does not provide a clear answer to the query, and I do not know the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
