Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context appears to focus on NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) reconstruction, time-series analysis, and remote sensing applications, without delving into the details of deep learning pipeline management. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
