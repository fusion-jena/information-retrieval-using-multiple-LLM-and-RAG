Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. The context appears to be a collection of references and snippets from various papers and texts, but it does not provide specific information about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question based on the provided context.
