Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to focus on machine learning methods, such as Support Vector Regression (SVR), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Random Forest (RF), and XGBoost, but it does not provide information on data splitting criteria for deep learning models.

However, it does mention the use of grid search for optimizing model parameters, such as the number of trees in RF and the number of boosting iterations in XGBoost. Additionally, it mentions the use of indices such as "percent IncMSE" and "IncNodePurity" for assessing variable importance in RF.

But, it does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation in the context of deep learning models. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
