Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or any measures taken to ensure its generalizability. The context appears to be related to a different topic, specifically a model called FERM (Functional Ecosystem Restoration Model) that is used to evaluate the condition of ecological targets. The text discusses the model's parameters, equations, and limitations, but does not mention deep learning or generalizability measures such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.
