Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the model training process, specifically the use of YOLOv7 for object detection and the application of the Kalman Filter (KF) for tracking.

However, it does mention that the authors plan to "further optimize the detection model and implement migration learning during model training to further improve detection accuracy." This suggests that the authors may be interested in evaluating and refining their model's performance, but the specific postprocessing steps involved are not detailed in the provided context.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
