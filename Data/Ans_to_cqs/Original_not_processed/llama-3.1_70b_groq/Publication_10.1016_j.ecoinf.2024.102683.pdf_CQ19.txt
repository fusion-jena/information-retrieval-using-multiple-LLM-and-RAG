Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The text discusses various techniques and methods used in deep learning, including attention mechanisms, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and data augmentation, but it does not provide information about the specific frameworks used to implement these methods. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
