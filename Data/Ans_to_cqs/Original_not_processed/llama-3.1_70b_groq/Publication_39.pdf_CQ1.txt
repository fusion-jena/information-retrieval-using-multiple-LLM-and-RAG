Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. It mentions the use of pre-trained models and datasets such as COCO 2017train and Kinetics-400, but it does not provide information on how the data was collected for these datasets. Additionally, it mentions the use of an annotated dataset called AnnotationsActions, but it does not provide information on how the data was collected for this dataset. Therefore, I do not know the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
