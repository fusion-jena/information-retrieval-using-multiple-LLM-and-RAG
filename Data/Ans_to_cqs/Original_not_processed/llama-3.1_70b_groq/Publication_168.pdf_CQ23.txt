Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning models. It discusses various deep learning architectures and their performance on hyperspectral image (HSI) classification tasks, but it does not provide information on the specific techniques used to ensure generalizability, such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.
