Answer:

To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, the techniques used in the context of GreenCam include:

1. **Diverse data collection**: The dataset is constructed by expanding the geographic scope of data collection to include a wider range of urban settings, such as different types of green spaces (parks, gardens, campuses, urban forests, etc.) and varying levels of urban green density.
2. **Data augmentation**: Techniques such as random rotations, scaling, and flipping of images are implemented to improve the balance of the dataset and address underrepresented classes. This helps the model generalize better without compromising the diversity of the dataset.

There is no mention of stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling in the provided context. Therefore, it is unclear if these techniques are used in the preprocessing pipeline of GreenCam.
