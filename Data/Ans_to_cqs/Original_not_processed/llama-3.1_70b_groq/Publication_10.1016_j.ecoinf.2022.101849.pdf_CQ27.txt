Answer:::
I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. It appears to be a research paper discussing weakly supervised learning tasks, specifically in the context of regression with structurally incomplete target labels. The paper mentions various definitions and terms used in the literature to describe variants of noise and scarceness of labels, but it does not provide information on the deployment process of a trained model.
