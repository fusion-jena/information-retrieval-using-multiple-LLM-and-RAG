Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling, ensemble modeling, and the selection of background points for model training, but it does not discuss deep learning or regularization methods.
