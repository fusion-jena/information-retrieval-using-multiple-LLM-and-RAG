Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily discusses active learning strategies, transfer learning, and dimensionality reduction using deep neural networks, but it does not delve into data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
