Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets. However, it does mention that the chironomid dataset was acquired through a lab-based image acquisition protocol, where specimens were collected from 5 sampling sites within the South Morava river basin, Serbia. The protocol involved taking images of the specimens, specifically larvae, from a ventral point of view, with controlled object position. This suggests that the raw data collection method involved collecting and imaging physical specimens in a controlled laboratory setting.
