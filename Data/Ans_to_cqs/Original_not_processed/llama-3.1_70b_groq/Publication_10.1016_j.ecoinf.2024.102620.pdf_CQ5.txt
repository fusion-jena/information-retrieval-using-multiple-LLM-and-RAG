Answer: 

The provided context does not mention the use of any specific deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics and remote sensing, discussing the use of datasets such as NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), vegetation type data, DEM (Digital Elevation Model) data, and meteorological data from CMIP6. 

The context mentions the use of specific datasets, including:

* MOD13Q1.006 for NDVI data
* SRTM V4.1 dataset for DEM data
* CMIP6 for meteorological data

However, these datasets are not typically used in deep learning pipelines for image classification tasks. They are more related to remote sensing and ecological applications. Therefore, the answer to the query is that the context does not mention the use of any specific deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
