Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific deep learning model used in the pipeline. It mentions that other machine learning algorithms, including deep learning algorithms, can be applied to hyperspectral data to predict water quality parameters with better accuracy and performance. However, it does not specify the type of deep learning model used. It does mention the use of artificial neural networks (ANN) in other studies, but it does not indicate that ANN is used in the pipeline.
