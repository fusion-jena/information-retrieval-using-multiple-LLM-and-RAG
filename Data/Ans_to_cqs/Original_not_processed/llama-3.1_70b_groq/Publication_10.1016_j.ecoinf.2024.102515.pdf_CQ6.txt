Answer:::
The provided context does not specifically mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention the challenges of working with tweets as a data source, such as the low number of words accompanying the messages, poor writing quality, and the need for cleaning and filtering processes to focus on relevant data.

It mentions a flowchart of the data acquisition and processing (Fig. 1) that includes filtering out tweets with images in GIF format, which are often memes. Additionally, it describes the use of three different criteria to search for tweets that are likely to contain biodiversity observations.

While the context does not provide a detailed list of preprocessing steps, it implies that some form of cleaning and filtering is necessary to prepare the tweet data for analysis. However, it does not mention normalization or scaling, which are common preprocessing steps in deep learning.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the answer to the query is that the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model are not explicitly stated, but it is mentioned that cleaning and filtering are necessary to prepare the tweet data.
