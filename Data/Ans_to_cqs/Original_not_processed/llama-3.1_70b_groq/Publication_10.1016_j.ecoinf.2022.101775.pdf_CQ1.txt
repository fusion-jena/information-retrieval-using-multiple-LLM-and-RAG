Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the context that sensors are one of the methods used for collecting data. For example, the paper "Iot-enabled low power environment monitoring system for prediction of pm2.5" by Shah and Mishra (2020) mentions the use of sensors for collecting environmental data.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) for collecting data, which suggests that sensors are a common method for collecting raw data.

There is no mention of surveys or public datasets as methods for collecting raw data in the provided context. However, it is possible that these methods may be used in other deep learning pipelines, but it is not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the answer to the query is that sensors are one of the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
