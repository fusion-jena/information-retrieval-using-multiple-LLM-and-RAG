Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions the specific hyperparameter values used for the model, such as the learning rate, batch size, and object queries parameter. However, it does not provide information on the method used to optimize these hyperparameters, such as grid search, random search, or other methods. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
