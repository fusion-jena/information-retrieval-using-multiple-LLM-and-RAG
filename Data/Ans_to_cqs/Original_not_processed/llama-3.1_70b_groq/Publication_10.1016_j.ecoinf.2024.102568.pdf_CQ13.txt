Answer: The deep learning model used is an LSTM model, and the hyperparameters mentioned in the context are:

* Loss function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
* Optimizer: ADAM optimization (Kingma and Ba, 2015)
* Regularization method: Dropout layer, which randomly excludes some inputs from activation and weight updates while training the network.

However, the learning rate is not explicitly mentioned in the context. Therefore, I do not know the learning rate used in the model.

Additionally, the context mentions that the dimension of the temporal window must be selected dynamically considering the performance obtained with different values on the available dataset, but it does not provide specific values for the temporal window size.
