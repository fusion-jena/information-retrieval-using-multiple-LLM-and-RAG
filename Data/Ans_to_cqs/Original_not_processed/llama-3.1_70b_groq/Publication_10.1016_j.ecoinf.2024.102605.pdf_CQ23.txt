Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The context appears to be a list of references related to ecological informatics, remote sensing, and machine learning, but it does not provide information about a specific deep learning model or its development process.

However, some of the references mention the use of techniques such as cross-validation (e.g., Liu, D.S., Kelly, M., Gong, P., 2006) and multivariate calibration (e.g., Lira, D.B.F.L., Albuquerque, D.S.M., Pacheco, A.G.J., et al., 2010), which are commonly used to evaluate and improve the performance of machine learning models. Additionally, some references mention the use of diverse datasets (e.g., Broge, N.H., Leblanc, E., 2001) and multispectral features (e.g., Carlo, R., Sandrine, P., Cerabolini, B.E.L., et al., 2021), which can contribute to the generalizability of a model.

However, without more specific information about the deep learning model in question, it is not possible to provide a more detailed answer to the query.
