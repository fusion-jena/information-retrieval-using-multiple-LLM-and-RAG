Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate and optimizer. The context only mentions that the authors used deep learning for modelling animal biodiversity using acoustic monitoring, but it does not provide details about the model's architecture or hyperparameters. The reference to the paper "Modelling animal biodiversity using acoustic monitoring and deep learning" by Chalmers et al. (2021) may contain this information, but it is not provided in the given context.
