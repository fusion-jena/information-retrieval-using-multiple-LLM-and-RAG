Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention the calculation of certain metrics. 

The context mentions that the results achieved an F1 score of 0.9034 and a Jaccard index of 0.8287 on the test set. This suggests that metrics calculation is one of the postprocessing steps involved. 

Additionally, the context does not provide information about the use of saliency maps or confusion matrices as postprocessing steps. Therefore, it is not possible to confirm whether these steps were involved in the process.
