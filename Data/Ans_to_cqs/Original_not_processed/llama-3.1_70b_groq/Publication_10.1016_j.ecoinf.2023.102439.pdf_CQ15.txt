Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), specifically the NARX model, and a hybrid model combining wavelet analysis and the NARX ANN algorithm, for predicting vegetation biomass density. It discusses the performance of these models, including the number of hidden layer neurons, R-values, MAPE, RMSE, and MSE, but does not delve into the optimization techniques used. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
