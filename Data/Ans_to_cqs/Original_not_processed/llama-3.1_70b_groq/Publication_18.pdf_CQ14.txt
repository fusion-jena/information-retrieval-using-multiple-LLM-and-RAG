Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context appears to be a research paper that discusses the use of deep neural networks for image classification, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process. It mentions the authors' contributions to the paper, including designing the experiments, collecting the data, and implementing the code, but it does not specify the method used for hyperparameter optimization.
