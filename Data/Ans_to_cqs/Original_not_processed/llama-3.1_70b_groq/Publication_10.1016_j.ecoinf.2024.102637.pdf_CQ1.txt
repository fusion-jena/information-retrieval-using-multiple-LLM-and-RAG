Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the data for this work are published on Kaggle and are available at specific URLs, suggesting that the data was obtained from existing public datasets.

Specifically, the context mentions the UrbanSound8k and Birdsdata datasets, which are publicly available on Kaggle. This implies that the researchers utilized existing public datasets as the source of their raw data, rather than collecting it through surveys, sensors, or other means.

It is worth noting that the context does not provide information on how the data was originally collected for these public datasets. It only mentions that the researchers used these existing datasets for their work.
