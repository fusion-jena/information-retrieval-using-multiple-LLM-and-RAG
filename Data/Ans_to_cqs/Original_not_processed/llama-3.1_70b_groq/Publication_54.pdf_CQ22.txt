Answer:::

The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the following metrics:

* True Positive (TP): the number of birds correctly detected as endemic birds.
* True Negative (TN): the number of birds correctly detected as nonendemic birds.
* False Positive (FP): the number of birds incorrectly detected as endemic birds.
* False Negative (FN): the number of ground truth birds undetected by the predictive system.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the trained models in identifying individual bird species. However, it is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context that precision and recall are used as evaluation metrics.
