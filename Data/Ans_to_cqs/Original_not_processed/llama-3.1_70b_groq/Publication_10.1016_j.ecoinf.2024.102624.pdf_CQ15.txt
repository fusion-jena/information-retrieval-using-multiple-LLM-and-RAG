Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or any optimization techniques such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, classification, and accuracy assessment, using algorithms such as Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS). The hyperparameters for these algorithms are tuned using a grid search, but the context does not mention deep learning or optimization techniques commonly used in deep learning pipelines.
