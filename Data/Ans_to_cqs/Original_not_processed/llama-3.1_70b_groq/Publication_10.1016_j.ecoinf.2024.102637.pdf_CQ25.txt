Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. The text mentions that Shazzadul Islam et al. used VGG-16 to extract features from bird images and then used support vector machines for classification, achieving an accuracy of 89%. Additionally, Sankupellay et al. used ResNet-50 to automatically recognize the spectrograms of 46 bird songs with an accuracy of 60%â€“72%. This suggests that the deep learning models mentioned in the text are used for classification tasks, such as image classification and audio classification.
