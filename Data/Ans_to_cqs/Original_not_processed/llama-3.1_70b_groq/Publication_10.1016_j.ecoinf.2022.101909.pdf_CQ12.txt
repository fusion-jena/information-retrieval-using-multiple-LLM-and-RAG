Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, a modified version of the ResNet50 architecture is used, which is a type of CNN. The model is pre-trained on ImageNet data and then fine-tuned for the task of identifying bird species in soundscapes using transfer learning and spectrogram-based identification.
