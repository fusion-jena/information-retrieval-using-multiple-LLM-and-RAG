Answer: 
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context appears to focus on the performance of different deep learning models (VGG16, Xception, ResNet50, DenseNet121, and the proposed model) in terms of training and prediction run-time, as well as the application of privacy-preserving deep learning (PPDL) techniques for satellite image classification. It does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline.
