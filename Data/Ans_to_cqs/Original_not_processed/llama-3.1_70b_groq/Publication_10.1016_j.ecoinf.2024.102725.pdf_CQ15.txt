Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to focus on the use of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data, image synthesis, and reconstruction techniques, as well as evaluation metrics for assessing the accuracy of predicted images. It does not delve into the specifics of the deep learning pipeline or optimization techniques used. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to this question.
