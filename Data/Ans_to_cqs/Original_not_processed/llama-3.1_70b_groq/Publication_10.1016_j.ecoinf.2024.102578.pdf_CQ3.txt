Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily discusses the limitations of computer vision, the need for human review, and a semi-automated workflow for image classification. It mentions the use of MegaDetector and custom-trained models, but does not provide details on the annotation techniques employed. Therefore, I do not know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
