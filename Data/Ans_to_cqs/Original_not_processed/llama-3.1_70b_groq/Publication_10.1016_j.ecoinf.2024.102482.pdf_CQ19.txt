Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The text only mentions the use of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, but it does not provide information on the frameworks or tools used to implement the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
