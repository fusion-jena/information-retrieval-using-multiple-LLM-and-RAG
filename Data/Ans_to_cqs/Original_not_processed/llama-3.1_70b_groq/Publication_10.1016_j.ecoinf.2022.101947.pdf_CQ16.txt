Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the validation of the algorithm using holdback trials and the determination of the optimal number of footprint trails required for the algorithm training set and test sets. It discusses the results of the holdback trials, the comparison of predicted and actual test set sizes, and the variation in sequential trials. However, it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine the completion of training.
