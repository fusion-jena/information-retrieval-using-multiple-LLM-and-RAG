Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily discusses species distribution modeling (SDM) and various machine learning methods, including maximum entropy (MaxEnt), artificial neural networks (ANN), random forest (RF), gradient boosting machine (GBM), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and light GBM (LGBM). However, it does not delve into the details of the deep learning pipeline or optimization techniques used.

One relevant reference is Lee (2013), which mentions pseudo-labeling as a semi-supervised learning method for deep neural networks, but it does not discuss optimization techniques. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
