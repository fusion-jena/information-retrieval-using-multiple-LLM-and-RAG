Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The text primarily focuses on the comparison of object detection models (YOLOv5 and Faster R-CNN) and their performance on detecting Pacific oysters, as well as some limitations and potential future work. It does not delve into the details of the deep learning pipeline or regularization techniques used. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
