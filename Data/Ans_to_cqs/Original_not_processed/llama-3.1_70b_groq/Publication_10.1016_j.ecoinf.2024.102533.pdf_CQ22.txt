Answer: 

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or its performance evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall. However, it does mention the use of K-Means clustering and the evaluation of its performance using the following metrics:

1. Distortion: calculates the sum of squared distances of data to their nearest cluster center. A lower Distortion value indicates good cluster cohesiveness.
2. Silhouette: represents how similar a point is to other points in the same cluster compared to points in different clusters. The Silhouette index is calculated as the ratio of the difference between the average distance to points in other clusters and the average distance to points in the same cluster, to the maximum of these two values.
3. Calinski-Harabasz: determines the ratio of dispersion between and within clusters.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the K-Means clustering algorithm in determining the number of clusters, but they are not directly related to the performance evaluation of a deep learning model.
