Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily discusses the challenges of applying deep learning to natural systems, particularly in remote sensing, due to the need for large training datasets and the limitations of data collection and annotation. It also mentions the potential of self-supervised learning and semi-supervised frameworks to improve deep learning on limited training data. However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.
