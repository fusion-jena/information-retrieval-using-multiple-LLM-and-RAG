Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The text only discusses the structure of the NLPP network model, its components, and the optimization algorithms used, but it does not provide information about the frameworks or tools used to implement the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
