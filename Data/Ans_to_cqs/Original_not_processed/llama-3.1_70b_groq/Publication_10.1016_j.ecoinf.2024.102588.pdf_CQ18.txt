Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of early stopping. According to the provided context, the early stopping option stopped the model training at a specific epoch where the model validation accuracy could not be improved. This suggests that the model's performance on the validation set was continuously monitored during training, and the training process was halted when the model's performance stopped improving. This is a common strategy used to prevent overfitting and ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data.
