Answer:::

The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include:

* Rotation up to 20 degrees
* Width and height shifting up to 20% of the total image size
* Shearing with a maximum of 20 degrees
* Zooming with a maximum factor of 20%
* Horizontal flipping

These transformations were implemented using the `train_datagen` instance of `ImageDataGenerator`. Additionally, the `fill_mode` parameter was set to ‘nearest’ to handle any potential gaps or missing pixels resulting from the transformations.
