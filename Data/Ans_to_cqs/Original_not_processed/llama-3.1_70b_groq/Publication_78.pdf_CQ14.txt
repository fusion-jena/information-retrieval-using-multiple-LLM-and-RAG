Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the classifier used (SVM), the kernels used (linear, Gaussian, and polynomial), and the parameters of the confusion matrix, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process. Therefore, I do not know how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.
