Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a research paper on detecting man-made underwater objects and human activity types from 3D posture data using deep learning models. However, it does not provide information on the specific techniques used to address data bias.

That being said, the context does mention the use of a methodology that involves evaluating the model with a completely new dataset independent from the first and second datasets to ensure its viability. This suggests that the authors may have taken steps to ensure that their model is robust and generalizable, but it does not provide specific information on techniques used to address data bias.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to the query. If you have any further context or clarification, I would be happy to try and assist you further.
