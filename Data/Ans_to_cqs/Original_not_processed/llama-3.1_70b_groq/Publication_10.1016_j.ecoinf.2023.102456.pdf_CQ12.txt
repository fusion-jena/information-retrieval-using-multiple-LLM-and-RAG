Answer: 
The text does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it does mention the use of a neural network (ANN) and a backpropagation algorithm, which is a common training algorithm for neural networks. Additionally, it mentions the use of a sigmoid activation function, which is often used in neural networks. But it does not provide enough information to determine the specific type of deep learning model used, such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer.
