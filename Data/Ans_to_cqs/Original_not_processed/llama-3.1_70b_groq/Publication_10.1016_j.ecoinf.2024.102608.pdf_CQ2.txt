Answer: 
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the data formats used are likely to be related to remote sensing and satellite data, such as images from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 satellites. The context mentions the use of Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat-8 OLI data, which suggests that the data formats used are likely to be satellite image data. Additionally, the context mentions the estimation of water quality parameters, which may involve the use of CSV files for storing and processing data. However, this is not explicitly stated.
