Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention a technique used to prevent poor generalization of the DCNN model due to similar images within the same capture event. 

To prevent this, the integrity of events was kept during data splitting, putting all images of an event into the same dataset. This approach ensures that similar images are not split into training and test sets, which could lead to biased results.

No other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection are mentioned in the provided context.
