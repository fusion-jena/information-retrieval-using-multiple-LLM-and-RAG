Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper or a section of a research paper discussing the development and evaluation of a deep learning-based bird sound noise reduction network. The context provides information on the experimental setting, comparative algorithms, and training of the network, but it does not include a link to a data repository.
