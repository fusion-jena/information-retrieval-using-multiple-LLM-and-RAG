Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to ecological and environmental studies, discussing topics such as landscape ecology, species migration corridors, and ecological sources. It mentions the use of certain methods and tools, such as the Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM) and hotspot analysis, but these are not related to data annotation techniques in deep learning.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not relevant to the provided context.
