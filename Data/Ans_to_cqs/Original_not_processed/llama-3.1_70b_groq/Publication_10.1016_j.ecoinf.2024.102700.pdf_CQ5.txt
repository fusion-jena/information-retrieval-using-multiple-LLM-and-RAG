Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context only mentions that deep learning strategies, including neural networks, were used in some studies (e.g., Cazau et al., 2023), but it does not provide information about the datasets used in these studies.
