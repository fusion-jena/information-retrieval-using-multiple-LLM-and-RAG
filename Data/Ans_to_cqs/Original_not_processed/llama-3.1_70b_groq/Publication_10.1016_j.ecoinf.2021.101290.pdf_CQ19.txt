Answer:::
The provided context mentions several deep learning frameworks, including Theano, Torch, Caffe, TensorFlow, and deeplearning4j. These frameworks are mentioned in the paper "Deep Learning with Theano, Torch, Caffe, Tensorflow, and deeplearning4j: Which One Is the Best in Speed and Accuracy?" by Kovalev et al. (2016). However, it does not specify which framework is used to build a particular deep learning model. 

It is worth noting that PyTorch is not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I do not know if PyTorch is used to build the deep learning model.
