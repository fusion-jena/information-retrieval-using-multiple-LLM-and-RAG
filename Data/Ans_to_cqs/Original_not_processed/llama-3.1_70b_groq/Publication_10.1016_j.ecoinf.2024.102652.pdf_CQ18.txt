Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of an early stopping function. According to the provided context, the training process is set to run for 100 epochs, but the early stopping function is designed to halt the learning process if there is no improvement in accuracy after 20 epochs. This suggests that the model's performance is being continuously monitored during training, and the training process is stopped if the model's performance plateaus or degrades.
