Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on explaining the architecture and components of a convolutional neural network (CNN), including the convolutional layer, pooling layer, fully connected layer, and output layer. It also provides mathematical definitions of convolution and the output value of a neuron in the convolutional layer.

However, it is common in deep learning pipelines to use optimization techniques like SGD, Adam, or RMSProp to update the model's weights and biases during training. These techniques help minimize the loss function and improve the model's performance. Nevertheless, without explicit mention in the provided context, I cannot confirm which specific optimization techniques are applied in this particular pipeline.

If you have any further questions or would like me to clarify any of the concepts mentioned in the context, please feel free to ask!
