Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of a Stacked GRU-DNN model, hyperparameter tuning, and techniques to prevent overfitting such as early stopping and dropout. It also mentions the use of a validation group to track generalization performance, but it does not provide information on techniques to address data bias.

However, it does mention that the training data is separated into training and validation groups, which could be a step towards addressing data bias, but the specific techniques used are not mentioned.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
