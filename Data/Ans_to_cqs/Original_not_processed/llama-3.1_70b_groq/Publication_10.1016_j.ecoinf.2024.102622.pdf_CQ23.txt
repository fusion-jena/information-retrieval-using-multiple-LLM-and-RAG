Answer: The text does not specifically mention the use of deep learning models, but rather mentions the use of various machine learning models such as Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGboost), and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). 

To ensure the generalizability of these models, the text mentions that the dataset was split into training and verification sets in a ratio of 3:1. This suggests that the models were trained on a larger portion of the data and then evaluated on a smaller, held-out portion of the data. This is a common technique for evaluating the performance of machine learning models and can help to ensure that the models are generalizable to new, unseen data.

Additionally, the text mentions that the model was extended to Northeast China in 2023 to test its generalization ability and robustness. The high R2 value of 0.85 in Northeast China suggests that the model is able to generalize well to new regions. However, it is not clear if the dataset was diverse or if stratified splitting was used.
