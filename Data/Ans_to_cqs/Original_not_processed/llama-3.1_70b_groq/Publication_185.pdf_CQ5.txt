Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions that the experiments were performed on a small-size dataset without data augmentation. However, it does mention the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge, which suggests that ImageNet might be related to the context, but it is not explicitly stated as the dataset used in the experiments.
