Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the performance across all the thresholds was evaluated using the value of the Area Under Curve (AUC) evaluation metrics. This suggests that AUC was used as a performance evaluation metric, but it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training.
