Answer:::
The provided context mentions that passive acoustic recording equipment is used to collect audio data over long time periods and large areas. This method is part of ecoacoustic surveying, which has emerged as a useful method for large-scale quantification of ecological communities and their habitats. The context does not mention the use of surveys, sensors, or public datasets as methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the audio data is collected in chunks, and each chunk is categorized into one of four states. The context also mentions that the dataset was randomly selected from the remaining sites, but it does not provide further information on the methods used for collecting raw data.
