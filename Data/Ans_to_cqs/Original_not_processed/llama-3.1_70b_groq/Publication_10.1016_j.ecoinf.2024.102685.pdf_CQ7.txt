Answer: I don't know. The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. It appears to be discussing the use of random forest classification models and the preparation of training data for those models, but it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to split the data into training, testing, and validation sets for deep learning models.
