Answer: 
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is mentioned in the context as "A CNN is a type of neural network commonly used for image classification which includes convolutional layers within its architecture." Additionally, the context also mentions the use of a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) model, but the primary deep learning model used is a CNN.
