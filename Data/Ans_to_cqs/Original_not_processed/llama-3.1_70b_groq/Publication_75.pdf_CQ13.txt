Answer:::
The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. It only describes the architecture of the model, including the number of layers, the activation function used (ReLU), and the pooling strategy employed (Max pooling with a 3 × 3 filter size and 1 × 1 stride). It also mentions the input image size (224 × 224 × 3) and the output of the last fully-connected layer, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameters used for training the model.
