Answer:

Based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include:

1. Metrics calculation: The performance metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score are calculated to evaluate the model's performance. (Table 6)
2. Confusion matrix: A confusion matrix is generated to visualize the model's performance on the binary classification test. (Table 5)
3. Model optimization results: The model optimization results are visualized in a figure (Fig. 9) to show the performance of the model.
4. Performance test: A performance test is conducted to evaluate the model's performance on each running fold of the model training. (Fig. 10 and Fig. 11)
5. Scatterplot: A scatterplot is generated to visualize the model's performance on each running fold for binary classification. (Fig. 11)

There is no mention of Saliency maps in the provided context. Therefore, it is not clear if Saliency maps are involved in the postprocessing steps.

Note that the provided context is limited to a specific research paper, and the postprocessing steps may vary depending on the specific research question and methodology.
