Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context appears to focus on water quality prediction models, data pre-processing, and machine learning algorithms, but it does not discuss randomness or deep learning pipelines explicitly. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
