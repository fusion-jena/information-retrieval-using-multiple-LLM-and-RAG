Answer:

To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the model was trained on a large dataset with manual annotations, which helped to reduce overfitting. The dataset was split into training, validation, and testing sets, with the testing set being composed of 500 manually annotated images from the same transect. This allowed for the evaluation of the model's performance on unseen data.

Additionally, the model was trained for a limited number of iterations (up to 6000) to prevent overfitting. The number of iterations was chosen based on the performance of the model on the validation set, with longer training times resulting in higher recall but lower precision.

The use of a validation set during training also helped to prevent overfitting. The model's performance on the validation set was evaluated after each epoch, and the model's weights were adjusted accordingly. This process helped to ensure that the model was not becoming too specialized to the training set.

It is not explicitly mentioned in the text whether cross-validation or stratified splitting were used. However, the use of a separate validation set and the evaluation of the model's performance on a testing set suggest that some form of validation was used to ensure the generalizability of the model.

Overall, the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model include the use of a large dataset, splitting the data into training, validation, and testing sets, and limiting the number of training iterations.
