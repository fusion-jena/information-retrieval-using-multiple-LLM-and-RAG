Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention any optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. The text appears to be discussing the cblindplot package, which is related to creating colorblind-friendly plots, and mentions techniques like Random Forest and neural networks, but does not provide information on optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline.
