Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically address techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on machine learning and remote sensing applications, particularly in the field of forestry and ecology. It discusses various machine learning algorithms, such as SVR, XGBoost, and MLR, and their applications in predicting above-ground biomass and other ecological variables.

However, I can provide some general information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. These techniques include:

* Stratified splitting: This involves splitting the data into training and testing sets in a way that preserves the class distribution of the original dataset.
* Oversampling: This involves creating additional copies of the minority class to balance the class distribution.
* Undersampling: This involves reducing the number of samples from the majority class to balance the class distribution.
* Diverse data collection: This involves collecting data from diverse sources to reduce bias and increase the representativeness of the dataset.

It's worth noting that these techniques are not specific to deep learning and can be applied to other machine learning pipelines as well. However, without more specific information on the context and requirements of the deep learning pipeline, it's difficult to provide more detailed advice on addressing data bias.
