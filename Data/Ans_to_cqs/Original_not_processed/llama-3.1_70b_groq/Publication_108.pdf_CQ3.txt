Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. It mentions that the data (orthophoto and corresponding labels) were split into three datasets: training (80%), validation (20%), and test (two full images of 10,000 Ã— 10,000 pixels). However, it does not provide information on how the labels were created or what annotation techniques were used.

It does mention that the study relied on high-resolution orthophotos with 20-cm spatial resolution obtained from an aerial survey, and that the great advantage of these data is that many details can be detected. It also mentions that the orthophotos were divided into relatively small labeled tiles (or rather small image cubes) and fed into the CNN. However, it does not provide further information on the annotation techniques used to label these tiles.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
