Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be a list of references and some statistical data, but it does not provide information on the specific criteria used for data splitting.

However, in general, common practices for splitting data for deep learning model training include:

* Random splitting: dividing the data into training, testing, and validation sets using random sampling.
* Stratified splitting: dividing the data into training, testing, and validation sets while maintaining the same proportion of classes in each set.
* Time-based splitting: dividing the data into training, testing, and validation sets based on time, such as using historical data for training and more recent data for testing and validation.

Without more information, it is impossible to determine the specific criteria used in the context provided. If you have any additional information or context, I may be able to provide a more specific answer.
