Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention the location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research article discussing the use of deep learning models, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, for forecasting agricultural carbon emissions in China. The article mentions various references and citations, but it does not provide information about the data repository.
