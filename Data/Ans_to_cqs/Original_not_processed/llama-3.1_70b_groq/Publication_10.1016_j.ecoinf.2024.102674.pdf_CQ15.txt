Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context only mentions the use of deep learning in the paper "Wind-topo: downscaling near-surface wind fields to high-resolution topography in highly complex terrain with deep learning" by Dujardin and Lehning (2022), but it does not provide details on the optimization techniques employed. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
