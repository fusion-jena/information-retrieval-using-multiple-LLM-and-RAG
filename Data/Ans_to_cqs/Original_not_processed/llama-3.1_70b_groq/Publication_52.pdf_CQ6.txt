Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the theoretical framework of Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs), Deep Extreme Learning Machines (DELE), and their applications in object recognition, speech recognition, and audio recognition.

However, it does mention the use of autoencoders for unsupervised learning of efficient coding, which can be used for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction. Additionally, the context mentions the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for object recognition tasks, which often involve preprocessing steps such as normalization and scaling.

But, the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed answer to this query based on the given information.
