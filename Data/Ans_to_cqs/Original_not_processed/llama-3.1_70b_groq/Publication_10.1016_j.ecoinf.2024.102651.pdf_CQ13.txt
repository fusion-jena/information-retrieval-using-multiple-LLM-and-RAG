Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context primarily discusses the performance of the proposed classification network, the architecture of the CA-Hybrid network, and the comparison of classification accuracy between "medium" and "small" objects. It does not provide information on the specific hyperparameters used in the model. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
