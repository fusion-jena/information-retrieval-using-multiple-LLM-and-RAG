Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily discusses the use of machine learning and deep learning techniques, including artificial neural networks (ANN), bootstrap forest, and boosted tree, for predicting plant disease severity and forecasting disease incidence. It also mentions the use of image analysis with machine learning and deep learning techniques, but it does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used.
