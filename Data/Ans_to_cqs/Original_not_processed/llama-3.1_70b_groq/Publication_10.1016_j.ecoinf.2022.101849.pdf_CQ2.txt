Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on weakly supervised learning, particularly in the context of regression and predictive modeling of global vegetation cover. It mentions various references to research papers and studies, but does not provide information on data formats.

However, based on the mention of "histopathology cancer image segmentation and classification" in one of the references (Xu et al., 2014), it can be inferred that image data may be one of the formats used in certain deep learning pipelines. Additionally, the context mentions "satellite images" in another reference (Yao et al., 2016), suggesting that image data may be relevant in some cases.

But without more specific information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query.
