Answer:

The provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention standardization as a technique used for preprocessing data. Standardization is a normalization technique that allows changing the scope of individual variables so that they are presented in a similar numerical range. This transformation preserves the distance relations between individual data.

The context does not mention Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection as techniques used to address data bias. It only mentions standardization as a preprocessing step, which is used to transform the data into a similar numerical range.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the answer to the query is that standardization is used as a preprocessing technique, but it does not specifically address data bias. The other techniques mentioned in the query (Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, Diverse data collection) are not mentioned in the context.
