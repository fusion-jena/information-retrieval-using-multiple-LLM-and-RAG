Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. It only mentions that the variables used to train the models are those recorded solely by the GPS device, including variation in longitude and latitude, altitude, and coverage ratio. It also mentions that different combinations of these variables were used to explore the qualities of different models. However, it does not provide information on any preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning that may have been performed on the data before training the models.
