Answer:::
The criteria used to determine when training is complete is early stopping, which is used to prevent overfitting. The optimizer Adam is used with an initial learning rate of 1×10^-4 and a decay of 1×10^-7. Typically, the model trains between 10 and 15 epochs before training ceases, where each epoch takes roughly 1 minute on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU.
