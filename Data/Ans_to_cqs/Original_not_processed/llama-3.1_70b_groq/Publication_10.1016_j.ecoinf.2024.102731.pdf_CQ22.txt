Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its performance evaluation metrics. The context appears to be related to landscape ecology and spatial analysis, with metrics such as patch area, patch density, core area index, and contiguity index being used to analyze landscape patterns. Additionally, statistical metrics such as the Mann-Kendall test, Sen's slope, and p-value are mentioned, but these are not related to evaluating the performance of a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
