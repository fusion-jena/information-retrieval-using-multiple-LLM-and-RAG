Answer: 

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model include:

1. Average Precision (AP): This metric is used to evaluate the accuracy of object detection models. Specifically, AP0.5:0.95 represents the AP calculated over an IoU range from 0.5 to 0.95 in increments of 0.05, while AP0.5 refers to the AP at a 50% IoU threshold.

2. Mean Average Precision (mAP): This metric is the mean of all AP values, as defined in Eq. (13). It provides an overall assessment of the model's performance across various object classes.

3. Precision: This metric is used to evaluate the model's ability to correctly identify objects. The precision metric is shown in Fig. 19 for the Wild Animal Facing Extinction dataset (WAD), Fishmarket dataset, and MS COCO 2017 dataset.

4. Frames Per Second (FPS): This metric measures the model's speed, encompassing preprocessing, inference, and non-maximum suppression speeds. It provides an overall assessment of the model's efficiency in real-time applications.

5. Floating Point Operations (FLOPs): This metric quantifies the computational complexity of the model, calculated considering the convolutional kernel size, the number of input and output channels, and the feature map's height and width.

These metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance, including its accuracy, speed, and computational efficiency.
