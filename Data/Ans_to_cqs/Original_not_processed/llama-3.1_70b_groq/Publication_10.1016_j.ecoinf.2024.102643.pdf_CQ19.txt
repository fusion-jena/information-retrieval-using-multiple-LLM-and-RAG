Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The context only mentions the use of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) as one of the modeling techniques, but it does not provide information on the frameworks used to implement it. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
