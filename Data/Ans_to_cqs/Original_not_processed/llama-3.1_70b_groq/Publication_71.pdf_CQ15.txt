Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. However, it does provide information on the training parameters used in DeepLabV3+, which includes the learning policy, base learning rate, learning rate decay factor, and momentum.

According to Table 1, the learning policy used is "Poly", which is a polynomial learning rate schedule. The base learning rate is set to 0.0001, and the learning rate decay factor is 0.1. The momentum is set to 0.9. These parameters suggest that the optimization technique used is likely a variant of stochastic gradient descent with momentum, but the specific optimizer (e.g., SGD, Adam) is not explicitly mentioned.

Therefore, while we can infer some information about the optimization technique used, we cannot provide a definitive answer to the query.
