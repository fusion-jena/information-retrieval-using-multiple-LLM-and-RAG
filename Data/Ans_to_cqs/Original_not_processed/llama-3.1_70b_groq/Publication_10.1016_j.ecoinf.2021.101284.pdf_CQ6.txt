Answer: 

According to the provided context, one preprocessing step mentioned is standardization (Williamson and Piattoeva, 2019). This is a type of normalization that allows changing the scope of individual variables so that they are presented in a similar numerical range. The transformation preserves the distance relations between individual data. The standardization formula is given as:

xnew_j,i = (xj,i - mi) / stdi

where xj,i is the original value, mi is the mean, and stdi is the standard deviation.

No other preprocessing steps, such as cleaning or scaling, are mentioned in the provided context. However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of deep learning algorithms in other studies (e.g., Castillo, 2020), but it does not provide information on the specific preprocessing steps used in those studies.
