Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. The context appears to be focused on traditional machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Gradient Boosting, and their respective hyperparameters.

However, it does mention an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in Table 1, which is a type of deep learning model. The hyperparameters tuned for the ANN are:

* Hidden layer: 1-5
* Neurons per layer: 5-100
* Threshold: 0.01-10

But it does not provide information on the learning rate or optimizer used in the ANN. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a complete answer to the query.
