Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any information about model training, postprocessing steps, saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices. The context appears to be related to data collection and processing, specifically in the context of ecosystem carbon uptake and process networks. It discusses the use of TPINet, a process network approach, to analyze the interactions between variables in a pine-dominated ecosystem.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not related to the provided context.
