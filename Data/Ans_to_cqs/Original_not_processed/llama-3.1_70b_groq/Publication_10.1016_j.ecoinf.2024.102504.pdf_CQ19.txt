Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models. The context mentions the use of deep learning models, such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), but does not provide information on the frameworks used to implement these models. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
