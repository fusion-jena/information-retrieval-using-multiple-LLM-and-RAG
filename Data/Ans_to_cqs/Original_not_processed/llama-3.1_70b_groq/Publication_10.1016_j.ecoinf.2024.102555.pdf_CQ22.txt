Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The context appears to be a list of references related to environmental and ecological studies, with a brief mention of a study on "Verification of novel integrations of swarm intelligence algorithms into deep learning neural network for flood susceptibility mapping" (J. Hydrol. 581, 124379). However, it does not provide details on the evaluation metrics used in this study. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
