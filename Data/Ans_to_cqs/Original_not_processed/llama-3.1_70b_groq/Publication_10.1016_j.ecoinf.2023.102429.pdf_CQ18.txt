Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is based on the Root-Mean-Square Error of Cross-Validation (RMSEcv) values. According to the context, parameter values were selected based on the RMSEcv values (De Santana et al., 2021). This suggests that the model performance was evaluated using cross-validation, and the RMSEcv values were used to select the optimal parameters for the model.
