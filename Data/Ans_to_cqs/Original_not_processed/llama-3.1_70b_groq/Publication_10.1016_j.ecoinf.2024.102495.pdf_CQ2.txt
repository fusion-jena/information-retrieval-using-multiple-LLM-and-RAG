Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information given, it can be inferred that the data format used is likely audio. 

The context mentions "voice feature extraction" and "sound data" as inputs for the deep learning algorithm, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This suggests that the data format is related to audio. Additionally, the context mentions the use of parameters such as the number of bands, number of frames, hop length, and length of the FFT window, which are typical parameters used in audio processing. 

There is no mention of image, video, or CSV data formats in the provided context. Therefore, based on the available information, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is likely audio.
