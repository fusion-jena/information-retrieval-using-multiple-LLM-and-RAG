Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or any specific type of neural network architecture such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. The text appears to be discussing machine learning models, specifically bagging and random forests, but it does not delve into deep learning models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the given context.
