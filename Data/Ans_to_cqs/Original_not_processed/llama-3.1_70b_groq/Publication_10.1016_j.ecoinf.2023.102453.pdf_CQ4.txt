Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context only mentions that the training dataset could be pre-processed, and that image resizing was used to make the images suitable for the input image resolution required for the selected models. It does not provide information on other data augmentation techniques that may have been applied.
