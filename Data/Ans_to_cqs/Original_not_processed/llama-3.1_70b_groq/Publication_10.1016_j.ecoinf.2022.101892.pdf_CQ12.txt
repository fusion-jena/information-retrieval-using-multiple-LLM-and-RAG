Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, the text mentions the use of various CNN architectures, including ResNet, RepVGG, and MobileNet-V3, as backbone networks for the experiments. These models are used for image classification tasks and are trained on the ImageNet dataset before being fine-tuned on the PAD Full and PAD Lite datasets.
