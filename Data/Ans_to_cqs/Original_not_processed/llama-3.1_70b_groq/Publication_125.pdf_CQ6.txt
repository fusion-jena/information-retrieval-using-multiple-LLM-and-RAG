Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention data augmentation in section 4.2.1, which is a common preprocessing technique used to artificially increase the size of the training dataset by applying random transformations to the existing data. 

Additionally, the context mentions transfer learning, which involves using pre-trained models as a starting point for training a new model. In transfer learning, the pre-trained model's weights are often fine-tuned with the new dataset, but the context does not provide information on the specific preprocessing steps used.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we can only confirm that data augmentation is mentioned as a preprocessing technique, but we do not have information on other preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.
