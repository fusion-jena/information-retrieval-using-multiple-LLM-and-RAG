Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily discusses the importance of high-quality data for automated annotation and analysis, the limitations of offline annotation, and the potential of online annotation and analysis. It also mentions the use of machine learning, computer vision, and artificial intelligence for automated annotation and analysis.

However, the context does mention that most annotation is still done by hand or at least partly by hand, and that there is a lack of standardization and convergence of methods, which makes full automation too expensive and cumbersome to be worthwhile.

One relevant reference mentioned in the context is the paper by Egnor and Branson (2016), which discusses the use of machine learning for automated annotation, but it does not provide specific details on the annotation techniques used.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
