Answer:

The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the provided context is primarily for weed detection and classification in agricultural settings. Specifically, the models are designed for:

1. Weed detection: The models, such as YOLOX and YOLOv8, are used for detecting weeds in images, which can be useful for precision farming and automated weeding systems.
2. Weed classification: Some models, like the ones mentioned in the papers by Olsen et al. (2019) and Wang et al. (2022), are designed for classifying different species of weeds, which can aid in targeted weeding and crop management.
3. Segmentation: A few papers, such as the one by Weyler et al. (2023), mention the use of deep learning models for crop and weed segmentation, which involves separating weeds from crops in images.

The overall goal of these models is to enable efficient and accurate weed management in agricultural fields, reducing the need for manual labor and minimizing the environmental impact of herbicides.
