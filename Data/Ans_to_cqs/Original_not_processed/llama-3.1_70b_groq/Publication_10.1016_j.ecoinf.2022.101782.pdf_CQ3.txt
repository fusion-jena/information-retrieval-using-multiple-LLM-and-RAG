Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of citizen science data, social media posts, and image metadata to identify red kite sightings, but it does not provide details on the specific annotation techniques employed.

However, it is mentioned that the model was trained on a dataset of images, and that the best model was selected based on minimal validation loss. It is also mentioned that the model was evaluated on an independent test set of 2060 images, with 950 of these images being true positive red kite images. This suggests that the dataset was annotated with labels indicating the presence or absence of red kites, but the specific annotation techniques used are not specified.

Therefore, I do not know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.
