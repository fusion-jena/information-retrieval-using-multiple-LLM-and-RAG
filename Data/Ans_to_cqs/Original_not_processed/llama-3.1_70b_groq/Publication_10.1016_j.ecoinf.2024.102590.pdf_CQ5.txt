Answer: I don't know. The provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. It only mentions that the results of the study can be used as a baseline for future LULC analysis performed with other methodologies, such as deep learning CNN, and that integrating large-area historical datasets can serve as a resource for better understanding long-term landscape changes. However, it does not provide information on the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
