Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does mention that manual image annotation was indispensable for creating a dataset, and that special software was used to make annotations. Additionally, it mentions the use of Labelbox for annotating images.

It can be inferred that the annotation technique used is likely semantic segmentation, as the context mentions the use of datasets such as COCO and Cityscapes, which are commonly used for object detection and segmentation tasks. The context also mentions the use of IoU (Intersection over Union) as a metric, which is commonly used to evaluate the performance of semantic segmentation models.

However, without more specific information, it is not possible to determine the exact annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
