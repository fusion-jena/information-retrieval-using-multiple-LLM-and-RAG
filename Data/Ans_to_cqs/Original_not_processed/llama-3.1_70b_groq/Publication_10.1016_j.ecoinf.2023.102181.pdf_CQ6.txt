Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on machine learning models for predicting soil classes and map validation, but it does not provide information on deep learning models or their preprocessing steps.

However, I can provide some general information on common preprocessing steps involved in machine learning and deep learning models. These steps may include:

* Normalization: scaling numeric data to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model.
* Scaling: transforming data to have zero mean and unit variance, which can improve model performance.
* Cleaning: handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting errors in the data.
* Feature engineering: transforming and selecting relevant features to improve model performance.

But, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in the context provided, and I don't want to make any assumptions or provide incorrect information.
