Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a research study on ecological informatics, specifically focusing on NDVI data and its processing. It discusses the data sources, datasets used, and the authors' contributions, but it does not provide information on preprocessing steps for deep learning models.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model based on the provided context.
