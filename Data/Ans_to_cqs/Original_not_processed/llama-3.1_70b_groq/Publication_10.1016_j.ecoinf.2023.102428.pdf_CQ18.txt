Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the information provided in Table 7, it appears that the model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Training RMS (Root Mean Square) and Testing RMS, as well as Accuracy Rate and Skill measure (%). The Acceptable RMS value is set to 0.01, which suggests that the model's performance is considered acceptable if the RMS value is below this threshold. Additionally, the model is trained for a fixed number of iterations (10,000), which implies that the model's performance is monitored during training to determine when to stop training. However, the specific strategy or criteria used to monitor the model's performance during training is not clearly stated.
