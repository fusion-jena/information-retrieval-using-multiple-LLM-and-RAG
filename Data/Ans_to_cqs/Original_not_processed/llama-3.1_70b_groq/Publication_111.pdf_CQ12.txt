Answer:::
The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), specifically a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model. The proposed architecture combines the GRU with a regular neural network, where the GRU layer is preceded by an input layer and followed by a fully connected layer. This model is used for forecasting Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Significant Wave Height (SWH) in the Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency dataset.
