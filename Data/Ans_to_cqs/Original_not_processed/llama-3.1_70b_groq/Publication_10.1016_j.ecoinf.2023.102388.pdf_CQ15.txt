Answer:::
The optimization algorithm used in the deep learning pipeline is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). Specifically, in the no-overfitting setting, SGD is used with a learning rate of 0.0001 and a weight decay of 0.5. In another instance, SGD is used with a momentum of 0.9 and a learning rate of 0.001. Additionally, a decay of 0.5 is applied every 512 iterations. There is no mention of Adam or other optimization techniques being used in the provided context.
