Answer:::
The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are accuracy, AUC (Area Under the Curve), and MAE (Mean Absolute Error). According to the text, the model's performance is evaluated using these three metrics during the cross-validation process, and the model with the highest AUC is chosen in case of small discrepancies among the metrics. Additionally, the text mentions that the optimal model achieved a testing accuracy of 96.0% and an AUC of 0.99.
