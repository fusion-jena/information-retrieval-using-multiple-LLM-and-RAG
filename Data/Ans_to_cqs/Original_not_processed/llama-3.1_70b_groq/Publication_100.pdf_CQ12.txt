Answer: 
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the description of the model architecture, which mentions the use of convolutional layers, batch normalization layers, ReLU activations, and grouped convolutions. The text also explicitly mentions the use of the discrete convolution operator, which is a key component of CNNs. Additionally, the model architecture is described as transforming inputs into outputs with a series of simple transformations, which is consistent with the typical architecture of a CNN.
