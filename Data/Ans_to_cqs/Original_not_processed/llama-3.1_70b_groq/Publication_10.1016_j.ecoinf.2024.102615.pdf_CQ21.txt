Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the model optimization process, data partition, and the introduction of the MLP model. It provides details on the hyperparameters tuning ranges, the optimal MLP architecture, and parameters but does not discuss postprocessing steps. Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training.
