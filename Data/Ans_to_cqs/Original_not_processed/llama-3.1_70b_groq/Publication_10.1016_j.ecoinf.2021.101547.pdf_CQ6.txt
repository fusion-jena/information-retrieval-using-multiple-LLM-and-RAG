Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily discusses the importance of choosing an optimal mini-batch size, the challenges of using deep learning, and the process of training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

However, it is generally common practice in deep learning to perform some form of preprocessing on the data before training a model. This can include techniques such as normalization, scaling, data augmentation, and cleaning to prepare the data for the model. But without more specific information, I cannot provide a detailed answer to this question.

Therefore, my answer is that I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model based on the provided context.
