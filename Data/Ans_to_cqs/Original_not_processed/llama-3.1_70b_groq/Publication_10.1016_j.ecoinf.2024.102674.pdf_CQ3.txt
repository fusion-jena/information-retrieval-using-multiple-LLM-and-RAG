Answer:::
I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to climate modeling, species distribution models, and statistical analysis, but it does not discuss data annotation techniques or deep learning pipelines. The only mention of a deep learning-related topic is a reference to a paper titled "Wind-topo: downscaling near-surface wind fields to high-resolution topography in highly complex terrain with deep learning" (Dujardin and Lehning, 2022), but this paper is not discussed in detail, and its contents are not elaborated upon. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide an answer to the query.
