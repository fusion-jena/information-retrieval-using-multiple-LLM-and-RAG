Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. However, it does mention a few instances of randomness and iterative processes in the context of clustering algorithms and neural networks.

For example, the provided context mentions a clustering algorithm that involves randomly selecting cluster centers (step 1 in the algorithm). It also mentions iterative processes, such as recalculating cluster centers and reassigning features to clusters.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of various neural network architectures, such as VGG-19, ResNet50, and InceptionV3, but it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in these architectures.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
