Answer: The text does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. It discusses the performance of different machine learning models, such as BTS-ANFIS, ANN, and SVM, and compares their performance using evaluation measurements. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during the training process.
