Answer: 
The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context focuses on the features used to predict the conservation status of unevaluated orchid species, including geographic, climatic, biome, and anthropogenic features. It also mentions the implementation of a deep neural network algorithm (IUC-NN) as an R package, but it does not provide information on the data annotation techniques used.
