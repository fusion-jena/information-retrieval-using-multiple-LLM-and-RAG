Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It mentions that the AI platform operates on a Central Processing Unit (CPU) or Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and uses MXNet to provide the essential modules and functions required for the program operation. Additionally, it mentions that the deeplabv3 model was developed by Google, but it does not imply that the Google Cloud platform was used to deploy the model. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
