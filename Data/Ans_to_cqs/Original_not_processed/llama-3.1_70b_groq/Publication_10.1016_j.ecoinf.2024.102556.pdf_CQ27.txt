Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The text discusses the performance of different models, such as SORT and Deep SORT, and the use of YOLOv7 as a baseline model, but it does not provide information on model deployment.

The context mentions the use of an airborne computer, which suggests that the model may have been deployed on a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) platform, but the specific details of the deployment process are not provided. Additionally, there is no mention of model serialization or other deployment-related processes.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this query.
