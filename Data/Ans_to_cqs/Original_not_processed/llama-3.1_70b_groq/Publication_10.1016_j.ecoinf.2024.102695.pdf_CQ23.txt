Answer: To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the dataset was divided chronologically into training, validation, and test sets. Specifically, 70% of the data was allocated to the training set, 10% to the validation set, and 20% to the test set. This allocation strategy was chosen to simulate real-world scenarios and prevent data snooping bias. By doing so, the data in the validation and test sets differed from the training set data, which helped to enhance the model's generalizability. Additionally, an early stopping strategy was implemented to prevent overfitting issues.
