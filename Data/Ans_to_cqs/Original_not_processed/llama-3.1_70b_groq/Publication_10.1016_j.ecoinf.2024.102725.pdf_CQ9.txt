Answer: I don't know. The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline or where it is available. It only mentions the data access link for the MODIS_061_MCD43A4 dataset, which is hosted on the Google Earth Engine platform (https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/MODIS_061_MCD43A4). However, this is not the data repository of the deep learning pipeline, but rather the source of the satellite data used in the study.
