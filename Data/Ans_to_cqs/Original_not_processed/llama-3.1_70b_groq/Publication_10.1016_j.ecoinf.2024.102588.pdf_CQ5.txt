Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context primarily discusses the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in aquatic ecosystem health estimation and mentions various studies that have used CNNs for tasks like image classification, object detection, and natural language processing. However, it does not provide information on the specific datasets used in these studies. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
