Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate and optimizer. The context appears to be a collection of references and tables related to machine learning, remote sensing, and land use classification, but it does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
