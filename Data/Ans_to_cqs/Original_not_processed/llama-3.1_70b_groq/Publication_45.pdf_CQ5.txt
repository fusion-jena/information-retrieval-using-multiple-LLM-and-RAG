Answer:::
The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. It appears that the context is focused on the application of deep learning in ecological prediction, specifically in the context of forest disturbance and bark beetle outbreaks in conifer forests. The context mentions that the authors provide a reproducible example, including code and data, for designing, training, and applying deep neural networks for ecological prediction, but it does not specify the datasets used.
