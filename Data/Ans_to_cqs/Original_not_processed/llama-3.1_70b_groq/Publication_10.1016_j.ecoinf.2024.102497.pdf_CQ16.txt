Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the implementation of CART and Random Forest regression models, including the selection of model parameters and their optimization.

However, it does mention that the model parameters were fine-tuned to "prevent overfitting and minimize cross-validation error in our model." This suggests that cross-validation error may have been used as a metric to evaluate the model's performance during training, but it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete.

Therefore, I do not know the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete, as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
