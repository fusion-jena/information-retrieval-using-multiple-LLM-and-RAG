Answer: The text does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention that the dataset was divided into 70% for training, 10% for validation, and 20% for testing purposes. This suggests that the model's performance was likely evaluated on the validation set during training, but the specific strategy or metrics used for monitoring performance are not specified.
