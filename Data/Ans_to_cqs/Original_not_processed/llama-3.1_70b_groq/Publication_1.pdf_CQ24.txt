Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The text primarily focuses on the application of deep learning for large-scale biodiversity monitoring, its benefits, and case studies. It does not delve into the technical details of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
