Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses the comparison of SLSTM and SGRU models, their performance, and the advantages of using GRU models over LSTM models, but it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training the model.
