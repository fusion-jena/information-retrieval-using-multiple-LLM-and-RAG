Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the data formats used are likely to be image-based, specifically remote sensing (RS) data, such as satellite images. This is evident from the mention of Sentinel-2 time series, hyperspectral data, and high-resolution remote sensing images. Additionally, the context mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which are commonly used for image and sequential data processing, respectively. Therefore, it is likely that the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are image-based, but the exact format (e.g., TIFF, JPEG, etc.) is not specified.
