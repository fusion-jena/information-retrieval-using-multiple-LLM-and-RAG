Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the mention of "detect and identify/classify organisms in marine imagery" and the reference to Durden et al. (2021) and Orenstein et al. (2020), it can be inferred that the deep learning model is likely used for classification and identification of organisms in marine images. The context also mentions the use of images and annotations as training data for the development of artificial intelligence tools, which further supports the idea that the model is used for classification and identification tasks. However, without more specific information, it is not possible to determine the exact purpose of the model.
