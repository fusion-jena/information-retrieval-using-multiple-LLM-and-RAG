Answer:::

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models in the provided context are:

1. Accuracy: This is the proportion of correctly classified instances out of all instances in the dataset. The accuracy of the models is reported in Table III, with the best-performing model, Inception-V3, achieving an accuracy of 94%.

2. Macro Average F1-score: This is a measure of the model's performance on multiple classes. It is the average of the F1-scores for each class, where the F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. The macro average F1-score is reported in the text, with the best-performing model, Inception-V3, achieving a macro average F1-score of 0.93.

3. F1-score for each class: The F1-score for each class is reported in the text, with the best-performing model, Inception-V3, achieving F1-scores above 0.92 for all classes except 'other', which had an F1-score of 0.79.

Additionally, the confusion matrix (Table V) and ROC curves (Figure 9) are also used to evaluate the performance of the TFLite Inception-V3 model. However, precision and recall are not explicitly reported in the provided context.
