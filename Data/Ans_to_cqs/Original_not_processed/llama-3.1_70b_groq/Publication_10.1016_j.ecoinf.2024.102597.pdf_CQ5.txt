Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. In fact, the context mentions that deep learning algorithms were considered, but the limited number of samples was not conducive to deep learning. The context does mention the use of various machine learning algorithms, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), neural networks, and ensemble learning, but it does not provide information on the specific datasets used.
