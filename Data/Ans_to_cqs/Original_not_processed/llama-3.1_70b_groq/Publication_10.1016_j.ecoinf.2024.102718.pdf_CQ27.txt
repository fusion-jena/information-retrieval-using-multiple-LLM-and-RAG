Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. The context primarily focuses on the experimental setup, training parameters, and performance evaluation of the BEiT model. It does not provide information on the deployment process. Therefore, I don't know the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
