Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. In fact, the text states that deep learning algorithms were not used in the study due to the limited number of samples, which is not conducive to deep learning. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
