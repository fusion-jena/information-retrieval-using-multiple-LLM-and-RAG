Answer:::
The provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. It only mentions the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Random Forests (RF) as machine learning methods, but it does not provide information about the frameworks used to implement these methods. Therefore, I don't know which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model.
