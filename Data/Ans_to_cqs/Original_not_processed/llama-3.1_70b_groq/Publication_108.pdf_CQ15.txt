Answer:::

The provided context mentions the use of the Adam optimization technique in the deep learning pipeline. This is evident from the reference to Kingma, D.P.; Ba, J. "Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization" (arXiv 2015, arXiv:1412.6980). 

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a learning rate in the hyperparameter fine-tuning results (Table 1), which is a common parameter in many optimization techniques, including Adam. However, it does not explicitly mention other optimization techniques such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent).

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, which is an optimization technique, but it is not clear if it is used in the deep learning pipeline. The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is mentioned in the context of a reference (Mor√©, J.J. "The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm: implementation and theory"), but it is not explicitly linked to the deep learning pipeline.

In summary, the provided context confirms the use of the Adam optimization technique in the deep learning pipeline, but does not provide information on the use of other optimization techniques such as SGD.
