Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the challenges of applying deep learning to natural systems, the need for large training datasets, and the potential of self-supervised learning and semi-supervised frameworks to address these challenges. It also mentions the use of a Retinanet framework for object detection and a resnet-50 classification backbone pretrained on the ImageNet dataset. However, it does not provide information on the specific optimization techniques used, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam.
