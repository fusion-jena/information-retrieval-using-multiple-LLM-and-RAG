Answer: 
The provided context does not explicitly state the method used to optimize the hyperparameters of the model. However, it does mention that "meticulous manual tuning of hyperparameters was conducted to achieve optimal model performance." This suggests that the hyperparameters were optimized through manual tuning, but the specific method used (e.g., grid search, random search) is not specified.
