Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is object detection, specifically for image processing and analysis. The text mentions the use of a compact network incorporating a non-local layer for extracting long-distance features to predict parameters for the image processing module. Additionally, it mentions the use of a deep learning model for image adaptive enhancement modules and the evaluation of models using Average Precision (AP) as a performance metric, which is commonly used in object detection tasks. Furthermore, the text references the YOLOv3 model, which is a well-known object detection algorithm. Therefore, the primary purpose of the deep learning model in this context is object detection.
