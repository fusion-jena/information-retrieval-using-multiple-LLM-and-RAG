Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily discusses the architecture and components of the DeepMeerkat model, including dropout, fully connected layers, and softmax layers. It also mentions the training process and evaluation metrics, but does not provide specific details on the stopping criteria for training.

However, it does mention that the model is designed to be conservative, with a high threshold for retaining frames (acceptance value = 0.1), which prioritizes minimizing false negatives. This suggests that the model may be trained until it reaches a certain level of accuracy or confidence, but the exact criteria for determining when training is complete are not specified.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to this question.
