Answer:::
The data is split into training, validation, and test sets based on geographical division. Each ALS project is divided into horizontal stripes of width 900 pixels (9.0 km). Within each stripe, the northernmost 5.4 km is assigned to the training set, the next 1.8 km is assigned to the validation set, and the southernmost 1.8 km is assigned to the test set. This division ensures that the different regions and modalities in each ALS area are evenly distributed between the three sets. The resulting split is approximately 60% for training, 20% for validation, and 20% for testing, following the commonly used "60-20-20" ratio in machine learning studies.
