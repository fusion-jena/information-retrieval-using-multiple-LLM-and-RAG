Answer:::
The dataset used in this work is the "One-hundred plant species leaves data set" from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset contains images of plant leaves from 100 different species. The dataset is not large enough for deep learning, so data augmentation was used to enlarge the dataset and overcome the problem of overfitting.
