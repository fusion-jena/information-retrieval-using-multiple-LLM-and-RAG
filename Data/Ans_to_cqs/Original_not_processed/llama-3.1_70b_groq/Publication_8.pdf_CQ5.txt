Answer:::
The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the provided context is the ImageNet dataset. According to the text, the ImageNet dataset was used for pre-training the model weights, which were then fine-tuned during training using the annotated herbarium scan dataset. The ImageNet dataset is a large-scale hierarchical image database, as described in the reference by Deng et al. (2009). There is no mention of MNIST or CIFAR datasets being used in the deep learning pipeline.
