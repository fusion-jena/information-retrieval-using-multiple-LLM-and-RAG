Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention a "bug-picture database" and a "6570-picture dataset" that was used for training and testing algorithms. This suggests that the raw data consists of images of bugs, but the method of collecting these images is not specified. It can be inferred that the images may have been collected through some form of observation or sampling of bugs, but the exact method is not provided.
