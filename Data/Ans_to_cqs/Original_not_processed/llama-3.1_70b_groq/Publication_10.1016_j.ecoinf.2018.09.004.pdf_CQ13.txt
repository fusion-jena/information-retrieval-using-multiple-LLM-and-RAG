Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. The context appears to be related to machine learning algorithms, specifically discussing Support Vector Machines (SVMs), K-nearest neighbors, and Decision Trees, but it does not provide information on deep learning models or their hyperparameters.
