Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. The context appears to be discussing a statistical model, specifically a penalized loss function with an L1 penalty for shrinkage estimation and variable selection. The hyperparameters mentioned in the context are τ and ϕ, which are tuning parameters for the L1 penalty and the root trimmed mean squared prediction error (RTMSPE), respectively. There is no mention of a learning rate or optimizer, which are typically associated with deep learning models.
