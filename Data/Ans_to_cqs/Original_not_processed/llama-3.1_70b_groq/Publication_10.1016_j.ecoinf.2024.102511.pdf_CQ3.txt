Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning and deep learning in bioacoustic classification, particularly in the context of marine mammal research. It mentions the use of deep neural networks and the importance of significant sample sizes for all classes, but it does not delve into the specifics of data annotation techniques. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this question.
