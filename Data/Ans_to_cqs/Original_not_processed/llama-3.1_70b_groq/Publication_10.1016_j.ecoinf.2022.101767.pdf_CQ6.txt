Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to data extraction and analysis of YouTube videos displaying wild birds, but it does not provide information on the preprocessing steps for training a deep learning model.

However, it does mention that a machine learning algorithm was used to select important video factors, but it does not provide details on the preprocessing steps involved in this process.

Therefore, I do not know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model in this context.
