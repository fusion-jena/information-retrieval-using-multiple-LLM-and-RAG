Answer:::
The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are Overall Accuracy (OA), Producer Accuracy (PA), User Accuracy (UA), and the F1-score. 

The Overall Accuracy (OA) is calculated by taking the sum of the diagonal of the confusion matrix. The Producer Accuracy (PA) is calculated by dividing the number of well-ranked individuals by the sum of the column in the confusion matrix. The User Accuracy (UA) is calculated by dividing the number of well-ranked individuals by the sum of the line in the confusion matrix. 

The F1-score is calculated as the harmonic mean of precision and recall, allowing for equal importance to be given to both Producer Accuracy (PA) and User Accuracy (UA).
