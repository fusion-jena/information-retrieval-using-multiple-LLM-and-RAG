Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, time series analysis, and wildlife management, but it does not discuss deep learning or data preprocessing techniques.

However, I can provide some general information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. These techniques include:

* Stratified splitting: dividing the data into subsets based on the class labels to ensure that each subset has a similar proportion of samples from each class.
* Oversampling: creating additional copies of the minority class samples to balance the class distribution.
* Undersampling: reducing the number of majority class samples to balance the class distribution.
* Diverse data collection: collecting data from diverse sources or environments to reduce bias.

These techniques are commonly used in machine learning and deep learning pipelines to address class imbalance and data bias issues. However, without more specific information, I cannot provide a more detailed answer.

If you have any further questions or would like more information on these techniques, please let me know.
