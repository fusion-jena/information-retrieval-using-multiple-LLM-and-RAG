Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention data augmentation techniques that were applied to the remaining training and validation samples after excluding samples with no-data values. The six data augmentation techniques mentioned are not specified in detail, but they were used to augment the data for training and validation.

Additionally, the context mentions that the complete samples set was randomly split into 70% for training and 30% for validation. This random splitting may help to reduce bias in the data, but it is not a specific technique for addressing data bias.

The context does not mention stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection as techniques used to address data bias. Therefore, it is not possible to confirm if these techniques were used or not.

In summary, the context mentions data augmentation techniques and random splitting of the data, but it does not provide detailed information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
