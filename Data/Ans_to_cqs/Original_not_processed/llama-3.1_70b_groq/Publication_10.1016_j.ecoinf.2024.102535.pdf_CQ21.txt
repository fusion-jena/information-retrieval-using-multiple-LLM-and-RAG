Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context mainly discusses the experimental setup, network architectures, and performance metrics, but it does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
