Answer: 
The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or the specific data formats used in such a pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it appears that the study utilizes remote sensing data, specifically NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data, which is typically in the form of raster images. Additionally, the study mentions the use of various drivers related to climate, terrain, and human activity, which are listed in Table 1. These drivers include data types such as continuous variables (e.g., temperature, precipitation) and categorical variables (e.g., landform type). The data is also processed and analyzed using GIS software, such as ArcGIS Pro 3.0.2. However, the specific data formats used in the pipeline are not explicitly mentioned.
