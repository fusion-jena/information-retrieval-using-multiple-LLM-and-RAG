Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only discusses the training phase of the Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN) and the selection of optimal predictor variables, but it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed.

However, it does mention that the trained network was "subsequently used for feed-forward predictions on continuous spatial data." This suggests that the model was used to make predictions on new, unseen data, but the details of how the model was deployed and integrated into a larger system are not provided.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to answer the query about the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
