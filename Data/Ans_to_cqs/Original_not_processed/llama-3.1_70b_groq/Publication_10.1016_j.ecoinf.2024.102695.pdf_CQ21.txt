Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the model architecture, training setup, and experimental results. It does mention the calculation of model forecasting performance metrics in Section 4.1, but it does not provide details on the specific metrics calculated or any other postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrices.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query. If you have any further context or clarification, I would be happy to try and assist you further.
