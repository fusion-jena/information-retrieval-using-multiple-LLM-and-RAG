Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss data augmentation as a technique to increase the amount of data available for training the proposed CNN model without actually acquiring new data.

Data augmentation is mentioned as a technique to expand the dataset into a larger one more appropriate for DL model training. The context lists various strategies used for data augmentation, including rotation, zoom, horizontal and vertical shift, brightness scaling, and flipping. These techniques can potentially help reduce data bias by increasing the diversity of the dataset.

However, the context does not specifically mention techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection as methods to address data bias. Therefore, it cannot be determined from the provided context whether these techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
