Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The context mentions a paper titled "Object retrieval with deep convolutional" by Mohedano et al. (2017), which suggests that the authors used deep convolutional networks, but it does not specify the framework used to implement these networks. The context also mentions a paper by Cohen and Shashua (2017) that discusses the inductive bias of Deep Convolutional Networks, but again, it does not mention the specific framework used. Therefore, I do not know which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model.
