Answer:::

The provided context does not specifically mention the evaluation metrics used for a deep learning model. However, it does mention the evaluation metrics used for the machine learning models, specifically the Random Forest (RF) model and Support Vector Regression (SVR) model.

For the RF model, the performance evaluation metrics mentioned are:

* R-squared values (0.66, 0.70, and 0.81)
* RMAE (Root Mean Absolute Error) of 14.33%
* RRMSE (Root Relative Mean Squared Error) of 22.23%

Additionally, the context provides tables with values for MAE (Mean Absolute Error), RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), and other metrics, but it does not specify which model these metrics correspond to.

For the SVR model, the context mentions the importance of selecting the appropriate kernel function and optimizing the "C" parameter, but it does not provide specific evaluation metrics.

Therefore, I do not know the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model, as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
