Answer:::

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows:

* Learning rate: 0.0001
* Optimizer: Adam optimizer
* Exponential decay rate of first-moment estimation: 0.9
* Exponential decay rate of second-moment estimation: 0.999
* Epsilon (a positive scalar value): 1e-08
* Batch size: 32

These hyperparameters were used in conjunction with the mini-batch gradient descent algorithm and the Inception-ResNet-v2 model. Additionally, the model employed fivefold cross-validation and early stopping to prevent overfitting and optimize hyperparameters efficiently.
