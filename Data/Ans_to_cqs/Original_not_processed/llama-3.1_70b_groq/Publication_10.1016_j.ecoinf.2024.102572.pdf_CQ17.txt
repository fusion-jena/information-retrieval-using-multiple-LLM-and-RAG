Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on land use and land cover (LULC) data, Sentinel-2 satellite photos, and forest fire analysis using machine learning techniques and geospatial computations. There is no mention of deep learning pipelines or regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
