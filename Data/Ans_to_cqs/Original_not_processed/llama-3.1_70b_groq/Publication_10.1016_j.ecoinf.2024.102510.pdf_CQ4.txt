Answer:::
The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, as mentioned in the context, include:

1. Horizontal and vertical translations: This involves shifting the images within a range of -30 to 30 pixels, allowing for random shifts.
2. Shear distortion: This involves applying a shear transformation within a range of -5 to 5, representing maximum distortion to the left and right.

These techniques were applied to the existing dataset to expand it and reduce overfitting, improving the generalization of the deep learning models. The context does not mention flipping, rotating, or scaling as data augmentation techniques used in this specific study.
