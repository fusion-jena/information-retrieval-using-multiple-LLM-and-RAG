Answer:

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning models are as follows:

For the Unet model:
- Initial learning rate: 0.01 (further refined via iterative testing)
- Number of iterations: 150
- Batch size: 4
- Downsampling multiplier: 8
- Optimizer: SGD
- Activation function: ReLu
- Loss function: Dice loss function

For the Deeplabv3+ model:
- Initial learning rate: 0.0001 (fine-tuned through iterative testing)
- Number of iterations: 150
- Batch size: 2
- Optimizer: Adam
- Activation function: ReLu
- Loss function: Dice loss function

Note that the hyperparameters for the Pspnet model are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
