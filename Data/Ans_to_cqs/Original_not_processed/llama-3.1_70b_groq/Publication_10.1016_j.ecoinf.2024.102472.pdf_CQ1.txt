Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning algorithms, specifically artificial neural networks, for tasks such as carbon stock estimation, forest biomass estimation, and hyperspectral image classification.

However, it can be inferred that remote sensing data from satellites like Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel-2 are used as input data for some of the studies mentioned in the context. For example, the study by Uniyal et al. (2022) uses Landsat 8 OLI data for quantifying carbon sequestration by urban forests. Similarly, the study by Wang et al. (2022) uses Sentinel-2 data for estimating forest LAI.

Additionally, some studies mention the use of multispectral and SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data, which are likely collected by satellite or airborne sensors.

It is also possible that other data sources, such as field surveys or public datasets, are used in some of the studies, but this information is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, while we can infer that remote sensing data from satellites are used in some studies, we cannot provide a comprehensive answer to the question without more information.
