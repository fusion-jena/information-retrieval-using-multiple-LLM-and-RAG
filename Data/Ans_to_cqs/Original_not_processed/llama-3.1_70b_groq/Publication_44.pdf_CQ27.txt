Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context discusses the training procedure, including the adaptation of pre-trained models, data augmentation, and hyperparameter tuning, but it does not provide information on model deployment. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
