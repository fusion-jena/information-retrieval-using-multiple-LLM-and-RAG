Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context appears to be focused on machine learning algorithms, ecological data, and river quality assessment, but it does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness in deep learning pipelines.

However, I can provide some general information on this topic. In deep learning, randomness can be introduced through various sources, such as random weight initialization, dropout, and data augmentation. To handle this randomness, researchers often employ techniques like:

1. Seed fixing: Setting a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results.
2. Ensemble methods: Combining the predictions of multiple models trained with different random seeds to reduce variability.
3. Averaging: Taking the average of multiple runs with different random seeds to reduce the effect of randomness.

These strategies can help mitigate the impact of randomness in deep learning pipelines, but the specific approach used often depends on the problem at hand and the researcher's goals.

In the context of the provided references, I couldn't find any specific information on handling randomness in deep learning pipelines. If you're looking for more information on this topic, I recommend consulting additional resources or research papers that focus specifically on deep learning and randomness.
