Answer: The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are based on a proportion of 70:20:10 for training, validation, and testing, respectively. This is mentioned in the context as "training, validation, and testing proportion as 70:20:10 in both the levels". This means that 70% of the data is used for training, 20% for validation, and 10% for testing. Additionally, the data is split into eleven groups based on visual morphological characteristics, and each group consists of several plant species varieties. The context also mentions that consistent ratios are maintained across groups to avoid any potential bias during classification.
