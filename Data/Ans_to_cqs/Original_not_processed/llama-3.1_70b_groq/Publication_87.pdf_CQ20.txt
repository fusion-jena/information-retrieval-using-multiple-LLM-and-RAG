Answer:::
The provided context mentions that the training of the deep learning model was performed on two different machines: a Mac with a 2.4Ghz processor and 64Go memory, and a machine with a GPU. 

It is mentioned that with all pictures and a resnet50, it took 75 minutes per epoch approximately on the Mac, and less than half an hour on the machine with a GPU. This indicates that the machine with a GPU was significantly faster in training the model.

There is no mention of TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) being used for training the model.
