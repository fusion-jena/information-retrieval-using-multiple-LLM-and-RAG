Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. The context appears to be related to environmental and pollution studies, including water pollution control, greenhouse gas emissions, and wastewater treatment. There is no mention of deep learning models or their deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
