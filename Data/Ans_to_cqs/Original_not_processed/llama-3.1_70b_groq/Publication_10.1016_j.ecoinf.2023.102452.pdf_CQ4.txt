Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Flipping, Rotating, or Scaling. The context appears to be focused on various topics related to machine learning, signal processing, and water resources, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of various machine learning models, such as LSTM, CNN, and ConvLSTM, which are commonly used in deep learning pipelines. Additionally, the context mentions the use of techniques such as wavelet transform, Fourier transform, and genetic programming, which are used for signal processing and feature extraction.

If you are looking for information on data augmentation techniques, I would recommend searching for specific research papers or articles that focus on deep learning and computer vision, as these topics are not explicitly covered in the provided context.
