Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models, such as the LSTM model, for land use prediction and optimization. It discusses the performance of these models, their advantages, and their comparison with traditional machine learning models.

However, it does mention the use of a large dataset, as evident from the tables and figures provided, which suggests that the model was trained on a substantial amount of data. Additionally, the context mentions the use of different scenarios and land use types, which could indicate that the model was tested on diverse data.

But, there is no explicit mention of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or other techniques to ensure the generalizability of the model. Therefore, it is unclear what specific measures were taken to ensure the model's generalizability.

It is worth noting that the context appears to be a part of a research paper or a technical report, and it is possible that the authors may have discussed the measures taken to ensure generalizability in other sections of the paper that are not provided in the given context.
