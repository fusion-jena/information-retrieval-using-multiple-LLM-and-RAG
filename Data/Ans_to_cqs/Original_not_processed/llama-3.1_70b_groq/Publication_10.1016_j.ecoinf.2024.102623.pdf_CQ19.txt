Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. It only describes the architecture of the model, including the number of layers, neurons, activation functions, and optimizer used, but does not mention the framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) used to implement the model.
