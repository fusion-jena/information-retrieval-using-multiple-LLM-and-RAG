Unfortunately, the provided context does not provide information on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context appears to be a collection of research papers and articles related to remote sensing, LiDAR data, and machine learning, but it does not provide specific details on model deployment.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
