Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided pieces of context do not mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the challenges of training deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with limited training samples, the concept of overfitting, and the application of transfer learning to overcome these challenges. It also discusses the use of pre-trained models, such as MobileNet, for feature extraction and fine-tuning.

The context does mention that the pre-trained models were trained on 1.4M images from 1000 classes, but it does not specify how these images were collected. It also mentions the use of the ImageNet dataset, but it does not provide information on how the data in this dataset was collected.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
