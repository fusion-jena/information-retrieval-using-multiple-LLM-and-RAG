Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the classification techniques used for large-vocabulary bird species classification from flight calls, specifically comparing a "shallow learning" approach with a deep convolutional neural network combined with data augmentation.

However, it can be inferred that the dataset used in the study consists of 5428 flight calls from 43 different species, but the context does not provide information on how these flight calls were collected. It is possible that the data was collected through field recordings, sensors, or other methods, but this information is not provided in the given context.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
