Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on various topics, including object retrieval, ecology, archaeology, and remote sensing, but it does not provide information on the datasets used in deep learning.

However, it does mention a few papers and studies that may be related to deep learning, such as "Object retrieval with deep convolutional" by Mohedano et al. (2017) and "Deep learning for feature extraction in remote sensing" by Petrovska et al. (2020). But these papers do not mention the specific datasets used in their research.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the question about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
