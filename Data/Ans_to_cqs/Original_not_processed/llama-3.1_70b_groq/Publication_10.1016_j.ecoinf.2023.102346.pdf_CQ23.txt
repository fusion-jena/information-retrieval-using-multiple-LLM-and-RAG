Answer:

To ensure the generalizability of the models, several measures were taken. Firstly, the data was split into training and testing sets, with 70% of the data used for training and 30% for testing. This split was done for each taxon's data records.

Additionally, the models were assessed using 10 K-fold cross-validation and 10-fold bootstrapping. This means that the data was randomly divided into 10 folds, and the model was trained and tested on each fold, with the remaining 9 folds used as the training set. This process was repeated 10 times, providing a robust evaluation of the model's performance.

Furthermore, the models were evaluated using various metrics, including Area Under the Curve (AUC), True Skill Statistics (TSS), Cohen's KAPPA, point-biserial correlation (COR), and Receiver Operator Characteristics (ROC). These metrics provide a comprehensive assessment of the model's performance and generalizability.

It is worth noting that the text does not specifically mention the use of a deep learning model, but rather a range of machine learning algorithms, including Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS), Random Forest (RF), Flexible Discriminant Analysis (FDA), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Generalized Boosting regression Model (GBM), and Maximum-Entropy learning (MAXENT).
