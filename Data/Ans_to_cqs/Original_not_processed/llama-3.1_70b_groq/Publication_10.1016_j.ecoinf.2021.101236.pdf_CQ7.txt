Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The text discusses the model design, architecture, and training process, but it does not provide information on how the data was split into training, testing, and validation sets.

However, it is mentioned that the overall process "mostly followed current best practices in deep learning" which are summarized in (Chollet, 2017). This suggests that the data splitting criteria might be similar to those commonly used in deep learning, such as random splitting or stratified splitting. Nevertheless, without further information, it is impossible to determine the exact criteria used.

Therefore, I must conclude that I don't know the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training in this case.
