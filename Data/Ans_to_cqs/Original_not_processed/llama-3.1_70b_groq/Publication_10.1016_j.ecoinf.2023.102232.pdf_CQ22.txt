Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or any metrics used to evaluate its performance. The context appears to be discussing a hybrid algorithm that combines least squares methods, genetic algorithms, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to estimate model parameters. The metrics mentioned in the context are related to the evaluation of the algorithm's performance, such as the sum of the residual, but not specifically to a deep learning model.
