Answer: Unfortunately, the provided pieces of context do not explicitly mention the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the applications of deep learning in various fields, including bird species identification, soundscape classification, and ecoacoustic data analysis. It discusses the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and other architectures, but does not delve into the specifics of optimization techniques. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
