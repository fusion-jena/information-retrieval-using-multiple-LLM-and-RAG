Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the performance metrics used to evaluate a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, data mining, and association rule mining, but it does not mention deep learning or its performance metrics.

However, I can tell you that common metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, mean squared error, and mean absolute error, among others. But these metrics are not mentioned in the provided context.

If you're looking for information on the performance metrics used in the context of ecological informatics or association rule mining, the provided context mentions the "support" metric, which measures the abundance or frequency of a set of items in a database. But this is not directly related to deep learning model performance evaluation.
