Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate and optimizer. The context primarily discusses the performance of different classification models, including SVM and deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), on a coral classification task. It also provides details on the confusion matrix and various performance metrics, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameters used in the deep learning models.
