Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the study utilized Landsat 8 imagery, which consists of eleven spectral bands with varying spatial resolutions. This suggests that the raw data was collected through remote sensing using satellite imagery.

Additionally, the context mentions that the fire hotspot data analysis was provided by INPE (Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais), which is a Brazilian space agency. This implies that the data may have been collected through a combination of satellite imagery and other remote sensing technologies.

There is no mention of surveys or public datasets being used for collecting raw data. However, it is mentioned that the Landsat data was available on Google Earth Engine Platform, which is a public dataset. Therefore, it can be inferred that public datasets were used in the study, but the primary method of data collection was through remote sensing using satellite imagery.
