Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is classification, specifically moth species classification. The model is designed to classify moth species using images, and it uses a customized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to achieve this goal. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as F1-score, precision, and recall, which are commonly used in classification tasks. The context mentions that the model was designed to be light and fast for execution on an embedded Raspberry Pi computer used in a light trap, suggesting that the model is intended for real-time classification of moth species in a field setting.
