Answer:::
I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a study on earth system science, specifically on the use of machine learning models to predict certain variables. It discusses the dataset, feature variables, and hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV, but does not mention data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
