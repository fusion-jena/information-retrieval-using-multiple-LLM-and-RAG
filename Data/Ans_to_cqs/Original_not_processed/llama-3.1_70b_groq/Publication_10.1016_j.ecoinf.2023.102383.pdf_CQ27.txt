Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the challenges of detecting small objects in UAV thermal images, the limitations of traditional object detection models, and the potential benefits of using Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN) and ResNet models. It does not provide information on model deployment, serialization, or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
