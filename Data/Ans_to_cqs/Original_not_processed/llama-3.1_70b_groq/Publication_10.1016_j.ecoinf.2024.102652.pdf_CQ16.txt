Answer:

According to the provided context, the training process uses an early stopping function to determine when training is complete. Specifically, the training process is halted if there is no improvement in accuracy after 20 epochs. This suggests that the criteria used to determine when training is complete is based on the accuracy of the model, rather than validation loss plateau. The context does not mention validation loss plateau as a criteria for determining when training is complete.
