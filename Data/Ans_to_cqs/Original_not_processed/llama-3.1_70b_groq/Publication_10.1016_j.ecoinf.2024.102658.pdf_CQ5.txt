Answer:::
The provided context does not mention the use of any specific deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. In fact, the context appears to be related to climate data and species distribution modeling, rather than deep learning or computer vision.

The context mentions the use of climate datasets, including the 27 climate extremes indices defined by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI) and the 19 bioclimatic variables from WorldClim. It also mentions the use of observational and simulation data averaged for specific time periods to represent present-day and future climate conditions.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline.
