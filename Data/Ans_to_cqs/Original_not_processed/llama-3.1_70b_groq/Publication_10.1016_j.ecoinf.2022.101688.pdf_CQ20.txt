Answer: The text mentions that CNNs are commonly executed on GPU hardware, which results in faster training time. However, the authors deliberately trained ResNet152V2 on CPUs to verify that training could be executed on less expensive hardware. Specifically, they used a virtual machine running on Microsoft Azure with 16GB RAM and a 2.35Ghz AMD EPYC 7452 2 vCPU. There is no mention of TPUs being used for training the deep learning model.
