Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically address the question of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of random seed values. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing, ecology, and environmental science, with some mentions of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and their applications.

However, I can provide some general information on handling randomness in deep learning pipelines. In deep learning, randomness can be introduced through various sources, such as random weight initialization, dropout, and data augmentation. To handle this randomness, several strategies can be employed, including:

1. Setting a fixed random seed value: This ensures that the same sequence of random numbers is generated each time the model is trained, allowing for reproducibility of results.
2. Using techniques like dropout and batch normalization: These techniques can help reduce the impact of randomness on the model's performance.
3. Averaging model predictions: This can help reduce the variance introduced by randomness in the model's predictions.
4. Using ensemble methods: Combining the predictions of multiple models trained with different random seeds can help reduce the impact of randomness.

It's worth noting that the provided context does not mention these strategies specifically, and it's unclear whether they are relevant to the context. If you have any further questions or would like more information on handling randomness in deep learning pipelines, I'd be happy to try and help.
