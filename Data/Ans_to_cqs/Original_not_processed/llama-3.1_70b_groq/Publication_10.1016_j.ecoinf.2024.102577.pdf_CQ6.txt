Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a research article on machine-learning aided sustainable Indian Ocean tuna purse seine fishery, and it includes tables and references to various machine learning models, such as Random Forest, SMO, and Multilayer Perceptron. However, it does not provide information on the specific preprocessing steps used in the study.

That being said, common preprocessing steps involved in training a deep learning model include:

* Data cleaning: handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting errors
* Normalization: scaling numeric data to a common range, usually between 0 and 1
* Scaling: transforming data to have zero mean and unit variance
* Feature engineering: selecting and transforming relevant features to improve model performance
* Data augmentation: artificially increasing the size of the training dataset by applying transformations to the existing data

However, without more specific information from the context, it is impossible to determine the exact preprocessing steps used in this particular study.
