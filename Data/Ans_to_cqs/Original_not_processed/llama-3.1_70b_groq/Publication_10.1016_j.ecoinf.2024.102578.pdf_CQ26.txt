Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of image augmentation techniques, such as random rotation, width and height shift, shear, zoom, and horizontal flip, which can help increase the diversity of the training data and potentially reduce bias.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a semi-automated workflow that includes manual quality checks and data formatting, which may help identify and address any biases in the data. However, it does not provide specific information on techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I can only confirm that image augmentation techniques are used, but I do not know if other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling are used to address data bias.
