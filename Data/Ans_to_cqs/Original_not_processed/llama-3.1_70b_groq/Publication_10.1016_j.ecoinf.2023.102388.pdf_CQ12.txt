Answer: 
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically the VGG16 architecture. This is evident from the provided context, which describes the architecture of VGG16, including its convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and fully connected layers. Additionally, the context mentions fine-tuning the VGG16 model by unfreezing certain layers and adjusting the final dense layer, which further supports the use of a CNN.
