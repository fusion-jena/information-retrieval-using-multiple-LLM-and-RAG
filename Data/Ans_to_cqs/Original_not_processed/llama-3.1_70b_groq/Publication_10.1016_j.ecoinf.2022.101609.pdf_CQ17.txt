Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the selection of suitable optimizers, loss functions, and activation functions, but it does not provide information on regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization.

However, it does mention that "Further training beyond 20,000 epochs would have either resulted in overfitting or no further drop in both losses," which suggests that the authors were aware of the risk of overfitting and took steps to prevent it. Unfortunately, the specific methods used to prevent overfitting are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I do not know the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
