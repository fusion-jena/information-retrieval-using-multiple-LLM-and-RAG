Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses the comparison between Generalised Linear Models (GLM) and Random Forest (RF) in species distribution modelling for Southeast Asian felids, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search.
