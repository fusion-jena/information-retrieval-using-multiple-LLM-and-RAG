Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions that the data was cropped to a size of 256 Ã— 256 pixels, resulting in a total of 1764 image pairs, which were then used for training, validating, and testing the Res_AUNet network. It also mentions that the data is from the WSGD dataset, but it does not provide information on how the data was collected. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
