Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. However, it does mention that an accuracy assessment was conducted on the map (Section 4.5) and that a confusion matrix for accuracy assessment is provided in Table A.8.

From Table A.8, we can infer that a confusion matrix was used to evaluate the performance of the model. The table shows the number of true positives, false positives, and false negatives for each class (Other vegetation, Iceplant, and Non-vegetation).

Additionally, the text mentions that the accuracies obtained with the model trained on the dataset are shown in Table 1, but the contents of Table 1 are not provided in the context.

Therefore, while we can confirm that a confusion matrix was used for accuracy assessment, we do not have information on other postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps or Metrics calculation.
