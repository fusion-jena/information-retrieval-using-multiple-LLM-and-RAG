Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the experimental design, network architecture, and results of the ablation experiments. It discusses the training parameter settings, including batch size, input image resolution, number of epochs, learning rate, and optimizer, but does not provide information on the dataset used or any techniques employed to ensure generalizability. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
