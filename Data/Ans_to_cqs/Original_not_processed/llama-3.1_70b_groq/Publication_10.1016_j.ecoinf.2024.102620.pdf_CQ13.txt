Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. It discusses the PLUS model, which consists of two main modules: the transformed specification mining framework based on the land expansion analysis strategy (LEAS) module and the cellular automata (CA) model based on a multi-type random patch seed mechanism (CARS). The LEAS module uses a random forest algorithm, but there is no mention of a deep learning model or its hyperparameters.
