Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling, habitat suitability analysis, and conservation planning, using statistical models such as generalized linear models, maximum entropy, random forest, generalized boosting model, and multivariate adaptive regression lines.

However, it does mention a 3:1 train-test split for the occurrence points, which is a common technique used in machine learning to evaluate model performance. Additionally, it mentions the generation of 1000 random pseudo-absence points, which can be used to provide a reference for areas that are unlikely to be inhabited by the target species.

But, it does not mention any specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
