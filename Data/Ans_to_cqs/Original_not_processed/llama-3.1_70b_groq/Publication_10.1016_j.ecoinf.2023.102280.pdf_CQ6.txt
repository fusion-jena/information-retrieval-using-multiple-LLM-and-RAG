Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention that the generation of ground-truth training data from noisy samples is a practical limitation for deep learning audio enhancement models. To approximate "clean" ground-truth data, the context describes a process where spectral subtraction is applied to remove noise from the signal, and then randomly sampled noise is superimposed onto the ground-truth to generate the noisy input.

Additionally, the context mentions that the noisy input data is generated by superimposing randomly sampled noise onto the clean data, which suggests that some form of data augmentation is being used. However, it does not provide information on other preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the only preprocessing step that can be inferred is the use of spectral subtraction to remove noise from the signal and the superimposition of randomly sampled noise onto the ground-truth to generate the noisy input. Other preprocessing steps are not mentioned, and it is unclear whether they are used or not.
