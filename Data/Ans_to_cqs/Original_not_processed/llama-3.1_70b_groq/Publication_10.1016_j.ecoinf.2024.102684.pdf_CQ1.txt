Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the challenges and limitations of deep learning models in remote sensing, particularly in heterogeneous environments, and the need for more robust and adaptive validation criteria and methods.

However, it can be inferred that the context is related to remote sensing, and the data is likely collected through sensors, such as LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) sensors, which are mentioned in some of the cited references (e.g., Lopatin et al., 2015, 2016). Additionally, the context mentions "remotely sensed data," which suggests that the data is collected through remote sensing technologies, such as satellite or aerial imagery.

It is also possible that public datasets are used, as the context mentions the development of model validation frameworks and the need for more robust and adaptive validation criteria and methods. However, the specific methods used for collecting raw data are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
