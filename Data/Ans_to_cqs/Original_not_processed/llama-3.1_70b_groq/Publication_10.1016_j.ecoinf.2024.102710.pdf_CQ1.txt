Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the annotation and analysis of existing datasets, specifically passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) datasets, using transfer learning and active learning techniques. It does not provide information on how the raw data was collected. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
