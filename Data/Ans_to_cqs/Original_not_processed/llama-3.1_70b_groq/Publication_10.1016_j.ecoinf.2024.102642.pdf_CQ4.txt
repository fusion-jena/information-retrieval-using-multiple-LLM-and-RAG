Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The text primarily focuses on the annotation process, inter-annotator variability, and the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for cetacean vocalization detection. It discusses the challenges associated with annotation discrepancies and proposes methods for annotation aggregation, such as majority voting and soft labeling. However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
