Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention the use of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function and the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001 in the training of the EPDNet model. Additionally, it mentions the use of the R2 metric to assess the model's fit to the observed data. This suggests that the model's performance is being monitored and evaluated using these metrics, but the exact strategy or approach used to monitor performance during training is not specified.
