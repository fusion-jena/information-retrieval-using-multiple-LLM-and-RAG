Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention a few metrics and assessments that are related to model evaluation.

From the context, we can see that the authors used metrics such as mean error and number of misclassified points to estimate the optimal number of iterations in the Stacked Autoencoder (SAE) model (Fig. 6). Additionally, the authors mention the use of a confusion matrix in Table 3, which suggests that they may have used it to evaluate the model's performance.

Furthermore, the context mentions the calculation of the J-M value (ranging from 1.69 to 1.81) among the six types of Landsat images, which could be a metric used to evaluate the model's performance.

However, there is no explicit mention of saliency maps or other postprocessing steps. Therefore, we cannot provide a comprehensive answer to the query based on the provided context.
