Answer:::
The deep learning pipeline in the context of noise reduction and audio enhancement uses audio data formats, specifically raw waveform data or audio spectrograms. According to the text, recent state-of-the-art deep learning methods have successfully used raw waveform data for wider applications such as source separation and classification. This approach removes errors introduced when applying a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to generate a time-frequency representation and reconstruction errors due to the loss of phase information. Additionally, some methods operate on audio spectrograms, which is a time-frequency representation of audio data. There is no mention of image, video, or CSV data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline for this specific application.
