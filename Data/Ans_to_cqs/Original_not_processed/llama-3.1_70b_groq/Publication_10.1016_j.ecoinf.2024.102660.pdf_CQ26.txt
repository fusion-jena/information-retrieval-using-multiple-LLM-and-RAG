Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the dataset was split into training, validation, and testing sets, with 1232 image pairs used for training, 176 image pairs for validation, and 356 image pairs for testing. This suggests that the dataset was split in a way that allows for evaluation of the model's performance on unseen data, but it does not provide information on whether techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling were used to address data bias.

Additionally, the context mentions that the dataset was cropped to a size of 256 Ã— 256 pixels, resulting in a total of 1764 image pairs. This suggests that the dataset was preprocessed to have a uniform size, but it does not provide information on whether this preprocessing step was used to address data bias.

Overall, the provided context does not provide enough information to determine what techniques were used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
