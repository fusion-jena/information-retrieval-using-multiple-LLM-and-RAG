Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context appears to be related to natural water retention measures, infiltration rates, and ecological informatics, but it does not provide any information about the development or evaluation of a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the provided context.
