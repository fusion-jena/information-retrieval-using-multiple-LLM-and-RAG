Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be focused on machine learning for inferring animal behavior from location and movement data, and it discusses various machine learning algorithms such as random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks. However, it does not provide information on data splitting criteria for deep learning model training.

In general, the criteria for splitting data into training, testing, and validation sets can vary depending on the specific problem, dataset, and model architecture. Common practices include splitting the data into 70-80% for training, 10-15% for validation, and 10-15% for testing, but these proportions can be adjusted based on the specific needs of the project.

Since the provided context does not provide specific information on data splitting criteria for deep learning model training, I cannot provide a more detailed answer.
