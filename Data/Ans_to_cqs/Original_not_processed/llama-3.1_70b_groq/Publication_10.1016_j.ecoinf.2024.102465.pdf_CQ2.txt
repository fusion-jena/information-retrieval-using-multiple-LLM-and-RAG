Answer: 

The data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are primarily image data, specifically social media images, and text data from reviews. The study employs the HRNet model for semantic segmentation of images, which suggests that the image data is in a format that can be processed by the HRNet model, such as JPEG or PNG. Additionally, the study uses text data from reviews, which is likely in a text format such as CSV or JSON. There is no mention of audio or video data being used in the pipeline.
