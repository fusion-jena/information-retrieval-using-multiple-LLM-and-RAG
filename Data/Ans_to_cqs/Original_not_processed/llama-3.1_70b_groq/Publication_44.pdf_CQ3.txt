Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the images were annotated and used for training the DeepLabv3+ model. It also mentions that the model was trained for a binary class problem (leaf or background), which suggests that the annotation technique used might be semantic segmentation, where the annotators labeled the pixels in the images as either leaf or background. However, the exact annotation technique used is not specified in the provided context.
