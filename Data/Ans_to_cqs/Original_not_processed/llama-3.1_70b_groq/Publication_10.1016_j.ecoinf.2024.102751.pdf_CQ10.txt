Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. The context appears to be related to environmental science and research papers, with no mention of coding or software development. Therefore, I am unable to provide a link to a code repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
