Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the importance of fish biomass estimation, the challenges of estimating biomass in turbid environments, and the potential of deep learning techniques to address these challenges.

However, it does mention the use of object detection and segmentation techniques to extract fish from the background and calculate their size and biomass. This suggests that techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation might be used to annotate the data, but this is not explicitly stated.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of Bidirectional LSTM with GloVe embeddings, which is a technique used for natural language processing, but it is not clear how this relates to data annotation for object detection or segmentation tasks.

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the question about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
