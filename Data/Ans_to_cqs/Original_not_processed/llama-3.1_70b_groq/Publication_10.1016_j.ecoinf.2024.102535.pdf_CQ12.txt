Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, the context mentions the use of various CNN architectures, including VGG, ResNet, and Xception, which are commonly used for image classification tasks. The context also describes the components of these CNN architectures, such as the feature extractor and classifier modules, which are typical components of CNNs. There is no mention of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers in the provided context.
