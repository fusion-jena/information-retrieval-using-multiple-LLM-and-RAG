Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The text only discusses the architecture and parameters of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU) models, as well as various hyperparameters and training settings. There is no mention of GPUs, TPUs, or any other hardware resources.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
