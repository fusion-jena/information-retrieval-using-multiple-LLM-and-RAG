Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) for planetary-scale geospatial analysis, remote sensing, and wildfire science. It mentions the use of supervised machine learning (ML) classification for fire scar delineation, but it does not provide details on the data annotation techniques employed. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
