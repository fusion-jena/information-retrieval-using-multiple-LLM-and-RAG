Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The text discusses the supervised learning workflow, data collection, and analysis, but it does not provide information on model deployment. It only mentions that deep learning methods, such as CNN, can be used for future LULC analysis, but it does not elaborate on the deployment process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
