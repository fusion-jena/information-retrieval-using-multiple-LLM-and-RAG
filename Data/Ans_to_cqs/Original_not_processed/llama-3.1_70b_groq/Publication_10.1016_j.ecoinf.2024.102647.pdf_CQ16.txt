Answer: I don't know. The provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be focused on evaluating the performance of machine learning models using various metrics (R2, NSE, KGE, COR) and comparing the performance of different models (FR, SI, RF, CART) on a specific task (predicting groundwater salinity hazard maps). It does not provide information on the training process or the criteria used to determine when training is complete.
