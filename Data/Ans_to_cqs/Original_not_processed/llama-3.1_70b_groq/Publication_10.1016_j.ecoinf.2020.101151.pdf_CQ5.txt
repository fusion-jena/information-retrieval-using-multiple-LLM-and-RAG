Answer: I don't know. The provided context does not mention any deep learning pipeline or datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to a research project on forest fire danger rating systems, specifically the IFDS prototype, and discusses data layers, spatial resolution, and meteorological data. There is no mention of deep learning or any specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline.
