Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. It mentions "various benchmark datasets" in the context of evaluating the capacity of the EfficientNet model, but it does not provide the names of the datasets. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
