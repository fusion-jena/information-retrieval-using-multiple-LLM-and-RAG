Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the process of annotating the dataset, the performance of the model on different datasets, and the use of image augmentations during training.

However, it does mention that the model was trained for 500 epochs with heavier augmentation. This suggests that the training process may have been stopped after a fixed number of epochs, but it does not provide information on whether a validation loss plateau or other criteria were used to determine when to stop training.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to the question.
