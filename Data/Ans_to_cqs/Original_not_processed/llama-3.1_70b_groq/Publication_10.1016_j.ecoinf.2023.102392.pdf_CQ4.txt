Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily discusses the application of deep learning models, particularly XGBoost, for land use/land cover classification, forest type classification, and assessing the impact of flooding on fish populations. It also mentions the use of remote sensing data, but it does not provide details on data augmentation techniques used in the pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context.
