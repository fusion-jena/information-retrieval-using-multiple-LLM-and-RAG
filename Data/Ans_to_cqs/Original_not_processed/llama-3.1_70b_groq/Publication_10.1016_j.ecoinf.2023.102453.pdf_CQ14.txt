Answer:::
The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using Hyperband and Bayesian Optimization algorithms, as mentioned in the provided context. These algorithms are part of the Keras Tuner, which is a tool used for hyperparameter optimization. 

Hyperband is a probabilistic algorithm that uses a combination of random search and Bayesian optimization to efficiently search the hyperparameter space. Bayesian Optimization is a global optimization algorithm that uses a probabilistic approach to search for the optimal hyperparameters.

The context does not mention the use of grid search, which is a brute-force approach that involves trying all possible combinations of hyperparameters. Instead, the authors opted for more efficient algorithms that can handle large hyperparameter search spaces.

It's worth noting that the authors also mention the use of Random Search as an available option in the Keras Tuner, but they chose to use Hyperband and Bayesian Optimization as they are considered superior to other search algorithms.
