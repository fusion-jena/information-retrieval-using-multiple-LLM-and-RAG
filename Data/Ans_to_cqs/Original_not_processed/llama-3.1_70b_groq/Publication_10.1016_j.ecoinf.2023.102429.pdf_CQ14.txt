Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that "parameter values were selected based on the RMSEcv values" and that "Epsilon-SVR optimal parameters (e.g., cost C, epsilon p, and gamma g) are used to make the model achieve the best accuracy". However, it does not specify the method used to optimize these parameters, such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
