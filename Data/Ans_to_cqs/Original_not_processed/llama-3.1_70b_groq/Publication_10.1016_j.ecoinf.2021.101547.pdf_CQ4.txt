Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily discusses the importance of choosing an optimal mini-batch size, the challenges of using deep learning, and the process of training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context.
