Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The text only discusses the optimization of hyperparameters, the architecture of the deep neural network (DNN), and the algorithms used for optimization, but it does not mention the frameworks used to implement the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
