Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM) algorithm, is classification and clustering analysis. It is used to allocate research units into different ecosystem service (ES) bundles based on spatial similarities. The model combines dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis to identify ecological sources and classify them into different categories. The SOFM algorithm is used to overcome the shortcomings of linear dimensionality reduction techniques and to objectively classify ecosystem functions according to a predefined setting.
