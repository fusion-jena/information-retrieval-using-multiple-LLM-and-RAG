Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the importance of proper metadata curation, the architecture of the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used, and the computational resources utilized for training. However, it does not provide information on model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related processes.

The context does mention that the code used to define and train the CNNs can be found in the Mathematica notebooks (Suppl. materials 1, 3, 2, 4), but it does not provide details on how the trained models were deployed. Therefore, I do not know the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
