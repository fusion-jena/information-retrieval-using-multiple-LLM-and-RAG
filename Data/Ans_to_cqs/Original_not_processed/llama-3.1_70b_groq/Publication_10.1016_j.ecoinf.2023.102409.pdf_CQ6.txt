Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and configuration of various deep learning models, such as Unet, Pspnet, and Deeplabv3+, including their encoder-decoder structures, activation functions, loss functions, and optimization algorithms.

However, it can be inferred that the input to the Unet model is a 512 Ã— 512 pixels image, which suggests that the images may have been resized or cropped to a uniform size before being fed into the model. Additionally, the use of batch normalization in the convolutional blocks of the Unet model implies that some form of normalization may have been applied to the input data.

But, without further information, it is unclear what specific preprocessing steps were involved, such as data cleaning, scaling, or normalization. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based on the provided context.
