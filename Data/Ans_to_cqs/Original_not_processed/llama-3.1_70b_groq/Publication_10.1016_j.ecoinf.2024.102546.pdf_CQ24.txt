Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. However, one of the papers mentions "domain randomization" as a technique for transferring deep neural networks from simulation to the real world. 

Domain randomization is a technique used to train deep neural networks to be robust to variations in the environment, such as lighting, textures, and other factors. This technique can help to reduce the impact of randomness in the deep learning pipeline by training the network to be more generalizable.

However, this is not directly related to handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline through techniques such as setting random seed values. The context does not provide information on this specific topic.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
