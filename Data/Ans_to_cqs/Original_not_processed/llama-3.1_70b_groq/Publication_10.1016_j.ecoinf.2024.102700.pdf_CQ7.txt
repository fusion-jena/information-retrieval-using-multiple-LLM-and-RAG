Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context primarily discusses the validation methods used in various studies, including internal and external validation strategies, and the types of models used in the examined articles. 

However, it does mention that some studies used "simple sample splitting" (n = 16, 5%) for internal validation, but it does not provide details on the specific criteria used for splitting the data. Additionally, it mentions that some studies used "generalised CV" (n = 12, 4%), which does not require data partitioning into training and test datasets, but instead uses a mathematical formula to consider the trajectory of fitting errors while varying the model's hyperparameters.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the provided context does not provide specific information on the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training.
