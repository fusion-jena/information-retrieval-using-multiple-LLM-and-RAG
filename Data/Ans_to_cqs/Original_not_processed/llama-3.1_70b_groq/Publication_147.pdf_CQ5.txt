Answer: 
The provided context does not mention the use of standard datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet in the deep learning pipeline. Instead, it mentions that the inputs used by the CNN model were derived from remote sensing data, including ARI, Band 2, Band 3, Band 4, DEM, NDVI, NDWI, PSRI, REIP, TPI, TRI, TWI, VBF, and VH. These inputs were used to train a U-Net CNN architecture for wetland mapping in Alberta, Canada. The context also mentions that the model was trained on a patch-level and was compared to a shallow learning (XGBoost) model using photo-interpreted validation data and a small field data set.
