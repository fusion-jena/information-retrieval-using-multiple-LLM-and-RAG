Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The text only discusses the application of machine learning and deep learning algorithms to hyperspectral data for predicting water quality parameters, but it does not provide information on the computational resources used for training these models. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
