Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text only mentions that deep learning methods, specifically CNN, can be used for future land-use and land-cover analysis, but it does not provide details on the specific techniques used to prevent overfitting. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
