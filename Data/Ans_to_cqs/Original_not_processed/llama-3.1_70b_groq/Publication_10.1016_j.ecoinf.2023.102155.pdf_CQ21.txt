Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context appears to be focused on the ppmlasso package, model selection, and regularization, as well as the performance of different methods for predicting intensity maps.

However, it does mention the calculation of performance measures, such as NIMSE (Normalized Integrated Mean Squared Error), and the display of predicted intensity maps with different combinations of lasso regularization and bias correction. Additionally, it references the use of metrics such as knn (k-nearest neighbors) and LoopT, but it does not provide details on the postprocessing steps involved.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
