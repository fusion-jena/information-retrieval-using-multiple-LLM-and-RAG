Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context appears to be a collection of research papers and a table comparing different models, but it does not provide information on the specific strategy used to monitor model performance during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
