Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is YOLO (You Only Look Once), specifically YOLOv8n. This is evident from the text, which mentions "YOLO training losses" and "YOLOv8n" as the base model for some of the models (Models 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6). YOLO is a type of convolutional neural network (CNN) that is commonly used for object detection tasks.
