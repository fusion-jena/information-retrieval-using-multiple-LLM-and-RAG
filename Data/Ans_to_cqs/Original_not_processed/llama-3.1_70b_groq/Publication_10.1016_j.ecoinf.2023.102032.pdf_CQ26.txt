Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a study on wetlands, land use classes, and ecosystem health, using Sentinel-2 data and earth observation. It mentions the use of machine learning for cloud detection, but does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias.

However, it does mention that the approach used in the study required no further user input, pre- or post-processing steps, and can be seen as more objective, more comparable, and robust across time steps. This suggests that the study may have used techniques that minimize the need for manual preprocessing, but it does not provide specific information on techniques used to address data bias.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
