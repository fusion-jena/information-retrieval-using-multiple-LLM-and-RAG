Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on the application of deep learning in fish-related research, such as fish detection, fish length monitoring, and fish biomass estimation.

However, it does mention a "targeted fish species dataset" that was divided into training and validation sets in an 8:2 ratio using a random selection process. But it does not provide any further information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
