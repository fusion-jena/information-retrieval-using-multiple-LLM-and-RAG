Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. However, it does mention that the model's performance was evaluated using an average precision metric.

After the model was trained, around 200 scans were annotated by hand based on the predicted bounding boxes. These annotated scans were then compared with the predictions to evaluate the precision of the organ detection model on this dataset. This suggests that some form of metrics calculation was performed, but the specific metrics used (other than average precision) are not mentioned.

There is no mention of Saliency maps or Confusion matrix in the provided context. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a detailed answer to the query based on the available information.
