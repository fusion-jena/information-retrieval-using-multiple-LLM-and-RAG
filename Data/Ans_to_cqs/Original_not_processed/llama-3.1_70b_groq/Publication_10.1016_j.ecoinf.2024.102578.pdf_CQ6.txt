Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The text only mentions that there is a "pre-processing of images" step in the workflow (Fig. 1), but it does not provide further details on what specific preprocessing steps are involved, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

However, it does mention that the workflow is adapted from BÃ¶hner et al. (2023), and that the authors build on the results of Rigoudy et al. (2022) and Fennell et al. (2022), who combined MegaDetector with manual classification and custom-trained models. But it does not provide information on the specific preprocessing steps used in these studies.

Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed answer to the query, and I do not want to make any assumptions or provide incorrect information.
