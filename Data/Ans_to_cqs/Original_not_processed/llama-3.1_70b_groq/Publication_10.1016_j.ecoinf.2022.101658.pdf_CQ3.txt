Answer:::
The text does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does mention that manual classification of fuel types was used in semantic segmentation training and testing, which suggests that some form of annotation was performed on the data. Additionally, the text mentions that the dataset was augmented using techniques such as horizontal flip, Gaussian noise addition, and contrast reduction, but it does not provide further details on the annotation process. Therefore, the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not clearly stated in the provided text.
