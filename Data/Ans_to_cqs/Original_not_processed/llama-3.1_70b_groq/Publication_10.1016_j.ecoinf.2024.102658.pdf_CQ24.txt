Answer:::
The provided context does not specifically mention strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline or the use of a random seed value. However, it does describe the use of random forest as a baseline model, which inherently involves randomness in the form of bootstrap sampling and random feature selection.

In the context of random forest, the text mentions that "a random subset of features is considered when finding the optimal split at each node" and that the size of this subset is set to sqrt(n), where n is the number of potential predictors. This suggests that randomness is introduced in the feature selection process, but it does not provide information on how this randomness is controlled or seeded.

Therefore, I do not know what specific strategies are employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value, as this information is not provided in the context.
