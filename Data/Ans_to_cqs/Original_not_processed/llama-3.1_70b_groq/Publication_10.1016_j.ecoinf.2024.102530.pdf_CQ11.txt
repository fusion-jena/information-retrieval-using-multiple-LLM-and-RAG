Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention a data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a study on ecological informatics, specifically focusing on Quebec, Canada, and mentions various data sources such as Données Québec, Ministère des ressources naturelles et forêts, and others. However, it does not provide information on a deep learning pipeline or its associated data repository link.
