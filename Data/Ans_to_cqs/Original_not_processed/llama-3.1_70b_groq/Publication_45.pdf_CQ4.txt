Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the basics of deep learning, its history, and its applications in ecological prediction and machine learning. It does not delve into the specifics of data augmentation techniques.

However, it is worth noting that data augmentation is a common technique used in deep learning to artificially increase the size of the training dataset by applying transformations to the existing data. This can help improve the model's robustness and ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

If you're looking for information on data augmentation techniques, I'd be happy to provide general information on the topic. But based on the provided context, I couldn't find any specific information on the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
