Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the data format used is likely images. This is because the context mentions the use of the AlexNet CNN architecture, which is commonly used for image classification tasks, and the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge, which is a benchmark for image recognition. Additionally, the context mentions the use of color characters for automatic insect identification, which also suggests the use of image data. However, it does not provide information on the use of audio, video, or CSV data formats in the deep learning pipeline.
