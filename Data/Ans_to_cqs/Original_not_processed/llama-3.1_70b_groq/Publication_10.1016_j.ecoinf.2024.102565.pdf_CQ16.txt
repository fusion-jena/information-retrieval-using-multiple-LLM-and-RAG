Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. It only mentions that the model underwent training using the balanced three-fold training dataset for a "specified number of epochs" and was subsequently tested on the validation fold to generate predictions for that specific fold. However, it does not provide information on how the number of epochs was determined or what criteria were used to stop the training process.
