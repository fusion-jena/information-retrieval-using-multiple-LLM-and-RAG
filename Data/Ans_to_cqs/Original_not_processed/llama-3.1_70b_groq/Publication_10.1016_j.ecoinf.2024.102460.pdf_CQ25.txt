Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the LSTM model, is to solve the prediction problem of time series data, particularly in the context of land use/cover change (LUCC) and ecosystem services (ESs). The LSTM model is used for time series forecasting, which involves predicting future values based on historical data. In this study, the LSTM model is combined with other models, such as the PLUS model and the FMOP model, to simulate future land use scenarios and optimize land allocation. The LSTM model is used to manage the prediction problem of time series data, especially the long-term dependency problem and multivariate time series data.
