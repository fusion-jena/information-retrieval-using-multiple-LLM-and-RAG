Answer:

To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the dataset was split into training and validation sets with an 80/20% ratio, which is a common practice to evaluate model performance during training. This split helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the model is not biased towards the training data.

Additionally, the test dataset was separated from the training and validation sets, containing 500 segments with a representative distribution of target features to non-target features. This test dataset was used to evaluate the model's performance, providing an unbiased estimate of its generalizability.

Furthermore, the dataset itself was designed to be diverse, containing 1130 possum vocalisations and 1870 noise sources, which helps to ensure that the model is trained on a wide range of examples. Each segment was also manually reviewed by a human, which adds an extra layer of quality control and helps to reduce the risk of bias in the dataset.

However, it is not mentioned whether cross-validation or stratified splitting were used to further ensure the generalizability of the model. Therefore, we cannot confirm whether these specific measures were taken.
