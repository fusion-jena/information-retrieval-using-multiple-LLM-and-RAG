Answer: To ensure the generalizability of the machine learning models, a 5-fold cross-validation grid search strategy was implemented to tune hyperparameters within the training dataset. This approach helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the models are not overly specialized to the training data. Additionally, the use of cross-validation allows the models to be evaluated on unseen data, which helps to estimate their performance on new, unseen data.

It is not explicitly mentioned whether the dataset was diverse or if stratified splitting was used. However, the use of cross-validation suggests that the authors took steps to ensure that the models were evaluated on a variety of data, which can help to improve their generalizability.

It's worth noting that the text does not specifically mention "deep learning" models, but rather a range of machine learning models including linear regression, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Light Gradient Boosting. However, the measures taken to ensure generalizability, such as cross-validation, are relevant to both traditional machine learning and deep learning models.
