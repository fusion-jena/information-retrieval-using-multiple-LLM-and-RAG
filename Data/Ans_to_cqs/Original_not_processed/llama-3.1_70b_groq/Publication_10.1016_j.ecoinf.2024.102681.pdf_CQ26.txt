Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the CNN-LSTM hybrid model, its performance, and the dataset used for training. It also discusses the analysis of drought propagation times and the influence of various factors on drought propagation.

However, it does mention the use of a sliding window method with a window size of 30 years and a step size of one year to generate 42 distinct datasets for model training. This approach may help to reduce the impact of data bias by creating multiple datasets with different time windows, but it does not explicitly address data bias.

Therefore, I do not know the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.
