I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific deep learning model or measures taken to ensure its generalizability. The context appears to be related to soil science, node-based programming, and data exchange schema, but it does not provide information about deep learning models or their evaluation. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
