Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the analysis and processing of data, particularly in the context of land cover/land use classification, El Niño Southern Oscillation, and the use of machine learning models such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks.

However, it can be inferred that the data used in the studies mentioned in the context may have been collected from various sources such as satellite imagery, weather stations, or other environmental monitoring systems. For example, the study on El Niño Southern Oscillation may have used data from weather stations or satellite imagery to analyze the effects of ENSO on rice-producing environments.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of public datasets, such as the one used in the study on land cover/land use classification. However, it does not provide information on the specific methods used to collect the raw data.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query.
