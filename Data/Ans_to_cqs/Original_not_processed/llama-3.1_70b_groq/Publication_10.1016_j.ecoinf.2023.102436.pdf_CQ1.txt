Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a research study on 3D spatial metrics and ecological informatics, but it does not provide information on the data collection methods used in the study. 

However, it does mention the use of oblique photogrammetry in one of the references (Guo et al., 2023), which suggests that remote sensing or aerial photography might be used for data collection in some related studies. Additionally, the context mentions the use of convolutional neural networks for analyzing landscape photographs, which implies that visual data might be used in the study. 

But without more specific information, it is not possible to determine the exact methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
