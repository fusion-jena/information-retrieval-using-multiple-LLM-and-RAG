Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be discussing a Monte Carlo method-based classification model, its limitations, and potential improvements, as well as its application to a real-world wildfire scenario. However, it does not provide information on data splitting criteria for deep learning model training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
