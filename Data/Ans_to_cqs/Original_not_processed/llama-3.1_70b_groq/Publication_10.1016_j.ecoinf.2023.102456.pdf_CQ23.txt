Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of different partitions and the evaluation of model performance using various metrics (Table 1). This suggests that some form of cross-validation or partitioning of the data may have been used to evaluate the model's performance.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a surrogate loss function for optimization of FÎ² score in binary classification with imbalanced data, which may indicate that the dataset is imbalanced and that measures were taken to address this issue.

However, without more information, it is difficult to say for certain what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model. The context does not mention the use of a diverse dataset or stratified splitting, and it is unclear whether these methods were used.

Therefore, while some measures may have been taken to evaluate the model's performance, the specific measures taken to ensure generalizability are not clear from the provided context.
