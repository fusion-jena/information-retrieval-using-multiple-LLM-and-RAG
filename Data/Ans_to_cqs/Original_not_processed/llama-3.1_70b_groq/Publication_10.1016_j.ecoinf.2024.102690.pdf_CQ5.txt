Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any deep learning pipeline or datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to ecological source identification and spatial analysis, using datasets such as GlobeLand30, ALOS World 3D-30m, China soil map, MODIS image MOD13Q1, and others. These datasets are used for spatial analysis and ecological source identification, but they are not related to deep learning pipelines or image classification tasks.
