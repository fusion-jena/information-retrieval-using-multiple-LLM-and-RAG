Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It mentions that certain parameters are adjustable, such as the buffer distance in step 8 and the proximity distance in step 19, but it does not provide information on how these parameters are optimized. It does not mention techniques such as grid search or random search, which are commonly used for hyperparameter optimization. Therefore, I don't know how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.
