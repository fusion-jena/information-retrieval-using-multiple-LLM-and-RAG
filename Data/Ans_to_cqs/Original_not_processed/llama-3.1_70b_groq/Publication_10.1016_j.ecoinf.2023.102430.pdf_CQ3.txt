Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context only mentions that the algorithms were trained on a dataset of 6570 pictures, but it does not provide information on how the data was annotated.

However, it is mentioned that the algorithms use numerical 'features' extracted from the pictures, which were obtained using Inovtaxon (Bambil et al., 2020). These features include 36 color features, 135 shape features, and 55 texture features. But it does not provide information on whether techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation were used.

Therefore, I do not know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
