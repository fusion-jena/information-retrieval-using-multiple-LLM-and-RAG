Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. It appears to be discussing a data management framework called FRAMES, which is built on top of the Django Python web framework and uses the Foundation front-end framework for its user interface. There is no mention of deep learning or any related frameworks.
