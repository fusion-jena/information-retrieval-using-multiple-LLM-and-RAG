Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model is object detection. According to the provided context, the model takes images as input and uses a DCNN (Deep Convolutional Neural Network) as the backbone network to construct feature maps. The model then generates region proposals, assigns a probability to each region, and finally performs classification and bounding box regression to predict the presence and location of objects within the original images. This is a classic two-stage object detection process, where the model aims to detect and identify objects of interest within an image.
