Answer:::

The performance of the evaluated methods is expressed in terms of three metrics: Overall Accuracy (OA), F1-Score, and Alarm Area (AA). 

1. Overall Accuracy (OA): It is a global metric that indicates the percentage of samples correctly classified in relation to the total samples. It is defined by the formula: OA = (tp + tn) / (P + N) * 100, where tp is true positives, tn is true negatives, P is the total number of positive samples, and N is the total number of negative samples.

2. F1-Score: Although the formula for F1-Score is not provided in the given context, it is a common metric used to evaluate the performance of a model. It is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.

3. Alarm Area (AA): No specific definition or formula is provided for Alarm Area in the given context. However, it is mentioned as one of the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model.

Note that precision and recall are not explicitly mentioned as metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model in the given context.
