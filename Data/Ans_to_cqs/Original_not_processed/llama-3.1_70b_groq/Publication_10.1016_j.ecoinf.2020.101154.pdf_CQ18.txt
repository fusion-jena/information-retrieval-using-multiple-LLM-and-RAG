Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is early stopping. According to the text, "The early stopping technique was used to determine when to stop the model training to avoid overfitting." This means that the model training was stopped when the performance on the validation set started to degrade, preventing the model from overfitting to the training data.
