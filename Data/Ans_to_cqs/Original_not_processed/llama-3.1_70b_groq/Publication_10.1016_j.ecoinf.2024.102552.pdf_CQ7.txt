Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The text discusses the potential of machine learning tools to refine classifications, but it does not delve into the details of the data splitting process.

However, it does mention that the quality of the inputs (both imagery and training data) is crucial for the success of machine learning methods. It also cautions that historical imagery with variable characteristics may pose challenges for machine learning models.

Additionally, the text mentions that the authors used a manual classification method and that they reviewed their approach to arriving at a broad classification scheme. They also discuss the possibility of using a finer classification scheme for individual sites or images.

Overall, while the context provides some insights into the challenges and considerations of using machine learning for classification tasks, it does not provide specific information on the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training.
