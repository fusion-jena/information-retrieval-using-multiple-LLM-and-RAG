Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification. The text mentions that the model is used for "imagery classification" and that the goal is to optimize hyperparameters to increase model performance. Specifically, the model is used to classify images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach. The CNN is used as a feature extractor, and the SVM is used as a classifier. The text also mentions that the model is trained and evaluated using a k-fold cross-validated fine grid-search on the training data, which is a common approach for classification tasks.
