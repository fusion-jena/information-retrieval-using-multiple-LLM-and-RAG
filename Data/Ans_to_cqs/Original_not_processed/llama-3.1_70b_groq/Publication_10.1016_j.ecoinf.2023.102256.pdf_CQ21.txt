Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The text only discusses the training and testing of the models, the architecture of the model for Case IV, and the preliminary experiments conducted on enhancing deep learning with metadata. It does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
