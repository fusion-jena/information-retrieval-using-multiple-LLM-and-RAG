Answer:

The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a combination of manual tuning and grid search. For the two-part split, grid search is used to perform an exhaustive search over specified parameter values for an estimator. This involves evaluating a model trained on each element of the Cartesian product of the sets of possible hyperparameter values. The grid search algorithm automatically generates the validation sets internally, eliminating the need to generate a separate validation set to select the best model.

For the three-part split, further tuning of the parameters is done manually. The initial parameters are set based on the results of the grid search for the two-part split, and then adjusted manually to achieve the best performance.

The use of grid search allows for a systematic and exhaustive evaluation of different hyperparameter combinations, which helps to identify the optimal set of hyperparameters for the model. The manual tuning of hyperparameters for the three-part split provides additional flexibility and allows for further refinement of the model's performance.
