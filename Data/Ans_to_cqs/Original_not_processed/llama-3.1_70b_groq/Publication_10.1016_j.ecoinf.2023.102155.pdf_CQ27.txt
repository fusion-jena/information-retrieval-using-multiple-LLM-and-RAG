I don't know. The provided context does not mention the deployment of a trained deep learning model or any related processes such as model serialization or platform selection. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, specifically discussing methods for handling missing data and comparing the performance of different algorithms. There is no mention of deep learning models or their deployment.
