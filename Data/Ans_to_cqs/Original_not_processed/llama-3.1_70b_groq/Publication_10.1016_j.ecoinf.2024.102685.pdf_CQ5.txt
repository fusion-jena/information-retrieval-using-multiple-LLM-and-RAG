Answer: I don't know. The provided context does not mention any datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to a study on using machine learning algorithms for mapping seagrass meadows in a lagoon ecosystem, using seasonal multispectral images from Landsat satellites. There is no mention of deep learning or specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline.
