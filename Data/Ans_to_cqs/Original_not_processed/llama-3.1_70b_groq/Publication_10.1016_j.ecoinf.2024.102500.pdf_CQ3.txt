Answer:::
I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on machine learning models for water quality prediction, hyperparameter tuning, and model optimization, but it does not discuss data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
