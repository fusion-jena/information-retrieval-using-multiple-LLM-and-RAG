Answer: The text does not provide explicit information on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as the use of a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that a full description of the model architecture, dataset spatial split, and training procedure can be found in supplementary information (SI) Box A. This suggests that the authors may have taken steps to ensure generalizability, but the details are not provided in the main text.
