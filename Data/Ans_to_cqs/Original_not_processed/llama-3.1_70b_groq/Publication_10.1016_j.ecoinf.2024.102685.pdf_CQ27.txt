Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention anything about deploying a trained deep learning model. The context appears to be discussing the collection and preparation of data for a random forest classification model, as well as the use of satellite data and image preprocessing. There is no mention of deep learning models or their deployment.

Therefore, I must answer that I don't know the process that was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
