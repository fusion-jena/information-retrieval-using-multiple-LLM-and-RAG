Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. However, it does mention some hyperparameters that can affect the randomness or variability in the training process.

The context mentions the use of a learning decay rate of 0.7, which allows the learning rate to gradually decay as the training progresses. This can help stabilize the training process and reduce the impact of randomness. Additionally, the context mentions the use of a regularization strength of 0.2, which can help prevent overfitting and reduce the variability in the model's performance.

The context also mentions the use of a batch size of 8, which can help reduce the impact of randomness in the training process by averaging out the gradients over a larger number of samples. However, it does not provide information on how the random seed value is handled or whether any other strategies are employed to handle randomness in the pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
