Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the system structure, model architecture, and performance metrics. It does mention that after the training is completed, the trained model is used to predict water conditions and analyze performance using the test data set, but it does not provide details on specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this query.
