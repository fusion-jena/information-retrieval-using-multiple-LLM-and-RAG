Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It only discusses the development and application of the convolutional neural network (CNN) model for acoustic detection, but does not provide information on the hardware used for training the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
