Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The text only discusses the training time, video memory usage, and model size, but does not provide information on the stopping criteria used during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
