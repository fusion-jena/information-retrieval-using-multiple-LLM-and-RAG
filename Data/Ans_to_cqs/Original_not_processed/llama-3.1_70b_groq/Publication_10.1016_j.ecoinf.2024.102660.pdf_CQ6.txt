Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training the Res_AUNet network. However, it does mention that during the network training process, the input images underwent random rotations, flips, and other image augmentation operations to enhance the network's robustness. This suggests that some form of data augmentation was used as a preprocessing step.

Additionally, the context mentions that the images were cropped to a size of 256 Ã— 256 pixels, resulting in a total of 1764 image pairs. This implies that some form of resizing or cropping was used to preprocess the images.

However, it does not provide information on other preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, I can only confirm that data augmentation and resizing/cropping were used as preprocessing steps, but I do not know if any other preprocessing steps were involved.
