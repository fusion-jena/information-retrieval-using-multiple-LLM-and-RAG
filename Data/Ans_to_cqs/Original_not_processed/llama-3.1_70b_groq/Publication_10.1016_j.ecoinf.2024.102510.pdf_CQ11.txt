Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a collection of research papers and studies related to bird species recognition using deep learning models, but it does not provide information on where the data or pipeline is stored. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other data repository.
