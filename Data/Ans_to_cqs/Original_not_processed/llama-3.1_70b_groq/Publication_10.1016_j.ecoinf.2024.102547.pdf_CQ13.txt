Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context appears to be focused on the results of the model, including various metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R2, as well as the performance of different models (e.g., GAM, FGSAM) on different datasets. However, it does not provide information on the hyperparameters used to train the models. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
