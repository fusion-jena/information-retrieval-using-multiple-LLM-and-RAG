Answer: 

The provided context does not specifically mention the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does describe the methods used for collecting soil and topography data for modeling net growth in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.

According to the context, soil samples were collected from each plot to obtain a composite sample, and information was obtained for the depths of 0-20 cm and 20-40 cm. The soil analyses were performed at the laboratory of Soil Fertility at the Universidade Federal de Vi√ßosa (UFV), Brazil.

Additionally, topography data was collected using the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), and elevation, slope, and aspect were calculated for each plot using the surface Spatial Analyst Tools in the ArcGIS 10.3.1 program.

It is not clear if these methods are part of a deep learning pipeline or if they are used for a different purpose. The context does mention the use of machine learning methods, specifically Random Forest (RF), but it does not provide information on the methods used for collecting raw data for this purpose.
