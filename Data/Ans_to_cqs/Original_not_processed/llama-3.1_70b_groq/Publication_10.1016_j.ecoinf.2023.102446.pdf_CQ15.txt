Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any deep learning pipeline or optimization techniques such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be related to information theory-based transfer entropy approach for network generation, specifically TPINet, and its application to environmental data. It discusses the methodology, data collection, and processing, but does not mention deep learning or optimization techniques.
