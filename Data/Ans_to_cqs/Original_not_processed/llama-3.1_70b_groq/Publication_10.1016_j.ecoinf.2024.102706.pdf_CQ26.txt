Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on comparing Random Forest (RF) with gradient boosting models like LightGBM and XGBoost, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.

However, I can provide some general information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. These techniques include:

* Stratified splitting: This involves splitting the data into training and testing sets while maintaining the same proportion of classes in both sets.
* Oversampling: This involves creating additional instances of the minority class to balance the data.
* Undersampling: This involves reducing the number of instances of the majority class to balance the data.
* Diverse data collection: This involves collecting data from diverse sources to reduce bias.

It's worth noting that these techniques are not specific to deep learning pipelines and can be applied to various machine learning models. However, the provided context does not discuss these techniques in the context of deep learning pipelines.

If you're looking for information on addressing data bias in the context of deep learning pipelines, I recommend exploring additional resources that specifically focus on this topic.
