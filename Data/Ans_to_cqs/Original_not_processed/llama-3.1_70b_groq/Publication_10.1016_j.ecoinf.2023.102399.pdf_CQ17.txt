Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the application of computer vision and deep learning techniques in aquaculture, specifically for biomass estimation and fish length and weight estimation. It mentions the use of neural networks, Haar classifiers, and principal component analysis, but does not provide information on regularization methods.

Therefore, I don't know the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context.
