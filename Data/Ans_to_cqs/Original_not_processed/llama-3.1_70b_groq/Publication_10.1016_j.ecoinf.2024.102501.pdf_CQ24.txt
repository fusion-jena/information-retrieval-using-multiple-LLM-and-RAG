Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning and deep learning methods for predicting dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration in water, discussing various models, techniques, and their performance.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to set a random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results. This is because many deep learning algorithms involve random initialization of weights, random shuffling of data, and other random processes. By setting a fixed random seed, researchers can ensure that their results are reproducible and comparable across different runs.

While the context does not provide specific information on handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does mention the use of various machine learning and deep learning techniques, such as LSTM, SVR, and RF, which may involve random processes. However, without further information, it is unclear how randomness is handled in these specific studies.
