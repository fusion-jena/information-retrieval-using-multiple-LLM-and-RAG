Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for the DeepLabV3+ model. The context primarily focuses on the training parameters used for the model, the architecture of the model, and the hardware used for training and testing. It does mention that the model is used for land cover classification and that the number of land covers in the dataset is different from the number of classes in the PASCAL VOC-2012 dataset, but it does not provide information on the data annotation techniques used. Therefore, I do not know the specific data annotation techniques used in this pipeline.
