Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is YOLOv5, which is a variant of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) family of real-time object detection models. Specifically, it is a depth-attention YOLOv5 model, which incorporates an attention mechanism to improve its performance. The model architecture is shown in Fig. 9, and it uses a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer with a cycle learning rate. Additionally, the model uses pre-trained VGG16 weights and incorporates multi-modal information fusion techniques.
