Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline's data is available. However, it does mention GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) as a related resource, but it does not explicitly state that the data is hosted there. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question based on the given context.
