Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on climate modeling, species distribution models, and downscaling methods, but it does not provide information on the specific deep learning pipeline or its regularization methods.

However, it does mention the use of shrinkage in the Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs) implementation, which is a form of regularization. The context states that the GBMs were fitted with a shrinkage parameter equal to 0.01, which can help prevent overfitting by reducing the influence of individual trees in the ensemble. Nevertheless, this is not directly related to the deep learning pipeline, and the question about regularization methods in the deep learning pipeline remains unanswered based on the provided context.
