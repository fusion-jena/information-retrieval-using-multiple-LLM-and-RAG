Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The context only mentions that a deep learning algorithm is used for early diagnosis of COVID-19-affected patients based on X-ray and computed tomography images, but it does not provide information on the evaluation metrics used. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
