Answer:::
The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is audio. The context mentions the use of audio frontends, such as LEAF-P and SincNet-P, and the processing of audio signals, including filtering, downsampling, and log-compression. Additionally, the context mentions the use of a backend neural network classifier, specifically an EfficientNet-B0, which is typically used for image classification but is being repurposed for audio classification in this case. There is no mention of image, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
