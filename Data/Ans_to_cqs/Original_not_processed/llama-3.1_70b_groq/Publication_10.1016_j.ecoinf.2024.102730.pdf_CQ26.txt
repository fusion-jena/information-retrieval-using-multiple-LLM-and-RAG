Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the applications of deep learning in ecology, plant species identification, and vegetation studies. It discusses various machine learning models, such as multilayer perceptrons, support vector machines, and boosted tree ensembles, but does not delve into data preprocessing techniques for addressing bias.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the importance of using diverse data in deep learning models. For example, the study by Barhate et al. (2023) uses a hybrid deep learning approach for plant species identification, which may involve diverse data collection. Additionally, the study by Barr√© et al. (2017) uses a computer vision system for automatic plant species identification, which may involve data preprocessing techniques to address bias.

Unfortunately, without more specific information, it is difficult to provide a detailed answer to the query. Therefore, I must conclude that I don't know the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
