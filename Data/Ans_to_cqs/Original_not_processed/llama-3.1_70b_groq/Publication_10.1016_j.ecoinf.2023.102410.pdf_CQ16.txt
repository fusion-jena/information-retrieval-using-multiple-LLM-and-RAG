Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about training, validation loss, or criteria for determining when training is complete. The context appears to be related to data analysis and tracking of vocalisations, specifically in the context of animal behaviour. It discusses methods for tracking and localising vocalisations, but does not touch on machine learning or training processes. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
