Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the use of Random Forest (RF) classifier for hierarchical classification of medicinal plants, and various studies related to plant species identification using machine learning and deep learning approaches.

However, it is mentioned that the data collection is split into eleven groups based on visual morphological characteristics, and each group consists of several plant species varieties. The training, validation, and testing proportion is set as 70:20:10 in both levels, which might help in reducing the impact of randomness in the data. Additionally, the use of Random Forest classifier, which is an ensemble learning method, can help in reducing the variance and improving the robustness of the model.

But, specific strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value, are not mentioned in the provided context.
