Answer:::

The provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques such as Flipping, Rotating, or Scaling in the context of a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on data filtering, scaling, and workflow replicability in the context of Earth Observation (EO) data processing.

However, it does mention "data scaling" as a technique used to aggregate data across scales prior to modeling, and as a method for gap-filling operations. But this is not related to the typical data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, I don't know the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the query, as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
