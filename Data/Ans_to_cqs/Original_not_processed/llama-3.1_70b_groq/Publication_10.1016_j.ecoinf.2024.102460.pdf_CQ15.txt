Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily discusses the use of LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models for time series prediction and land use change analysis, but it does not delve into the details of the optimization techniques used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
