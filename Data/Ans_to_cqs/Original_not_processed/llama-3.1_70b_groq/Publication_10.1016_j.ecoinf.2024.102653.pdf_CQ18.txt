Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that conventional metrics were used to evaluate the model's performance, such as confusion matrices, accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, Cohen Kappa, and the area under the ROC curve. Additionally, Figure 4 shows the accuracy of the training and validation datasets, suggesting that accuracy was monitored during training. However, the specific strategy or approach used to monitor performance during training is not clearly stated.
