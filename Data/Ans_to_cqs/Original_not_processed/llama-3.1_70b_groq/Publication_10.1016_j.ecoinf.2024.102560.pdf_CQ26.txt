Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to environmental studies, specifically focusing on Lake Urmia and its ecological changes. It discusses various research papers and methodologies used to study the lake's conditions, such as prognostic modeling, land-use data, and satellite datasets. However, it does not touch upon deep learning pipelines or techniques used to address data bias.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not related to the provided context.
