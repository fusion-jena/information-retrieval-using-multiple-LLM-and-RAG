Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models. It discusses various techniques and methods for evaluating the interpretability of deep learning models, such as model decomposition, sensitivity analysis, and feature visualization, as well as specific approaches like Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) and gradient-based sensitivity analysis (GBSA). However, it does not provide information on the frameworks used to implement these models.
