Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the BatNet, is for species identification, particularly for tropical bats, based on their calls. The model is designed to extract acoustic features from spectrum images and classify the calls into different species. This is evident from the context, which mentions that the model is used for "Automatic standardized processing and identification of tropical bat calls using deep learning approaches." The model is also compared to other models, such as CNNFULL, which has been used for localizing European bats based on their calls. The context suggests that the BatNet model is used for classification, specifically for identifying different species of bats based on their calls.
