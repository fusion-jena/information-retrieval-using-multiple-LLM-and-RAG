Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text only mentions that CNNs are sensitive to overfitting and that early stopping can be used to prevent overfitting, but it does not provide information on other regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization.

However, it is mentioned that the model parameters were modified from the default configuration to balance the use of resources and training speed, and that some parameters were kept to default or set according to guidance by the developers. This suggests that some form of regularization may have been used, but the specific methods are not specified.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to the query.
