Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the predictions are based on 4 groups of features, which are derivable from digitally available occurrence records. These features include geographic, climatic, biome, and anthropogenic data.

It can be inferred that the data is likely in a tabular format, such as CSV, since the features are described as being derived from occurrence records and include variables such as mean latitude and longitude, and mean Human Footprint Index. However, without further information, it is not possible to confirm the exact data format used.

There is no mention of image, audio, or video data being used in the pipeline. The focus appears to be on analyzing and predicting the conservation status of orchid species based on occurrence records and associated features.
