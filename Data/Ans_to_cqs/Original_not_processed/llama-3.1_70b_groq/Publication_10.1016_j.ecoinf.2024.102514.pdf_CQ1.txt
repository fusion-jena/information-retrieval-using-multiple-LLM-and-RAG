Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the data splitting and machine learning aspects of a study on water quality monitoring, rather than the data collection process.

However, it can be inferred that the study may have used remote sensing techniques, as mentioned in the context, which could involve collecting data from satellite or aerial imagery. Additionally, the context mentions "sample locations" being selected for training and testing, which suggests that some form of field data collection may have taken place.

But without more specific information, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer to the query. The context does not mention surveys, sensors, or public datasets as methods for collecting raw data, but it does not rule them out either.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the context does not provide enough information to determine the specific methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
