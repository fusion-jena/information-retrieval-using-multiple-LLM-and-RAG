Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention the use of 5-fold cross-validation in the training and validation of the classifier. This suggests that the data was split into training and validation sets, but the exact criteria or proportions used for the split are not specified.

In the context of the ResNet model, the text mentions that the authors "compared their training times and validation accuracies" for different depths of the model, but it does not provide information on how the data was split for these comparisons.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the exact criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training.
