Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses the use of CNNs for bird vocalization classification/detection, the challenges of working with limited data, and the potential benefits of using smaller CNN architectures like MobileNetv2 for deployment on mobile devices. However, it does not provide information on the hardware resources used for training the model, such as GPUs or TPUs.
