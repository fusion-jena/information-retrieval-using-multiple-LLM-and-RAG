Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing, above-ground biomass estimation, and machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Regression (SVR), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Random Forest (RF), and XGBoost.

However, it does mention the importance of integrating spectral bands with other variable sets, such as those produced from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Digital Elevation Model (SRTM DEM) and vegetation-derived indices, to improve the accuracy of above-ground biomass estimation. This suggests that data preprocessing may involve data integration and feature engineering, but the specific steps involved are not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model based on the provided context.
