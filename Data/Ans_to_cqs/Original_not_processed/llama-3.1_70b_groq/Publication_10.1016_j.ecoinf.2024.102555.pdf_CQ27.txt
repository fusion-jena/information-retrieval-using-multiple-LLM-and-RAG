Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context appears to be a collection of research papers and articles related to ecological informatics, remote sensing, and environmental management, but it does not provide information on the deployment process of a deep learning model.

The only mention of a deep learning model is in the paper "Verification of novel integrations of swarm intelligence algorithms into deep learning neural network for flood susceptibility mapping" (J. Hydrol. 581, 124379), but it does not discuss the deployment process.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
