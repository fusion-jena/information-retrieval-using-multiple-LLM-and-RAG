Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to focus on the research design, data processing, and model description of a study that utilizes a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) algorithm and Markov chain for land use and land cover (LULC) simulation. It discusses the MLPnn-MC model, its architecture, and training process, but does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
