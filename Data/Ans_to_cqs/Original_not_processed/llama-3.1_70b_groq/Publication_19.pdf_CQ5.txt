Answer:::
The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, except for the fact that the models were pre-initialized to ImageNet weights. This suggests that the models were initially trained on the ImageNet dataset, but the actual dataset used for fine-tuning and training the models for the animal classification task is not specified.

However, it is mentioned that the models were trained on a dataset consisting of 33,984 images taken during day and night with 6 animal classes. This dataset is not a standard benchmark dataset like MNIST or CIFAR, but rather a custom dataset collected for the specific task of animal classification using camera trap images.
