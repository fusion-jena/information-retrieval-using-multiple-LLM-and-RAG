Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of techniques like dropout and batch normalization in the Deep Neural Network (DNN) model to reduce over-fitting and increase generalization on testing data.

It is also mentioned that the hyperparameters in the DNN model, including the learning rate, number of epochs, and batch size, were tuned to optimize the testing accuracy and kappa. However, there is no mention of setting a random seed value or employing any specific strategies to handle randomness in the pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query.
