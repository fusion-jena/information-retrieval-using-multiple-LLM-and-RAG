Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the classification performance of different methods using single CNN-based models, the architecture of the proposed model, and the experimental results on classifying 43 bird species.

However, it can be inferred that the data annotation technique used in this context is likely related to audio classification, as the context mentions the classification of bird species from their sounds. The context also mentions the use of spectrograms, such as Mel-spectrogram, harmonic-component based spectrogram, and percussive-component based spectrogram, as inputs to the CNNs. But it does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used to prepare the data for the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the context does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
