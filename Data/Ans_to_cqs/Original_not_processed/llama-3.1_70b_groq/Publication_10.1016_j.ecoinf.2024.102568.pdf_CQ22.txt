Answer: According to the provided context, four metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the algorithms: 

1. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
2. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
3. Mean Relative Error (MRE)
4. Accuracy

These metrics are used to assess the performance of the deep learning model, specifically the LSTM and VR + SVR models, in predicting values. The context provides formulas for calculating RMSE and MAE, and defines accuracy as the ratio between the number of correct predictions and the total number of input samples.
