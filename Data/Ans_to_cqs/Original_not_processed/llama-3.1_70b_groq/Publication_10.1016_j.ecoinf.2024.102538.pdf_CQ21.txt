Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, it does mention the evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance, which are:

1. Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)
2. Accuracy (ACC)
3. Hierarchical Distance of a Mistake (HDM)

These metrics are calculated after the model training process, but the context does not provide information on other postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrices. Therefore, I can only confirm that metrics calculation is one of the postprocessing steps involved, but I do not know about the other steps.
