Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context appears to be a collection of references and snippets from various academic papers and sources, mostly related to ecology, image processing, and deep learning. However, none of the provided snippets directly address the question of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

That being said, some of the papers mentioned in the context, such as "Inductive bias of Deep Convolutional Networks through Pooling Geometry" by Cohen and Shashua (2017), may touch on related topics, but without more information, it's difficult to say for certain.

Therefore, I must conclude that I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
