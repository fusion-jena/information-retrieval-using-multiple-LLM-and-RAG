Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the model training process, including data preprocessing, training data collection, and the architecture of the convolutional neural network (CNN) model. It does not provide information on the postprocessing steps, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
