Answer:

The provided context does not specifically mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention the preprocessing steps involved in natural language processing (NLP) for text mining.

According to the context, the preprocessing steps involved in NLP are:

1. Text translation: Translating text descriptions into English using DeepL.
2. Tokenization: Breaking down text into individual words or tokens.
3. Lemmatization: Reducing words to their base or root form.
4. English stop words removal: Removing common English words such as "and", "the", etc.
5. Removal of additional words: Removing words such as country names, towns, etc.

These preprocessing steps are specific to NLP and text mining, and may not be directly applicable to training a deep learning model. Normalization and scaling are common preprocessing steps in deep learning, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the provided context does not mention the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, but it does mention some preprocessing steps involved in NLP for text mining.
