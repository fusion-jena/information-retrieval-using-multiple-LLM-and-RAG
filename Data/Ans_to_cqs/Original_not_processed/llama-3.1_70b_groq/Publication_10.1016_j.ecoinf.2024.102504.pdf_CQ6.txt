Unfortunately, the provided pieces of context do not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be a collection of research papers and data related to air quality, pollution, and environmental science, but it does not provide information on the specific preprocessing steps used in deep learning models.

However, I can provide some general information on common preprocessing steps involved in training deep learning models. Typically, these steps include:

* Data cleaning: handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting errors
* Normalization: scaling numeric data to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model
* Feature scaling: transforming data to have zero mean and unit variance to improve model performance
* Encoding categorical variables: converting categorical variables into numerical variables using techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding

It's worth noting that the specific preprocessing steps may vary depending on the specific problem, dataset, and model architecture. Without more information on the specific deep learning model and dataset being used, it's difficult to provide more specific guidance on preprocessing steps.

Therefore, my answer is that I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in the context of the provided research papers, but I can provide general information on common preprocessing steps used in deep learning models.
