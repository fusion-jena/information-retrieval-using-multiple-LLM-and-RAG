Answer:::
The data format used in the deep learning pipeline, as indicated by the provided context, is primarily audio. This is evident from the references to audio classification, spectrograms, and soundscape synthesis. The context mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify audio data, specifically to predict the presence or absence of biotic and anthropogenic sounds. The use of librosa, a Python library for audio and music signal analysis, further supports the conclusion that audio data is the primary format used in the pipeline. There is no mention of image, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
