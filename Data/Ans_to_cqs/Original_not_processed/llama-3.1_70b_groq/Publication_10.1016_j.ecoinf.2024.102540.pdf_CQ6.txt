Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The text only mentions that applying different preprocessing and augmentation techniques can diversify the training data and increase overall performance, but it does not specify what those techniques are.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to perform preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning before training a model. Normalization typically involves scaling the pixel values of the images to a common range, usually between 0 and 1. Scaling may involve resizing the images to a uniform size. Cleaning may involve removing any noise or irrelevant data from the images.

But without explicit information from the context, we cannot confirm what specific preprocessing steps were involved in this particular study.
