Answer:::
The text mentions that the ENS (Evaluation of Neural network Stability) is calculated on four separate test sets, measuring different aspects of model generalizability. This suggests that the model's performance was evaluated on multiple independent test sets to assess its ability to generalize to new, unseen data. However, the specific details of how these test sets were constructed (e.g., stratified splitting, cross-validation) are not provided. Additionally, the text mentions that the data used for training consists of 23,904 datacubes located across Europe, which may indicate that the dataset is diverse in terms of geographical location. However, it is unclear whether other measures such as cross-validation or stratified splitting were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.
