Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The context discusses the use of deep learning to quantify the beauty of outdoor places, species distribution modeling, and automated species identification, but it does not provide information on the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model.

However, it does mention that the accuracy of the AI naturalist is an important consideration when determining the appropriate taxonomic resolution for a study. This suggests that accuracy is likely one of the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model, but it does not provide information on other metrics that may be used, such as precision or recall.
