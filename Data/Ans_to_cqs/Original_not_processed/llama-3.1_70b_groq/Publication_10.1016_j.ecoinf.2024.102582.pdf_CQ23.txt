Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The text appears to be discussing a study on mangrove forests, their evolution, and the impact of governmental policies on their conservation and restoration. It mentions the use of landscape metrics and spatial analysis, but it does not provide information on the use of deep learning models or any measures taken to ensure their generalizability. Therefore, I do not have enough information to answer this question.
