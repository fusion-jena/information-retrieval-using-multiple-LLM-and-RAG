Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model was trained on a limited dataset with a small number of labeled images in each category, and that existing deep learning techniques were combined with statistical fundamentals to overcome the limitation in dataset size.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model was trained with a batch size of 25 individuals, and that the performance of the runs was studied using TensorBoard. However, it does not provide information on whether techniques such as cross-validation, stratified splitting, or data augmentation were used to ensure the generalizability of the model.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
