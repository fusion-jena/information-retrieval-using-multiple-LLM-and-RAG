Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on a research article about forecasting ecological water demand of an arid oasis using deep learning methods, and it discusses various aspects of the research, such as the authors, affiliations, abstract, and references. However, it does not provide information on the data collection methods used in the study.

That being said, some of the references mentioned in the context, such as Xu (2006) and Xu et al. (2021), suggest that remote sensing and satellite imagery may be used as data sources in the study. For example, Xu (2006) discusses the modification of the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) to enhance open water features in remotely sensed imagery. However, without more information, it is impossible to determine the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the provided context does not provide enough information to determine the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
