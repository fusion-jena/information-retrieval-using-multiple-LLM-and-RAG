Answer:::

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows:

* Number of epochs: 55 (the number of times the algorithm goes through the entire training data set)
* Batch size: 64 (the number of samples to work through before updating model parameters)
* Learning rate policy: one-cycle policy with a minimum of 0.000001 and a maximum of 0.001 (hyperparameter controlling model response to estimated error each time the model weights are updated)

The optimizer used is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the model uses a one-cycle learning rate policy, which is a type of learning rate schedule that is often used with the Adam optimizer or other adaptive optimizers. But without further information, we cannot confirm the specific optimizer used.

The model architecture used is ResNet-50, which is a convolutional neural network that is 50 layers deep.
