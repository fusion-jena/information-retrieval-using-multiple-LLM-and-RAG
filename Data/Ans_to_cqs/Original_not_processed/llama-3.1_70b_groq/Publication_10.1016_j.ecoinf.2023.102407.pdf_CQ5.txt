Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling and climate data, with references to BIOCLIM variables and research papers on machine learning and ecology. There is no mention of image classification datasets or deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
