Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the references to image processing, computer vision, and pest recognition, it can be inferred that image data formats are likely used in the pipeline.

Some specific examples of image data formats used in the context include X-ray scans (mentioned in reference [25]) and UAV images (mentioned in reference [26]). Additionally, the context mentions the use of OpenCV, which is a computer vision library that supports various image and video formats.

However, the context does not provide information on the use of audio or video data formats in the deep learning pipeline. It also does not mention the use of CSV files, which are typically used for tabular data.

Therefore, based on the available information, it can be concluded that image data formats are likely used in the deep learning pipeline, but the specific formats and other data types used are not explicitly mentioned.
