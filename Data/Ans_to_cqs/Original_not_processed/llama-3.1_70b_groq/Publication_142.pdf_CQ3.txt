Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. It mentions that the images on Flickr are "better annotated with tags, location, and description" which suggests that the images have some form of metadata associated with them. However, it does not provide information on the specific annotation techniques used, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.

It does mention that the Pl@ntNet API uses a CNN architecture that is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and fine-tuned on Pl@ntNet data, but it does not provide details on how the data was annotated for training the CNN. Therefore, I do not know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
