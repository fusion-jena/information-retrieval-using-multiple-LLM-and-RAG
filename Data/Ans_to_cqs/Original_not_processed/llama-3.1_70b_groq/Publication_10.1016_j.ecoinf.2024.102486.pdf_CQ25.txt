Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the context is primarily for classification and recognition tasks. Specifically, it is used for the recognition and classification of visual images (e.g., Atila et al., 2021) and acoustic recordings (e.g., Nanni et al., 2020). The context does not mention segmentation or detection as the primary purpose of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model is used for machine learning applications, and the most used software tools are those that provide accessible extensions to the Python programming language, such as TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch.
