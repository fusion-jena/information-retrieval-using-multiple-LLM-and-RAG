Answer:::
The text does not explicitly mention the specific deep learning framework used to build the model. However, it does mention that the Keras library (version 2.12.0) is used, which is a high-level neural networks API that can run on top of TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Theano. Therefore, while we can't pinpoint the exact framework used, it is likely that TensorFlow or another supported backend is used in conjunction with Keras.
