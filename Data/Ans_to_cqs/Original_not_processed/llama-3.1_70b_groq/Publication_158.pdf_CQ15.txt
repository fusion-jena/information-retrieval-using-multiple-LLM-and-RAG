Answer:::
The optimization technique applied in the deep learning pipeline is the Adam optimizer. It was used for training with 500 epochs and categorical-cross entropy loss function. Additionally, early stopping criteria was applied if no improvement was found in 50 epochs, and data augmentation was used to enhance sample variation. Data augmentation included rotation, reflectance bias of ±10%, and random noise of ±10% reflectance for 15% of the input image.
