Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the performance of the models is evaluated using the average loss, average bias, and average variance, which are derived after training each model on 100 different subsets generated from the original training sets using the bootstrap method. The predictions of the trained models on the testing dataset are averaged to obtain the main prediction, and then the average loss, average bias, and average variance are calculated.

Additionally, the context mentions that the hyperparameters of the heterogeneous ensemble models were set to those optimized by the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) algorithms, which suggests that the TPE algorithm is used to optimize the hyperparameters of the models during training. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance is monitored during training.

Therefore, while we can infer some aspects of the evaluation strategy, the exact strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context.
