Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention anything about preprocessing steps for training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to environmental and ecological studies, discussing topics such as evapotranspiration, water surplus, conductivity, and precipitation, as well as research papers on ecological niche models and species distribution maps.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query about preprocessing steps for training a deep learning model based on the provided context.
