Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily discusses various machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost, and their applications in water quality prediction. It also mentions the use of hyperparameter optimization techniques, such as random grid search and Bayesian optimization, but does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this query.
