Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. It appears to be a study on the relative roles of environmental and anthropogenic drivers in determining the richness and abundance of invasive alien species in a region, using statistical models and data from various sources. There is no mention of deep learning or its associated hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer.
