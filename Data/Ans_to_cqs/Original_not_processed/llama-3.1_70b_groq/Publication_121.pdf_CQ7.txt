Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly state the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that the dataset was divided in a ratio of 75:25 into a training set of 5789 images and a test set of 1930 images. This suggests that the data was split based on a random sampling approach, where 75% of the data was used for training and 25% was used for testing. There is no mention of a separate validation set, but the performance of the models was evaluated using a test dataset, which implies that the test set may have been used for validation purposes as well.
