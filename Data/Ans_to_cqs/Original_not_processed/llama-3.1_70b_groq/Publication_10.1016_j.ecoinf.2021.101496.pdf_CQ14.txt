Answer: The text does not explicitly state how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, it mentions that the ANN was constructed empirically and that a random number generator was used for numerical optimization of the model. This suggests that the hyperparameters may have been optimized using a random search or a similar method, but the exact approach is not specified.
