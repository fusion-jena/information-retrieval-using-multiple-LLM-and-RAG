Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention the importance of having a large number of annotated images to later make correct predictions on new images. It also mentions that the learning of CNNs on small datasets can be boosted by data-augmentation and transfer learning.

In general, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training typically include:

* Random sampling: The data is randomly split into training, validation, and testing sets.
* Stratified sampling: The data is split in a way that maintains the same proportion of classes in each set.
* Holdout method: A portion of the data is held out as a test set, and the remaining data is used for training and validation.

The typical split ratio is 80% for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing, but this can vary depending on the specific problem and dataset. However, this information is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

It's worth noting that the context does mention the use of a training dataset containing 700 aerial images with whales and background, and a total number of bounding boxes of 945. However, it does not provide information on how the data was split for training, validation, and testing.
