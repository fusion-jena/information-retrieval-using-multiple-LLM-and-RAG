Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The text describes the FIT method, which uses a customized model that classifies animal trails by employing a robust cross-validated discriminant analysis, but it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
