Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be discussing a risk assessment model for the spread of Hyphantria cunea, a type of pest, using a logistic regression model (equations 3 and 4). The model uses a linear index (Ln) and a risk probability (P) to predict the spread of the pest, but it does not mention any deep learning techniques or regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization.
