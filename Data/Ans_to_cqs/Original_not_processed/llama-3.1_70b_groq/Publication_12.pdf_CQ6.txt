Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention the addition of a new kind of BNorm (Batch Normalization) layers behind the 22 convolutional layers to prevent overfitting. This suggests that some form of normalization is involved in the preprocessing steps.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model was trained using a large batch size of 128 images for each iteration, which implies that the data was divided into batches before training. However, it does not provide information on other preprocessing steps such as scaling, cleaning, or data augmentation.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions that the model was trained using a dataset of images, but it does not provide information on how the images were preprocessed or if any transformations were applied to the images before training.

Overall, the provided context does not provide a comprehensive overview of the preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model.
