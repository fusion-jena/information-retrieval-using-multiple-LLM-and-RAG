Answer:

According to the provided context, the method utilized for collecting raw data in the FIT (Footprint Identification Technique) pipeline is camera traps or smartphones with a basic digital camera. Field operatives with rudimentary tracking skills can identify left and right hind footprints and collect images according to the FIT protocol. The images are then stored on an external or cloud-based drive for further analysis.

Additionally, the context mentions that FIT can be integrated with existing monitoring efforts, such as anti-poaching or community-outreach programs, at little extra cost. In areas where human resources are not already deployed, salaries for data collectors are required for fieldwork.

It is also mentioned that other methods, such as camera-trap or eDNA surveys, may be used for monitoring low-density populations, but these methods may be more costly and dependent on local costs.

There is no mention of surveys, sensors, or public datasets as methods for collecting raw data in the FIT pipeline.
