Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on the use of Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN) and residual neural networks (ResNet) for object detection tasks, particularly in the context of UAV thermal images. It discusses the limitations of deeper layers in capturing spatial information and the benefits of combining feature maps from different layers using FPN. However, it does not provide information on regularization methods used to prevent overfitting. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
