Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the EF network, the training setup, and the influence of the number of training samples on the model's performance.

However, it can be inferred that some form of preprocessing might have been performed, as the context mentions the creation of a "global training set" and the selection of "mini-patches" for training the SVMs filter bank. This suggests that the data might have been preprocessed to create a suitable format for training the models.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a "dropout rate" and "weight decay" in the training setup, which are techniques used to prevent overfitting in deep learning models. However, these are not preprocessing steps per se, but rather techniques used during the training process.

In summary, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. If you are looking for information on preprocessing steps, you might need to refer to a different source.
