Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning techniques for bird species classification, image recognition, and radiomics analysis. It discusses various network models, optimization techniques, and architectural designs, but does not address the specific topic of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of batch normalization (BN) layers, which can help reduce the effect of randomness in the training process by normalizing the input data for each layer. Additionally, the context mentions the use of activation functions, such as cascading multiple activation functions, which can help introduce non-linearity into the model and potentially reduce the impact of randomness.

Overall, while the context does not provide a direct answer to the query, it suggests that the authors are aware of the importance of controlling for randomness in the training process and have employed techniques such as batch normalization to mitigate its effects.
