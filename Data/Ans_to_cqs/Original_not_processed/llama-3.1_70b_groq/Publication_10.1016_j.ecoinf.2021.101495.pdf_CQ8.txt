Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the computing infrastructure used to train the neural networks, the hyperparameters used for training, and the performance of the models, but it does not provide information about where the code is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
