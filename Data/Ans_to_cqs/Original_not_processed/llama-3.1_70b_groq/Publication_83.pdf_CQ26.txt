Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss methods for dealing with varying length audio data. Two methods are mentioned: 

1. Repeating the signal from the beginning to force a fixed duration of 2s.
2. Directly resizing the audio image to a fixed size.

These methods are used to preprocess the audio data before feeding it into the CNN-based model, but they do not specifically address data bias. The context does not provide information on techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.
