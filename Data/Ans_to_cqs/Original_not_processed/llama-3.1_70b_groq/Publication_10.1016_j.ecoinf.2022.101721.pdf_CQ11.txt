Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to species identification and population size estimation using machine learning, but it does not provide any information about a specific data repository or a link to one. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other data repository.
