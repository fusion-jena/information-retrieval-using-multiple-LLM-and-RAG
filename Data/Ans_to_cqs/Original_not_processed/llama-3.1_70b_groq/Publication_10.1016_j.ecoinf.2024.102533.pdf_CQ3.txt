Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to focus on fish freshness classification, clustering, and machine learning experiments, but it does not delve into the details of data annotation techniques.

However, it does mention that the research utilizes six organoleptic parameters and applies them to seven fish species, serving as the standard for automatically classifying fish freshness. This suggests that the data annotation might involve labeling or categorizing the fish based on these parameters, but the specific techniques used are not mentioned.

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query, and I would recommend consulting additional sources or the original research papers for more information on the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
