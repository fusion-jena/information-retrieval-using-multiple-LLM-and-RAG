Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context appears to be a collection of research papers and figures related to remote sensing and machine learning, but it does not provide information on model deployment.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question. The context does not provide any information on model serialization, platform selection, or any other aspect of deploying a trained deep learning model.
