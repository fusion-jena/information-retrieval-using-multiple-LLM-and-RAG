Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in the context provided is primarily classification. The studies mentioned in the text focus on using deep learning models for plant species classification, disease detection in crops, and identifying medicinal plants. Specifically, the models are used for:

* Leaf-based plant species classification
* Detecting diseases in single crop species
* Classifying a large group of Indian medicinal plants
* Identifying plant species
* Automating plant species classification
* Recognizing multiple disease varieties in a single crop

The models used for these purposes include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), VGG-16, ResNet-50, and others. The primary goal of these models is to classify images of plants or crops into different categories, such as species, diseases, or varieties.
