Answer:

According to the provided context, data augmentation is used to address data imbalance problems in classification tasks during preprocessing. This is mentioned in section b) "Some preprocessing steps like data augmentation and normalization are performed to address the diversity of training data and data imbalance problems in classification tasks."

There is no mention of other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection being used to address data bias during preprocessing. However, it is mentioned that the performance of the proposed EMViT-Net is compared on both the original dataset and the augmented dataset, and the results show that the performance obtained by CNN models after augmentation is higher than the performance obtained under the original dataset. This suggests that data augmentation is an effective technique used to address data imbalance problems in this specific deep learning pipeline.
