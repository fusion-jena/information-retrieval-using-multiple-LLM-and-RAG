Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is two-fold: segmentation and classification. 

The segmentation model is used to separate individual fishes from the rest of the image, as shown in Figure 3. This is done using a neural network architecture obtained from the TensorFlow Object Detection API.

The classification model, on the other hand, is used for fish classification by species. A residual neural network architecture, specifically the ResNet50V2 model, is used for this task. The model is pre-trained with the ImageNet dataset and fine-tuned for the specific task of fish species classification.
