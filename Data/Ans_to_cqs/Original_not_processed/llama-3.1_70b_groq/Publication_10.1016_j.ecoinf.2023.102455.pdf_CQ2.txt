Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the data is likely in a numerical format, possibly in a CSV file, as the context mentions "predictors" and "streamflow" data, which are typically numerical in nature. Additionally, the context mentions the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which are commonly used for time-series data, further supporting the likelihood of numerical data. However, without explicit mention of the data format, it is impossible to provide a definitive answer.
