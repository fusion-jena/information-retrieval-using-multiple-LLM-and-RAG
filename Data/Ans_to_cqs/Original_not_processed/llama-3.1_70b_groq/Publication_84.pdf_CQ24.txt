Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning for the detection of invasive species, specifically S. alterniflora, using phenological features and Landsat images. It discusses the potential of deep learning in improving the performance of invasive species detection and compares its performance with traditional machine learning methods.

However, it does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this query.
