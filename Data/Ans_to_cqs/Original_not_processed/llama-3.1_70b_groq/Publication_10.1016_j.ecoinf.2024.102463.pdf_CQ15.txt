Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on Hyperband, a hyperparameter optimization technique, and discusses the architecture of a neural network, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent highway networks (RHNs). It also mentions the use of gates in RHNs to control the flow of data between layers, but it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used for training the models.
