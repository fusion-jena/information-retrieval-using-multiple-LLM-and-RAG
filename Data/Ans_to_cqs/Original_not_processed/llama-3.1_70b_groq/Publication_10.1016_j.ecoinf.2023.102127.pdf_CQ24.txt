Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning pipelines or strategies for handling randomness in such pipelines. The context appears to be focused on species distribution models, biodiversity datasets, and ecological informatics. It discusses the challenges of working with biased and limited data, the importance of accounting for biases, and the use of various modeling approaches, such as ensemble modeling and model-based boosting. However, it does not provide any information on deep learning pipelines or strategies for handling randomness in such pipelines.
