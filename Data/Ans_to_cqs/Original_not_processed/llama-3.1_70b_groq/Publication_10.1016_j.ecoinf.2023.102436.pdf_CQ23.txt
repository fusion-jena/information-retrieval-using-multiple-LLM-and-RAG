Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on 3D spatial metrics, landscape design, and environmental performance evaluation, but it does not provide information on the development or validation of a deep learning model. Therefore, I don't know what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
