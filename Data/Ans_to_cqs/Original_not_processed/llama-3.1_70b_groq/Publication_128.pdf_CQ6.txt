Answer:::
According to the provided context, before training a deep learning model, the input data undergoes the following preprocessing step:

* Batch normalization: The input data is batch normalized before training. This step is mentioned in the context as a preprocessing step to ensure the accuracy of the experimental results.

Additionally, the context mentions that the input data has a resolution of 224Ã—224 with Red Green Blue (RGB) format. However, it does not explicitly mention any other preprocessing steps such as scaling or cleaning.

It is worth noting that the context does not provide a comprehensive list of preprocessing steps, and it only mentions batch normalization as a specific preprocessing step. Therefore, it is possible that other preprocessing steps may be involved, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.
