Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is XGBoostClassifier, which is an implementation of the Extreme Gradient Boosting algorithm. It is not a traditional deep learning model like CNN, RNN, or Transformer, but rather an ensemble learning method that uses a series of decision trees to classify the target variables.
