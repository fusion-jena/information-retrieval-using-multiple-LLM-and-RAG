Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about hyperparameter optimization or model training. It appears to be a discussion about the use of various indices (Rao's Q, Shannon's H, Simpson's D, and CV) to assess heterogeneity in LiDAR data, specifically in the context of forest structure analysis. There is no mention of machine learning models or hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search.
