Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the data was divided into training and testing subsets using the train_test_split function from the scikit-learn library, with 70% of the data designated for training and 30% for testing. Additionally, it is mentioned that individuals from the control and pesticide-exposed groups were evenly distributed between these subsets, guaranteeing a balanced representation of each class.

This suggests that the data was split in a way that maintains the class balance, which can help to mitigate some issues related to data bias. However, it does not provide information on other techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.

It is worth noting that the context mentions a reference to a research paper on "Cross-validation for imbalanced datasets: avoiding overoptimistic and overfitting approaches", which suggests that the authors may have considered issues related to data bias and imbalance. However, the specific techniques used to address these issues are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, based on the provided information, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
