Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing, geospatial analysis, and environmental applications, with a few papers discussing the use of deep learning for tasks like detecting artisanal small-scale mining or mapping land use/land cover changes. However, the specific data augmentation techniques used in these pipelines are not mentioned.
