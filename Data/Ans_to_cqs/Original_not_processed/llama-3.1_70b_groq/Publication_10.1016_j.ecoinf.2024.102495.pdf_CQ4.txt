Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and classification of mosquito voice recordings, as well as the implementation of Mel spectrogram feature extraction. It also discusses the performance of different CNN configurations and the use of deep learning algorithms for pattern recognition.

While data augmentation is a common technique used in deep learning pipelines to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset, the specific techniques used in this case are not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this question.
