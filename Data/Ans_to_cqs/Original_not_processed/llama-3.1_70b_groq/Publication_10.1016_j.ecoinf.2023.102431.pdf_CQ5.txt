Answer: The text does not mention the use of a deep learning pipeline or any specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The text appears to be discussing a study that uses camera trap images and track data to identify species and sex of fisher and marten using linear discriminant analyses. The datasets used in this study are not publicly known datasets like MNIST or ImageNet, but rather a custom dataset created from camera trap images and track data.
