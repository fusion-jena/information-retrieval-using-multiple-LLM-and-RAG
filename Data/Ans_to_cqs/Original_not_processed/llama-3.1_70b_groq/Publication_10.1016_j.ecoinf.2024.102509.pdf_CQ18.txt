Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Adjusted R2, Mean Squared Error (MSE), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) (Table 1). Additionally, the context mentions that the model's performance is compared to other conventional methods, and that repeated training and testing are necessary to develop an optimal neural network and attain high accuracy. 

It can be inferred that the model's performance is monitored through the use of these metrics and through a process of trial and error, where the model is repeatedly trained and tested to optimize its structure. However, the specific strategy or technique used to monitor the model's performance during training is not explicitly stated.
