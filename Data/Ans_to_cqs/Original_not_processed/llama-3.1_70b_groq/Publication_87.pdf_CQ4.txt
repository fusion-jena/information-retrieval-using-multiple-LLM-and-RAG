Answer:::

According to the provided context, specifically the paper "A Survey on Image Data Augmentation for Deep Learning" by Shorten and Khoshgoftaar (2019), various data augmentation techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline to artificially increase the size of the training dataset and improve model performance.

Some of the data augmentation techniques mentioned in the paper include:

1. Flipping: Flipping the image horizontally or vertically to create new training examples.
2. Rotating: Rotating the image by a certain angle to create new training examples.
3. Scaling: Scaling the image up or down to create new training examples.
4. Color jittering: Randomly changing the brightness, contrast, and saturation of the image.
5. Translation: Translating the image by a certain number of pixels to create new training examples.
6. Cropping: Randomly cropping a portion of the image to create new training examples.
7. Noise injection: Adding random noise to the image to create new training examples.

These data augmentation techniques can be applied individually or in combination to create a large and diverse set of training examples, which can help improve the performance of deep learning models.

It's worth noting that the specific data augmentation techniques used can depend on the specific problem and dataset being worked with. The paper provides a comprehensive overview of various data augmentation techniques and their applications in deep learning.
