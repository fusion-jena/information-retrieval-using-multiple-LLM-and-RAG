Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the challenges of applying deep learning to natural systems, the need for large training datasets, and the use of semi-supervised and self-supervised learning approaches to address these challenges.

However, it does mention the use of Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) data and RGB images, which may require preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning. But the specific preprocessing steps involved are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
