Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention the concept of "validation loss" in the context of training deep neural networks. 

In general, validation loss is a common metric used to evaluate the performance of a model during training. A plateau in validation loss can be an indication that the model has converged and training can be stopped. However, the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete may vary depending on the specific problem, model architecture, and training setup.

Some common criteria used to determine when training is complete include:

* Validation loss plateau: When the validation loss stops improving or reaches a plateau, it may be an indication that the model has converged.
* Validation accuracy: When the validation accuracy reaches a certain threshold or stops improving, it may be an indication that the model has converged.
* Number of epochs: Training can be stopped after a fixed number of epochs, regardless of the validation loss or accuracy.

However, without more specific information, it is difficult to provide a more detailed answer.
