Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model. The text primarily focuses on the architecture of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model, the data used, and the performance evaluation metrics. It does mention that the model was trained using data from 2005 to 2015 and tested using data from 2016 to 2018, but it does not provide information on any preprocessing steps that may have been applied to the data before training the model. Therefore, I do not know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this study.
