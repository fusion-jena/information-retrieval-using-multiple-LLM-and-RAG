Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a research study on whale vocalizations, specifically discussing data analysis, visual sightings, and song patterns. There is no mention of deep learning models, model serialization, or platform selection. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide an answer to the query.
