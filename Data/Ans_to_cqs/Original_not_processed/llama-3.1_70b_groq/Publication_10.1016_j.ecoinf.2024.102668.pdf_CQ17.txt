Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to audio signal processing, acoustic indices, and preprocessing methods for audio recordings, but it does not discuss deep learning or regularization techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
