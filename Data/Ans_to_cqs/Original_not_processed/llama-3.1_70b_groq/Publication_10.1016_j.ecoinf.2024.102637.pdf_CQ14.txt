Answer: The text does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the learning rate was optimized using the Adam optimizer, but it does not provide information on how the other hyperparameters, such as Î», were optimized. It is also mentioned that the batch size was set to 16 and the number of epochs was set to 200, but it is not clear if these values were chosen through a hyperparameter optimization process or if they were simply chosen based on some other criteria.
