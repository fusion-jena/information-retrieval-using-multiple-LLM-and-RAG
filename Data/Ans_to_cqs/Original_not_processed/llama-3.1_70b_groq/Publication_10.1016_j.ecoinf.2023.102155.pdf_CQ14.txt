Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, it does mention that the `ppmlasso` package is used, and one of the arguments is `n.fits`, which is the number of models to fit through the regularization path. This suggests that the model may use a form of regularization path optimization, but the exact method of hyperparameter optimization is not specified.

Additionally, the context mentions that the `ppmlassoMixEngine` function returns the same elements as the `ppmMixEngine` function, which is described in the supporting information of Guilbault et al. (2021). However, without access to this supporting information, it is unclear how the hyperparameters are optimized.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the exact method of hyperparameter optimization used in the model.
