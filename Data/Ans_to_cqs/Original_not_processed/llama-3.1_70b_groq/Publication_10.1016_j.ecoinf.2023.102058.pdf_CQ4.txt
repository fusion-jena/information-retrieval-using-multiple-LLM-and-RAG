Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily discusses the application of machine learning algorithms to hyperspectral data for predicting water quality parameters, the importance of considering atmospheric correction algorithms, and the need for intelligent feature selection techniques to reduce the feature space dimension.

While the context mentions the use of deep learning algorithms, it does not provide details on the specific techniques used for data augmentation. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to the query.
