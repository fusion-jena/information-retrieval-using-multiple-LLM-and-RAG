Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be focused on model evaluation metrics, such as AUC, TPR, TSS, and Kappa, and the selection of a threshold for model evaluation. It does not provide information on the training process or the criteria used to determine when training is complete. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
