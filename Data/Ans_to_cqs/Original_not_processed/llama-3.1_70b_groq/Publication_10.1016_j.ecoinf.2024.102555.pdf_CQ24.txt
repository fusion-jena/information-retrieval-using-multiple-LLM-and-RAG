Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about handling randomness in deep learning pipelines or the use of random seed values. The context appears to be focused on environmental and ecological studies, including vegetation dynamics, climate change, and remote sensing applications. There is no mention of deep learning or machine learning techniques in the context, except for a few studies that use machine learning techniques for attribution of climate and human activities to vegetation change, but they do not discuss handling randomness in the pipeline. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide an answer to this query.
