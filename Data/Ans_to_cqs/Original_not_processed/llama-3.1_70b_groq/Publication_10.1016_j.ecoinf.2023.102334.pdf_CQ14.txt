Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses the model architecture, experimental parameter settings, and results, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process. It mentions the use of an improved SoftMax function to speed up training and improve robustness, but it does not elaborate on the hyperparameter tuning process.

Therefore, I do not know how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, and I cannot provide a more specific answer.
