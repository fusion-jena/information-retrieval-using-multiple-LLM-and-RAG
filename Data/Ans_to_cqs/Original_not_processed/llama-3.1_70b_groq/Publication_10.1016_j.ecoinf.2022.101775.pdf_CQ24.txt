Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of stochastic gradient descent for optimizing the regularized cost function, which implies that randomness is involved in the training process.

In the context of deep learning, randomness is often handled through techniques such as:

* Setting a random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results
* Using techniques like dropout to randomly drop out units during training to prevent overfitting
* Using batch normalization to normalize the input data for each mini-batch
* Using techniques like data augmentation to artificially increase the size of the training dataset by applying random transformations to the input data

However, without more specific information about the deep learning pipeline being referred to, it is difficult to provide more specific strategies for handling randomness.

It is worth noting that the context mentions the use of Pytorch as the framework for implementing the algorithms, and Google Colaboratory as the environment for training and testing the models. Pytorch provides various ways to handle randomness, such as setting the random seed using the `torch.manual_seed()` function, but without more specific information, it is difficult to provide more detailed strategies.
