Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or any measures taken to ensure its generalizability. The context appears to be related to ecological research, specifically the identification of ecosystem service bundles and the analysis of their spatial patterns. It mentions the use of the Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM) algorithm, which is a type of unsupervised learning neural network, but it does not provide information on the generalizability of the model.
