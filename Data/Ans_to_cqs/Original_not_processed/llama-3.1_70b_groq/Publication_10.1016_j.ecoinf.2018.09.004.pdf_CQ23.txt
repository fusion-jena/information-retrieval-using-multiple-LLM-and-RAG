Answer:

To ensure the generalizability of the model, the researchers used stratified cross-validation with K = 10 folds. This means that the dataset was split into 10 equally-sized parts, and in each iteration, 9 parts were used for training and the remaining part for testing. This process was repeated 10 times, with each part being used for testing once. This approach guarantees that every instance in the dataset is used both for training and testing, which helps to ensure that the model is not biased towards a particular subset of the data.

Additionally, the researchers used stratified splitting, which means that each fold contained a balanced number of instances for each class. This is particularly important in this case, as the dataset is imbalanced, with one class (Cymodocea) constituting 75% of the dataset. By using stratified splitting, the researchers ensured that the model was not biased towards the dominant class and that the performance metrics were not skewed.

It's worth noting that the researchers did not mention using a diverse dataset or any other techniques to ensure generalizability, such as data augmentation or transfer learning. However, the use of stratified cross-validation with 10 folds is a robust approach to ensure that the model is generalizable to unseen data.
