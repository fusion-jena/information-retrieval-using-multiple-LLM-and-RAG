Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the dataset was annotated using ImageLab, and an example of deer annotation is shown in Figure 10. The annotation process involved verifying the annotations to prevent subjective biases and ensure accuracy and reliability.

From the context, it can be inferred that the annotation technique used is likely bounding box annotation, as the example in Figure 10 shows deer instances annotated with bounding boxes. However, there is no mention of instance segmentation as an annotation technique used in this specific pipeline.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of anchor boxes in the object detection architecture, which is a common technique used in bounding box annotation. Anchor boxes are used to generate regions of interest (RoIs) and facilitate bounding box regression.

In summary, while the context does not provide an exhaustive list of data annotation techniques used in the pipeline, it suggests that bounding box annotation is likely one of the techniques used.
