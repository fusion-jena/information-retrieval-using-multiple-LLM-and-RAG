Answer: The provided context does not specifically mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of True Skill Statistics (TSS) as a validation metric, which is implemented in the "modEvA" R-package. Additionally, it mentions the use of thresholding with minimum presence values, fixed or percentile values, to create binary, categorical percentile, and normalized outputs. But it does not provide a comprehensive list of metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model, such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
