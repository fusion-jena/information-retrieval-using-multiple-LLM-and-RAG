Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the data is standardized, and the standardization parameters are calculated on one of the three datasets (defined as the training base) and applied to the other two datasets (considered as the test base). This suggests that the model is being trained and tested on different datasets, which could help to evaluate its generalizability.

Additionally, the context mentions that the best result of the optimization will allow determining the base that will be used for training. This implies that the model is being trained and evaluated on different datasets, and the performance is being compared across these datasets. However, it is not clear if this is done using techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting.

Overall, while the context provides some information about the training and testing process, it does not provide explicit details about measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.
