Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on ensemble modeling, machine learning algorithms, and their applications in forest fire susceptibility mapping. It discusses the use of various machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest, and the importance of calibration and validation using techniques like cross-validation. However, it does not delve into the specifics of preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

That being said, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to perform preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, and cleaning to prepare the data for modeling. Normalization typically involves scaling numeric data to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model. Scaling involves transforming data to have a specific mean and standard deviation, often to improve model convergence. Cleaning involves handling missing values, outliers, and noisy data to ensure the quality of the data.

However, without explicit information in the provided context, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query. If you're looking for information on preprocessing steps for deep learning models, I recommend consulting a relevant resource or documentation specific to the model or framework you're using.
