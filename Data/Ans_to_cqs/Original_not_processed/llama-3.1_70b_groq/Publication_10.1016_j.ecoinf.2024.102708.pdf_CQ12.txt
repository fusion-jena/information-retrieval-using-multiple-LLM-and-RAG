Answer: The text mentions the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models. Specifically, it mentions the use of YOLOv5, which is a type of CNN, and TPH-YOLOv5, which is a variant of YOLOv5 with a Transformer Prediction Head. Additionally, it mentions Faster R-CNN (FR-CNN), which is also a type of CNN. The text also mentions the possibility of using other types of models, such as ResNets and DenseNets, but these are not used in the pipeline.
