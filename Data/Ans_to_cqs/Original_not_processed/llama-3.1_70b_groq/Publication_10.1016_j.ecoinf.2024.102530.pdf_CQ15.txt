Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a fuzzy inference system (FIS) model, specifically the Apis-FIS model, and its application in evaluating the suitability of landscapes for a particular purpose. The context mentions the use of Matlab 2023b and its fuzzy logic toolbox, but it does not mention deep learning or any optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
