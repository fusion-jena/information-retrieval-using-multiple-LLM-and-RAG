Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the challenges and limitations of current deep learning frameworks in agriculture, the need for advances in deep learning techniques, and the potential of Bayesian deep learning models.

However, it can be inferred that sensors might be one of the methods used for collecting raw data, as the context mentions "smart farmingâ€“IoT initiatives" and "IoT in agriculture", which often involve the use of sensors to collect data. Additionally, the context mentions "domain-knowledge" and "plant phenological research", which might involve collecting data through surveys or other means. However, this is not explicitly stated.

Public datasets are also not explicitly mentioned as a method for collecting raw data, but the context does mention the limitations of current frameworks in terms of their reliance on large datasets, which might imply that public datasets are not always available or sufficient.

In summary, while the context provides some hints about the potential methods used for collecting raw data, it does not provide a clear answer to the query. Therefore, I can only speculate that sensors, surveys, and possibly public datasets might be used, but I do not know for certain.
