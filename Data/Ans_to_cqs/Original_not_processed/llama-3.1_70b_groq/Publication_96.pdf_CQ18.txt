Answer: 
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that "an accuracy is generated for each algorithm applied" during the training step, which suggests that accuracy is being used as a metric to evaluate the model's performance. Additionally, the context mentions that the input of the training data was split into two sets, with 70% of the samples used for training and 30% for testing, to estimate the ability of the DNN algorithm to map burned areas in the study area. This suggests that the model's performance is being evaluated on a test set during training, but the specific strategy or metrics used to monitor performance are not clearly stated.
