Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model is regression, specifically age prediction. The text mentions that "Accuracy of the regression tasks was calculated by rounding the prediction to the nearest integer age and comparing it with the ground truth." This indicates that the model is trained to predict a continuous value (age) rather than classify images into categories. The model is also evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and mean average percentage error (MAPE), which are commonly used for regression tasks.
