Answer: To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, k-fold cross-validation (k = 5) was used to determine the ideal training-test split for the model. This involved splitting the data into k different training-test sets and training the model on each split. The result was an investigation of the best data split, and the split with the highest mAP50 value (0.987) was used for the prediction of the model.

Additionally, the model was trained on two different datasets: a modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset of handwritten digits, and the researchers' own dataset of clusters of extracted numbers. This use of multiple datasets helps to increase the generalizability of the model by exposing it to different types of data.

However, it is not mentioned whether the dataset was diverse or if stratified splitting was used. The use of stratified splitting would have ensured that the training and test sets had the same proportion of each class, which can help to improve the generalizability of the model. But this information is not provided in the given context.
