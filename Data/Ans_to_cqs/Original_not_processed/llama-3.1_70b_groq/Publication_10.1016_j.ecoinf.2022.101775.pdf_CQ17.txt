Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of a min-max scaler and a validation set to check for overfitting during the training process. Additionally, it mentions the use of Adam as the optimization algorithm, which has a built-in regularization mechanism.

The context also mentions the use of stochastic gradient descent to optimize the regularized cost function, which suggests that some form of regularization is being used. However, the specific type of regularization is not mentioned.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I can only confirm that some form of regularization is being used, but I do not know the specific methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
