Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that the model was trained with N images randomly selected from the source dataset, and then used to predict all images of the target dataset. It also mentions that the model was trained with 400 training images in the LH dataset for a within-dataset analysis. 

Additionally, the context mentions that the model was tested on 200 test images sampled from the two datasets for the dataset classification task. However, it does not provide information on how the data was split for training, validation, and testing in general. Therefore, the exact criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training cannot be determined from the provided context.
