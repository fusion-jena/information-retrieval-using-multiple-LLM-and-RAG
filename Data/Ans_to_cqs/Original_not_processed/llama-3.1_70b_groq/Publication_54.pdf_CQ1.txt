Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the structure of the paper, deep learning models, and the application of transfer learning for recognizing endemic bird species. It does not provide information on data collection methods such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets. Therefore, I do not know the specific methods used for collecting raw data in this particular deep learning pipeline.
