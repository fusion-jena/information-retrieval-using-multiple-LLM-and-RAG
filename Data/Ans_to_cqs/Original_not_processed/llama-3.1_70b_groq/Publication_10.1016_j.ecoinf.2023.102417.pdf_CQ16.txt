Answer:

According to the provided context, the training was stopped after 100 epochs. Additionally, the training was performed using a cross-validation on the training data set with 80% training data and 20% validation data. This suggests that the training was monitored using validation metrics, but the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau, are not explicitly stated.

However, it is mentioned that the training was stopped after 100 epochs, which implies that a fixed number of epochs was used as a stopping criterion, rather than a specific validation loss threshold or plateau.
