Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a study on Apis-FIS (a fuzzy inference system) for evaluating the suitability of landscapes for honey bees, and it discusses the use of various data types, such as Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) maps, weather data, and field survey data. However, it does not mention any techniques for addressing data bias in deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. If you have any further context or clarification, I would be happy to try and assist you further.
