Answer: I don't know. The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions the sources of the datasets used, which are:

* https://www.resdc.cn/
* https://www.tpedc.ac.cn/
* https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/

These sources are listed in Table 1 as the sources of the datasets for Economy (GDP), Society (NTL), and Ecology (NPP) aspects, respectively. However, it does not provide information on where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
