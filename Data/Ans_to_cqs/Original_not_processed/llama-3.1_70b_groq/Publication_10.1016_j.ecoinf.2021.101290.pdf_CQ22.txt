Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models. However, it does mention a study by Kovalev et al. (2016) that compares the speed and accuracy of different deep learning frameworks, including Theano, Torch, Caffe, TensorFlow, and deeplearning4j. This suggests that accuracy is one of the metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models.

Additionally, the context mentions a paper by LeCun et al. (2015) that provides a general overview of deep learning, but it does not specifically discuss evaluation metrics.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the only metric that can be confirmed as being used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models is accuracy. However, it is likely that other metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, etc. are also used, but this cannot be confirmed based on the provided context.
