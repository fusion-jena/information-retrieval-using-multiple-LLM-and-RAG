Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that the model with the best accuracy was retained after training the three main DNN models for 200 epochs. This suggests that the training process was stopped after a fixed number of epochs, rather than being based on a specific criteria such as validation loss plateau. Additionally, the context mentions the use of learning and loss curves to diagnose the learning performance of the models over time, which could potentially be used to determine when training is complete, but it does not provide further details on this.
