Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions that a large environmental context around each observation is collected and provided to the model, including various predictors such as WorldClim2 bioclimatic variables, Soilgrids pedological variables, human footprint rasters, terrestrial ecoregions of the world, and the observation location (longitude and latitude). However, it does not provide information on how these data were collected.

Therefore, I do not know the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets.
