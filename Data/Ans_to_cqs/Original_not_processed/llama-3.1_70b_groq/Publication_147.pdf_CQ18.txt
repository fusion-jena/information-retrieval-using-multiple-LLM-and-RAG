Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention that the XGBoost model parameters were tuned using grid search functions to find the optimal value when judged by the test error metric. This suggests that the model's performance was evaluated based on its error on a test set, but the specific strategy used to monitor performance during training is not mentioned.
