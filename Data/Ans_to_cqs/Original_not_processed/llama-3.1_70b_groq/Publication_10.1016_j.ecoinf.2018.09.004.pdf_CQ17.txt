Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be focused on a specific experiment using machine learning algorithms for classification tasks, including cross-validation and variable importance determination. It does not provide information on the specific techniques used to prevent overfitting in the experiment.
