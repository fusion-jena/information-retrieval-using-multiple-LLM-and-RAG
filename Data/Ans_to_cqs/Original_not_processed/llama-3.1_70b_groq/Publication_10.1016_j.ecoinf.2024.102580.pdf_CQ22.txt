Answer:

The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall. 

Accuracy is reported to be 92% for the semantic segmentation model used to identify substrate types. 

Precision is reported for each class: 0.90 for the vegetation class, 0.96 for the bare class, and 0.50 for the 'other' class. 

Recall is also reported for each class: 0.97 for vegetation, 0.87 for bare substrate, and 0.53 for the 'other' class. 

These metrics are used to evaluate the model's performance against the test dataset.
