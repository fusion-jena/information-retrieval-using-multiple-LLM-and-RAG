Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on digital soil mapping, land cover classification, and remote sensing, with references to various machine learning algorithms such as artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), and random forests (RF).

However, I can provide some general information on common preprocessing steps that are often involved before training a deep learning model. These may include:

* Normalization: scaling the input data to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model.
* Scaling: transforming the input data to have zero mean and unit variance, which can help improve the stability and speed of training.
* Cleaning: handling missing or noisy data, such as removing or imputing missing values, and removing outliers or anomalies.
* Feature extraction: transforming the input data into a more suitable representation for the model, such as extracting features from images or text.

It's worth noting that the specific preprocessing steps required may depend on the specific problem, dataset, and model architecture. Without more information on the specific deep learning model and dataset being used, it's difficult to provide more specific guidance.

In the context of the provided references, some papers mention the use of texture statistics, co-occurrence texture statistics, and multi-scale textural features, which may involve some preprocessing steps such as image filtering or feature extraction. However, the specific preprocessing steps involved are not explicitly mentioned.
