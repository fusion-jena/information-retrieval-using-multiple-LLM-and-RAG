Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not provide information on the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the pre-processing and analysis of audio data, specifically vocalisations of different animal species, using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It discusses the challenges of working with bioacoustic datasets, the importance of selecting suitable input sizes, and the performance of different CNN architectures.

However, it does not mention the methods used for collecting the raw audio data, such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
