Answer: Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily uses image data. The context mentions the use of images from camera traps, which were manually classified and then used to train a model. The specific data format is not explicitly mentioned, but it can be inferred that the images are likely in a format such as JPEG or PNG, which are common formats for image data. There is no mention of audio or video data being used in the pipeline. CSV (Comma Separated Values) is not mentioned as a data format used in the pipeline, but it is possible that CSV files were used to store metadata or other information related to the images.
