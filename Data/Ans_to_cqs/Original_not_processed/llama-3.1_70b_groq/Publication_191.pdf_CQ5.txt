Answer:::
The provided context mentions several datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, specifically for image classification tasks. These datasets include:

1. PlantClef2015 dataset: This is a plant database with around 113,205 images and 100 categories.
2. MS COCO (Microsoft Common Objects in Context): This dataset has 328,000 images (2.5 million labeled instances) and 91 categories.
3. Places2: This dataset contains 8.3 million images and 365 categories.
4. Sport-1M: This dataset has 1 million videos and 487 categories.
5. Visual Genome QA: This dataset contains 1.7 million questions/answer pairs.
6. ILSVRC 2010 (ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2010): This dataset has 1.4 million images and 100 categories.

These datasets are used for training and testing deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for image classification tasks. However, it's worth noting that the context does not mention MNIST or CIFAR datasets, which are commonly used in deep learning pipelines.
