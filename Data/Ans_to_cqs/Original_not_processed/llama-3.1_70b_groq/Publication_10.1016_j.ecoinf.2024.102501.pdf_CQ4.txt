Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to focus on the application of machine learning and deep learning methods for predicting dissolved oxygen concentration in water, discussing the strengths and limitations of different approaches, and referencing various studies. However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.

Therefore, I must answer that I don't know what data augmentation techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline, as this information is not present in the provided context.
