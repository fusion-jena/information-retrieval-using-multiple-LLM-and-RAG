Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention the use of Genetic Programming (GP) for feature selection and modeling tasks, as well as the use of Eureqa Pro software for GP modeling.

One of the references, Bowden et al. (2002), mentions the importance of optimal division of data for neural network models in water resources applications, but it does not provide specific criteria for splitting the data.

Therefore, I do not know the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training based on the provided context.
