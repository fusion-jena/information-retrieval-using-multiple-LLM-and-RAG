Answer: 
The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or its performance evaluation metrics. However, it does mention the evaluation criteria used for drought modeling, which are the Correlation Coefficient (R) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) obtained from in-situ observations and satellite data.
