Answer:

The data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that a web-based annotation tool was designed and developed to support animal scientists in labeling goat vocalizations. The tool is available in the back-end area of the official project's website.

Additionally, it is mentioned that the annotation process is based on the information provided by the available farm records filled by the stock persons and the output of the YAMNet-based goat vocalization detection algorithm. Cameras were also positioned in the barns, and videos were transmitted via WiFi to a digital video recorder and stored on a hard disk. These videos, together with farm records, were used to support the labeling of goat vocalizations.

It is also mentioned that the list of possible events (i.e., event types) was provided by domain experts, namely animal scientists and farmers. However, the specific annotation techniques used, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, are not mentioned.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
