Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on machine learning models, particularly LightGBM and XGBoost, and their application to a specific problem, possibly related to remote sensing or environmental monitoring (given the mention of AGB, which could stand for Above-Ground Biomass). The context also discusses hyperparameter optimization and model interpretation, but does not delve into data annotation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
