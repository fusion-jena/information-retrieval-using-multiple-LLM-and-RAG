Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. However, it does mention that the network was trained using a two-stage process, with the second stage involving fine-tuning the network as a whole using smaller learning rates. This suggests that the learning rate was adjusted during the training process, but the specific optimization algorithm used is not specified.
