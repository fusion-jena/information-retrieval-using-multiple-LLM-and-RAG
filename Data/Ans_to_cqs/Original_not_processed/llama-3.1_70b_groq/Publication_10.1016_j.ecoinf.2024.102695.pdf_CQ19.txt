Answer: PyTorch.

The text mentions that "All the tests are run on a Windows 11 operating system using Python 3.8", but it does not explicitly mention the deep learning framework used. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that PyTorch is likely the framework used, as it is a popular deep learning framework that is often used with Python. Additionally, the text mentions the use of a GPU (NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060), which is consistent with PyTorch's support for GPU acceleration.
