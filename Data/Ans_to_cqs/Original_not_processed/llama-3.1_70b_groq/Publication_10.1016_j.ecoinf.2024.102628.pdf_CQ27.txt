Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only discusses the training and validation of the model using the fast.ai platform and the Leave-One-Group-Out cross-validation approach. It does not provide information on model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related steps. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
