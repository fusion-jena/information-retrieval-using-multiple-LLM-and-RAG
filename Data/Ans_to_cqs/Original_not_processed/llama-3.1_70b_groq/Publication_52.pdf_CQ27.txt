Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the benefits of Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) in handling and analyzing Big Data, and their application in biosecurity, specifically in machine hearing for marine species identification. However, it does not provide information on model deployment, such as model serialization or platform selection.
