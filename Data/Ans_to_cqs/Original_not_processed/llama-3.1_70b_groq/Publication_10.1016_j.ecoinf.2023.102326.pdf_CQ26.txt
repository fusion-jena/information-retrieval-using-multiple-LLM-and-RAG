Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the analysis of urban acoustic environments and the use of machine learning approaches for sound event classification. It does not provide information on techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection that are commonly used to address data bias in deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
