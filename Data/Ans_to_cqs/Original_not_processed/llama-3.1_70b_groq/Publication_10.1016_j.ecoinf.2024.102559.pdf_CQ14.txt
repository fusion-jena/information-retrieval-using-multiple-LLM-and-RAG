Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context appears to be focused on the results of the classification models, including accuracy metrics and classification results, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process. Therefore, I do not know how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.
