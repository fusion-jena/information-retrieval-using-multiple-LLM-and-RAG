Answer: The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the provided context are:

1. Aquarium dataset (part of the Marine Dataset)
2. Trash-ICRA19 dataset (part of the Marine Dataset)
3. VisDrone dataset
4. NWPU VHR-10 dataset
5. HRSID dataset
6. URPC datasets (consisting of 1201 images with four object categories: holothurian, echinus, scallop, and starfish)

Note that the context does not mention MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet datasets, which are commonly used in deep learning pipelines. The datasets mentioned in the context appear to be specific to the task of object detection in marine environments and remote sensing.
