Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on text processing, data cleaning, and theme perception technology, including Chinese text segmentation, machine learning methods, and the use of specific models like ERNIE and LDA. It does not delve into the specifics of deep learning pipeline regularization methods. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
