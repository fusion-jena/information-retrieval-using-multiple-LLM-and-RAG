Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. The text appears to be discussing species distribution modeling, specifically using the Maxent model, and evaluating its performance using metrics such as AICc, AUC, and TSS. There is no mention of deep learning or its associated hyperparameters, such as learning rate or optimizer.
