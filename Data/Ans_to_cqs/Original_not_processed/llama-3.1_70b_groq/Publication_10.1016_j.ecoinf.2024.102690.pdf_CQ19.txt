Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. It only mentions that the study used the R package "kohonen" for the Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM) algorithm, but it does not provide information on the frameworks used for building the deep learning model.
