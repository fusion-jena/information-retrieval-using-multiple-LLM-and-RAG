Answer:::
The provided context does not specifically mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it does mention the use of CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) in certain studies, such as the one by Zhou et al. (2016) that used class activation maps to identify discriminative regions. Additionally, it mentions the use of LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory) networks, a type of RNN (Recurrent Neural Network), in studies such as the one by Arras et al. (2019) that proposed a Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) for LSTM networks. However, it does not explicitly state that these models are used in the pipeline.
