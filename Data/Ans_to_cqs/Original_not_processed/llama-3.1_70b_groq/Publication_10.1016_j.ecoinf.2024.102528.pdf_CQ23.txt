Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the framework was applied to over 80 species and that 20 species with the highest recall scores were selected for further analysis. Additionally, the study used the Agmon annotated dataset to examine the BirdNET deep learning model, which suggests that some effort was made to evaluate the model's performance on a specific dataset.

It is also mentioned that the relationships between the confidence thresholds and the precision and recall values are species-specific, and that species-specific confidence thresholds were used to yield detection scores that account for the precision-recall tradeoff. This suggests that the model's performance was evaluated and adjusted for different species, which could help to improve its generalizability.

However, without more information, it is unclear whether other measures such as cross-validation or stratified splitting were used to ensure the generalizability of the model.
