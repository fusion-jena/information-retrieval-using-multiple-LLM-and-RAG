Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. The context appears to be a collection of references and abstracts from various research papers and articles, but it does not provide detailed information about the hyperparameters used in a specific deep learning model.

However, one of the references, "Kovalev, V., Kalinovsky, A., Kovalev, S., 2016. Deep Learning with Theano, Torch, Caffe, Tensorflow, and deeplearning4j: Which One Is the Best in Speed and Accuracy?" suggests that the authors compared the performance of different deep learning frameworks, but it does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in the comparison.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
