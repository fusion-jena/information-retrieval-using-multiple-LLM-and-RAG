Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the application of deep learning models for plant disease classification, specifically using a dataset (possibly PlanVillage) that has been augmented using a complex data augmentation technique. The context mentions that the dataset has been pre-processed and enhanced with image enhancement techniques, but it does not provide information on how the raw data was initially collected. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
