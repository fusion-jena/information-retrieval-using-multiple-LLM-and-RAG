Answer: The pipeline uses various deep learning models, including DenseNet-161, ResNet-50, and Vision Transformers (ViT). Specifically, the ViT models used are ViT-S/16, ViT-B/16, and ViT-L/16, which are variants of the Vision Transformer model. These models are used for sound event detection and birdsong classification tasks. There is no mention of CNNs or RNNs being used in the pipeline, but rather a combination of DenseNet, ResNet, and Vision Transformer models.
