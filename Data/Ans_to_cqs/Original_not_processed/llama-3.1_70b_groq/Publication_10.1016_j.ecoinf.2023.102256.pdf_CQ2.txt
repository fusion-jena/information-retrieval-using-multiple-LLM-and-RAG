Answer:::
The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is spectrograms, which are visual representations of audio signals. The text mentions that the baseline model takes a spectrogram input and produces a probability for each of the 22 species. Additionally, the text mentions that the study used a dataset built specifically for this purpose, which included spectrograms recorded for different bird species. There is no mention of image, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline. However, it is mentioned that techniques commonly used in image processing can be adapted and effectively applied in bioacoustics for this purpose.
