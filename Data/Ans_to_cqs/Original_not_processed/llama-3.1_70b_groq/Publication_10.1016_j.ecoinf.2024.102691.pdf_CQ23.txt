Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the model architecture, training parameters, and attention mechanisms used in the YOLOv5 network. It discusses the input image size, batch size, optimizer, and learning rate, but does not provide information on the dataset or evaluation protocols used to ensure generalizability.

However, it is mentioned that the model was trained using a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer and that the models were trained using a cycle learning rate, which might indicate that some form of regularization or adaptive learning was used to improve generalizability. Nevertheless, without further information, it is difficult to determine the specific measures taken to ensure the model's generalizability.

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question based on the provided context.
