Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The text discusses various performance metrics, such as variance, R2 score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), precision, and recall, but it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine the completion of training.

However, it is mentioned that "The training duration indicates that both models underwent 50 complete iterations of processing the full dataset." This suggests that the training process may have been set to run for a fixed number of iterations, but it does not provide information on whether any other criteria, such as validation loss plateau, were used to determine when training was complete.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete.
