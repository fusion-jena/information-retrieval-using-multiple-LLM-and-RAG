Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the architecture and functionality of a specific deep learning model, particularly the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and its application to object detection tasks. It discusses the model's ability to handle small objects and the trade-offs between spatial resolution and semantic feature information, but it does not discuss data preprocessing or techniques for addressing data bias. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
