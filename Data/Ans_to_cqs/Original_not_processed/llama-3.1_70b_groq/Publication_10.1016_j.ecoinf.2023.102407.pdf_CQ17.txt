Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling (SDM) and provides information on various studies, datasets, and environmental variables used in SDM. However, it does not discuss deep learning or regularization methods.

The only mention of a deep learning-related topic is a reference to a paper by Lee (2013) titled "Pseudo-label: The simple and efficient semi-supervised learning method for deep neural networks." However, this paper is not discussed in detail, and its contents are not revealed in the provided context.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to the query regarding regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
