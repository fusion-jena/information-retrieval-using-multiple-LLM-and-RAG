Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. It does mention the use of stochastic gradient descent with momentum (SGDM) as the optimization algorithm and the convergence of the training after 1000 epochs, but it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training.

However, it does mention the use of confusion matrices to evaluate the model performance, as shown in Figure 8. This suggests that the model performance was evaluated after training, but it does not provide information on how the performance was monitored during training.

Therefore, I do not know the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training.
