Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the training parameters used in DeepLabV3+ and the sequential approach used for training the model on the Vasiliko dataset.

However, it does mention the calculation of performance metrics, as stated in the context: "The performance metrics were generated by sequentially training the model on each of the four quadrants of the Vasiliko dataset." This suggests that some form of metrics calculation is involved in the postprocessing steps, but the specific details are not provided.

Additionally, the context mentions the generation of results using the Kimisala-20 test image and the calculation of the average overall accuracy for the CNN model. This implies that some form of evaluation or metrics calculation is performed, but the exact postprocessing steps involved are not specified.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we can only confirm that metrics calculation is involved in the postprocessing steps, but the specific details about saliency maps, confusion matrix, and other postprocessing steps are not mentioned.
