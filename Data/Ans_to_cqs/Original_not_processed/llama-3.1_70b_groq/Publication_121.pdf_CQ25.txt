Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. The model is designed to classify images of leaves into different tree species. The model uses pre-trained models such as MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3 as a feature extractor, and then adds a dropout layer and a softmax layer to predict the class of an input image. The model is trained on a dataset of images and is optimized using Adam optimizer and Gradient descent. The model is then converted into a TensorFlow Lite version and integrated into a mobile app for tree species identification in remote areas.
