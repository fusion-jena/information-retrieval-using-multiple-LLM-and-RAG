Answer:::
I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data augmentation techniques or a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a research study on vegetation change, human activities, and climate change in China, using datasets such as NDVI and land use/cover data. The methodology section only mentions a GSN change trend analysis method, but does not provide information on data augmentation techniques or deep learning pipelines.
