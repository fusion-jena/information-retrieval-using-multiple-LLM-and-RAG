Answer: 

The text mentions the use of Bidirectional LSTM with GloVe embeddings, which suggests that a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is used in the pipeline. Specifically, Bidirectional LSTM is a variant of RNN that is designed to handle sequential data, and GloVe is a type of word embedding that is used to capture semantic information. Additionally, the text mentions the use of YOLO, which is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that is commonly used for object detection tasks. However, it is not clear if YOLO is used as part of the main pipeline or if it is being modified and used as a separate component.
