Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does provide information on the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the trained models, including Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), correlation coefficient (r), and Bias. These metrics are typically used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models, but the context does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training.
