Answer: 
The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the primary data format used is images, specifically satellite images. The context mentions the use of satellite image analysis, image classification, and the resampling of 20 m bands of imagery to 10 m. This suggests that the pipeline is working with image data. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
