Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is image classification, specifically animal classification. The text mentions that the model is used for "animal classification results" and that the goal is to improve the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning models for this task. Additionally, the text discusses the use of models such as EfficientNetV2 and Vision Transformers (ViT) for image classification problems.
