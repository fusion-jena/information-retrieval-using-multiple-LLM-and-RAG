Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only discusses the use of pre-trained models, such as BirdNET, VGGish, and Wav2Vec 2.0, and how they were used to extract embeddings from audio data. It also mentions the code and methods used to run the models, but it does not provide information on model deployment.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
