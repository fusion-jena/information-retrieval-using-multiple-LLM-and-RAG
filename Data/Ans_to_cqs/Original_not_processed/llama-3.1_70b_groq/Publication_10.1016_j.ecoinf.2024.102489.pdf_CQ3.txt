Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing, machine learning, and vegetation index-related topics, with a focus on Random Forest models and leaf area index (LAI) estimation.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
