Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on biomass estimation, fish length and weight estimation, and object detection in underwater images, but it does not provide information on data preprocessing techniques.

However, I can suggest some common techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, although these are not mentioned in the provided context:

* Stratified splitting: This technique involves splitting the data into training and testing sets while maintaining the same proportion of classes in both sets.
* Oversampling: This technique involves creating additional copies of the minority class to balance the data.
* Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of samples from the majority class to balance the data.
* Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from diverse sources to reduce bias in the data.

It's worth noting that these techniques are commonly used in deep learning pipelines, but the provided context does not mention them specifically. If you're looking for information on data preprocessing techniques used in the context of biomass estimation or fish length and weight estimation, I would recommend searching for additional resources.
