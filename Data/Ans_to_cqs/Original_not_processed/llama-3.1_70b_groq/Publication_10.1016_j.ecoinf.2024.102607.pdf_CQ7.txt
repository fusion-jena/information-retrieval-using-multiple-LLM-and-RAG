Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be focused on land use and land cover (LULC) mapping using random forest and other machine learning techniques, but it does not provide information on data splitting criteria for deep learning model training.

However, I can provide some general information on common practices for splitting data in machine learning. Typically, data is split into three sets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and evaluate the model's performance during training, and the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance after training is complete.

The proportion of data allocated to each set can vary, but common practices include using 60-80% of the data for training, 10-20% for validation, and 10-20% for testing. However, the specific criteria used to split the data can depend on the problem, dataset, and model being used, and may involve techniques such as stratified sampling or k-fold cross-validation.

In summary, the provided context does not provide specific information on the criteria used to split data for deep learning model training, but common practices involve splitting data into training, validation, and testing sets using various proportions and techniques.
