Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the purpose of a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to the study and monitoring of big cats, specifically Amur tigers, using techniques such as FIT (Footprint Identification Technique) and camera traps. However, it does not mention deep learning models or their purposes.

The context does mention the use of a classification dendrogram generated using the FIT pairwise comparison model for identifying individual tigers, but it does not explicitly mention deep learning models. Therefore, I do not have enough information to answer the query about the purpose of a deep learning model.
