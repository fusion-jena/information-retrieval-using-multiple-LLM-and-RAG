Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. The context only mentions that the hyperparameters of XGBoost and LightGBM were tuned by several optimizers, including Bayesian optimization (BO), Bayesian optimization with Hyperband (BOHB), and Tree-based Distribution Optimization (TDO). However, it does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters that were tuned.

The context does mention that the training dataset was used to optimize the hyperparameters and fit the models, and that the mean RMSE was used as the objective function. Additionally, the context mentions that the performance of different optimizers was compared using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R2. However, it does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters that were used in the models.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
