Answer:::
I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific deep learning pipeline or its code repository link. The context appears to be a list of references and a description of a process for extracting taxa records and metadata, but it does not include any information about a deep learning pipeline or its code repository. Therefore, I am unable to provide a link to a code repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
