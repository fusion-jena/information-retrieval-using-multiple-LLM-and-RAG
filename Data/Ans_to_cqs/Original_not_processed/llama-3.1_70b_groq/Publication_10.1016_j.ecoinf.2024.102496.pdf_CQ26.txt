Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to environmental science and policy, discussing topics such as watershed management, pollutant loads, and environmental justice. It does not mention deep learning or data preprocessing techniques.

However, I can provide some general information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. These techniques include:

* Stratified splitting: dividing the data into subsets based on the class labels to ensure that each subset has a similar proportion of samples from each class.
* Oversampling: creating additional copies of the minority class samples to balance the class distribution.
* Undersampling: reducing the number of majority class samples to balance the class distribution.
* Diverse data collection: collecting data from diverse sources to reduce bias and increase representation.

Please note that this information is not derived from the provided context, but rather from general knowledge of machine learning and data preprocessing techniques.
