Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the application of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and other machine learning techniques in various fields such as ecology, environmental modeling, and public health.

However, some of the references mentioned in the context suggest the use of data from various sources, such as:

* Hydroacoustic surveys (Brosse et al., 1999)
* Weather data (Chuang et al., 2012; Lebl et al., 2013)
* Public datasets (e.g., climate models, Patz et al., 1998)
* Field observations (e.g., mosquito abundance patterns, Chuang et al., 2012)

It can be inferred that the data collection methods may vary depending on the specific application and research question being addressed. However, without more explicit information, it is difficult to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.

Therefore, I must conclude that I don't know the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
