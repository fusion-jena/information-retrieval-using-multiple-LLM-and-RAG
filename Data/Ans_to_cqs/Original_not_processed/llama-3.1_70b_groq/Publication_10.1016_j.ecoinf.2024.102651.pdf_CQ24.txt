Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context appears to be focused on the comparison of different deep learning architectures (CNN, ViT, ResNet) for image classification tasks, particularly in the context of microorganism and Cervidae classification. It discusses the strengths and weaknesses of these architectures, but does not address the topic of randomness or random seed values in the deep learning pipeline.
