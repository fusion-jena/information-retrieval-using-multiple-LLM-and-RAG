Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be focused on machine learning for spatial data, specifically discussing techniques for handling clustered data and spatial autocorrelation, such as covariance-weighted bagging. It does not mention deep learning or data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
