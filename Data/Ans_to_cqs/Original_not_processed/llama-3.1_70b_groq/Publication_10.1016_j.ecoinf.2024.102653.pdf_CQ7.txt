Answer:

The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are as follows:

* The dataset is divided into training and validation sets, with 70% of the data designated for training and 30% for validation.
* The division is performed through random selection using the train_test_split function from the scikit-learn library (version 1.2.2).
* The data is also split into distinct training and testing subsets, with individuals from the control and pesticide-exposed groups evenly distributed between these subsets to guarantee a balanced representation of each class.

Additionally, the model was trained using varying disjoint subsets of the dataset to assess the number of recordings necessary to yield satisfactory classification metrics. These subsets corresponded to different time steps, namely 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 days of flight activity recordings.
