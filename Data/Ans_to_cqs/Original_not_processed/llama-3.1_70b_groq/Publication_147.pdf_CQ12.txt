Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically a U-Net CNN architecture. This is mentioned in the provided context as the segmentation convolutional neural network implemented in the Python programming language using the Keras deep learning library. The U-Net architecture is based on a fully convolutional network and was chosen for its ability to train in a reasonable time and require fewer training patches.
