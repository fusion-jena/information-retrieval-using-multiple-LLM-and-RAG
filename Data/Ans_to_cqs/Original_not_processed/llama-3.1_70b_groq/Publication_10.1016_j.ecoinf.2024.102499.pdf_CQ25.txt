Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is detection and classification. According to the provided context, the model is used for shark detection and classification, as well as fish detection and species classification in underwater environments. The model is trained on a dataset that includes images of sharks and other marine species, and its performance is evaluated using metrics such as recall, precision, and F-measure. The model's architecture is based on NASnet with a Faster-rcnn backbone, and it is implemented in TensorFlow. The context also mentions that the model is trained to build pertinent feature embeddings and to enhance its ability to detect and classify shark species.
