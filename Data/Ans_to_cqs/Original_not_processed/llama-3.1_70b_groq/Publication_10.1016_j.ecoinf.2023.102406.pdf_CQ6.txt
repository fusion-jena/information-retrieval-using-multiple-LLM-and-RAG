Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling, discussing topics such as sample thinning, modeling approaches, and variable reduction for correlation. It does mention the use of a randomly sampled split for testing data, but this is not directly related to preprocessing steps for deep learning models.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model based on the provided context.
