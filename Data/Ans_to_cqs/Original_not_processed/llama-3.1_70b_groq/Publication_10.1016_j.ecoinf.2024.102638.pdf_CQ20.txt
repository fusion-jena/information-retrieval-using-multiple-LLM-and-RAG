Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses various machine learning algorithms, hyperparameter optimization, and model selection, but it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training the model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
