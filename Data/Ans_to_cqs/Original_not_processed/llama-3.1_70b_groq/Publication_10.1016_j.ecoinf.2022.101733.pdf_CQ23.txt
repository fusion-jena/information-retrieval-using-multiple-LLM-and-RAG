Answer:

To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the researchers took several measures. Firstly, they used a stratified splitting approach to split the dataset into training and validation sets according to a 60%â€“40% ratio. This approach helps to maintain the same proportion of samples in each class, which is essential for ensuring that the model is trained on a representative sample of the population.

Additionally, the researchers checked the collected samples carefully to ensure that they were representative of the real class proportions in the landscape. This step helps to ensure that the model is trained on a diverse dataset that reflects the real-world scenario.

Furthermore, the researchers used a robust system architecture that includes an optimizer approach for feature selection and optimizing SVM parameters. This approach helps to select the most relevant features and optimize the model's hyperparameters, which can improve the model's generalizability.

However, it is not clear from the provided context whether cross-validation was used to evaluate the model's performance. Cross-validation is a technique that involves training and evaluating the model on multiple folds of the data to ensure that the results are not biased towards a particular subset of the data.

Overall, the researchers took several measures to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, including stratified splitting, careful sample collection, and robust system architecture. However, it is unclear whether cross-validation was used to further evaluate the model's performance.
