Answer:::

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are precision, recall, and F-measure. These metrics are used to assess the model's ability to correctly classify fish in the test videos.

Specifically, the F-measure is used as the primary evaluation metric, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. The F-measure is calculated as the ratio of the intersection surface (IS) to the union surface (US) of the predicted and actual bounding boxes.

The results of the deep learning model are presented in Table 3, which shows the precision, recall, and F-measure for each test video. The F-measure is also compared to the F-measure of a HOG+SVM model in Table 4, which shows that the deep learning model outperforms the HOG+SVM model.

Additionally, the model's performance is also evaluated using a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, which is shown in Figure 6. The ROC curve plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate at different thresholds, allowing for the evaluation of the model's performance at different operating points.

Overall, the use of precision, recall, F-measure, and ROC curves provides a comprehensive evaluation of the deep learning model's performance in detecting fish in the test videos.
