Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the CNN training data, architecture, and references, but it does not delve into the specifics of data annotation techniques.

However, it is mentioned that the dataset used is the "Salmon scale 9056 image dataset" and that there was an "Expert reading of extra 150" images. This suggests that some form of annotation or labeling was performed on the images, but the exact techniques used are not specified.

Therefore, I do not know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.
