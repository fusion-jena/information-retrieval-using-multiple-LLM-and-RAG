Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be focused on the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) for modeling and prediction, specifically in the context of ecological and environmental applications. It discusses the importance of generalization competence, overfitting, and techniques for avoiding overfitting, such as early stopping and regularization. However, it does not mention data augmentation techniques.
