Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, it does mention that data augmentation is used to avoid overfitting and render the model generalized. Specifically, it mentions that random cropping, horizontal/vertical flipping, image rotation, image translation, zooming, brightness adjustment, contrast adjustment, hue and saturation adjustment, Gaussian noise, and random erasing are applied to increase the size and variability of the dataset. This suggests that data augmentation is used as a regularization technique to prevent overfitting, but it does not provide information on other regularization methods that may be used.
