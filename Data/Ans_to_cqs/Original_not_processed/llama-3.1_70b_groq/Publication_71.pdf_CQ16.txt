Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it does mention the "Training number of steps" parameter, which is set to "â‰¥100,000". This suggests that the training process is set to run for at least 100,000 steps, but it does not provide information on how the completion of training is determined beyond this point.
