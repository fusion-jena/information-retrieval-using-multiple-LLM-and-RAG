Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model (AlexNet). The context only mentions the implementation of the model in MATLAB, the optimizer used, and the hyperparameters set, but it does not provide information on the preprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model.
