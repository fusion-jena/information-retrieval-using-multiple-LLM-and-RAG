Answer: 
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) as a related resource, with a link to its website (https://www.gbif.org/). It is possible that the data used in the pipeline is available through GBIF, but without further information, it is impossible to provide a direct link to the specific dataset or repository.
