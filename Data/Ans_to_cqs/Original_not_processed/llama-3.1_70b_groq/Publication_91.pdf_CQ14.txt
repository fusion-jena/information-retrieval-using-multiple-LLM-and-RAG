Answer:::
The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions the specific hyperparameters used, such as the batch size (32), initial learning rate (0.001), and the exponential decay of the learning rate every 3 epochs with a factor of 0.94. However, it does not provide information on the methodology used to optimize these hyperparameters, such as grid search, random search, or other methods.
