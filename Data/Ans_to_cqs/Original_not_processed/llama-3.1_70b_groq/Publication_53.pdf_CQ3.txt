Answer: 
The data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline is classification annotation, where images are labelled as either "dam" or "not dam". This is a simple classification task where the model is trained to identify the presence or absence of a farm dam in an image. There is no mention of more complex annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, which are typically used for object detection tasks. The model is trained on a random subsample of 400 images that were manually labelled, and then used to automate the classification of the remaining images, with manual correction of any mistakes.
