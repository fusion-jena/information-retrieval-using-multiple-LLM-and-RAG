Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context only mentions that the training set must have its data normalized and standardized to fit into the network, but it does not provide information on how data bias is handled.

However, it does mention that the batch size was set to 32 to make full use of computer resources and not exceed the memory limit, but this is not directly related to addressing data bias.

The context also mentions the use of the Adam optimizer, cosine function-based learning ratio, and early stopping function, but these are related to the training process and not specifically to addressing data bias.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
