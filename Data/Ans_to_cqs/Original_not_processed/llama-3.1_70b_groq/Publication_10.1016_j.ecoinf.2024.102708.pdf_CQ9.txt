Answer: I don't know. The provided context does not mention the location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of deep learning models for object detection, specifically YOLOv5 and Faster R-CNN, and provides information on the dataset and data augmentations used, but it does not provide information on where the data repository is hosted.
