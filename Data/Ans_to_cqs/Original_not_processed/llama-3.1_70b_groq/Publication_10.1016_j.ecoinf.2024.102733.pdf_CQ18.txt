Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that a scheduler is used to adjust the learning rate when the network reaches a plateau. This suggests that the model's performance is being monitored, and the learning rate is adjusted accordingly to prevent overfitting or underfitting. Additionally, the use of a plateau-based scheduler implies that the model's performance is being evaluated on a validation set or using a metric that is not specified in the provided context.
