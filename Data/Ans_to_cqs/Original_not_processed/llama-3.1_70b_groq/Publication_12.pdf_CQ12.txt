Answer: 
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a convolutional neural network (CNN). This is evident from the mention of "22 convolutional layers" in the text, which is a characteristic of CNNs. Additionally, the text mentions the use of "Rectified Linear Unit" as an activation function for non-linear classification, which is also commonly used in CNNs. Furthermore, the text mentions the use of "BatNet" which is modified and optimized for the task at hand, but it is not explicitly stated what type of network BatNet is, however, the mention of convolutional layers suggests that it is a type of CNN.
