Unfortunately, the provided context does not provide information on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context appears to be a collection of references and snippets from research papers related to remote sensing, LiDAR data, and machine learning, but it does not provide specific details on the methodology or techniques used to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to answer the query.
