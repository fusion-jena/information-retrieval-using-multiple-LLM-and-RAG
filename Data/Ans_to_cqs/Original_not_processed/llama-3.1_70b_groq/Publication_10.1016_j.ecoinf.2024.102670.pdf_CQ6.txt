Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily discusses the application of deep learning methods in various domains, such as karyotyping images of chromosomes and 3D volumetric images, and compares the performance of different methods. It also mentions the use of crowd-sourcing for obtaining manual annotation and the development of a Convolutional Neural Network-based segmentation model.

However, it does mention that Sharma et al. (2017) utilized crowd-sourcing for obtaining manual annotation, which implies that some form of data preprocessing or cleaning might have been involved. Additionally, the context mentions the use of spherical patches around points of interest in 3D volumetric images, which could involve some form of data normalization or scaling.

But without more specific information, it is difficult to provide a detailed answer to the query. Therefore, I must say that I don't know the exact preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model based on the provided context.
