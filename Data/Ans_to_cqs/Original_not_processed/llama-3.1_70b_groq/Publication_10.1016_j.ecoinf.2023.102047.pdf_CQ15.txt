Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. However, it does mention the use of a "momentum optimiser value of 0.5" in the context of training the proposed detector-2 model based on EfficientDet-B7. This suggests that a momentum-based optimizer is used, but the specific type of optimizer is not specified.
