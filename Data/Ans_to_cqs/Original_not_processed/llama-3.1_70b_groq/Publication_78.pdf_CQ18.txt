Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention the use of a confusion matrix to validate the performance of the machine learning model. The confusion matrix includes parameters such as True Positive (TP), True Negative (TN), False Positive (FP), False Negative (FN), Sensitivity (TPR), Specificity (Sy), Accuracy, F1-score, and Cohen's Kappa (Îº). These metrics can be used to evaluate the model's performance, but it is not clear if they are used during training or only for validation after training.
