Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models, particularly XGBoost, for object recognition, categorization, and land use/land cover classification. It also discusses the importance of forest-type categorization and its relation to forest fire risk.

However, it does mention the use of UAV data and SPOT satellite images, which suggests that the data may require some form of annotation or preprocessing before being fed into the deep learning model. Nevertheless, the specific annotation techniques used are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
