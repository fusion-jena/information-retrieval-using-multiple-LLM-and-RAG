Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. The context appears to be related to research papers and studies on topics such as soil moisture, water retention, and land reclamation, but it does not provide information on the deployment of a deep learning model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
