Answer:::
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the context mentions that the training set was balanced by upsampling the images from the underrepresented classes through repetition to match the number of images of the most represented class, "No species". This suggests that the dataset was balanced to prevent any bias towards the majority class.

However, the context does not explicitly mention the use of cross-validation or stratified splitting to ensure generalizability. It does mention that the full data set can be split in various ways, but the specific method used is not mentioned.

It is also mentioned that the naive approach of randomly sampling images from the full data set may not be suitable due to the images being captured in close proximity and potentially having overlapping fields of views, which could lead to information leakage between the data sets. However, an alternative approach to splitting the data is not explicitly mentioned.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it appears that the primary measure taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model was balancing the training set by upsampling the underrepresented classes.
