Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The text discusses the use of machine learning tools to refine classifications, but it does not provide details on the annotation techniques used. It also mentions a manual classification method, but it does not elaborate on the specific techniques used for annotation. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
