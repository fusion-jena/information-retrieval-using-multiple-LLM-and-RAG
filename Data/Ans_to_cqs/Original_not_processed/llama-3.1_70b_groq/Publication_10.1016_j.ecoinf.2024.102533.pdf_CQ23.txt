Answer:

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model. Instead, it discusses a clustering approach for classifying fish freshness. Therefore, measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model are not applicable in this context.

However, the context does mention that the dataset was generated over 11 days and includes seven fish species. This suggests that the dataset may be diverse in terms of time and species, which could contribute to the generalizability of the clustering approach. Additionally, the context mentions that future research possibilities may involve extending the work to include other fish species, which could further improve the generalizability of the approach.

There is no mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting in the provided context.
