Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on the development and experimentation of a machine learning model, specifically the SSA-TPRF model, for land cover classification using satellite data. It discusses the feature variables used, the experimental group design, and the effect of tile size on accuracy, but it does not provide information on the deployment process of the trained model. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
