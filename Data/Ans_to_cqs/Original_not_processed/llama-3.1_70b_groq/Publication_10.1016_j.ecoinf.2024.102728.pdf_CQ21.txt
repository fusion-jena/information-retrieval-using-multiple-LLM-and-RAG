Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context appears to be related to a classification methodology, specifically the NHC (Nested Hierarchical Classification) methodology, and describes the classification process and equations used. However, it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps after model training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
