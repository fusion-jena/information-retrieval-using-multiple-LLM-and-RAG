Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the model.

According to the context, the following statistical metrics were employed to evaluate the performance of the model:

1. Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE)
2. Mean Square Error (MSE)
3. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
4. Correlation coefficient (R)

These metrics provide insights into the accuracy and predictive capability of the model by measuring the deviation between the predicted EVI values and the actual observed values.

There is no mention of saliency maps or confusion matrices in the provided context. Therefore, I do not know if these postprocessing steps were involved after the model training.
