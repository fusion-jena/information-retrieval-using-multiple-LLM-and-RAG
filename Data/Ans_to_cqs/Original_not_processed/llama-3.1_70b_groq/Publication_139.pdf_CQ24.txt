Answer: 
The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of five training folds, which suggests that some form of cross-validation is being used. This could help to reduce the impact of randomness in the training process by averaging the results across multiple folds. 

Additionally, the context mentions that the five prediction records are averaged together to create a single prediction record. This averaging process could also help to reduce the impact of randomness in the predictions. However, without more information, it is not possible to determine if any other strategies are being employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
