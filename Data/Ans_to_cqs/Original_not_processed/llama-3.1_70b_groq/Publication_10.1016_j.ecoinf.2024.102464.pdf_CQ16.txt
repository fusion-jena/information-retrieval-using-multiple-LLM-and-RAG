Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be focused on the results of the machine learning models, including the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves and the area under the curve (AUC) values, but it does not provide information on the training process or the stopping criteria used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
