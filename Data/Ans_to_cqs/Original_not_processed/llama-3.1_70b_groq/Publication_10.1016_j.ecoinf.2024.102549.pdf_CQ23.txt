Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as the use of a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, its application in predicting water quality, and the accuracy of the model.

However, it can be inferred that the model was trained on a dataset of water quality monitoring data, as mentioned in Fig. 3, which shows the CNN model architecture and band reflectance of water quality monitoring. Additionally, Fig. 4 shows the accuracy comparison of different pixels and the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of the final selected 21 pixels, which suggests that some form of evaluation or validation was performed.

Despite this, the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model, such as cross-validation or stratified splitting, are not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, it is unclear what specific measures were taken to ensure the model's generalizability.
