Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a collection of references and citations related to unmanned aircraft systems, wildlife research, and biodiversity monitoring, but it does not provide information about a specific code repository.

However, it does mention "RStudio Team, 2020. RStudio: Integrated Development for R. PBC, Boston, Massachusetts. http://www.rstudio.com/.", which suggests that RStudio is being used for development, but it does not provide a link to a specific code repository.

Therefore, I do not know where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
