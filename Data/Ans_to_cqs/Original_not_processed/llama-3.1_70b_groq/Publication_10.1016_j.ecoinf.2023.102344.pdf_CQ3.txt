Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be discussing the architecture and performance of various pre-trained deep neural networks, including EfficientNet-B0, ResNet101, MobileNetV2, and InceptionV3, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques.
