Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context only mentions that after completing the environmental classification phase, the system extracts a frame and applies image filtering/enhancement. However, it does not provide details on the specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning that are typically involved before training a deep learning model.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this query.
