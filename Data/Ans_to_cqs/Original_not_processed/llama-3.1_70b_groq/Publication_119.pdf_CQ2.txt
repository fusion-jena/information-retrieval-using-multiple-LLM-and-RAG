Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information given, it can be inferred that the pipeline uses image data, specifically WV-3 imagery. The context mentions the use of convolutional layers, which are commonly used for image processing tasks, and the U-Net model, which is typically used for image segmentation tasks. Additionally, the context mentions the use of a ResNet-50 backbone, which is a pre-trained model on ImageNet, a large-scale image dataset. Therefore, it can be inferred that the pipeline uses image data, but the specific format (e.g., JPEG, TIFF, etc.) is not mentioned.
