Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model include average precision, recall, F1-measure, and MMC (Minimum Mean Cycle). These metrics are used to assess the performance of the model on fungal images. Additionally, Lin's Concordance Coefficient (œÅc) is used to evaluate the agreement between the automated method and the gold standard method (manual tracing) for measuring mycelium length.
