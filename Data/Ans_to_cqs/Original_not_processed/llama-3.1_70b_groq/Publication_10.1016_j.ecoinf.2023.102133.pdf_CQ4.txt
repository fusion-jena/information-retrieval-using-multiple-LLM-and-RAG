Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be focused on the configuration and performance of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and a Random Forest (RF) model, as well as the evaluation of their performance on a specific dataset. There is no mention of data augmentation techniques, so I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
