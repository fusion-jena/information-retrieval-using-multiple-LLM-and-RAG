Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the parameters of the model are adjusted following an optimization process during the training phase, but it does not provide details on the specific optimization method used (e.g., grid search, random search). Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
