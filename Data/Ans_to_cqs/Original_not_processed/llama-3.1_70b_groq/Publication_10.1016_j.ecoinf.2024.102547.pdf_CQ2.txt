Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or specific data formats used in such a pipeline. The context appears to be related to functional data analysis (FDA) and principal component analysis (PCA) in the context of marine organism aggregations and environmental data. The data formats mentioned in the context are not explicitly stated, but it seems to involve time-series data and possibly spatial data, as indicated by the mention of "functional attributes distributed across a spatial domain." However, there is no mention of image, audio, video, or CSV data formats specifically.
