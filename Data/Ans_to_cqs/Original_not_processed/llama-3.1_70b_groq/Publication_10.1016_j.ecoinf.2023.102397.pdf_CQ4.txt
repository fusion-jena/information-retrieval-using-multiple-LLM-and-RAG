Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be related to bird acoustic data analysis, discussing topics like species distribution modeling, acoustic indices, and neural networks. However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the query.
