Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. It mentions that the dataset will be created from scratch and annotated for custom training, but it does not provide the name of the dataset. It also mentions that the data is collected using a KaKaXi fixed camera, which takes images every hour within a fixed period of time each day. However, it does not provide any information about the type of data or the specific dataset used.

The context does mention some research papers and models, such as Mask R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, and FCN, but it does not provide any information about the datasets used in these models. It also mentions some other papers and models, such as U-Net and FastFCN, but again, it does not provide any information about the datasets used in these models.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
