Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context only mentions the use of machine learning and deep learning models, including artificial neural networks (ANN), but does not provide details on the optimization techniques used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
