Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of a validation set, which suggests that some form of cross-validation or splitting was used to evaluate the model's performance.

Table 3 shows the number of images used for training and validation, with 7773 images used for training and 1943 images used for validation. This suggests that the dataset was split into training and validation sets, but it does not provide information on how the splitting was done (e.g., random splitting, stratified splitting).

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a "proposed dataset" for evaluating the performance of different object detection models, but it does not provide information on the diversity of the dataset or whether it was collected from a variety of sources.

Therefore, while it appears that some form of validation was used to evaluate the model's performance, the exact measures taken to ensure generalizability are not clear from the provided context.
