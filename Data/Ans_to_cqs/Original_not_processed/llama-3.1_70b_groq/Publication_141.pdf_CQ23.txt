Answer: 

To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the dataset was split into training and validation sets, with 80% of the images used for training the CNN model and the remaining 20% used for validation. This split was carried out per category (chironomid taxa), where each fifth image was chosen for the validation dataset. This stratified splitting approach helps to ensure that the model is evaluated on unseen data from each category, which can improve its generalizability.

Additionally, the model used transfer learning, where a pre-trained ResNet-50 network was fine-tuned on the specific dataset. This approach allows the model to leverage features learned from a large and diverse dataset (ImageNet) and adapt them to the specific task at hand. The use of transfer learning can help to improve the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

Data augmentation was also used, although the specific techniques used are not mentioned in the provided context. Data augmentation can help to increase the diversity of the training data, which can improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.

Overall, the combination of stratified splitting, transfer learning, and data augmentation can help to improve the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it is not mentioned whether cross-validation was used, so it is unclear whether this technique was employed to further evaluate the model's performance.
