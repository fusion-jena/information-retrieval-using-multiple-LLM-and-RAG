Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that a 10-fold cross-validation (CV) design was used to validate each model, where 70% of the data was used for training and 30% for validation. This suggests that the training process was repeated 10 times with different folds of the data, but it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete.
