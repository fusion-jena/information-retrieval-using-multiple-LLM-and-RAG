Answer:::

To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, a 5-fold cross-validation was performed, where for each fold, 80% of the Videoclips dataset was randomly selected for training, and 20% was used for testing. This approach helped to assess the robustness of the method and ensured that the model was not overfitting to a specific subset of the data.

Additionally, instead of splitting the dataset directly into images, the splitting was done at the video level. This was done to ensure full independency between the images of the training set and the testing set, as images from the same videos were very alike. This approach helped to prevent the model from memorizing specific patterns in the training data and improved its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

Furthermore, the model was tested on two different datasets: Testingclips (short sequences centered around the presence of fish) and Testingstations (1-h videos, corresponding to real use-case scenarios of ecological studies). This helped to assess the robustness of the method on different types of data and ensured that the model was able to generalize well to different scenarios.

Overall, the combination of cross-validation, video-level splitting, and testing on different datasets helped to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
