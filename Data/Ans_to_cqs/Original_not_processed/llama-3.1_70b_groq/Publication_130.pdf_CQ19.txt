Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. It mentions the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and other deep learning methods, but it does not provide information on the frameworks used to implement these models. It references several research papers and mentions the use of techniques such as ResNet, but it does not provide information on the specific frameworks used.
