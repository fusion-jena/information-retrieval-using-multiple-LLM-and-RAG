Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically address techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the development and application of neural network models, including deep learning, and their use in various fields such as time series forecasting, ecological footprint analysis, and particle-bound metal prediction.

However, I can provide some general information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, although it is not directly supported by the provided context. Common techniques used to address data bias include:

* Stratified splitting: dividing the data into subsets based on relevant characteristics to ensure that each subset is representative of the overall population.
* Oversampling: increasing the number of instances of the underrepresented class to balance the dataset.
* Undersampling: reducing the number of instances of the overrepresented class to balance the dataset.
* Diverse data collection: collecting data from diverse sources to reduce bias and increase representation.

Additionally, other techniques such as data augmentation, feature engineering, and using algorithms that are robust to bias can also be used to address data bias.

It is worth noting that the provided context does not mention any specific techniques used to address data bias, and therefore, I cannot provide a more detailed answer based on the context.
