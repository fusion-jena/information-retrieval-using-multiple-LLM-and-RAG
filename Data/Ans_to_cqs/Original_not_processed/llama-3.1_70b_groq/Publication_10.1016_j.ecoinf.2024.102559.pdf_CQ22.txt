Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. However, based on the tables provided, it appears that the performance of the models is evaluated using various accuracy metrics, including:

* Overall Accuracy
* Producer's Accuracy
* User's Accuracy
* Counts per class (n)

Additionally, the tables provide information on True Positives (TP), True Negatives (TN), False Positives (FP), and False Negatives (FN), which are commonly used to calculate precision, recall, and F1-score.

While precision and recall are not explicitly mentioned, they can be calculated using the provided TP, TN, FP, and FN values. However, without explicit mention of these metrics, it is unclear if they are used to evaluate the model's performance.

It is also worth noting that the context appears to be focused on evaluating the performance of models for classifying iceplant and other vegetation, and the metrics used may be specific to this task.
