Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of machine learning methods such as random forest classification, support vector machine classification, and decision tree classification in the context of crop classification and hyperspectral imaging. But it does not provide information on regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
