Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning and deep learning techniques in ecology and earth science, including plant species identification, vegetation studies, and soil carbon loss analysis.

However, it does mention the use of hyperparameter-tuned batch-updated stochastic gradient descent in a deep learning model for plant species identification (Barhate et al., 2023). Stochastic gradient descent is an optimization algorithm that can introduce randomness in the training process, but the context does not provide information on how this randomness is handled.

In general, setting a random seed value is a common strategy to ensure reproducibility in deep learning experiments. This allows researchers to reproduce the same results by using the same random seed value. However, this information is not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
