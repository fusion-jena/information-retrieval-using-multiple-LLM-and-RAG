Answer:

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily deals with image data. The text mentions the use of remote sensing images, image segmentation, and image feature depth learning, indicating that the primary data format used is images.

Specifically, the text mentions that the input to the network is a 512 Ã— 512 pixels image, suggesting that the images are in a raster format. There is no mention of audio or video data being used in the pipeline.

Additionally, the text mentions the use of CSV (Comma Separated Values) files, but only in the context of citing a reference (Minghini et al., 2020), which discusses geospatial openness and standards. It is not clear if CSV files are used as input or output data in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images, specifically raster images.
