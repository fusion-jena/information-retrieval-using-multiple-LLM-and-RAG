Answer:::
Answer: The data format used in the deep learning pipeline, as mentioned in the provided context, is image data. Specifically, the context mentions the use of satellite images for training and validation, which are cropped into sub-images of size 256 Ã— 256 and used as input for the neural network. The images are represented as 3D arrays with shape (m, 256, 256, 3), where m is the batch size. Additionally, mask data is used, which has a shape of (20, 256, 256, 1). There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
