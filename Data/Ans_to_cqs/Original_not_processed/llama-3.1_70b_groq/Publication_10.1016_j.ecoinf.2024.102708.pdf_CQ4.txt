Answer:::

According to the provided context, the data augmentation techniques applied to the training data are listed in Table 1. These techniques include:

1. Flip
2. Crop
3. Contrast Shift
4. Translation
5. Rotation

The minimum and maximum values for each augmentation are also provided in the table. Specifically:

* Flip: no minimum or maximum value specified
* Crop: minimum 0%, maximum 25%
* Contrast Shift: minimum -20%, maximum +50%
* Translation: minimum 0%, maximum 20%
* Rotation: minimum -90°, maximum +90°

These augmentations were applied in a random order to increase the size of the training dataset. Five augmented images were created per original tile, resulting in an additional 5735 tiles split between the two sites.
