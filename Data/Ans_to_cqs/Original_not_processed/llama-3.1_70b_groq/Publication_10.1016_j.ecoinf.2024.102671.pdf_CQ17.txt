Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. The context appears to be related to ecological research, spatial analysis, and conservation, with topics such as habitat quality assessment, ecological risk assessment, and spatial pattern analysis. There is no mention of deep learning or regularization methods. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
