Answer:::

The purpose of the deep learning model in the study is to automatically monitor the stereotypical behaviors of captive wild animals. Specifically, the model uses a Siamese relation network to track the animals in videos and extract their location boxes. The model then calculates the motion trajectories of the animals and classifies the motion trajectory patterns by calculating cross-correlation functions.

The primary contributions of the study include the use of a deep learning model to automatically record, store, and display the motion trajectories of animals, as well as providing real-time warning prompts for stereotypical behaviors through a human-computer interaction interface.

In terms of the specific tasks performed by the model, it appears to be a combination of object detection (identifying the location boxes of the animals), tracking (following the movement of the animals over time), and classification (identifying the patterns of motion trajectories).
