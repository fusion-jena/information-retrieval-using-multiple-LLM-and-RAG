Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. The text primarily discusses the use of satellite data and machine learning methodologies for aquatic environmental monitoring, specifically for estimating Chl-a concentrations. It mentions the development of algorithms and retrieval methods, but does not provide details on the specific hyperparameters used in a deep learning model.
