Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to a workflow for estimating fishing pressure on stocks and other species, using vessel tracking data and environmental, biodiversity, and fishery data. It mentions data classification and spatio-temporal aggregation, but does not provide information on data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline.
