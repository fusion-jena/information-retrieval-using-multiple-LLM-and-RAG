Answer:

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in the provided context are:

1. UIQM (Underwater Image Quality Metric): A higher score indicates an enhanced level of human visual perception in the results.
2. UCIQE (Underwater Color Image Quality Evaluation): A higher score signifies a better balance between chroma, contrast, and saturation.
3. NIQE (Natural Image Quality Evaluator): A lower score indicates a better perception quality.
4. PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio): A higher score indicates a closer resemblance of the result to the reference image.
5. SSIM (Structural Similarity Index): A higher score indicates a closer resemblance of the result to the reference image.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the model in terms of image quality and perception. The model's performance is compared to other approaches using these metrics, and the results are presented in tables (e.g., Table 2, Table 3, Table 4).
