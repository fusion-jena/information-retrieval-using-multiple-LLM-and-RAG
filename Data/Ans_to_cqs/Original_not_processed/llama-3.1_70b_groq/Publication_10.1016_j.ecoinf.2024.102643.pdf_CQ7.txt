Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling and human-wildlife conflict risk assessment, and it mentions the use of various machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network, and Generalized Boosted Model. However, it does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation.

The context does mention that the biomod2 package was used to construct an ensemble conflict risk model by weight averaging the predictions of ten different algorithms. It also mentions that the predictions were averaged across three replicated runs for each model, and that model runs with a TSS (True Skill Statistic) value greater than 0.5 were selected for generating the ensemble model. However, this information is not directly related to the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
