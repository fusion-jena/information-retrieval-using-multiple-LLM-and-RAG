Answer:

According to the provided context, the following data augmentation techniques were applied in the deep learning pipeline:

1. Random cropping
2. Horizontal/vertical flipping
3. Image rotation
4. Image translation
5. Zooming
6. Brightness adjustment
7. Contrast adjustment
8. Hue adjustment
9. Saturation adjustment
10. Gaussian noise
11. Random erasing

These techniques were applied to both models' training data to increase the size and variability of the dataset, which helped to avoid overfitting and improve the model's generalization.
