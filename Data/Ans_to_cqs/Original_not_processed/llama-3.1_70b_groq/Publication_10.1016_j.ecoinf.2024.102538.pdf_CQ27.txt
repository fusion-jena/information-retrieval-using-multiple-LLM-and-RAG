Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the development and training of the model, including the architecture, hyperparameters, and performance evaluation. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related details.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
