Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, it does mention that the penalty method was employed within the framework of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models to address the inclination of neural networks to overfit data. Additionally, it mentions the use of early stopping, which is a technique used to prevent overfitting by stopping the training process when the model's performance on the validation set starts to degrade.
