Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on natural language processing, text mining, and ecosystem services, but it does not provide information on the development or evaluation of a deep learning model.

However, it does mention the use of a large corpus of text data (2.8 billion words) to train a word vector space model, which suggests that the model was trained on a diverse dataset. Additionally, the context mentions the use of techniques such as tokenization, lemmatization, and stop word removal, which are common preprocessing steps in natural language processing.

But, it does not provide information on cross-validation, stratified splitting, or other techniques that are commonly used to ensure the generalizability of machine learning models. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question based on the provided context.
