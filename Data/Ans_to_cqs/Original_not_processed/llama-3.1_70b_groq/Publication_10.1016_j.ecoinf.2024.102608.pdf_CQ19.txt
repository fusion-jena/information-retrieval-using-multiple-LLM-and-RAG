Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The text mentions the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and randomized grid search methods, but it does not provide information about the frameworks used to implement these models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
