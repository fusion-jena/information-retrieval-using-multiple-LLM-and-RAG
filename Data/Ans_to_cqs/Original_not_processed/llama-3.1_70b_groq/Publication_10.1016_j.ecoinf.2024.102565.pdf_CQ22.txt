Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model are:

1. Coefficient of determination (R2)
2. Mean bias error (MBE)
3. Root mean square error (RMSE)
4. Mean absolute error (MAE)

These metrics are used to assess the accuracy of water quality parameter predictions. The R2 quantifies the fraction of variance in the dependent variable accounted for by the independent variables in the model. The MBE evaluates the model's average bias, while RMSE calculates the discrepancies between predicted and true values. MAE quantifies the average size of these prediction errors. 

Note that traditional metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall are not mentioned in the provided context. The context specifically mentions the use of R2, MBE, RMSE, and MAE to evaluate the model's performance.
