Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that a 5-fold cross-validation of the training set was used for both SVM and CNN training protocols. This suggests that the data was split into 5 folds, with 4 folds used for training and 1 fold used for validation in each iteration. The context does not provide information on how the data was split into training, test, and validation sets, or what specific criteria were used for this split.
