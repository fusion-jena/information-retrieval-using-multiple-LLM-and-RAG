Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on the development of a model for forest fire detection and the use of machine learning algorithms, but it does not provide information on the deployment process.

The context mentions the use of a neural network and the Gumbel softmax function, but it does not discuss model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related topics. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.

If you have any further questions or would like me to clarify any other points, please let me know!
