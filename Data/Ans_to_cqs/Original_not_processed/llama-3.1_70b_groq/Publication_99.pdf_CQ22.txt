Answer:::
The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models in this context are not traditional metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. Instead, the performance of the generative models is evaluated using Peak Signal-To-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM). These metrics are commonly used to evaluate the quality of reconstructed images in image-to-image translation tasks. 

For classification networks, the context mentions that the models were trained with cross-entropy loss, but it does not specify the evaluation metrics used. However, it is common to use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the performance of classification models.
