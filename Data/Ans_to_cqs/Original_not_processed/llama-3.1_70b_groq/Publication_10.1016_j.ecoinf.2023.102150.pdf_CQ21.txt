Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the model retraining process, manual classification, and the number of images used for training, validation, and testing.

However, it does mention that the researcher can decide whether model performance is satisfactory or if it should be improved by selecting new training images and retraining the model. This implies that some form of evaluation or metrics calculation might be involved in assessing model performance, but the specific details are not provided.

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query, and I do not want to speculate or make assumptions about the postprocessing steps involved. If you have any further questions or context, I'll be happy to try and help.
