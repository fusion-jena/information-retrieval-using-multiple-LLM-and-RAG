Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning in marine ecology, specifically in fish and shark detection and classification. It discusses the use of various deep learning architectures, such as NASnet and Faster-RCNN, and provides details on the training process, including hyperparameters like learning rate and batch size. However, it does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness in the pipeline.

That being said, it is common practice in deep learning to employ techniques like random seed value fixing, data shuffling, and ensemble methods to mitigate the effects of randomness and ensure reproducibility. However, without explicit information in the provided context, it is unclear what specific strategies, if any, were employed in this particular pipeline.

Therefore, I must conclude that I don't know the exact strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
