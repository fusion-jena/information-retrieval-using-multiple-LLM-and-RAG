Answer: 

Based on the provided context, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image, specifically underwater optical images. The context mentions the difficulty of general deep learning networks in capturing accurate feature information from these images due to their poor quality. It also discusses various methods and modules, such as the CSMB module and DP-FishNet, designed to improve the performance of the model in extracting features from these images. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
