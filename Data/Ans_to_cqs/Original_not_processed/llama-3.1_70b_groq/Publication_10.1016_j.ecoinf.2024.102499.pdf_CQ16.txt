Answer: I don't know. The provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. It discusses the performance of different models, the use of k-fold cross-validation, and the evaluation metrics used (e.g., F-measure, precision, recall), but it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training.
