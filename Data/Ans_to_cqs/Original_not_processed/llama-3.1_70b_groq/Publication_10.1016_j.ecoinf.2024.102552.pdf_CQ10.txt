Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. The text appears to be a research paper discussing the use of machine learning tools for ecological informatics, but it does not provide any information about a specific code repository or pipeline. Therefore, I am unable to provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
