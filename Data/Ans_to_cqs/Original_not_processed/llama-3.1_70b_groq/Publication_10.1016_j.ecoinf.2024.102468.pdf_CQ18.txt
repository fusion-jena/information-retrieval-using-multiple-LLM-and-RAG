Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the performance is evaluated using the F1-score, which is a measure of the model's accuracy. The F1-score is calculated based on the precision and recall of the model, and a higher score (close to 1) indicates better performance.

Additionally, the context mentions that the experiments are performed over different runs to help capture the variability introduced by random factors, such as random initialization of weights in Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) or random sampling during training. This suggests that the model's performance is evaluated over multiple runs to account for the randomness and ensure that the results are reliable.

However, the specific strategy or metrics used to monitor the model's performance during training, such as validation loss or accuracy, are not mentioned in the provided context.
