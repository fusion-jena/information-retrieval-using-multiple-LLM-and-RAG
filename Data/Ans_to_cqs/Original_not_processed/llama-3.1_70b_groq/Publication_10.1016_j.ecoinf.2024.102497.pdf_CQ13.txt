Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. The context only mentions that Najar et al. (2022) compared deep learning and physics-based approaches for coastal bathymetry estimation from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, but it does not provide details on the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
