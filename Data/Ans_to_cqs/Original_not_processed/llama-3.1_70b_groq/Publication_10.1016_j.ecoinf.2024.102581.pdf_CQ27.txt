Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on the development and evaluation of the model, including the search space of CNN hyperparameters, the performance of the model on various datasets, and references to related research papers.

There is no mention of model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related processes. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
