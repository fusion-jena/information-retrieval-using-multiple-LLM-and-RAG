Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on the application of deep learning and machine learning algorithms to understand groundwater-climate interactions, rather than the technical details of model training. Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this context.
