Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided pieces of context do not mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on few-shot learning, data augmentation, and the comparison of deep learning and few-shot learning models in the context of image classification tasks, particularly in marine species classification.

However, it does mention the use of a non-linear mixed effects asymptotic model to analyze the relationship between the number of images per species and the accuracy of deep learning and few-shot learning models. This suggests that the authors are aware of the importance of accounting for variability in their models, but it does not provide specific information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
