Answer:::
The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned as popular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, the study utilizes Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) satellite images for detecting and mapping burned areas within the Cerrado biome. The spectral training samples of burned and non-burned areas are collected from the study area, which are then used to train the deep learning models. The fire hotspot data analysis is also provided by INPE (http://www.inpe.br/queimadas/bdqueimadas), but it is not clear if this data is used as a dataset in the deep learning pipeline or just for analysis.
