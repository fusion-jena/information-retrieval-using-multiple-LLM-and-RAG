Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of data augmentation techniques to prevent overfitting and improve generalization. 

Additionally, the context mentions the use of weight decay with a value of 0.0005 in the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimization technique. Weight decay is a form of L2 regularization, which is a regularization method used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function for large weights. 

Therefore, the regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline is weight decay (L2 regularization), but there is no mention of dropout or other regularization methods.
