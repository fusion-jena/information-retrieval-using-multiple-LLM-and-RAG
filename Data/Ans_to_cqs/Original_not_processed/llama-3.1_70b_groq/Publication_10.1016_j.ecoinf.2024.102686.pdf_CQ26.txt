Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on data sources, preprocessing steps, and research challenges related to a human activity (HA)â€“natural endowment (NE) coupled zoning index system. It does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
