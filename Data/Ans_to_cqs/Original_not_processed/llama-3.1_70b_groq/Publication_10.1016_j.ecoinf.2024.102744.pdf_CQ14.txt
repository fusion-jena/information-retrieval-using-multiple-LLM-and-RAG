Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses the experimental results, evaluation metrics, and comparisons with other state-of-the-art models, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
