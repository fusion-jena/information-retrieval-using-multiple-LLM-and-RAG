Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on deep learning architectures, neural networks, and their applications, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.

However, it is worth noting that data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to artificially increase the size of the training dataset and improve the robustness of the model. These techniques can help to reduce overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

If you are looking for information on data augmentation techniques, I would recommend consulting a more comprehensive resource on deep learning or computer vision.
