Answer: The provided context does not specifically mention the evaluation metrics for a deep learning model. However, it does mention the evaluation metrics for machine learning models (Random Forest (RF) and Classification and Regression Trees (CART)) and statistical models (Frequency Ratio (FR) and Statistical Index (SI)).

For machine learning models, the performance metrics mentioned are:

* Coefficient of determination (R2)
* Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE)
* Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE)
* Correlation coefficient (COR)

For statistical models, the performance metrics mentioned are:

* Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE)
* Accuracy
* Sensitivity
* Kappa (K)
* Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve (AUC)

It's worth noting that the context does not mention precision and recall as evaluation metrics for any of the models.
