Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention object extraction and segmentation processes in the pre-processing pipeline.

According to the text, the pre-processing pipeline involves segmentation and object extraction processes to obtain a pre-processed depth frame. The segmentation process separates a point cloud into meaningful segments or clusters based on the characteristics of the points. Object extraction is then performed to separate the object of interest from the rest of the scene in the RGB-D image using the segmented point cloud data.

While this information does not directly answer the question about data annotation techniques, it suggests that the pipeline may involve some form of instance segmentation or object detection, as the object of interest is being separated from the rest of the scene. However, without further information, it is unclear what specific data annotation techniques are used.

Therefore, I can only provide a partial answer, and it is not possible to confirm whether bounding box annotation or other specific techniques are used in the pipeline.
