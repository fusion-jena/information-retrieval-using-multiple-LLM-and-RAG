Answer: 
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on explaining the Faster R-CNN approach, its components, and the process of object detection. It also mentions some related studies and references, but it does not provide information on the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.

However, it can be inferred that the model is designed to work with a diverse dataset, as it is intended for agricultural pests recognition, which involves identifying various types of pests. But, there is no explicit mention of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or other techniques used to ensure the model's generalizability.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this question.
