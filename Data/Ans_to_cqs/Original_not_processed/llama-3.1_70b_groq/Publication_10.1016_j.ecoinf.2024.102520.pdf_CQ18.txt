Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention anything about monitoring model performance during training. The context appears to be related to a study on soil and site parameters, including tables of data and discussions of spatial dependency and kriging variance. There is no mention of a machine learning model or its training process.

Therefore, I must answer that I don't know what strategy is implemented to monitor the model performance during training, as this information is not provided in the context.
