Answer:

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, specifically TrunkNet, are as follows:

* Optimizer: Adam optimizer with default hyper-parameters:
	+ betas = (0.9, 0.999)
	+ eps = 1.0 × 10^(-8)
	+ weight_decay = 0
* Initial learning rate (lr) = 1.0 × 10^(-3)
* Batch size = 12

These hyperparameters are used to train the TrunkNet model from scratch using the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss function. The model is trained for approximately 11.5 hours with 65 K iterations, after which the training loss converges.
