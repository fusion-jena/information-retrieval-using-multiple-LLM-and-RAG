Answer:::
The text does not explicitly mention the use of GPUs or TPUs for training the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the training was performed on an Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9900K CPU @ 3.60GHz processor and 32GB RAM memory. This suggests that the model was trained on a CPU, but it does not rule out the possibility that GPUs or TPUs were also used.
