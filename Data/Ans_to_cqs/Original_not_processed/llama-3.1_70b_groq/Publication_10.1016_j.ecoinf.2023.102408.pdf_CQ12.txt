Answer: 

The text does not mention the use of a deep learning model such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer in the pipeline. It does mention the use of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), but it is a simple neural network with a single hidden layer, not a deep learning model. The ANN is used for modeling complex phenomena and developing nonlinear regression, but it is not a deep learning model.
