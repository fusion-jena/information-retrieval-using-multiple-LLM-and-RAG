Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be focused on the optimization of hyperparameters for a Random Forest (RF) algorithm using RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV, as well as the evaluation metrics used for a wildfire mapping study. There is no information about data collection methods, such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets.
