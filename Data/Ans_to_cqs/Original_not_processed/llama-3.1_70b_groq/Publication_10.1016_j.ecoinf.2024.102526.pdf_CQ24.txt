Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context appears to be focused on the planning and execution of marine imaging projects, including the collection and annotation of images, and the use of artificial intelligence for image analysis. While it mentions the use of deep learning for image analysis, it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline.
