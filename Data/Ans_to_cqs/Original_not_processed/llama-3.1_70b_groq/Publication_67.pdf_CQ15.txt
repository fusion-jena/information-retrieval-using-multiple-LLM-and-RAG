Answer:::
The optimization technique applied in the deep learning pipeline, as mentioned in the provided context, is RMSProp. It is used as the optimization algorithm with a momentum of 0.9 and epsilon of 0.1. RMSProp is a popular optimization algorithm used in deep learning to adapt the learning rate for each parameter based on the magnitude of the gradient.
