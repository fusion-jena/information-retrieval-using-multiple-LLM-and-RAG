Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the performance evaluation of the proposed SCAM-Herb models using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1-score. It also discusses the comparison of the proposed model with other state-of-the-art models and the performance of the proposed models in different epochs. However, it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine the completion of training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
