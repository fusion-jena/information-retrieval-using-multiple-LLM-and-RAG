Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. However, it does mention the evaluation of model performance using three error statistics: R2, mean absolute error (MAE), and RMSE (as indicated in Eqs. 8, 9, and 10). 

It also mentions that a stratified sampling method was applied to all AGB observations for this evaluation, where 70% of the samples were allocated to the training dataset and the remaining 30% to the validation dataset. 

Additionally, the context mentions that the generated machine learning models were then extrapolated for the entire region, but it does not provide further details on the postprocessing steps involved. 

Therefore, based on the provided context, I can only confirm that the model performance was evaluated using R2, MAE, and RMSE, but I do not have information on other postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps, Confusion matrix, or other metrics calculation.
