Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of deep learning models or specific frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context appears to be related to environmental informatics, discussing topics such as nutrient reduction, environmental justice, and best management practices (BMPs) for water quality. There is no mention of coding or deep learning models, so I am unable to provide an answer to the query.
