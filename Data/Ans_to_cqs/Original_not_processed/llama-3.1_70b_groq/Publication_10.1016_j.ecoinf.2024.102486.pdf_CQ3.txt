Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to focus on the use of GPUs in machine learning, particularly in ecology, and mentions various software tools and techniques used in this field.

However, it does mention data augmentation approaches for improving animal audio classification (Nanni et al., 2020), which might be related to data annotation. But it does not provide specific details on the annotation techniques used.

Therefore, I don't know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, as this information is not provided in the given context.
