Answer:::
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. 

Firstly, the model was fine-tuned using the entire SW stratum employing the SAL (Spatially Aware Learning) approach. This iterative process involved multiple iterations of training and inference, which helped to enhance the model's performance and gather samples pertaining to each key species present in the region.

Secondly, the training procedure involved collecting and including hard negative patches, which are patches containing false positives, to further train the model and reduce the number of false positives. This approach helped to improve the model's robustness and generalizability.

Thirdly, the model was trained using a combination of positive patches and hard negative patches, which helped to reduce overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.

Lastly, the model was selected based on its performance on the validation set, which helped to avoid overfitting and ensure that the model was generalizable to new data.

However, it is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context whether cross-validation or stratified splitting was used. Therefore, I do not know if these specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.
