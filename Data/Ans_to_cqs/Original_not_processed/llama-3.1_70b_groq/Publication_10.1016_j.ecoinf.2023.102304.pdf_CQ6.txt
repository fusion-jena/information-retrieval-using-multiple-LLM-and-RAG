Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to the optimization of parameters for a land treatment response (LTR) algorithm, specifically in the context of wildfire and vegetation recovery. It discusses the importance of selecting the most appropriate index for a given region and the improvement in accuracy and kappa values with optimized parameters. However, it does not provide information on preprocessing steps for training a deep learning model. 

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model based on the provided context.
