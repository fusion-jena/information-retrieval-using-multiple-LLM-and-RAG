Answer:::
The data formats used in the deep learning pipeline include images, CSV, and point clouds. Specifically, the dataset used in this study includes:

* Images of single-trees and preprocessed images of numbers
* CSV files containing attributes used to produce the images and reference data
* Point clouds of single-tree data

Additionally, the dataset also includes labeled numbers, clusters of numbers, and tables containing the results of digit recognition. The images are processed using OpenCV library in Python, and the labels are annotated using Labelbox. The data is split into training, testing, and validation sets using k-fold cross-validation.
