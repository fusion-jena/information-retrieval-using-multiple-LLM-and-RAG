I don't know. The provided context does not mention data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. It appears to be focused on data publication, data packages, and data usage policies in the context of environmental science projects such as AmeriFlux, WFSFA, and NGEE-Tropics. There is no mention of deep learning or specific data formats like image, audio, video, or CSV.
