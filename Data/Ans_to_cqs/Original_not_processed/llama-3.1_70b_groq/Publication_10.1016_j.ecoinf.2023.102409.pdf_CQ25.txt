Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the context, specifically Unet, Pspnet, and DeepLabV3+, is semantic segmentation. This is evident from the description of the models and their applications in the context. 

For instance, the Unet model is described as being proficient in achieving accurate results with a smaller number of training samples, which is a common requirement in semantic segmentation tasks. The Pspnet model is mentioned as employing a spatial pyramid module to gather contextual data from diverse regions, enabling the acquisition of comprehensive global information, which is also a characteristic of semantic segmentation tasks. 

DeepLabV3+ is described as integrating an asymmetric spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) architecture within an encoder-decoder framework, effectively merging multi-scale information, which is a common approach in semantic segmentation tasks. The context also mentions the application of these models in geographical and ecological challenges, such as floodplain forest ecosystem service value assessment, which further supports the idea that the purpose of these models is semantic segmentation.
