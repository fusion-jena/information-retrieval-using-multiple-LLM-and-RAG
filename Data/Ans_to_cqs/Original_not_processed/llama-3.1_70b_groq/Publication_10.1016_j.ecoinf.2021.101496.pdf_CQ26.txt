Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided pieces of context do not mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The texts appear to be from various fields such as plant physiology, fog computing, and food safety, but none of them discuss data bias or preprocessing techniques for deep learning pipelines.

However, I can provide some general information on the techniques you mentioned. Stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling are indeed techniques used to address data bias and imbalance in machine learning datasets. Stratified splitting involves splitting the data into training and testing sets while maintaining the same proportion of classes. Oversampling involves creating additional instances of the minority class to balance the dataset, while undersampling involves reducing the number of instances of the majority class.

Diverse data collection is also an important technique to address data bias by collecting data from diverse sources and ensuring that the data represents the real-world scenario.

But, I couldn't find any specific information on these techniques in the provided context.
