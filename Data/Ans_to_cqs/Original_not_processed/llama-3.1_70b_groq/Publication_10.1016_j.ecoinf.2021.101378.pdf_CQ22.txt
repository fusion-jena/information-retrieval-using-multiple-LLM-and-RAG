Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. In fact, the context does not even mention the use of a deep learning model, but rather discusses the use of machine learning methods such as random forest (RF) and maximum entropy modeling (Maxent) for ecological risk assessment and species distribution modeling. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
