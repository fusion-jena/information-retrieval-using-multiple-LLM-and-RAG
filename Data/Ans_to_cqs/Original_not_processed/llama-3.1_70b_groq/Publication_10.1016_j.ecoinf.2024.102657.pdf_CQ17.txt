Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the training process, data preparation, and performance of the CNN and k-NN models, but it does not provide information on the specific regularization techniques used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
