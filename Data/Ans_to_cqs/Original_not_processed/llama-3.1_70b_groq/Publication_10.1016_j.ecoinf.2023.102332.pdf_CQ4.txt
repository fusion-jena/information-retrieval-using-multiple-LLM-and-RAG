Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be focused on natural language processing (NLP) techniques, specifically text classification and word embeddings, rather than computer vision or image processing.

The mentioned papers and techniques, such as BERT, Word2vec, and transformer-based models, are related to NLP and text analysis, but do not discuss data augmentation techniques for image processing. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide an answer to the query.
