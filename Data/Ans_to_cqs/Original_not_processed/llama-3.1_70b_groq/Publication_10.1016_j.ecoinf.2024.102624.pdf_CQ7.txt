Answer:::

The provided context does not specifically mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention the splitting of the reference dataset into training and testing sets at a 70:30 ratio. This suggests that the data was split into two parts: 70% for training and 30% for testing.

It's worth noting that the context does not mention a separate validation set, which is often used in deep learning model training to evaluate the model's performance during training and prevent overfitting. The context only mentions the use of 10-fold cross-validation with three repetitions during the model building phase, which is a technique used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the criteria used to split the data for model training is a 70:30 ratio, with 70% of the data used for training and 30% used for testing. However, it's unclear if a separate validation set was used.
