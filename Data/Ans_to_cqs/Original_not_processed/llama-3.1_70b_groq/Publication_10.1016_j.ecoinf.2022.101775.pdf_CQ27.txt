Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only discusses the training process, including the use of stochastic gradient descent, Adam optimizer, and Pytorch implementation, as well as the testing and validation process. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
