Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on data preprocessing, the composition of the training database, and the classes added to the species database. It also provides a brief overview of deep learning and neural networks, but it does not discuss the postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this query.
