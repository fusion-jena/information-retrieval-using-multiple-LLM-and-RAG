Answer:
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to focus on data mining, knowledge discovery in databases (KDD), and the Apriori algorithm, which is a machine learning algorithm used for association rule learning. While pruning is mentioned as a data compression technique used in the Apriori algorithm to reduce overfitting, it is not directly related to the regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
