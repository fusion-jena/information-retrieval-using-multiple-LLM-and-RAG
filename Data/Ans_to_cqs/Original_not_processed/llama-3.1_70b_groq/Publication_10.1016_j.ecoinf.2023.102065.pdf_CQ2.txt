Answer:::
The data formats used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context are audio and image. Specifically, the audio data are represented as amplitude-time waveforms and 2D image spectrograms, including mel-spectrograms. The audio data are initially in .wav format, which is then sliced into 2-s increments and converted into mel-spectrograms. These mel-spectrograms are used as input to the deep learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). There is no mention of video or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
