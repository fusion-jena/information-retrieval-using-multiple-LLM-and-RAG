Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to machine learning and ecology, but it does not provide information on the evaluation metrics for deep learning models.

However, it does mention "classiÔ¨Åcation accuracy" in one of the references (Campbell et al., 2013), which suggests that accuracy might be one of the metrics used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models in this context. Additionally, the context mentions "precision" in the title of the Thorson and Haltuch (2018) paper, but it is not clear if this refers to the precision metric used in evaluating machine learning models.

Overall, the provided context does not provide enough information to give a definitive answer to the query.
