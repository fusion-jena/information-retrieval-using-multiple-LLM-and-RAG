Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The text appears to be a research paper discussing the development of a new underwater object detection network (UODN) and its performance on the URPC 2020 dataset, but it does not provide information on where the code is hosted. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
