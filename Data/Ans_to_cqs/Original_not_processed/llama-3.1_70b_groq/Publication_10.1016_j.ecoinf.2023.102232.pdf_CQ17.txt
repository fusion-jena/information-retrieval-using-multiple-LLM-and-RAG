Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to describe a hybrid optimization algorithm that combines a Least Squares (LS) method with a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and a Metropolis-Hastings-like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. The context does not mention deep learning or any specific regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide an answer to this query.
