Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context appears to be focused on particle Markov-chain Monte Carlo methods, parallel resampling, and data augmentation approaches, but it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps mentioned in the query.

However, it does mention that "No posterior samples were removed via thinning, as the resulting file sizes still allow for fast post-processing" and that "Gaussian kernel density estimation was used, with bandwidth equal to one fifth of the sample standard deviation of posterior samples for each respective parameter" to visualize posterior marginal distributions. But these are not the specific postprocessing steps mentioned in the query.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query based on the provided context.
