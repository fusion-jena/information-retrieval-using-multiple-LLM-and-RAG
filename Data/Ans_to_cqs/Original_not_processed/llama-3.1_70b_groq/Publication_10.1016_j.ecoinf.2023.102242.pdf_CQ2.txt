Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions "high-resolution remote sensing data" and the challenges associated with processing it, but it does not provide information on the specific formats used (e.g., image, audio, video, CSV). Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
