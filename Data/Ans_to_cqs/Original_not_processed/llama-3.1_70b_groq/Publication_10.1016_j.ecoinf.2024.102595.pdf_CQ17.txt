Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text mentions that the study aims to refine predictive modeling by addressing overfitting through sophisticated feature selection and cross-validation methods, but it does not provide details on the specific regularization techniques used, such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
