Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The text discusses the use of pre-trained word2vec models and the processing of textual data from hiking trails, but it does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
