Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, except for accuracy. It mentions that the proposed method exhibits improved accuracy by 1.35% and 0.08% in comparison to IA-YOLO on both datasets, respectively. Additionally, it mentions that the model with the added AIP module improved by 1.47% and 2.27% compared to the YOLOv8s baseline model on both datasets, respectively. However, it does not provide information on other metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, etc. Therefore, based on the provided context, the only metric that can be confirmed is accuracy.
