Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of Baited Remote Underwater Video Stations (BRUVS) in one of the studies. This suggests that video data from underwater environments is being used as a source of raw data for training deep learning models.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of annotated images, where video clips are transformed into still images at a rate of 1 frame per second, and then annotated with bounding boxes to identify sharks and non-shark species. This implies that the raw data is being collected through video recordings, which are then processed and annotated to create a dataset for training deep learning models.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of existing datasets, such as the ones used in the studies by Jalal et al. (2020) and Jenrette et al. (2022), which may have used different methods for collecting raw data. However, the specific methods used for collecting raw data in these studies are not mentioned in the provided context.
