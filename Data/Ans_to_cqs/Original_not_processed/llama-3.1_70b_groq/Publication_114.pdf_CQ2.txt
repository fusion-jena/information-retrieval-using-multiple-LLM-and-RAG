Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the data format used is likely images, as the context mentions "image classification" and "feature extraction" in the field of computer vision and remote sensing. Additionally, the context mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as VGG, GoogLeNet, and ResNet, which are commonly used for image classification tasks. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats in the provided context.
