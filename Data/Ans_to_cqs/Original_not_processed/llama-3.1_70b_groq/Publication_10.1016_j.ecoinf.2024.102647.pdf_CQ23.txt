Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context only mentions the evaluation criteria used to assess the performance of machine learning models (R2, NSE, KGE, and COR) and briefly touches on feature selection, but it does not provide information on the methods used to ensure the model's generalizability.
