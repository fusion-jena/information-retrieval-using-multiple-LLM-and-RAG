Answer:

According to the provided context, the performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the following metrics:

1. Accuracy
2. Precision
3. Recall
4. F1-score

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the five network models, including VGG16, Inceptionv3, ResNet34, ResNet50, and ResNet101. The results of these evaluations are presented in Table 6, which shows the overall accuracies, precisions, recalls, and F1-scores of the five networks.
