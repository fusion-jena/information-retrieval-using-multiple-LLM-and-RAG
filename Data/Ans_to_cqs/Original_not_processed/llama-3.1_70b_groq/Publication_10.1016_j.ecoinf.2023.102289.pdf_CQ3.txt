Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the LaDeco tool, its pre-trained models, and semantic segmentation technology. It also references various research papers and datasets, but it does not delve into the specifics of data annotation techniques.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions semantic segmentation, which is a technique used in image recognition that assigns specific objects to each pixel of an image. This implies that the data annotation technique used in this context might involve pixel-level annotation, but the exact technique is not specified.

To answer the query accurately, more information about the specific deep learning pipeline and its data annotation process would be required.
