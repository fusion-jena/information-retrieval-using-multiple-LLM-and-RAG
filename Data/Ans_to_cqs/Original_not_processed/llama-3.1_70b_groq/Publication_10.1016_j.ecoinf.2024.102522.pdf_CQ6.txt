Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention anything about preprocessing steps for training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to bioclimate, geographical environment factors, and human spread factors, with a list of variables and their explanations. It also includes some references to research papers, but none of them seem to be related to deep learning or preprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context. If you have any further information or context, I'd be happy to try and help.
