Answer:

Based on the provided context, it appears that the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Satellite images: The study by Neckel et al. (2023) mentions the use of Sentinel-3b SYN satellite images to collect data on air pollution in Budapest.
2. Passive samplers: The same study by Neckel et al. (2023) also mentions the use of self-made passive samplers to collect data on air pollution.
3. Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor vertical column density (VCD) products: The study mentions the use of monthly averages of five Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor VCD products, which include measurements of SO2, NO2, O3, HCHO, and CO.

It is not clear from the provided context whether surveys or public datasets are used as methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that the study by Chianese et al. (2019) uses a multi-layer perceptron to predict ambient particulate matter concentration, but the method of data collection is not specified.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline include satellite images, passive samplers, and Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor VCD products.
