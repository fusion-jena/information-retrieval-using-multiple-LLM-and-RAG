Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. However, it does mention "classification accuracy" as a metric used to evaluate the performance of software attempting to identify bats. Additionally, it mentions the importance of evaluating the performance of the software through the number of correct classifications using real-world examples.

It can be inferred that accuracy is one of the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model. However, it is not clear if other metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, etc. are also used.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that accuracy is mentioned as a metric used to evaluate the performance of the model, but it is not clear if other metrics such as precision and recall are also used.
