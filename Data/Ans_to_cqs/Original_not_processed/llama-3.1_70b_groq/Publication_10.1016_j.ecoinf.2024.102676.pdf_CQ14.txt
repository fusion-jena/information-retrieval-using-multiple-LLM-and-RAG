Answer: 
The text does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that "No hyperparameter tuning has been conducted" and that the default parameters were used for all models of the same species to assure uniformity. Additionally, it is mentioned that "All hyper-parameters have been previously tuned for all species", but it does not provide information on the method used for tuning.
