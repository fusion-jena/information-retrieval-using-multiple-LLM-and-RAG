Answer: 
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly state the purpose of the deep learning model. It mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the training process, but it does not specify whether the model is used for classification, segmentation, detection, or another task. The context does mention that the model is trained on pre-labelled data and that the goal is to make the model generalizable to remaining maps, but it does not provide enough information to determine the specific purpose of the model.
