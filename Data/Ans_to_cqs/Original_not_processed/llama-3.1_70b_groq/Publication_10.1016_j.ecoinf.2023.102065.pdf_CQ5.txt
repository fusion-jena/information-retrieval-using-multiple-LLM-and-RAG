Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on bird vocalization recognition and soundscape classification using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and mentions the use of weakly-labeled audio data from BirdCLEF competitions. It also mentions the use of transfer learning with existing image-based architectures like ResNet, VGGish, and MobileNet, but does not specify the datasets used for training these models. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
