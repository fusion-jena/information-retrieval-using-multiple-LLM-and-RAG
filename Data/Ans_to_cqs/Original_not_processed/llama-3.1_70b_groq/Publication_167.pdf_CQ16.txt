Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. It mentions the use of 10-fold cross-validation to divide the training and validation set, and the mean value of the ten results is used to estimate the accuracy of the model. However, it does not provide information on the specific stopping criteria used during training.

The context does mention the use of regularization methods, such as dropout, to prevent overfitting, and the use of cross-entropy as the loss function and the Adam optimization algorithm to update the weights of the neural network. However, it does not provide information on how these methods are used to determine when training is complete.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete.
