Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the methodology, data acquisition, and model development for predicting chlorophyll-a concentrations using machine learning models. It does mention that the training set was further randomly sampled to select training and validation sets to obtain optimized ML model hyperparameters, but it does not provide details on the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
