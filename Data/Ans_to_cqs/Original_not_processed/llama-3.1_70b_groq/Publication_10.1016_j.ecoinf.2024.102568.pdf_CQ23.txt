Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, specifically the LSTM model. However, it does mention that the model was tested on a test set, which implies that some form of splitting was used to separate the data into training and testing sets. Additionally, the context mentions that the model was compared to another model (VR + SVR) on multiple experiments (Exp.1, Exp.3), which suggests that some form of evaluation was performed to assess the model's performance on different datasets or scenarios. However, the specific details of the dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting are not provided.
