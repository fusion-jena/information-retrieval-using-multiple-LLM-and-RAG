Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the parameter selection was performed by minimizing the mean squared error, which suggests that the model's performance was evaluated based on its ability to minimize the error between predicted and actual values.
