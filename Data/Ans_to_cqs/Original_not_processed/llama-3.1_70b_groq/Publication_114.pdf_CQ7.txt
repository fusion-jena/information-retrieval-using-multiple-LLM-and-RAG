Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context discusses the performance of different deep learning algorithms (VGG16, ResNet50, and AlexNet) and their classification accuracies, but it does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation. Therefore, I do not know the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training in this context.
