Answer: The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using Bayesian optimization. This is mentioned in the text as "automated hyperparameter tuning was implemented using bayesian optimisation". This suggests that the model uses a Bayesian optimization algorithm to search for the optimal hyperparameters, rather than a grid search or random search.
