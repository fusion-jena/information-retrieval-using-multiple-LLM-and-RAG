Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as train, test, and validation sets. The context appears to be focused on the use of Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) for zoning and clustering tasks, but it does not provide information on data splitting criteria. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
