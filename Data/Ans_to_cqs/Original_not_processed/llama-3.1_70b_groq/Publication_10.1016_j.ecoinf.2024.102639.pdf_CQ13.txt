Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, such as learning rate and optimizer. The context appears to be related to a different type of machine learning model, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and discusses the selection of distance metrics, regularization parameters, and kernel types. Additionally, it mentions Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.

The only mention of a learning rate is in the context of a different type of model, where "learning rate functions V1(x) and V2(x)" are mentioned as articulating the algebraic expressions for the learning rate parameters associated with the choices of left and right directions by the paradise fish. However, this is not related to a deep learning model.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide an answer to the query about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model.
