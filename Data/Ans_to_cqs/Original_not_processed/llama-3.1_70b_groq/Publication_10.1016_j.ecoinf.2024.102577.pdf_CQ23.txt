Answer:

To ensure the generalizability of the model, the researchers used a 5 Ã— 10-fold cross-validation approach. This means that the dataset was split into 10 folds, and each fold was used as a test set once, while the remaining 9 folds were used as training sets. This process was repeated 5 times, resulting in a total of 50 iterations. This approach helps to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data and reduces the risk of overfitting.

Additionally, the researchers used a diverse dataset, which included various environmental and biological variables, such as temperature, salinity, oxygen concentration, and chlorophyll concentration, among others. This diversity in the dataset helps to ensure that the model is trained on a wide range of conditions and can generalize well to new, unseen data.

However, it is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context whether stratified splitting was used. Stratified splitting is a technique used to split the dataset into training and test sets while maintaining the same proportion of classes in both sets. This can be particularly useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets. Without further information, it is unclear whether stratified splitting was used in this study.
