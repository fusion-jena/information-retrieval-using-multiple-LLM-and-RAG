Answer: I don't know.

The provided context is a research article about using machine learning to infer animal behavior from location and movement data. It discusses various machine learning algorithms and models, such as hidden Markov models and state space models, but it does not mention anything about deploying a deep learning model on a specific platform like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud platform. Therefore, I do not have enough information to answer the query.
