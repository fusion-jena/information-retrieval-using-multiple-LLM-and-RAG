Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Flipping, Rotating, or Scaling. The context only mentions that data augmentation techniques were applied to increase training sample diversity, but it does not provide details on the specific techniques used. It also mentions that the overall process followed current best practices in deep learning, as summarized in (Chollet, 2017), but it does not elaborate on the specific techniques used. Therefore, I do not know the specific data augmentation techniques applied in this pipeline.
