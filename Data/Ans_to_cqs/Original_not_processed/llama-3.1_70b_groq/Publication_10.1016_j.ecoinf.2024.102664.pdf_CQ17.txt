Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the structure of the CNN and LSTM models, the performance of different solvers and input time series lengths, and the potential for future improvements in the Zhoushan fishery algal bloom forecasting model.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of different optimizers (adam, sgdm, and RMSProp) for training the network, which can help prevent overfitting to some extent. Additionally, the context mentions the use of fully connected layers with a small number of nodes (10 and 1), which can also help reduce the risk of overfitting.

But, without explicit information, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query.
