Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a research article or study on predicting the ecological niche of Short-billed Gulls using machine learning ensemble predictions, but it does not provide information on the deployment process of the trained model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
