Answer:::
The criteria used to split the data for machine learning model training, as mentioned in the provided context, is a 10-fold cross-validation (CV) design. Specifically, for each run of the cross-validation procedure, 30% of the forest fire occurrence data is reserved as a validation set, and the remaining 70% of the data is used to train the model. This rigorous validation methodology is adopted following the method explained by Eskandari et al. (2021).
