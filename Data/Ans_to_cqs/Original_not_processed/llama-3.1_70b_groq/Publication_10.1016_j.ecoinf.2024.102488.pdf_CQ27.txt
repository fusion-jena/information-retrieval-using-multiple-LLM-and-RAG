Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on feature selection, data fusion, and classification models, but it does not provide information on model deployment.

The context mentions the use of various machine learning algorithms, such as LightGBM, Random Forest, and AdaBoost, but it does not discuss the deployment of these models. It also mentions the use of Recursive Feature Elimination and Cross-Validation (RFECV) for feature selection, but this is not related to model deployment.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to answer the query about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
