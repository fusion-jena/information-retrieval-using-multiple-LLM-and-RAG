Answer:::

The provided context does not specifically mention a deep learning model, but it does discuss methods for ensuring the generalizability of a model. According to the text, when data are abundant, a common approach is to randomly divide the full dataset into three parts: a training set, a validation set, and a test set. However, when data availability is limited, resampling methods such as k-fold cross-validation are used.

In k-fold cross-validation, the full dataset is split into k approximately equally-sized disjoint subsets or folds. The model is then calibrated on k-1 folds, and the remaining fold is used for assessing prediction accuracy. This process is repeated k times, and the overall cross-validation accuracy is estimated by aggregating the residuals over the k folds.

The text does not mention the use of a diverse dataset or stratified splitting as measures to ensure generalizability. However, it does mention that in conventional k-fold cross-validation, the folds are chosen randomly, which can help to ensure that the model is trained and tested on a representative sample of the data.

It is worth noting that the context provided is focused on thematic map production and statistical prediction methods, rather than deep learning specifically. Therefore, the measures taken to ensure generalizability may differ from those used in deep learning applications.
