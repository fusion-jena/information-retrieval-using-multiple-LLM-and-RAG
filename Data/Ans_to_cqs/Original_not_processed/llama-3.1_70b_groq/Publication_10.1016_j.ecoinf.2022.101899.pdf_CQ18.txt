Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that "MCMC diagnostics are very similar to the informative model and show no issues with representativeness and accuracy." This suggests that Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) diagnostics were used to monitor the model's performance, but the specific details of the strategy are not provided. Additionally, it is mentioned that "Diagnostic plots are given in Appendix," which implies that some form of visualization was used to evaluate the model's performance, but the content of the appendix is not included in the provided context.
