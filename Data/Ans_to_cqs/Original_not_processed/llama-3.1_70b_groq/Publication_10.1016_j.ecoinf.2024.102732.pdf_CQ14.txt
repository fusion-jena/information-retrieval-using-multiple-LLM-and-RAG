Answer: According to the provided context, the hyperparameters of the models are optimized using a grid search methodology. Specifically, it is mentioned that "Optimal values for these parameters were identified using grid search" for RF parameters, and "A grid search methodology was employed to find the best parameter combination" for XGBoost. This suggests that the authors used a grid search approach to systematically explore different combinations of hyperparameters and identify the optimal values that result in the best model performance.
