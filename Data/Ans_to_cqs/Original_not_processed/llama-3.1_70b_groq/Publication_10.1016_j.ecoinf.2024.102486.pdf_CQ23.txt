Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The context appears to be a collection of references and citations related to various topics such as particle Markov-chain Monte Carlo, GPU computing, and machine learning in ecology. 

However, it does mention that the most common use of GPU computing in the referenced articles was in machine learning, particularly in image and acoustic recording classification tasks. It also mentions the use of software tools like TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch, which are popular deep learning frameworks.

While the context does not provide specific information on measures taken to ensure generalizability, it does mention data augmentation approaches for improving animal audio classification (Nanni et al., 2020). Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the size and diversity of a dataset, which can help improve the generalizability of a model.

Overall, the context does not provide a direct answer to the query, but it does suggest that data augmentation may have been used in some of the referenced studies to improve the generalizability of deep learning models.
