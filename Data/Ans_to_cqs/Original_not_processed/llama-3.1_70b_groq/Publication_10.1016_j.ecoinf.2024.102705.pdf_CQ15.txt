Answer: According to the provided context, several optimization algorithms are employed in the deep learning pipeline. These include:

1. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) (Herbert and Sutton, 1951)
2. Adaptive Gradient (AdaGrad) (Duchi et al., 2011)
3. Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp) (Tieleman and Hinton, 2012)
4. Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014)

Specifically, the Adam optimizer was used in the training process of the AIP-OD model, with a learning rate that initially started at 10^-4 and gradually decreased over the course of training.
