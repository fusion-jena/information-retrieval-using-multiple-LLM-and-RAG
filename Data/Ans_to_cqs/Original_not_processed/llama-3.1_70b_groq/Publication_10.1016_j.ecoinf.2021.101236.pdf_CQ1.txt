Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the design of the neural network architecture, the training process, and the use of spectrogram data, but it does not provide information on how the raw data was collected.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
