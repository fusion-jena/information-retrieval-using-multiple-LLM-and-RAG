Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline's data is available. However, it does mention that the dataset was shared by Jiang et al. (2020) through a Github repository: https://github.com/zhangchuanyin/weed-datasets. This suggests that the data may be available on Github, but it does not provide information on whether it is also available on other repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
