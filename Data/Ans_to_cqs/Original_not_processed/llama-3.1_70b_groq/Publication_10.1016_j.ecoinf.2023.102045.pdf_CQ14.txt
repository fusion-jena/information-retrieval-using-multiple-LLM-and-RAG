Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention anything about model optimization or hyperparameter tuning. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, scientific communication, and visualization, with a focus on colour blindness and the use of colour ramps in visualizations. There is no mention of machine learning models or hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search.
