Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context appears to be related to a study on climate data and ecological informatics, discussing topics such as extrapolation metrics, Mahalanobis distance, and downscaling methods. However, it does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps mentioned in the query, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
