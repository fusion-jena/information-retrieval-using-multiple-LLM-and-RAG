Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection. However, it does mention data augmentation, which was applied only to the training data to avoid overlapping the same data in different partitions. This suggests that some form of data preprocessing was performed, but the specific techniques used to address data bias are not mentioned.

The context does discuss the importance of considering spatial heterogeneity and variability in the data, particularly in the context of remote sensing and geographic information systems. It highlights the need for robust and adaptive validation criteria and methods that can account for the complexities of spatial data. However, it does not provide specific information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
