Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of the Root Trimmed Mean Squared Prediction Error (RTMSPE) as a metric to evaluate the model's performance. The RTMSPE is a robust measure that removes the impact of heterogeneous observations, which are common in crowdsourcing data analysis. The RTMSPE is defined as the square root of the mean of the squared prediction errors, after removing a proportion δ of the largest errors. This metric is used to select the appropriate values for the tuning parameters τ and ϕ, which are used in the penalized loss function to perform shrinkage estimation and variable selection.
