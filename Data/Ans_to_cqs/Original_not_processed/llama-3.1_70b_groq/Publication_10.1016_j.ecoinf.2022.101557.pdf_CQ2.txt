Answer: 
The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is raster, as mentioned in the context: "This creates a raster over the whole map, where each pixel is either deemed to be part of a wetland or not." Additionally, the data is split into smaller areas of 80 Ã— 80 pixels, suggesting that the input data is image-like. The context also mentions that the data is converted from a raster representation to a vector representation for further analysis and to minimize storage space. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
