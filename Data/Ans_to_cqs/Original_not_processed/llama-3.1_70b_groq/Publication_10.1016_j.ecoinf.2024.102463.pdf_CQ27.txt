Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context mainly focuses on the model optimization process, including hyperparameter tuning using the HyperBand algorithm, and the architecture of the proposed neural network model. It does not provide information on model deployment, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
