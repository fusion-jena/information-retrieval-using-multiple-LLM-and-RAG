Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on ecological and environmental research, with references to species distribution modeling, microbiome analysis, and geographic information systems (GIS). There is no mention of deep learning or computer vision-related topics.

However, I can mention that the context does reference several datasets and environmental data rasters, such as Bio-ORACLE, which is a global environmental dataset for marine species distribution modeling. Additionally, the context mentions the use of various R packages, such as "sdm", "dismo", "bioclim", and "biomod2", which are used for species distribution modeling and ecological analysis.

But, I couldn't find any information about the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
