Answer: The text does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as cross-validation or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the model was evaluated on three datasets, representing a range of domains, problems, species, and environmental conditions. This suggests that the use of diverse datasets was one approach taken to ensure the model's generalizability. Additionally, the text mentions that the model was evaluated on the MS COCO 2017 dataset, which is a large and diverse dataset, but it does not provide further details on the evaluation protocol.
