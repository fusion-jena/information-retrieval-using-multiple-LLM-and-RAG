Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the model development, evaluation, and comparison of different machine learning models, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine.

However, it does mention that the weights in the ANN were randomly initialized using the Nguyen-Widrow method, and the model was fitted with CARET, which is a package in R that provides a set of functions for building and testing regression models. But it does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query based on the given context.
