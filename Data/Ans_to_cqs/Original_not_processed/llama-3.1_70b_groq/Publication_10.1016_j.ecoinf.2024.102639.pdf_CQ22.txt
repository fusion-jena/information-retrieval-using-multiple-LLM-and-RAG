Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in the provided context are:

1. Precision (%)
2. Recall (%)
3. F-measure (%)
4. Accuracy (%)

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the KNN, SVM, and PCA-SVM models in classifying the left-right movements of zebrafish and rats. The values of these metrics are provided in the tables, showing the performance of each model in terms of precision, recall, F-measure, and accuracy.
