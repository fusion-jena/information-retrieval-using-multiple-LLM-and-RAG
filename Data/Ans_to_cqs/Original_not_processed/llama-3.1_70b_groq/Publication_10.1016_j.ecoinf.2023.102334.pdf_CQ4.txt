Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Flipping, Rotating, or Scaling. The context primarily focuses on the Vision Transformer (ViT) and its application to image classification tasks, particularly for identifying sika deer. It discusses the architecture of ViT, its advantages, and the use of a hybrid approach combining ViT with a CNN backbone. However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in the pipeline.

Therefore, I do not know the specific data augmentation techniques applied in this deep learning pipeline.
