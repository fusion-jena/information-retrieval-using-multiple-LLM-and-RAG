Answer:::
I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment platform used for the deep learning model. The context appears to be a research paper discussing the use of various machine learning models, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Bootstrap Forest, and Boosted Tree, for predicting CLCuD. However, it does not provide information on the deployment platform used.
