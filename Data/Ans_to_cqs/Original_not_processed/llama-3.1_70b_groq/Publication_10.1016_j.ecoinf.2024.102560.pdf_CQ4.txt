Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a study on Lake Urmia, discussing topics such as signal decomposition, river runoff variation, and land cover variations. It also mentions various datasets and methodologies used in the study, but it does not mention deep learning or data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
