Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. However, it does mention the use of a learning rate of 0.0075, which suggests that some form of gradient descent-based optimization is being used. Additionally, the context mentions the use of batch normalization, which can help with optimization by reducing internal covariate shift. But the specific optimization algorithm used is not mentioned.
