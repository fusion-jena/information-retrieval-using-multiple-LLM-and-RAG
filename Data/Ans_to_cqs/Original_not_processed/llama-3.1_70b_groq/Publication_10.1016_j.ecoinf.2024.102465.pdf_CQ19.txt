Answer:::
The study employs the HRNet model, which is used in combination with PyCharm software for semantic segmentation processing. However, the specific deep learning framework used to build the HRNet model is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. It is also mentioned that an NLP model based on the Lstm-cnn framework is used for sentiment scoring, but the framework used to build this model is not specified either.

However, based on the mention of PyCharm software, it can be inferred that the study may be using Python as the programming language, which is often used with frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. But without explicit mention, it is not possible to confirm the exact framework used.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the specific framework used to build the deep learning model is not specified in the provided context.
