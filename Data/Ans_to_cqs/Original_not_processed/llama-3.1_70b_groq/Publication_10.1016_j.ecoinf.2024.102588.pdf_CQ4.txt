Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the application of autoencoders and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for estimating aquatic ecosystem health and processing multidimensional data.

However, it does mention that one previous study applied a CNN-based approach to augment aquatic ecosystem health data (Lee et al., 2021), but it does not provide details on the specific data augmentation techniques used.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query. If you have any further questions or context, I would be happy to try and assist you.
