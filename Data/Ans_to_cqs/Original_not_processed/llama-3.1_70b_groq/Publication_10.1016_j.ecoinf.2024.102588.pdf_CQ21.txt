Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context appears to be a collection of research paper references and snippets related to artificial intelligence, neural networks, and dimensionality reduction, but it does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps mentioned in the query (Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, Confusion matrix).

However, I can tell you that the context does mention "early stopping" and "model validation accuracy" in the context of training a CNN model, which suggests that some form of performance evaluation or metrics calculation may be involved. But without more information, I cannot provide a detailed answer to the query.

If you're looking for information on postprocessing steps in machine learning, I'd be happy to provide general information on the topic, but it would not be specific to the provided context.
