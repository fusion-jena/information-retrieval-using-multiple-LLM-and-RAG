Answer: The text does not explicitly state how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, it does mention that "50% of the training data were held-out for validation (see Supporting Information)" and that "model selection and parameter optimization" were performed. This suggests that some form of validation and optimization was performed, but the specific method (e.g., grid search, random search) is not specified.
