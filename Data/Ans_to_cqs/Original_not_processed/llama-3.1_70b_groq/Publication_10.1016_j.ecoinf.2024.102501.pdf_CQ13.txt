Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate and optimizer. The context discusses various machine learning and deep learning models used for predicting dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration, including Support Vector Regression (SVR), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and others. It also mentions optimization algorithms like Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) used to optimize model parameters. However, it does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
