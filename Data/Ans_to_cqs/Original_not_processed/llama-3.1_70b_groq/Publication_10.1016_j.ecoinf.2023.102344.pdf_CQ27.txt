Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the training and evaluation of the models using different approaches and architectures, but it does not provide information on the deployment process.

The context mentions the training configuration, optimization algorithms, and evaluation metrics used, but it does not discuss model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related aspects. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
