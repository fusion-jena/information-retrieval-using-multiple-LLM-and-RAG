Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. It discusses the active learning pipeline, different query selection strategies, and the performance of the classifier model. However, it does mention that the classifier achieves 93.2% overall accuracy after the first 30,000 active queries, which suggests that the training process may be evaluated based on the model's performance on a validation set. Nevertheless, the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete are not mentioned in the provided context.
