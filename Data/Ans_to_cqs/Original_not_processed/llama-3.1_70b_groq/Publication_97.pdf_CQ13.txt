Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. However, it does mention some of the hyperparameters that were tuned during the grid search, including:

* num_layers: 64
* depth: 2, 3, or 4
* layer_rate: 2, 1.5, or 1.2
* batch_norm: True or False
* residual: True or False
* dropout: 0 or 0.5

The best-performing model had the following hyperparameters:

* num_layers: 64
* depth: 4
* layer_rate: 2
* batch_norm: True
* residual: False
* dropout: 0.5

However, the learning rate and optimizer used in the model are not specified in the provided context.
