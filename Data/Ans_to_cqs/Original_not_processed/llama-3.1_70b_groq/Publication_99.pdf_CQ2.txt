Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the primary data format used is images. This is evident from the mention of image preprocessing techniques such as mean centering and rescaling, as well as the use of image-related models like PConv networks, Pix2Pix networks, and VGG16. Additionally, the context mentions image sizes (256 × 256/512 × 512) and image-related tasks like plant species identification. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats in the provided context.
