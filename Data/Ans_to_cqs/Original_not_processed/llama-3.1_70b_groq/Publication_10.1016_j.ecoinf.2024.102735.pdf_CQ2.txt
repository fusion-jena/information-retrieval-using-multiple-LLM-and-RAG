Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it appears that the data used in the study is in the form of water quality parameters and ecosystem variables, such as temperature, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, and chlorophyll-a concentrations, which are typically stored in tabular formats like CSV.

The context mentions the use of machine learning models like random forest, multilayer perceptron, long-short term memory, and support vector regression, which are typically used for processing tabular data. Additionally, the context mentions the use of a dataset with specific columns like temperature, turbidity, and chlorophyll-a concentrations, which further suggests that the data is in a tabular format.

Therefore, based on the available information, it is likely that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is CSV or a similar tabular format. However, without explicit mention of the data format, this is only an educated guess.
