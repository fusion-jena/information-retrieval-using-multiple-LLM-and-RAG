Answer: The data was split into training (60%) and testing (40%) by randomly selecting entire audio files. The training audio files were mutually exclusive to the testing audio files, and the testing files were generally recordings over different days. This was done to ensure a fair evaluation of the model. There is no mention of a validation set in the provided context.
