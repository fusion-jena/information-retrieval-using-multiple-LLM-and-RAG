Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the clustering performance is evaluated using the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) and the Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI) scores, which quantify the intra-class cohesion and inter-class separability. These metrics are used to assess the model's ability to cluster the data effectively. No other metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall are mentioned in the context.
