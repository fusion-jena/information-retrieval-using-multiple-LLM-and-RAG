Answer: 
The provided context does not explicitly state how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that "During our study, we tested different hyperparameters to find an optimal setting for our problem" and presents the results of the hyperparameter fine-tuning in Table 1. However, it does not provide information on the specific method used for hyperparameter optimization, such as grid search or random search.
