Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the design of the model structure, feature extraction, and the potential application of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in ecology. 

However, it does mention the use of a dropout layer in the model structure, which is a regularization technique that can help prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data. Additionally, the context mentions the use of a finite number of patterns as features, which may help to reduce the risk of overfitting.

But, there is no mention of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the use of a diverse dataset to ensure generalizability. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question based on the provided context.
