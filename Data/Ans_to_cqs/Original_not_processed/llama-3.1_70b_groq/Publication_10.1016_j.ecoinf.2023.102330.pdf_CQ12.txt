Answer: CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)

According to the provided context, a previously developed CNN model (Nolan et al., 2022) is used to analyze recordings and detect covey calls. The model is trained on covey call spectrogram data and is used to detect and localize all covey calls per Autonomous Recording Unit (ARU) during the recording period. The model outputs a score for each detection, and a conservative score threshold of 0.95 is used to classify calls as positive bobwhite detections.
