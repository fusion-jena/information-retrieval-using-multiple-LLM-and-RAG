Answer: The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or its performance evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall. The context appears to be related to forest inventory and diversity index estimation using different methods (e.g., inventory estimator, NN1, NN2, NN3, and NN4 estimators). The performance of these methods is evaluated using the relative root mean square error (rRMSE) of the diversity indices.
