Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that training an image recognition model (e.g., deep learning) would be very useful if the methodology were extended to larger areas and/or more languages, with the subsequent increase in the volume of data. This suggests that the deep learning model is intended for image recognition, but the specific purpose (e.g., classification, segmentation, detection) is not specified.
