Answer: The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the context, specifically ResNet-50, Inception-V3, and CLIP, is image classification. These models are designed to classify images into different categories or classes. For example, ResNet-50 is a convolutional neural network model that uses skip connections to improve its performance on image classification tasks. Inception-V3 is also a convolutional neural network model that is used for image classification, and it has an auxiliary classifier that acts as a regularizer. CLIP, on the other hand, is a combination of two transformer models that is trained using contrastive learning to allow the image encoder to learn visual concepts through natural language supervision, and it can be used for zero-shot image classification.
