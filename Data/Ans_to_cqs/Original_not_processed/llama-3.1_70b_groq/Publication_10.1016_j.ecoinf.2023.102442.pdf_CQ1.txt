Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets, particularly through the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. According to the context, GEE provides a public catalog containing petabytes of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets, which can be accessed, selected, and processed for analysis.

It can be inferred that satellite imagery is one of the primary sources of raw data used in the deep learning pipeline. The context also mentions the use of Sentinel-2 based multispectral data for detecting artisanal small-scale mining in Ghana. This suggests that satellite-based remote sensing data is a key component of the raw data used in the deep learning pipeline.

However, it is unclear if other methods such as surveys or sensors are used to collect raw data. The context does not provide information on the use of public datasets beyond the satellite imagery and geospatial datasets available through GEE. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive answer to the query based on the provided context.
