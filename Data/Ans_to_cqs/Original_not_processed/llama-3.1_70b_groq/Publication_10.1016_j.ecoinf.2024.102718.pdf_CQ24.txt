Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the performance of various deep learning models, including BEiT, CAHA-AXRNet, DeepBatch, and DHLC-DETR, in plant disease classification tasks. It discusses the results of these models on different datasets, their accuracy, and their comparison with other models.

However, it does mention the use of ensemble learning in one of the references (Catal Reis, H., Turk, V., 2024a and 2024b), which can be a strategy to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Ensemble learning involves combining the predictions of multiple models to reduce the variance and improve the overall performance. But it does not specifically discuss the use of random seed values or other strategies to handle randomness.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
