Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be related to a study on estimating forest biomass using GEDI and Sentinel-2 data, and it discusses the methodology and results of the study. However, it does not provide information on the training process or the criteria used to determine when training is complete. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
