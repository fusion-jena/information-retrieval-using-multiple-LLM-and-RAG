Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to remote sensing and ecological informatics, discussing the use of machine learning algorithms like Random Forest and Artificial Neural Networks for estimating Above Ground Biomass (AGB). The datasets mentioned in the context are related to remote sensing data, such as Landsat, MODIS, SPOT, IKONOS, QuickBird, Sentinel-1 & 2, and Worldview, but these are not typically used in deep learning pipelines for image classification tasks.
