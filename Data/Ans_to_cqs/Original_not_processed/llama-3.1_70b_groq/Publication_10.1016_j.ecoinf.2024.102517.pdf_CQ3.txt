Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the experimental setting, comparative algorithms, and the framework of the bird sound noise reduction network based on deep feature loss. It does not provide information on the data annotation techniques used, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
