Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the sources of some of the data used in the analysis, such as:

* GUS ( likely referring to the Polish Central Statistical Office) for data on the percentage of the population employed in industry (INDST) and access to medical assistance (DOC)
* OpenStreetMap for data on distance from land border crossings (BOR)
* Money.pl (a Polish financial news website) for information on the contribution of industrial or mining workplaces to the emergence of disease outbreaks

It can be inferred that the data collection methods may include:

* Utilizing existing public datasets from sources like GUS and OpenStreetMap
* Gathering information from online news articles and websites like Money.pl

However, it is not clear if surveys or sensors are used for collecting raw data in this specific context. The context primarily focuses on analyzing existing data related to COVID-19 cases, population, and geographic conditions, rather than collecting new data through surveys or sensors.
