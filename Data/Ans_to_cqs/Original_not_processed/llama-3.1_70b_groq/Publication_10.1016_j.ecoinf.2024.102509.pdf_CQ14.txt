Answer: Hyperparameter tuning was carried out to ensure the reliability of the ANN models. However, the specific method used for hyperparameter optimization is not mentioned in the provided context. It is only mentioned that the selection of hidden layers and neurons was determined through a process of trial and error, aiming to optimize the network's structure.
