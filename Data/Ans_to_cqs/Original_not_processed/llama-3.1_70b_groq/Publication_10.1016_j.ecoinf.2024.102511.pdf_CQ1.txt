Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some sources of data and tools that might be related to data collection.

For example, the context mentions "Passive Acoustic Survey of Deep-Diving Odontocetes in the California Current Ecosystem 2018: Final Report" by Simonis (2020), which suggests that passive acoustic surveys might be a method used for collecting data on marine mammals. Additionally, the context mentions ERDDAP, a tool developed by NOAA/NMFS/SWFSC/ERD, which might be used for collecting or accessing data.

The context also mentions the use of echolocation clicks for classification of dolphins, which suggests that acoustic sensors might be used for collecting data. However, the specific methods used for collecting raw data are not explicitly mentioned.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive answer to the query. However, it can be inferred that passive acoustic surveys, acoustic sensors, and possibly other methods might be used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
