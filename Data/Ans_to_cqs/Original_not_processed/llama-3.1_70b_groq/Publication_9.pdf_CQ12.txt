Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the context, which mentions the use of CNNs for image recognition tasks, object detection, and image analysis workflows. The context also mentions the use of pre-trained CNNs, such as those trained on ImageNet, as a starting point for recognition tasks. Additionally, the context discusses the architecture of CNNs, including the creation of feature maps across multiple layers and the use of stochastic gradient descent with backpropagation for training. There is no mention of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers in the provided context.
