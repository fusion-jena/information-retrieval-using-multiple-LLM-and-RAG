Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository for a deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a collection of references and metadata standards for environmental monitoring efforts, particularly in the context of oceanography and ecology. There is no mention of a specific code repository or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
