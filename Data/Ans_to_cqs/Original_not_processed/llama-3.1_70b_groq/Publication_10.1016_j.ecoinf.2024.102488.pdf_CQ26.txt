Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to remote sensing and land cover classification, and it discusses various machine learning algorithms and techniques used for classification, such as LightGBM, Random Forest, and Recursive Feature Elimination. However, it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias.

That being said, the context does mention the use of stratified sampling in the form of five-fold cross-validation, which is a technique used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models. However, it is not explicitly mentioned as a technique used to address data bias.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query. If you have any further questions or context, I would be happy to try and assist you.
