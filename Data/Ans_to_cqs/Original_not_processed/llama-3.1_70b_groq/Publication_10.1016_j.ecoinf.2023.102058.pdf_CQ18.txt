Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. It discusses various machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest (RF), Principal Component Regression (PCR), and Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), and their applications in estimating water quality parameters using hyperspectral data. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance is monitored during training.
