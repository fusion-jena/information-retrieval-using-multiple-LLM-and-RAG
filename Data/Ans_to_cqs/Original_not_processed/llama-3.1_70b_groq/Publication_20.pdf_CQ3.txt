Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does provide some information on the criteria used for annotating fish in images.

According to the context, the criteria for annotating a fish include:

1. The fish should not be covered by more than 10% of its surface by another object.
2. The fish should be identifiable at the species level in the frame.
3. The apparent size of the fish should be larger than 3000 squared pixels.

These criteria suggest that the annotation process involves identifying and labeling individual fish in images, but the specific annotation techniques used are not mentioned. It is possible that bounding box annotation or other techniques were used, but this information is not provided in the context.
