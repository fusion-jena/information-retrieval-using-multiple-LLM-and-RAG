Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model is classification, specifically hierarchical classification of insects into different taxonomic levels (e.g., order, family, species). The model is designed to classify images of insects into their corresponding taxonomic categories, with the goal of achieving fine-grained classification. The model is trained on a dataset with images labeled with species information, and it uses a multitask learning approach to predict the class labels at different levels of the taxonomic hierarchy. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score, which are commonly used in classification tasks.
