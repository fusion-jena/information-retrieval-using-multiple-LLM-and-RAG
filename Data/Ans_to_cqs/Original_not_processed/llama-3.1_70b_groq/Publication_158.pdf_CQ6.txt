Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does mention data augmentation techniques that were applied to enhance sample variation. These techniques include:

* Rotation
* Reflectance bias of ±10%
* Random noise of ±10% reflectance for 15% of the input image

Additionally, the context mentions that batch normalization was applied after all convolution or dense layers, except for the final output. This suggests that some form of normalization was used during the training process, but it is not clear if any preprocessing steps were applied before training.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions that the input image size was varied, with images being cropped to sizes of 1 × 1, 4 × 4, 8 × 8, and 32 × 32. However, it is not clear if any other preprocessing steps were applied to the images before training.
