Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and training of the model, including the use of dilated convolutions, nested encoder-decoder structures, and binary cross-entropy loss functions. It also mentions the evaluation of the model on public datasets, but does not provide details on the specific datasets used or any techniques employed to ensure generalizability. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
