Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the evaluation of different deep learning models for algal bloom forecasting, including the performance of various models and their comparison. It also discusses the potential for future improvements and optimization of the models. However, it does not provide information on the deployment process of the trained models, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
