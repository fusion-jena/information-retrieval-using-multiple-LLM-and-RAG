Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, except for the "average overall accuracy" which is mentioned as 0.8298. This suggests that accuracy is one of the metrics used to evaluate the model's performance. However, other metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, etc. are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, based on the available information, we can only confirm that accuracy is one of the metrics used to evaluate the model's performance, but we cannot provide information on other metrics.
