Answer:::

The provided context does not specifically discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention active learning strategies, which can be used to mitigate data bias by selecting the most informative samples for labelling.

The context mentions that active learning algorithms typically start by training the underlying model on a small, randomly selected labelled subset of data. After training the initial model, various criteria can be employed to select the most informative unlabelled samples to be passed to the oracle for labelling.

While the context does not explicitly mention techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, it does suggest that active learning can be used to improve the quality of the training data. By selecting the most informative samples, active learning can help to reduce data bias and improve the overall performance of the model.

It is worth noting that the context does mention the use of margin-based active learning, which can be used to select samples that are most likely to be misclassified by the model. This can help to identify and address data bias, but it is not a direct technique for addressing data bias during preprocessing.

In summary, while the context does not provide a comprehensive list of techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing, it does suggest that active learning can be used to improve the quality of the training data and mitigate data bias.
