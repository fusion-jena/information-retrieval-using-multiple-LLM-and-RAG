Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It mentions that the MaxEnt model's output was analyzed, and the model was run with maximum iterations and a 30% random test percentage, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
