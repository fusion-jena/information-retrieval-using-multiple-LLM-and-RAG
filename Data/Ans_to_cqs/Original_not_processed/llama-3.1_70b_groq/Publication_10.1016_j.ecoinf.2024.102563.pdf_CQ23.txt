Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context appears to be focused on classification results and methods, including MLC, SVM, ANN, and RF, but does not provide information on the specific techniques used to ensure the generalizability of the models. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
