Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a research article or study on land use and land cover (LULC) classification using remote sensing data, but it does not provide information on the data collection methods.

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the study likely uses remote sensing data, possibly from satellite or aerial imagery, as it mentions spectral indices and vegetation indices. The context also mentions the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE), which is a platform for analyzing satellite and other Earth observation data.

But without more specific information, it is not possible to determine the exact methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
