Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the use of deep learning approaches for automatic standardized processing and identification of tropical bat calls, and the architecture of the BatNet model. It mentions the use of a cascade of multiple layers of nonlinear processing units for feature extraction, but it does not provide information on the data annotation techniques used.

However, it can be inferred that the data annotation techniques might involve labeling or annotating the bat calls, as the model is trained to identify specific bat species. But the specific techniques used, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to the query.
