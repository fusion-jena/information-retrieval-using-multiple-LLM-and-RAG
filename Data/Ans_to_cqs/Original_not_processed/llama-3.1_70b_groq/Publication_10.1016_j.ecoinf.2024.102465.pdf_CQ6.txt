Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the models used for sentiment analysis (LSTM-CNN) and semantic segmentation (HRNet), as well as various studies and research papers related to urban vitality, social media data, and deep learning.

However, it can be inferred that some form of preprocessing might have been involved, as the context mentions the use of text data and image data. Typically, preprocessing steps such as tokenization, stopword removal, and normalization are common for text data, while image data might involve resizing, normalization, and data augmentation.

But without explicit information, it's difficult to provide a specific answer to the query. Therefore, I must say that I don't know the exact preprocessing steps involved in this particular context.
