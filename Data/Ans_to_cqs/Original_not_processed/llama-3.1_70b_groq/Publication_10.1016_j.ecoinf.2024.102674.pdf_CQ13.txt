Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate and optimizer. The context appears to be related to a study on downscaling near-surface wind fields and temperature predictions using various algorithms, but it does not provide information on the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
