Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. In fact, it is mentioned that "deep learning algorithms were also considered, however, the limited number of samples was not conducive to deep learning", suggesting that deep learning models were not actually trained or deployed in this study. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
