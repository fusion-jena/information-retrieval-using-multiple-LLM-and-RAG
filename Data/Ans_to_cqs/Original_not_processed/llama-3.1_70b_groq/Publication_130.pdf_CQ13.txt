Answer:::
The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows: 

- The learning rate used is 10 times smaller than the initial learning rate, but the initial learning rate is not specified.
- The optimizer used is the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer.
- The batch size used is small, with eight pictures being provided to the model each time, as it has been shown that small batch sizes improve models' generalization capability.
- The model is stopped from training if there is no decrease in loss for more than 10 consecutive epochs.
