Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses various aspects of the model, such as the use of an AdaLAM-based module, the performance of the SORT and Deep SORT models, and the equations for the state vector and measurement vector of the Kalman filter. However, it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques like grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
