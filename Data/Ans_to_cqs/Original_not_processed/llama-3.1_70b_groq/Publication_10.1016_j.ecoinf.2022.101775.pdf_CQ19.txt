Answer: PyTorch is mentioned as one of the frameworks used to build the deep learning model. This is evident from the reference "Lerer, A., Wu, L., Shen, J., Lacroix, T., Wehrstedt, L., Bose, A., Peysakhovich, A., 2019. Pytorch-biggraph: A large-scale graph embedding system." However, it is not explicitly stated that PyTorch is the framework used for the specific deep learning model being discussed.
