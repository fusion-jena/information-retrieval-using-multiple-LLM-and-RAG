Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a snippet from a research paper, but it does not provide information about the datasets used. The text seems to be focused on the results of some experiments, with various abbreviations (e.g., S, PR, RM) and numbers, but it does not mention well-known datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query.
