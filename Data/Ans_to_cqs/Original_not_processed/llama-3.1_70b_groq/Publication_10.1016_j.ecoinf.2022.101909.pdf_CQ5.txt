Answer:::
The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the provided context are:

1. ImageNet: This is explicitly mentioned as the dataset used for pre-training the ResNet50 model.
2. Audio Set: This dataset is mentioned as an alternative to ImageNet for pre-training, specifically for bioacoustic tasks.
3. VGG-Sound: This is another dataset mentioned as a viable option for pre-training, particularly for audio-visual tasks.

There is no mention of MNIST or CIFAR in the provided context. Additionally, the context mentions the use of synthetic clicks or chirps as a possible pre-training option, but it does not specify a particular dataset for this purpose.
