Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the evaluation metrics for a deep learning model. The text discusses remotely sensed metrics, multispectral imagery, and data scaling in the context of ecological informatics, but it does not mention deep learning models or their evaluation metrics. The text does mention metrics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and textural metrics, but these are not related to the evaluation of deep learning models.
