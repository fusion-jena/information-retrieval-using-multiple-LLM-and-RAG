Answer: 
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions the use of images for the identification of Triatominae species, which are vectors of Chagas disease, but does not provide information on how these images were collected. Therefore, I do not know the specific methods used for collecting raw data in this particular deep learning pipeline.
