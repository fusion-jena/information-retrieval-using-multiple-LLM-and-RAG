Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that a "leave-one-out cross-validation" was performed to check the accuracy of the spatial predictions. This suggests that the data was split into training and validation sets, but the specific criteria used for this split are not specified.

In general, common criteria used to split data for deep learning model training include:

* Random splitting: dividing the data into random training and validation sets
* Stratified splitting: dividing the data into training and validation sets while maintaining the same proportion of each class
* K-fold cross-validation: dividing the data into k subsets and using each subset as a validation set while the remaining subsets are used for training

However, without more specific information, I cannot provide a more detailed answer to the query.
