Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context only mentions that the CNNs were initialised to pre-trained ImageNet weights and that the feature extractor and output layer were fine-tuned. It also discusses the importance of keeping the input size fixed and the characteristics of the vocalisations in the presence class for each dataset. However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the specific data augmentation techniques applied in this study.
