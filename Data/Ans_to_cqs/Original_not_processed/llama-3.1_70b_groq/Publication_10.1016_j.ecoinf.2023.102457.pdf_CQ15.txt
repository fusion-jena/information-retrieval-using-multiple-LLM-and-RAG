Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The text primarily discusses the use of pre-trained CNNs, such as BirdNET, VGGish, and Wav2Vec 2.0, for feature extraction and classification of animal vocalizations, but it does not delve into the details of the optimization techniques employed in the deep learning pipeline.
