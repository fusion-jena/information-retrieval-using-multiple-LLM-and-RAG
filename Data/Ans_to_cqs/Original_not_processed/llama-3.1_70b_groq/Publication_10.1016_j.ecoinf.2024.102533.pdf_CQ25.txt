Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the information given, it appears that the model is used for automated fish grading and freshness classification. The context mentions that the model is used to "automatically classify fish freshness" and that it is trained on a dataset generated over 11 days. Additionally, the context mentions that the model uses six organoleptic parameters to classify fish freshness. Therefore, it can be inferred that the purpose of the deep learning model is classification, specifically classification of fish freshness.
