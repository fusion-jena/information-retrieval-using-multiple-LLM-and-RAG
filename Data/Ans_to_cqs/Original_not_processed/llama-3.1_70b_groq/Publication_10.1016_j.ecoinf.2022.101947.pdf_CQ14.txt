Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the Footprint Identification Technique (FIT) for monitoring tiger populations, the limitations of the pugmark technique, and the potential of FIT as a useful tool for conservation monitoring. It also provides a list of variables and their descriptions, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization methods such as grid search or random search.
