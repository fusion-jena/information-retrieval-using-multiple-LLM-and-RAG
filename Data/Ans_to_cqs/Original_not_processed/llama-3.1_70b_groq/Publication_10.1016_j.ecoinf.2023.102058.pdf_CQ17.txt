Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text only mentions that machine learning methods are prone to overfitting and the curse of dimensionality, and that decreasing the feature space dimension using intelligent feature selection techniques can be an interesting topic of study. However, it does not provide information on the specific regularization methods used, such as dropout or L2 regularization.
