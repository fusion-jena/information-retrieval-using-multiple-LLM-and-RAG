Answer:::
The regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline is dropout. According to the provided context, a dropout value of 50% has been used in the first three layers to improve generalization and reduce overfitting. This suggests that dropout is the primary regularization technique employed in this model. There is no mention of L2 regularization or any other regularization methods being used.
