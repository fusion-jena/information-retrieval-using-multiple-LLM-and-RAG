Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. The model is designed to classify dolphin sounds into different species. The study compares the performance of two different architectures, a customized CNN and a pre-trained ResNet152V2, on two-class and multi-class classification tasks. The model is trained to predict the species of dolphin based on audio recordings, and the performance is evaluated based on validation accuracy and precision. The study aims to find the optimal parameters for constructing a suitable training dataset for classification tasks on complex dolphin sounds.
