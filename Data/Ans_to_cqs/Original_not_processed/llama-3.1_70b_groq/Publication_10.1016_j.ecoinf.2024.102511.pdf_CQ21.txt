Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context appears to be related to a research article or study on using machine learning for acoustic classification of beaked whale echolocation pulses. It provides information on the importance of automated classification, keywords, and references to other studies, but it does not delve into the specifics of the postprocessing steps.

However, based on general machine learning practices, common postprocessing steps after model training may include:

* Metrics calculation: This involves calculating various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc. to evaluate the performance of the model.
* Confusion matrix: A confusion matrix is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. It provides a summary of predictions against actual outcomes.
* Saliency maps: Saliency maps are a technique used to visualize which input features are most important for a model's predictions.

It is likely that these steps were performed in the study, but without explicit information, it is impossible to confirm.
