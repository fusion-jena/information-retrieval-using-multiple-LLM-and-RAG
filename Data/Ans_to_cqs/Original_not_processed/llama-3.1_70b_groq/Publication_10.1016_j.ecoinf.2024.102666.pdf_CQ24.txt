Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing and atmospheric correction algorithms, specifically discussing the use of artificial neural networks (ANN) and various algorithms for atmospheric correction (AC) in aquatic environments. It does not provide information on deep learning pipelines or strategies for handling randomness.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
