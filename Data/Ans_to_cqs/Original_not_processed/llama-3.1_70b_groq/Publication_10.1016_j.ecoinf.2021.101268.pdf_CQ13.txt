Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The text mentions the use of pre-trained models (AlexNet, VGG-19, ResNet-101, and DenseNet-201) and fine-tuning, but it does not provide information on the specific hyperparameters used.

However, it does mention the use of the Adam optimizer in a reference to a paper by Kingma and Ba (2014), but it is not clear if this optimizer was used in the specific deep learning model described in the text.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
