Answer: 
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, it is mentioned that the model used is a U-net, which is a type of CNN architecture that is commonly used for image segmentation tasks. This is evident from the references to U-net in the provided context, such as in references 26, 27, and 28. Additionally, the context mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for end-to-end classification and learning features from an input dataset.
