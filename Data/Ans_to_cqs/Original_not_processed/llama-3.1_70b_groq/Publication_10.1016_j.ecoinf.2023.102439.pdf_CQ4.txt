Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing, land use/land cover classification, and time series analysis using techniques like wavelet analysis and artificial neural networks (ANNs). It does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question.
