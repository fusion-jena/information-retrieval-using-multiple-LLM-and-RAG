Answer: According to the provided context, the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model include:

* 5-time cross-validation to optimize the parameters.
* Data from 2014 and 2015 were used as the test dataset, which suggests that the model was trained on data from previous years and tested on more recent data.
* The experimental process map was randomly selected in Matlab, which implies that the data was randomly split into training and testing sets.

There is no mention of using a diverse dataset or stratified splitting in the provided context. However, the use of cross-validation and testing on a separate dataset (2014 and 2015) suggests that some measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.
