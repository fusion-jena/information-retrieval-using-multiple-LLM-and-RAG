Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to data management and metadata standards for environmental or scientific data, and does not discuss deep learning or data preprocessing techniques.

The context mentions data processing approaches, data originators, and data consumers, but it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. It also mentions data column descriptions, data file descriptions, and measurement setting templates, but these are not relevant to the query.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. If you have any additional context or information, I would be happy to try and help further.
