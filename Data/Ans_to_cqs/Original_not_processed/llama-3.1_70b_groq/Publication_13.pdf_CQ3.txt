Answer: 
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The text primarily focuses on the performance of within-dataset classification, between-datasets classification, and the effects of datasets and the number of images on the accuracy of the classification. It also mentions the use of domain adversarial training of neural networks (DANN) for domain adaptation. However, it does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.
