Answer:::

According to the provided context, one strategy employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline is adding gradient noise. This is mentioned in the paper "Adding gradient noise improves learning for very deep networks" by Neelakantan et al. (arXiv 2015, arXiv:1511.06807). However, the context does not provide further details on how this strategy is employed or its specific application in the deep learning pipeline.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of random seed values in the training phase, but it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions the use of data augmentation, which is a technique used to increase the size of the training dataset by applying random transformations to the existing data. However, this is not directly related to handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the only strategy mentioned for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline is adding gradient noise. However, more information would be required to provide a comprehensive answer to this query.
