Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does discuss the importance of model convergence and the use of stochastic gradient descent with backpropagation to optimize model weights.

It also mentions the use of pre-trained CNNs, such as those trained on ImageNet, as a starting point for recognition tasks. This implies that the input data may need to be preprocessed to match the format and characteristics of the pre-trained model.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of the VGG Image Annotator to manually annotate pixel coordinates and create precise polygonal mask contours around the fish body boundary. This suggests that some form of data annotation and labeling may be involved in the preprocessing steps.

However, specific details on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning are not provided in the context. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to this query.
