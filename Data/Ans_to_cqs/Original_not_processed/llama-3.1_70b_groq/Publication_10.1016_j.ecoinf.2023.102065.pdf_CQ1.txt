Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of "acoustic reference data" and "audio domain" in the context of soundscape classification and bird species recognition. This suggests that audio recordings may be one source of raw data.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of "cloud-based crowd-sourcing platforms" as a potential method for collecting reference data. This implies that public datasets or crowdsourced data may be used as a source of raw data.

The context also mentions the use of "sensors" in the context of collecting ecological data, but it does not provide further details on the types of sensors used.

Overall, the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it appears that audio recordings, public datasets, and crowdsourced data may be used as sources of raw data.
