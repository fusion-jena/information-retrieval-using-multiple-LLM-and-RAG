Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention a general methodology for testing and evaluating a model, which involves:

i) training the model using a dataset
ii) testing/evaluating the model using another dataset completely different from the first dataset
iii) letting field experts evaluate the model with a completely new dataset independent from the first and second datasets.

This suggests that the data is split into at least three parts: a training set, a test set, and a validation set (or evaluation set). However, the specific criteria used to split the data (e.g., proportion of data in each set, random sampling, stratified sampling, etc.) are not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
