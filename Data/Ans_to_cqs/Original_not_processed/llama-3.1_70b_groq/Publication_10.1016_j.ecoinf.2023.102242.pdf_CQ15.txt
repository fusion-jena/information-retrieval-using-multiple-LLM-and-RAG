Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context only discusses the use of a hierarchical structure for selecting the optimal feature combination and an object-oriented multi-level classification method to minimize data redundancy and enhance classification accuracy and efficiency.

Therefore, I don't know what optimization techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline in this specific context.
