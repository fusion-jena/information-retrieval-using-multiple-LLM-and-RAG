Answer: 
The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of well-known datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it mentions the use of an "endemic bird data" dataset, which is randomly split into 3,132 images for training and 760 images for testing. This dataset is then augmented 10 times, resulting in a total of 31,320 images, with 25,056 (80%) used for training and 6,264 (20%) used for validation.
