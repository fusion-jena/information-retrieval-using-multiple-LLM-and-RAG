Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on ecological informatics, machine learning, and soil analysis, but it does not provide information on the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline.

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the data formats used might include image data, as mentioned in the paper by Nguyen et al. (2019), which uses object-based image analysis for mapping vegetation types. Additionally, the context mentions CSV-like data formats, as evidenced by the tables presented in the text, which contain numerical data on soil properties, climate, and other ecological variables.

But, without more specific information, it is impossible to determine the exact data formats used in a deep learning pipeline.
