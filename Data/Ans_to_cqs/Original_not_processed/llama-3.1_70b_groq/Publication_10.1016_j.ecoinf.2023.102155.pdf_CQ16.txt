Answer:::
The text does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that the Bayesian information criteria (BIC) is used to tune the lasso penalty. This suggests that the authors may be using some form of model selection or regularization criteria to evaluate the performance of their models, but the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete is not mentioned.
