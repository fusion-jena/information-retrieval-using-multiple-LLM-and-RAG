Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that various data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline, particularly in the field of ecology. The context mentions the use of visual images and acoustic recordings as typical machine learning applications.

Specifically, the context mentions the use of:

* Visual images (e.g., Atila et al., 2021)
* Acoustic recordings (e.g., Nanni et al., 2020)
* Animal audio classification (Nanni et al., 2020)

There is no explicit mention of video data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is possible that video data may be used in some applications, but it is not mentioned in the provided context.

Additionally, the context does not mention the use of CSV (Comma Separated Values) data format in the deep learning pipeline. CSV is a common data format used for tabular data, but it is not mentioned in the context as being used in deep learning applications.

Overall, the context suggests that visual images and acoustic recordings are common data formats used in the deep learning pipeline, particularly in the field of ecology.
