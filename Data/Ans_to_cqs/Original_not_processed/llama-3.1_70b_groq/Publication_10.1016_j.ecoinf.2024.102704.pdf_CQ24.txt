Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on various deep learning models, their architectures, and performance evaluations, but it does not delve into the specifics of managing randomness.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention a "random selection process" in the division of the targeted fish species dataset into training and validation sets in an 8:2 ratio. This suggests that randomness is indeed a factor in the data preparation process, but the specific strategies for handling it are not discussed.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query. If you have any further questions or would like me to clarify any specific points, please feel free to ask!
