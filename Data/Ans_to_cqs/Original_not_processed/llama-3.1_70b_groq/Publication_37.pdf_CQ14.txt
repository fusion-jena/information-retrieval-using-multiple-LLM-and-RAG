Answer: 
The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions the specific hyperparameters used for training the model, such as a constant learning rate of 0.01, dropout probability of 0.5, and L2-regularization penalty factor of 0.001. However, it does not mention the method used to optimize these hyperparameters, such as grid search or random search.
