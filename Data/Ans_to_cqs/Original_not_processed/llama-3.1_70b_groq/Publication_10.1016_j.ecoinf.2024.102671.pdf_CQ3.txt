Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to ecological research, carbon sink risk zones, and spatial analysis, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques used in deep learning.

However, I can suggest that the context mentions the use of various data sources, such as the Resource Environment Science and Data Research Center, Openstreetmap, and Geospatial Data Cloud, which may be used for data collection and annotation. Additionally, the context mentions the use of spatial analysis techniques, such as clustering and landscape zonation, but it does not provide information on specific data annotation techniques used in deep learning.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
