Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the challenges of collecting clean data for training deep noise reduction techniques, data requirements for fine-tuning, and the methodology pipeline for noise reduction and deep audio enhancement models.

The context does mention that the denoised outputs (Sdenoised) are compared, but it does not provide further details on how this comparison is done or what metrics are used. It also does not mention saliency maps or confusion matrices.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
