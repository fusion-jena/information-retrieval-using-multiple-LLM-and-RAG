Answer:::

I don't know. The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to machine learning models for predicting river water quality, and it discusses the importance of analyzing historical trends in water quality data to select representative training data subsets. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques.
