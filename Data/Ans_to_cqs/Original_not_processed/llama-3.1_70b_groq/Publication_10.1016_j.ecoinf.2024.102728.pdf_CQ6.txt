Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be a list of references and citations from various fields, including ecology, archaeology, and computer science.

However, I can provide some general information on common preprocessing steps involved in training deep learning models. These steps may include:

* Normalization: scaling numeric data to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model.
* Scaling: transforming data to have zero mean and unit variance, which can improve model performance.
* Cleaning: handling missing or erroneous data, such as removing duplicates, handling outliers, and imputing missing values.
* Data augmentation: artificially increasing the size of the training dataset by applying transformations to the existing data, such as rotation, flipping, or cropping.

Please note that these steps may not be exhaustive, and the specific preprocessing steps required may vary depending on the problem, dataset, and model architecture.

In the context of the provided references, the paper by Cohen and Shashua (2017) mentions the inductive bias of Deep Convolutional Networks through Pooling Geometry, but it does not explicitly discuss preprocessing steps. The other references appear to be unrelated to deep learning or preprocessing steps.
