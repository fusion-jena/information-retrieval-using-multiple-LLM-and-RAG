Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. It discusses the approach for training the network, the network setup, and the benefits of pre-training on larger datasets, but it does not provide information on how the model performance is monitored during training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
