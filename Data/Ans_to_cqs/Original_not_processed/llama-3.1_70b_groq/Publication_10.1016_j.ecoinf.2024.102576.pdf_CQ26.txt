Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models for land use and land cover classification, deforestation mapping, and phenological analysis using satellite imagery.

However, it does mention the importance of using a large dataset and increasing data during the training of a deep learning model to improve classification accuracy and performance (Kim et al., 2021a, 2021b). This suggests that data augmentation or diverse data collection might be beneficial in addressing data bias, but it is not explicitly stated.

The context also mentions the use of phenological characteristics and multi-index approaches for classification, which might help in reducing data bias by incorporating additional information. Nevertheless, specific techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling are not mentioned.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to the query.
