Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on the execution environment, hardware, and software specifications, as well as the results of calculations with different parameters for ResNet50 and VGG19 + ResNet50. It also mentions the use of data augmentation and flattened convolution kernels to achieve optimal simulation results. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training.
