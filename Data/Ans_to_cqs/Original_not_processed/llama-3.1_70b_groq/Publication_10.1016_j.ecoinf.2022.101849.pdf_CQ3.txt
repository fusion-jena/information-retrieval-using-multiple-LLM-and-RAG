Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to focus on weakly supervised learning tasks, particularly in the context of regression and classification problems, and discusses various terms and definitions related to noisy and scarce labels.

The context does mention a case study on predictive modeling of global vegetation cover, but it does not delve into the specifics of data annotation techniques used in this study. It also references various papers and studies related to weakly supervised learning, but these references do not provide information on data annotation techniques.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. If you have any further context or clarification, I would be happy to try and assist you further.
