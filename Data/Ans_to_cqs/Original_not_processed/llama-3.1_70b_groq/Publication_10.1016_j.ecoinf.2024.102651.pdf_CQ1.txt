Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the application of various deep learning architectures, such as CNN, ViT, and hybrid networks, for image classification tasks, particularly in the field of ecology and biology. It discusses the strengths and weaknesses of different architectures and their performance on various datasets.

However, it does not provide information on how the raw data was collected, such as through surveys, sensors, public datasets, or other methods. Therefore, I must conclude that the answer to this question is not available in the provided context.

If you have any further questions or would like me to clarify any points, please feel free to ask!
