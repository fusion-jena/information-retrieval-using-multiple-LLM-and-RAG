I don't know. The provided context does not mention deep learning models or frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. It discusses data filtering, Earth Observation System (EOS) data, and the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) for processing large datasets, but it does not provide information on deep learning models or their associated frameworks.
