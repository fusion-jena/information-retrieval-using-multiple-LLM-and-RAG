Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the performance of different models (e.g., YOLOv5, YOLOv6, YOLOv7, YOLOv8, YOLO_MRC) and the results of various experiments, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
