Answer: The text does not explicitly mention the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the model is "likely to detect animals when they occupy at least 60px in an image" under ideal conditions, suggesting that the model has been trained on a dataset that includes images with varying object sizes. Additionally, the text mentions that the model's performance is expected to improve with more training data and new model advancements, implying that the model has been designed to be adaptable to different datasets. However, without further information, it is unclear what specific measures were taken to ensure the model's generalizability.
