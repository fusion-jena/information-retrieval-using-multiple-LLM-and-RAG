Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the data preprocessing steps, model architecture, and performance evaluation metrics such as accuracy. It does not provide information on saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

However, it does mention that the performance of the proposed model is evaluated and compared with state-of-the-art approaches. The context also mentions that the accuracy obtained reaches 95% on 140 epochs, and the model is compared with conventional CNN models. But it does not provide details on the specific postprocessing steps involved.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
