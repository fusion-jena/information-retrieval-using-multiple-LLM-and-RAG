Answer: 

The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics, including overall accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 

- Overall accuracy is the number of images correctly classified out of the total number of images.
- Precision is the number of correctly classified images of a given class out of the number of predicted images of that class.
- Recall is the number of correctly classified images of a given class out of the number of annotated/observed images of that class.
- F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of individual classes and the overall performance of the model.
