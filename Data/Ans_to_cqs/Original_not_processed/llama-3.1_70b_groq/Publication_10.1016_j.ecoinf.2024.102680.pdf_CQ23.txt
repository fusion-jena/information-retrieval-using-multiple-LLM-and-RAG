Answer: The text does not explicitly mention measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the input layer of the UODN performs preprocessing operations, including applying algorithms such as mosaic data augmentation. This suggests that some form of data augmentation was used to enhance the ability of the model to represent the data and improve its performance during training. Additionally, the text mentions that the batch size of all networks was set to 16 uniformly, which may help to reduce overfitting and improve generalizability. However, it does not provide further information on the specific measures taken to ensure generalizability.
