Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only provides information on the hyperparameters used for training each model, such as batch size, learning rate, optimizer, and loss function, as summarized in Table 2. However, it does not discuss the process of hyperparameter optimization, such as grid search or random search.
