Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to focus on the application of machine learning algorithms to predict total phosphorus concentration in rivers and the use of neural networks in remote sensing and agriculture.

However, I can provide some general information on data annotation techniques that are commonly used in deep learning pipelines. Data annotation is the process of labeling or annotating data with relevant information to prepare it for use in machine learning models.

Some common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include:

* Bounding box annotation: This involves drawing a bounding box around objects of interest in an image to help the model learn to detect them.
* Instance segmentation: This involves annotating each instance of an object in an image, such as identifying each individual object in a scene.
* Semantic segmentation: This involves annotating each pixel in an image with a class label, such as identifying which pixels belong to a particular object or class.
* Landmark annotation: This involves annotating specific points or landmarks in an image, such as the eyes or nose in a face detection task.

These are just a few examples of data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. However, without more specific information from the provided context, I cannot provide a more detailed answer to the query.
