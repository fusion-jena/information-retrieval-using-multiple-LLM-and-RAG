Answer: 

According to the provided context, the performance of the classification models is evaluated using accuracy on the test set as an indicator. Specifically, the accuracy of the models on the test set is reported in Tables 6 and 7. 

For example, in Table 6, the accuracy of the Classic CNN model on the test set is reported as 81.00%, 88.36%, and 89.11% for features F1, F2, and F3, respectively. Similarly, in Table 7, the accuracy of various features using different machine learning models (RF, SVM, and MLP) is reported.

There is no mention of other metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, etc. being used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. Therefore, based on the provided context, the answer is that accuracy is the metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model.
