Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a research article on using machine learning to aid sustainable Indian Ocean tuna purse seine fishery, but it does not provide information on the data formats used in the pipeline.

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the data used in the pipeline might be related to oceanographic and fisheries data, such as temperature, sea level anomaly, mixed layer depth, and chlorophyll concentration. These data might be in the form of numerical values or spatial data, but the specific format (e.g., CSV, image, audio, video) is not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
