Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention anything about training or validation loss plateau. It appears to be a table of parameters and equations related to the FERM model, which is an ecological model for simulating the condition of ecological targets. There is no mention of machine learning or training processes, so I couldn't find any relevant information to answer the query.
