Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as cross-validation or stratified splitting. However, it does mention the use of a large dataset, BMXSM, which suggests that the model was trained on a diverse set of images.

The context also mentions that the model was trained on different training sets (Traini, i = 1, 2, â€¦, 7) and that the error values were compared across these different training sets. This suggests that some form of evaluation was performed to assess the model's performance on different subsets of the data.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model was trained on a GPU server and a desktop PC, and that the error values were compared across these different training modes (incremental training and zero-start training). This suggests that the model was evaluated on different hardware configurations, which may help to ensure its generalizability.

However, without more information, it is difficult to say for certain what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model. It is possible that cross-validation or stratified splitting were used, but this is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
