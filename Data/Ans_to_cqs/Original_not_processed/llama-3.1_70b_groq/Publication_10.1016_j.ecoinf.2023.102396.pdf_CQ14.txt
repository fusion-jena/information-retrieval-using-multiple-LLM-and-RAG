Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, it does mention that the R function "optim" is used to maximize the likelihood function of state space models to estimate unknown parameters a, b, c, and Ïƒ2u for each rabbit population. This suggests that the optimization of model parameters is done using a general-purpose optimization algorithm, but the specific method used for hyperparameter optimization (e.g., grid search, random search) is not mentioned.
