Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific frameworks used to build deep learning models, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context primarily discusses various research papers and studies related to natural language processing, text classification, and environmental governance, but it does not provide information on the specific frameworks used to build deep learning models.

However, it does mention the use of the ERNIE model, which is a pre-trained language model that has achieved state-of-the-art results in various Chinese natural language processing tasks. The ERNIE model is mentioned in the context of being used for text classification and named entity recognition tasks, but it does not provide information on the underlying framework used to implement the model.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
