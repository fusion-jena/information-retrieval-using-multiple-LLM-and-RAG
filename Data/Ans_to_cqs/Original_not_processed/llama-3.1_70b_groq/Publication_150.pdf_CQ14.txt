Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions the optimizer used, which is the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer, and the initial learning rate for all models except MansNet. It also mentions that the learning rate was reduced by a factor of 10 after steps of 30 epochs. However, it does not provide information on whether grid search, random search, or any other method was used to optimize the hyperparameters.
