Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the Res_AUNet network, is semantic segmentation, particularly for water sun glint detection in UAV water images. The model is designed to identify and separate the water sun glint from the rest of the image, which is a critical task for effectively eliminating water sun glint and determining the optimal timing for UAV water image acquisition. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and IOU (Intersection over Union), which are commonly used in semantic segmentation tasks.
