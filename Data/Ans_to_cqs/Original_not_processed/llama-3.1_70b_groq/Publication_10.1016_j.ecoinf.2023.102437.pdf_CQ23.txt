Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the comparison of machine learning models, including Random Forest (RF) and Lasso models, for forecasting ENSO, and the use of a deep neural network (DNN) for land cover/land use classification. 

However, it does mention the use of a large number of trees (200) in the RF model, which can help improve the model's generalizability. Additionally, the context mentions the use of a batch size of 32 and 500 epochs in the LSTM model, which can help prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.

Regarding cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the use of a diverse dataset, the context does not provide any information. Therefore, I cannot confirm whether these measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
