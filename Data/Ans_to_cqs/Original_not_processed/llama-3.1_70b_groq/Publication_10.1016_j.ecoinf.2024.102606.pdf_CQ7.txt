Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that cross-validation was used to ensure the statistical results and prevent overfitting. Specifically, it states that the dataset was randomly shuffled and divided into a training and an evaluation set K times, where K is 5 in this case.

This suggests that the data was split into training and evaluation sets using a random shuffle and split approach, but the exact criteria or ratio used for the split is not specified. It is also not clear if a separate validation set was used, or if the evaluation set was used for validation purposes.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the data was split using a random shuffle and split approach, but the exact criteria or ratio used for the split is not specified in the provided context.
