Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and performance of various object detection models, including YOLOv5, Faster RCNN, and others, but does not provide information on the hyperparameters used during training.

However, it does mention the use of focal loss as a loss function in some of the models, which is a hyperparameter-related choice. Additionally, it mentions the use of a Dropout layer with a probability of 0.5, which is also a hyperparameter. But other important hyperparameters like learning rate, optimizer, batch size, and number of epochs are not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a complete answer to the query.
