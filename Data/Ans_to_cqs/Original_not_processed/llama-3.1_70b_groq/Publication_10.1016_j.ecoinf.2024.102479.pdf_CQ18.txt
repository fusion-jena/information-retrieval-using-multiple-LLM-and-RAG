Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is Grid Search Cross-Validation (GSCV). According to the context, GSCV is used to identify the most effective set of hyperparameters that enhance the model's performance. During training, GSCV generates a series of models, each characterized by a different set of hyperparameters, and systematically trains and assesses the performance of these various models through cross-validation. This process concludes with the selection of the model that demonstrates the most superior performance, determined by its optimal hyperparameter combination.
