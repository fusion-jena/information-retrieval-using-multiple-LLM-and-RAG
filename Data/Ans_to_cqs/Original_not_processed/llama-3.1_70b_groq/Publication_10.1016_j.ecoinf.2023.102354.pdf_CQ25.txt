Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the information given, it appears that the research is focused on exploring the potential of deep learning and machine learning algorithms for enhancing groundwater-climate interactions understanding and investigating the climatic hotspots implications within the sub-basins of the GAB region.

It can be inferred that the deep learning model is likely being used for a predictive or analytical task, such as predicting groundwater levels, identifying areas of high drought risk, or analyzing the relationships between climate variables and groundwater dynamics. However, without more specific information, it is difficult to determine the exact purpose of the deep learning model, such as classification, segmentation, or detection.
