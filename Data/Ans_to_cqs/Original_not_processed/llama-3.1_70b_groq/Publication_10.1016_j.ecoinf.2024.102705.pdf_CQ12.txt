Answer:::
The text mentions that the proposed method incorporates a compact network with a non-local layer, but it does not explicitly state the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it does mention Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) as a classic deep learning model extensively utilized for image processing. It also mentions that DCNN can effectively extract ecological information from camera trap images. Therefore, it can be inferred that the pipeline might be using a DCNN or a variant of it, but the exact type of model is not explicitly stated.
