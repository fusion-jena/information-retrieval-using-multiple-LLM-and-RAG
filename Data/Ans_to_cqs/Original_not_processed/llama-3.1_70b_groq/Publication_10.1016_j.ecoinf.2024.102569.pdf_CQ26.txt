Answer:::

The provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss methods for mitigating sampling bias in the context of species distribution modeling.

Some of the methods mentioned in the context include:

* Target-group background method (Phillips et al., 2009)
* Spatial thinning (Veloz, 2009)
* Area-interaction process (Baddeley and van Lieshout, 1995)
* Cox process (MÃ¸ller et al., 1998)

These methods are not specifically related to deep learning pipelines, but rather to statistical modeling and species distribution analysis.

Regarding the techniques mentioned in the query (Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, Diverse data collection), the context does not provide any information on these specific techniques.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
