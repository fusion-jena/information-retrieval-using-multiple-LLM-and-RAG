Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context appears to be focused on specific deep learning models, such as Mask R-CNN, and their implementation details, but it does not discuss randomness or strategies for handling it.

However, it is worth noting that setting a random seed value is a common practice in deep learning to ensure reproducibility of results. This is because many deep learning algorithms involve random processes, such as weight initialization and data shuffling, which can affect the outcome of the training process. By setting a fixed random seed value, researchers can ensure that their results are reproducible and comparable across different runs.

Unfortunately, the provided context does not provide any information on whether a random seed value was set or used in the experiments described. Therefore, I cannot provide a more specific answer to this question based on the provided context.
