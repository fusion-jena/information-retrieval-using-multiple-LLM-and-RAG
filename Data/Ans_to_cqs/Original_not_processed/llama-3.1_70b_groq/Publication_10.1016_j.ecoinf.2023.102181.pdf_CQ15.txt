Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or optimization techniques such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be focused on machine learning, specifically bagging and Random Forest, and their application to geospatial modeling. It discusses issues related to biased model training and validation, and proposes a method to correct for the effects of clustering sampling on bagging models using residual spatial autocorrelation information. However, it does not provide information on optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines.
