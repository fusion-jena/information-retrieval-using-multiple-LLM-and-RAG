Answer:::
The provided context does not specifically mention the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It only mentions that the "corresponding computational infrastructure required by the learning algorithms" is one of the major enablers for the success of Deep Learning (DL). It does not provide details on the type of hardware resources used, such as GPUs or TPUs.
