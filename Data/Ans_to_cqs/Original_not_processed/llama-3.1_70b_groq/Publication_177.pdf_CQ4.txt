Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of pre-trained ImageNet weights, fine-tuning of network models, and Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling.
