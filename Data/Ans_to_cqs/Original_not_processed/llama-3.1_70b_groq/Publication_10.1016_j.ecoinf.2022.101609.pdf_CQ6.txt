Answer:

According to the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include:

1. Categorification: This step involves mapping categorical columns to distinct categories using the "categorify" pre-processor from the Fastai library.
2. Handling missing values: The "fillMissing" pre-processor is used to replace null values with column median values.
3. Normalization: Continuous columns are normalized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation using the "normalize" pre-processor.
4. Date feature extraction: The "add datepart" helper function is used to generate additional predictors such as "Year", "DayofWeek", "DayOfYear", "Is Month_End", and so on.

These preprocessing steps are applied to the dataset before splitting it into training, validation, and test sets. The specific preprocessing steps may vary depending on the dataset and the problem at hand, but these steps are mentioned in the context as part of the data preprocessing procedure.
