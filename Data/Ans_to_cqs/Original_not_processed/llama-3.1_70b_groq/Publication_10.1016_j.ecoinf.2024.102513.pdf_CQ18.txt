Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context provides information about the training configuration, classification accuracy, spectral indices used, and land use and land cover change matrix, but it does not provide details about the specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
