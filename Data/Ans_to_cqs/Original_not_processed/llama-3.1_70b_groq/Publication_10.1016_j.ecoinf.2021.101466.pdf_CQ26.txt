Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention data augmentation as a technique used to preprocess the dataset for training an image detection and classification model. Data augmentation involves applying transformations such as cropping, flipping, scaling, rotating, adding noise, and color transformation to the existing data to increase its size and diversity.

Additionally, the context mentions that 4000 images were prepared for each category using data augmentation, and 80% of these images were used for training, while the remaining 20% were used for validation. This suggests that the dataset was split into training and validation sets, but it does not provide information on whether stratified splitting was used.

There is no mention of oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection as techniques used to address data bias. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive answer to the query based on the provided context.
