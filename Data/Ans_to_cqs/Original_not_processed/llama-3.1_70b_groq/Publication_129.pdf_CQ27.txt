Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the architecture and training of the model, including the use of a Region Proposal Network (RPN) and a classifier, but it does not provide information on how the model was deployed.

However, it does mention that the detection and classification procedures of agricultural insect pests can be executed in a few seconds in the cloud computing system, which suggests that the model was deployed in a cloud-based environment. But the specific details of the deployment process, such as model serialization and platform selection, are not provided.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a complete answer to this question.
