Answer: 
The provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on a specific application of deep learning for acoustic detection of covey calls using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The CNN model was trained on covey call spectrogram data collected from Di-Lane and other sites around Georgia and Alabama, USA. However, it does not mention the use of any of the commonly known datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
