Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the application of deep learning and machine learning algorithms to understand groundwater-climate interactions, drought anticipation, and groundwater assessment. It discusses the importance of groundwater resources, the use of innovative techniques for evaluating groundwater-related aspects, and the significance of groundwater assessment in certain regions.

However, it does not provide information on the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this query.
