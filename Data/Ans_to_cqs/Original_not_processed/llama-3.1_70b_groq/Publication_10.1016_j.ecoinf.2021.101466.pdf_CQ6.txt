Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention data augmentation methods used to train the EfficientNet and YOLOv4 models.

For the EfficientNet, the context mentions that the same image processing as the data augmentation for YOLOv4 was applied to the foreground, background, and combined images. However, it does not provide details on the specific preprocessing steps used.

For YOLOv4, the context mentions that the data extension method used for YOLOv4 was also applied to the proposed data augmentation method. However, it does not provide details on the specific preprocessing steps used for YOLOv4.

The context does mention that the data augmentation method involved combining a masked foreground image with a background image that did not contain any insects, and that at most, one foreground image was composited. It also mentions that the parameters for the data augmentation employed to train the EfficientNet are shown in Table 1b, but the table is not provided.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.
