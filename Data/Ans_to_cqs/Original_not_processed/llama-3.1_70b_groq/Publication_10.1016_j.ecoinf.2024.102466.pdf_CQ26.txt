Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that some researches present techniques for addressing imbalanced class recognition of animal species in camera-trap images (Cunha et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2021). This suggests that data imbalance is a concern in wildlife monitoring tasks, but the specific techniques used to address it are not mentioned in the provided context.

Additionally, the context mentions that dataset noise is a factor that affects the algorithm's performance in identifying specific bird species, and that environmental clutter and ambiguities may affect the bird detection dataset, resulting in a noisy dataset. However, it does not provide information on how to address these issues during preprocessing.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. If you have any further context or clarification, I would be happy to try and assist you further.
