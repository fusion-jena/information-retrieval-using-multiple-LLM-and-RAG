Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that the best training for the first network was achieved with five epochs and a batch size equal to 32, and for the second network, the best training was achieved with six epochs and a batch size equal to 32.

It can be inferred that the number of epochs was used as a stopping criterion, but the context does not provide information on how the optimal number of epochs was determined. It is possible that the training process was stopped after a fixed number of epochs, but it is also possible that other criteria, such as validation loss plateau or a maximum number of epochs without improvement, were used.

Unfortunately, without more information, it is not possible to provide a more specific answer to this question.
