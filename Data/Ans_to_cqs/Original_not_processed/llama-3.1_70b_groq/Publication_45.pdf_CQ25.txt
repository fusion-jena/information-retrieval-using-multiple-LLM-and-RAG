Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model in the provided context is classification. The text mentions that the authors repeated experiments using other widely used classification algorithms, such as distributed random forest, gradient boosting machine, and generalized linear model, to compare their performance with the deep neural network (DNN). Additionally, the text states that the authors provide a reproducible example of designing, training, and applying DNNs for ecological prediction, specifically using bark beetle outbreaks in conifer-dominated forests as a case study. This suggests that the DNN is being used for classification tasks, such as predicting the occurrence of bark beetle outbreaks.
