Answer: The text does not explicitly mention the use of well-known datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it appears that the authors are working with a custom dataset of bird songs, where each song is represented as a spectrogram image. The dataset is divided into a training set, validation set, and test set, with a split of 70%/10%/20% respectively. The training set is used to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm for image classification.
