Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that fieldwork expeditions were conducted to confirm the selected shrub images and validate the orthomosaic annotations. This suggests that some form of data collection was done through field observations and possibly photography. Additionally, the context mentions the use of annotated data, which implies that some form of labeling or annotation process was involved in preparing the data for the deep learning model. However, the exact methods used for collecting the raw data, such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets, are not specified.
