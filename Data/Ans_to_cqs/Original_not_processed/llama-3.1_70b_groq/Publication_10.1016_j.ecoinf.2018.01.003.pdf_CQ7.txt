Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The text discusses the development of neural networks, deep learning, and the comparison between BPNN and SVM models, but it does not provide information on data splitting criteria. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
