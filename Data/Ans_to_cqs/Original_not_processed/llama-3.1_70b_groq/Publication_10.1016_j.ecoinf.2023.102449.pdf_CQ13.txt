Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The text only discusses the architecture of the model, including the use of residual networks, convolutional layers, and a variational autoencoder. It also mentions the dimensionality of the latent vector (d = 128) and the number of frames in the time-series (T = 19), but does not provide information on the hyperparameters used for training the model.
