Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the database construction phase, training phase, classification phase, and validation phase, but it does not provide information on model deployment.

However, it does mention that the model parameters were configured by training the last two fully connected network layers in the dataset, and that the model was trained using Inception v.3 with data augmentation and transfer learning. It also mentions the use of RMSProp as an optimization algorithm.

But, it does not provide information on how the trained model was serialized, or which platform was selected for deployment. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this query.
