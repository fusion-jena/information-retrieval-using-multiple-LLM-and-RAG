Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Average Error (MAE), and the coefficient of determination (r2). These metrics are used to assess the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data accurately. Specifically, the grid search is focused on minimizing the MSE to identify the optimal set of hyperparameters.
