Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper or a document discussing the use of deep learning in various fields, including ecology and earth system science. The text mentions various studies and references, but it does not provide information about the code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
