The provided context does not explicitly mention a strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. It discusses the use of class weights to handle minority classes during training and the performance metrics used to evaluate the model's performance, such as accuracy, precision, and recall. However, it does not provide information on how the model's performance is monitored during the training process.
