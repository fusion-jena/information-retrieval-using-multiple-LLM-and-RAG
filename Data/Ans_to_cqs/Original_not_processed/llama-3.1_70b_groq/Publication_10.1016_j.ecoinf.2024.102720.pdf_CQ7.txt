Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be focused on the results of a study that used structural equation modeling (SEM) to analyze the drivers of per capita carbon emissions from food (CEF) and the validation of the model fit. It mentions various metrics used to evaluate the model fit, such as Ï‡2/df, GFI, RMSEA, RMR, CFI, NFI, TLI, and IFI, but does not provide information on data splitting criteria for deep learning model training.

However, it does mention the use of deep learning algorithms in some of the referenced studies, but it does not provide specific details on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
