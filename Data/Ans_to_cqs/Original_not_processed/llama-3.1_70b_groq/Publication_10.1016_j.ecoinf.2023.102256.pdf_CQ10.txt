Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions a link to supplementary data associated with the article (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2023.102256) and a link to the TensorFlow website (https://www.tensorflow.org/), but it does not provide a link to a specific code repository for the pipeline.
