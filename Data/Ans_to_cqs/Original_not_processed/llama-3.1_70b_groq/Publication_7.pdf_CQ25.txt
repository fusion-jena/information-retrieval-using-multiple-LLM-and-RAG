Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. The model is designed to automatically annotate marine images, specifically to classify coral and non-coral areas in images of coral reefs. The model uses a pre-trained VGGnet and fine-tunes it on the Benthoz15 dataset, which consists of expert-annotated and geo-referenced marine images from Australian seas. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify images and free up experts from the tedious task of manual annotation, enabling rapid and accurate processing of massive datasets.
