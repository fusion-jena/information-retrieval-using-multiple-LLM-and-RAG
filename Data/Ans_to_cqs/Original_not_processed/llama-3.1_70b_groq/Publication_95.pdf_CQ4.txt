Answer:::
The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Random horizontal flipping of the image.
2. Scaling the contrast of each image channel by a random factor between 0.8 and 1.2.
3. Randomly cropping the image to a square with side lengths equal to the image height.

These techniques are applied to the images during training before being processed by the network. There is no mention of rotating the images in the provided context.
