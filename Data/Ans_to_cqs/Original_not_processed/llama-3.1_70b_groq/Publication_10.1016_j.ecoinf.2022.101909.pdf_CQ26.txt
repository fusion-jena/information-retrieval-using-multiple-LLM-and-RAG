Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning techniques, specifically transfer learning and fine-tuning, for species identification through audio recordings. It also discusses the potential of these technologies in monitoring biodiversity and acoustic activity.

However, it does mention the use of dropout as a technique to reduce overfitting and imitate the training of a set of different models. But this is not directly related to addressing data bias.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. The context does not mention techniques such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection, which are commonly used to address data bias.
