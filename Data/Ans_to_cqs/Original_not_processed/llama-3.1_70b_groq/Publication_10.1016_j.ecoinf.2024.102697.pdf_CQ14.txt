Answer: The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using Bayesian Optimization. This is stated in the text: "Hyperparameter optimization was performed using Bayesian Optimization to minimize a 5 k-fold cross-validation loss during model development." This indicates that the model uses a Bayesian approach to search for the optimal hyperparameters, rather than a grid search or random search.
