Answer: The text mentions that the model was selected relative to the epoch that gave the best performance on the validation set to avoid any risk of overfitting at each training stage. Additionally, it mentions that the weight decay was set to 5 Ã— 10^(-2), which is a form of L2 regularization. There is no mention of dropout as a regularization method in the provided text.
