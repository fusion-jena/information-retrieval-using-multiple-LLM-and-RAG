Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention anything about training or validation loss plateau. The context appears to be related to soil science and ecology, with tables and data related to soil nitrogen, phosphorus, and other parameters.

Therefore, I must answer that I don't know the criteria used to determine when training is complete, as this information is not present in the provided context.
