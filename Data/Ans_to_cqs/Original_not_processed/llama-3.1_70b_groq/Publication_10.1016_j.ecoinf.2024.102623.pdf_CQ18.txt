Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context appears to be focused on the evaluation of different machine learning loss functions and their performance on various datasets, but it does not provide information on how the model performance is monitored during training.

However, it can be inferred that the performance is evaluated using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) metric, as shown in the tables provided. But the specific strategy or technique used to monitor the model performance during training, such as validation sets, early stopping, or learning rate schedules, is not mentioned.
