Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the references provided, it appears that the context is related to remote sensing, ecology, and agriculture. 

Some of the references mention the use of hyperspectral and multispectral imaging, airborne and UAV-based sensors, and satellite data (e.g., Sentinel-2) for collecting data. For example, the study by Bingtao et al. (2023) uses a hyperspectral UAV image for early detection of dendroctonus valens infestation, while the study by Binxiang et al. (2022) uses Sentinel-2 data for estimating chlorophyll content.

Additionally, some references mention the use of indices and models for estimating biophysical characteristics, such as green leaf area index, canopy chlorophyll density, and nitrogen status. However, it is not clear if these indices and models are used as a method for collecting raw data or if they are used for processing and analyzing the collected data.

Overall, based on the provided context, it appears that remote sensing data from various sources (e.g., airborne, UAV, satellite) are used for collecting raw data, but the specific methods and details are not explicitly mentioned.
