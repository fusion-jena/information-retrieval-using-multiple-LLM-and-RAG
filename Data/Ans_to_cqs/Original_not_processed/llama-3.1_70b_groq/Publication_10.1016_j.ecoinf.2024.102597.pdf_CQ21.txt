Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the model performance evaluation, hyperparameter optimization, and comparison of different machine learning models (RF, GBDT, LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost) for estimating chlorophyll-a concentration and turbidity in Nansi Lake using Sentinel-2 imagery.

The context does mention the use of GridSearchCV from Scikit-learn and the Hyperopt library for hyperparameter optimization, but it does not provide information on postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

Therefore, I do not know the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training in this context.
