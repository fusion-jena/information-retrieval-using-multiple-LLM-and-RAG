Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the limitations of general deep learning networks for underwater optical images, the architecture of the YOLOv8 network, and the modifications made to it, such as using dilated convolution and depthwise separable convolution. It also mentions the preprocessing steps and the backbone of the UODN model, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform.
