Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context appears to be a research paper on ecological informatics, and it includes various tables and references, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
