Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is for image classification, specifically for individual identification of snow leopards. The model is trained to classify images and match them to the correct individual snow leopard, with the goal of enhancing the precision and efficiency of manual observers in estimating the true abundance of snow leopards.
