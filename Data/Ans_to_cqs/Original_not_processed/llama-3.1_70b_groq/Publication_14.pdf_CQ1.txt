Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of time-lapse camera trap images (Price Tack et al., 2016) and arboreal camera trapping (Gregory et al., 2014) as methods for collecting data. Additionally, it mentions the use of motion detection to capture events, which suggests that sensors or camera traps may be used to collect raw data. However, the context does not provide a comprehensive list of methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
