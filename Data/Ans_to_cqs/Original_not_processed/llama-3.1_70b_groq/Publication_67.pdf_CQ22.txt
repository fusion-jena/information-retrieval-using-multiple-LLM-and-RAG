Answer: 

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the CNN-based models are precision, recall, and F1-measure. These metrics are used to assess the accuracy of the models in classifying images into different tree cover classes.

Precision is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives, representing the proportion of correctly classified images out of all images classified by the model. Recall is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives, representing the proportion of actual tree cover images that were correctly detected by the model. The F1-measure is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the models in terms of their ability to correctly classify images into different tree cover classes, such as Open Forest, Closed Forest, and Dense Forest. The F1-measure is particularly useful in evaluating the overall performance of the models, as it takes into account both precision and recall.
