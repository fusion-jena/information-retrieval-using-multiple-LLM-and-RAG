Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on comparing the performance of different machine learning models, including linear regression, elastic net, support vector machine, random forest, extreme gradient boosting, and light gradient boosting machine, for predicting canopy cover from planet data. It discusses the hyperparameters used for each model and their optimized values but does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this case.
