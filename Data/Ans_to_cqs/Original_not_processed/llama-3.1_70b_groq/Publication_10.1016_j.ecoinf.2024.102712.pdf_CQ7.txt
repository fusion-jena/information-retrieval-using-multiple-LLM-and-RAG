Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be related to remote sensing and forestry, discussing the use of GEDI and Sentinel-2 data, as well as model-assisted frameworks and hierarchical modeling. However, it does not provide information on the data splitting criteria for deep learning model training.

The only mention of a validation approach is the use of leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV), which is a resampling technique used to evaluate the performance of a model. However, this is not directly related to splitting the data into training, testing, and validation sets.

Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training based on the provided context.
