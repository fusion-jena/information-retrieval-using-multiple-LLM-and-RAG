Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a collection of research papers and data related to air quality prediction, pollution, and environmental studies. While some of the papers may discuss deep learning models, such as LSTM, they do not provide information on the specific regularization methods used.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) deep learning models in some of the papers. LSTM models are known to be prone to overfitting, and regularization methods such as dropout and L2 regularization are commonly used to prevent overfitting in these models. Nevertheless, without explicit mention of these methods in the context, it is impossible to confirm their use.

Therefore, I must conclude that I don't know the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
