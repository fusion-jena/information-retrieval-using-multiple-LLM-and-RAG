Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be focused on classification and regression training, accuracy assessment, and remote sensing applications, but it does not specifically discuss deep learning or regularization techniques.

However, I can suggest that the context does mention hyperparameter tuning, which is a common approach to prevent overfitting in machine learning models. The caret package in R, mentioned in the context, provides tools for hyperparameter tuning, but it does not explicitly mention regularization methods.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines.
