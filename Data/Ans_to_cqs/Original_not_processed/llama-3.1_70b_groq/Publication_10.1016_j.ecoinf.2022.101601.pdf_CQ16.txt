Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be related to the development and validation of a Bayesian network (BN) model, specifically the PermaBN model, and discusses the pre-validation and validation stages of the model development process. However, it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete.
