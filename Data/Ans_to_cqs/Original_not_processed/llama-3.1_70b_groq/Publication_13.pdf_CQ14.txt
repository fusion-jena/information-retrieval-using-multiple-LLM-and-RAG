Answer: 
The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It mentions that the training procedure optimizes the model parameters in the shared part of the network to minimize the loss of the label classifier and maximize the loss of the domain classifier, but it does not provide information on the specific method used for hyperparameter optimization, such as grid search or random search.
