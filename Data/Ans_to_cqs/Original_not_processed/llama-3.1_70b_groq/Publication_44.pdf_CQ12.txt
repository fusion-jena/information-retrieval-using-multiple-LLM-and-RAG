Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, the context mentions the use of a modified ResNet-101, VGG16, and Xception model as feature extractors. Additionally, the context describes the use of a fully convolutional neural network for semantic segmentation, which is a type of CNN. There is no mention of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers in the provided context.
