Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention any deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context appears to be related to forestry and ecological informatics, discussing topics such as continuous cover forestry, diversity indices, and estimators (e.g., NN3, NN4, inventory estimator). There is no mention of deep learning models or frameworks.
