Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the references provided, it can be inferred that remote sensing data from satellites, such as MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), Landsat, and other Earth observation satellites, are used as a source of data for vegetation studies.

Some of the references mention the use of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) time series data, which is a common remote sensing-derived dataset used for monitoring vegetation health and phenology. Other references mention the use of sensors, but the specific type of sensors is not specified.

There is no mention of surveys or public datasets as a source of raw data in the provided context. However, it is possible that these methods may be used in conjunction with remote sensing data to collect additional information, such as ground truth data for training and validation of machine learning models.

Overall, the primary method of collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, as inferred from the provided context, appears to be through remote sensing data from satellites.
