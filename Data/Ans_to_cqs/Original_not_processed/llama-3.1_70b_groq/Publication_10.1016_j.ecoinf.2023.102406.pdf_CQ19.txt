I don't know. The provided context does not mention deep learning models or frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, biodiversity, and statistical modeling, with references to random forests and econometrics. There is no mention of deep learning or specific frameworks used to build such models.
