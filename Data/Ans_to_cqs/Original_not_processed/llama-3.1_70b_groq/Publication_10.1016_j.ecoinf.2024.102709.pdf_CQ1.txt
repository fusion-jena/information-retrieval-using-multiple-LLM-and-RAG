Answer:::

According to the provided context, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Ground-based systems: Specifically, two major systems are mentioned - stationary Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) and mobile Laser Scanning (MLS), including Photogrammetric Laser Scanning (PLS).
2. Public datasets: The modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset of handwritten digits is mentioned as a source of data for training classification models.

It is also mentioned that the dataset used in the study includes single-tree point clouds, images of single-trees, and other data, but it is not clear how this data was collected. However, it is mentioned that the data is freely available under a specific DOI, suggesting that it may have been collected and shared by the researchers themselves.

It is worth noting that surveys are not mentioned as a method for collecting raw data in the provided context.
