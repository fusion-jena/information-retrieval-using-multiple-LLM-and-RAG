Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The text describes the training and prediction flow, including the use of a training dataset, prediction, and calculation of prediction error, but it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine the completion of training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
