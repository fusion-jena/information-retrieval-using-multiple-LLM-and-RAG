Answer:::
The provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of a deep learning model, including the use of convolutional layers, pooling, Local Response Normalization (LRN), and dropout. It also mentions various deep learning models such as LeNet, AlexNet, GoogLeNet, VGG, and ResNet, but does not discuss data preprocessing techniques.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. However, I can suggest that common techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, as mentioned in the query. These techniques can help to ensure that the training data is representative of the population and reduce the risk of biased models.
