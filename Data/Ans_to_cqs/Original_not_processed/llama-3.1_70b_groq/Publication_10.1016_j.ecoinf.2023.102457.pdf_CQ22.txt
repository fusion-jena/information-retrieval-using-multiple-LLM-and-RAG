Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models in this study are accuracy and Normalized Mutual Information (NMI). Accuracy is used to evaluate the performance of supervised classification, while NMI is used to evaluate the performance of unsupervised classification (specifically, affinity propagation clustering and HDBSCAN). The study reports the mean and 95% confidence intervals of these metrics over 20 random iterations for each of the five feature types as a function of distance.
