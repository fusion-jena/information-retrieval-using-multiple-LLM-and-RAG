Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of random iterations in the context of cross-validation for supervised classification.

Specifically, it is mentioned that the data was randomly divided into an 80/20 split of training and test sets over 20 iterations of cross-validation. This suggests that randomness is introduced in the data splitting process, but it does not provide information on how this randomness is controlled or whether a random seed value is set.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know what strategies are employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value.
