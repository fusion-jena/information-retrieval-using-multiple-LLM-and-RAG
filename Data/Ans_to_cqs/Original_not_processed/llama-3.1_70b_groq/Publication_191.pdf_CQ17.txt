Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text primarily discusses the limitations of existing plant datasets, the analysis of filter responses in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and the performance of various feature extraction and classification methods. It does not provide information on the specific regularization techniques used, such as dropout or L2 regularization.
