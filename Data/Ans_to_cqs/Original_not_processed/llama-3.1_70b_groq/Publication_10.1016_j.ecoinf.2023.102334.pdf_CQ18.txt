Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model's performance is evaluated based on its loss rate and accuracy. The context mentions that the proposed model is distinguished by a low loss rate and high accuracy, and that the training results are illustrated in Fig. 11, which suggests that the model's performance is monitored and evaluated during training. Additionally, the context mentions that the model's stability is assessed based on the smoothness of its curves and small fluctuations during training and testing. However, the specific strategy or metrics used to monitor the model's performance during training are not clearly stated.
