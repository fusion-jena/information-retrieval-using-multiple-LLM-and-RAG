Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to ecological and environmental studies, and it discusses various statistical and machine learning techniques such as Maximum Entropy, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and Generalized Linear Models, but it does not provide information on data preprocessing techniques for deep learning pipelines.

However, I can provide some general information on the techniques you mentioned. Stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling are indeed techniques used to address data bias and imbalance in machine learning datasets. Stratified splitting involves splitting the data into training and testing sets while maintaining the same proportion of classes in each set. Oversampling involves creating additional instances of the minority class to balance the dataset, while undersampling involves reducing the number of instances of the majority class.

Diverse data collection is also an important technique for reducing data bias, as it involves collecting data from a wide range of sources and ensuring that the data is representative of the population of interest.

It's worth noting that the context mentions XGBOOST, which is an extreme gradient boosting library, but it does not provide information on how to use it to address data bias.

In summary, while the provided context does not provide specific information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, I can provide some general information on the techniques you mentioned.
