Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the methodology used for hierarchical mapping of Brazilian Savanna (Cerrado) physiognomies based on deep learning techniques, including data augmentation, semantic segmentation, and classification. It does not provide information on model deployment, such as model serialization or platform selection.
