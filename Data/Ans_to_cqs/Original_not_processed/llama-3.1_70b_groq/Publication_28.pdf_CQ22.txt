Answer: 

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are precision, recall, F1-score, and F2-score. These metrics are used to assess the model's performance on both the UCM dataset and the AID dataset. 

Precision refers to the proportion of true positives among all predicted positive instances. Recall, on the other hand, refers to the proportion of true positives among all actual positive instances. F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of both. F2-score is also used, which gives more weight to recall than precision.

The experimental results show that the PTDLEN-VAE model has achieved high precision, recall, F1-score, and F2-score on both datasets, outperforming other techniques. For example, on the UCM dataset, the PTDLEN-VAE model has achieved a maximum average precision of 96%, a maximal average recall of 95.35%, and a maximum average F1-score of 95.75%. Similarly, on the AID dataset, the PTDLEN-VAE model has achieved an enhanced average precision of 95.90%, a maximal average recall of 95.23%, and a maximum average F1-score of 95.75%.
