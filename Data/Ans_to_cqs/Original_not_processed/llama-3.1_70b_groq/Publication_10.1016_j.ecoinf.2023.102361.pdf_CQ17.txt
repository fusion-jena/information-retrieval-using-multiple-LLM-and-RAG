Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the datasets, deep learning models (VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet-50), and the experimental setup, but it does not provide information on regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
