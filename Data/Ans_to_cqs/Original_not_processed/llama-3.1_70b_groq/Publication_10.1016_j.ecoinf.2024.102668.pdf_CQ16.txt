Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about training, validation loss, or criteria for determining when training is complete. The context appears to be related to acoustic data analysis, coherence measures, and comparisons between different audio recorders. There is no mention of machine learning or training processes, which are typically associated with the concept of validation loss plateau. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
