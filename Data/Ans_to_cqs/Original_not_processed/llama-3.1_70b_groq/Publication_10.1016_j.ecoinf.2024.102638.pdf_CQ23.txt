Answer:::

To ensure the generalizability of the models, several measures were taken. Firstly, the dataset was divided into training sets (80% of the data) and a test set (20% of the data) through random sampling. This division was done to maximize model training while maintaining a sufficient amount of data for robust model validation. Randomization helped to preserve the distribution of key features and target variables across both training and test sets, enhancing the generalizability of the model.

Additionally, a five-fold cross-validation was used during the hyperparameter optimization process. This involved using the GridSearchCV function from scikit-learn to fine-tune the hyperparameters of each model within the confines of the training set. The negative mean square error was set as the target measure. This process helped to evaluate the performance of the models on unseen data and reduce the risk of overfitting.

It is worth noting that the text does not specifically mention the use of a diverse dataset or stratified splitting as measures to ensure generalizability. However, the use of random sampling and five-fold cross-validation suggests that efforts were made to ensure that the models were trained and evaluated on representative subsets of the data.
