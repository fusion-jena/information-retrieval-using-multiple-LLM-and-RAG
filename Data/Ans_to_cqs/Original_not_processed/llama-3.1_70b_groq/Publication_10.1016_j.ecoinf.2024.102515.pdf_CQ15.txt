Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be focused on a study that uses Twitter API to collect and filter tweets related to biodiversity observations, and does not discuss deep learning or optimization techniques. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
