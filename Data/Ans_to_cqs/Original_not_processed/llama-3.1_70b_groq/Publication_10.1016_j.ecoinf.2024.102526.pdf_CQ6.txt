Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to image metadata and documentation for an imaging project, rather than deep learning model training.

However, I can provide some general information on common preprocessing steps involved in training deep learning models. These steps may include:

* Normalization: scaling numeric data to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model.
* Scaling: transforming data to have zero mean and unit variance, which can improve model performance.
* Cleaning: handling missing or erroneous data, such as removing or imputing missing values.
* Data augmentation: artificially increasing the size of the training dataset by applying transformations to the existing data, such as rotation, flipping, or cropping.

Please note that these steps are general and may not be specific to the context provided. If you have any further information or clarification on the context, I may be able to provide a more accurate answer.
