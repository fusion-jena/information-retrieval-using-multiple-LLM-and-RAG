Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model performance is monitored through the backpropagation of the loss value. The loss value is calculated using the equation λm‖Φm(β) (cid:0) Φm(g(x; θ) ) ‖1, and the weight λm is updated after 10 training iterations based on the relative value of the loss. This suggests that the model performance is monitored through the loss value, and the weight λm is adjusted accordingly to optimize the model's performance. However, the specific metrics or strategies used to monitor the model's performance during training are not mentioned in the provided context.
