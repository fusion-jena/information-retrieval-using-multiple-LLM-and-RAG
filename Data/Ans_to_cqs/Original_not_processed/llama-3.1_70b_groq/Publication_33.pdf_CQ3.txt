Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification and the application of deep learning algorithms for object detection and recognition in underwater images (e.g., fish detection and recognition) and plant species identification.

It can be inferred that the data annotation techniques used might include image classification labels, as the context mentions the classification of images into different species classes. Additionally, the context mentions the use of bounding boxes in the context of object detection, specifically in the paper "Fast accurate fish detection and recognition of underwater images with fast r-cnn" (Li et al., 2015).

However, without more specific information, it is difficult to determine the exact data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context does not provide explicit details on the annotation techniques used, such as instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, or keypoint annotation.
