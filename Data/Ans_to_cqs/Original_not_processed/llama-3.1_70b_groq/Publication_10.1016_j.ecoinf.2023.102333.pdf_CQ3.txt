Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to focus on hyperparameter optimization, model architecture, and remote sensing applications, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions the use of Google Earth Engine, which is a cloud-based platform for remote sensing data analysis. Google Earth Engine provides various tools and techniques for data annotation, such as visual inspection and labeling of satellite imagery. Nevertheless, the specific annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I don't know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, as this information is not provided in the context.
