Answer:::
The provided context does not specifically mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the different engines supported by ibis.iSDM for inferring or projecting the relative habitat suitability of biodiversity features, including various regression and machine learning approaches. It mentions specific packages and techniques, such as glmnet, BoomSpikeSlab, dbarts, mboost, and xgboost, but does not delve into the optimization techniques used within these packages. Therefore, I do not know the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
