Answer: 
The text does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the framework integrates IoT-based real-time data collection, including temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and nitrate concentration. This suggests that the data is likely in a numerical or sensor reading format, possibly in a CSV (Comma Separated Values) or similar format. There is no indication of image, audio, or video data being used in the pipeline.
