Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a research paper or report on habitat mapping and classification, and it discusses various datasets, maps, and classification methods. However, it does not mention a specific code repository or deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I am unable to provide a link to a code repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
