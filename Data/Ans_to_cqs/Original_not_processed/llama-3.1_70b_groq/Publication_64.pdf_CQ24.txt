Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value or strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of random ten-crop testing, which is a technique used to evaluate the model's performance on different crops of the same image. This technique can help to reduce the effect of randomness in the evaluation process.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of standard data augmentation techniques such as shear, translation, and mirroring during training. These techniques can help to introduce randomness in the training data and prevent the model from overfitting to a specific orientation or position of the images.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of the Adam optimization algorithm, which is a stochastic optimization algorithm that uses random gradients to update the model's weights. However, the context does not provide information on how the randomness in the Adam algorithm is handled.

Overall, while the context provides some information on how randomness is handled in the evaluation and training processes, it does not provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
