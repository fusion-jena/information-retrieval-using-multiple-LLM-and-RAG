Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a trained deep learning model, nor does it discuss model serialization or platform selection. The context appears to be focused on ecological research, specifically on identifying ecosystem service bundles, ecological corridors, and sources using techniques such as PCA, circuit theory, and hotspot analysis. There is no mention of deep learning models or their deployment.
