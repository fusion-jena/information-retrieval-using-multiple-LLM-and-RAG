Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does provide a DOI (https://doi.org/10.5068/D16M4N) for the data from the paper "Sashimi: A toolkit for facilitating high-throughput organismal image segmentation using deep learning" by Schwartz and Alfaro. This suggests that the data may be available through a repository that supports DOIs, but the specific repository is not mentioned.
