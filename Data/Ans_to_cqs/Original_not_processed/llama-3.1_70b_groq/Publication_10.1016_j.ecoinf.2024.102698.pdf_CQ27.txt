Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the development of synthetic data using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Variational Autoencoder (VAE) models, as well as the use of these models for generating coral cover and connectivity data. It does not provide information on model deployment, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
