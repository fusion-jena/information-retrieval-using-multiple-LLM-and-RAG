Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning techniques in ecology and evolution, particularly in bird species identification and acoustic phenology. It discusses the potential of deep learning for analyzing large datasets and monitoring biodiversity, but it does not delve into the technical details of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
