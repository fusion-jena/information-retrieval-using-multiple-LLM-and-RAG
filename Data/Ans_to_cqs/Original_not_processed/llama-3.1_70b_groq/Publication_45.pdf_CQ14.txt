Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly state how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the hyper-parameters evaluated iteratively were network capacity (number of layers and neurons per layer), applied regularization techniques, as well as the used loss function and optimizer. However, it does not provide information on the specific optimization method used, such as grid search or random search.
