Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The text explains the general process of training a deep learning (DL) network, including the use of annotated data and the evaluation of the network on an independent testing data set. However, it does not provide specific details on the stopping criteria used to determine when the training process is complete.

The text does mention the importance of avoiding data leakage, which can compromise the estimation of the network's generalization power. However, this is related to the testing process rather than the training process.

Therefore, I do not know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau, as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
