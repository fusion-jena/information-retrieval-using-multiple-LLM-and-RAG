Answer:::

To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, the provided context mentions the use of data augmentation as a strategy. Specifically, it states that "to avoid the distinction of identical textures only differing from each other by orientation changes and to increase the amount of tree species samples for training of the deep learning network, we performed data augmentation on the tree samples." The data augmentation techniques employed include rotating, mirroring, and flipping the tree samples randomly. This approach helps to increase the size of the training dataset and reduces the impact of randomness in the model's performance.

However, the context does not mention the use of a specific random seed value to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. It is possible that the authors used a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility of the results, but this information is not provided in the given context.

Therefore, while data augmentation is employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, the specific strategy used to handle random seed values is not mentioned in the provided context.
