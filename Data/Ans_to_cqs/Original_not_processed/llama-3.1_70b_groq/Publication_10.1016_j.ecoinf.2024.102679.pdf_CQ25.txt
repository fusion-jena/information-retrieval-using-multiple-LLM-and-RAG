Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is to detect animals in aerial imagery. According to the text, deep learning (DL) is used to achieve challenging tasks such as detecting animals in aerial imagery through a complex multi-level representation of information learned from large amounts of data. The model is specifically designed to automate the detection and counting of wildlife populations in aerial surveys, which is a crucial task for wildlife conservation and biodiversity monitoring.
