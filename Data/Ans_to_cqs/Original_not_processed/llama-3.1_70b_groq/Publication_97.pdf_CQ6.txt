Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of batch normalization, which is a technique used to normalize the input data for each layer in a neural network. 

Batch normalization is mentioned as being applied after each convolutional layer, which suggests that it is being used to normalize the input data for each layer. However, it does not provide information on other preprocessing steps such as scaling, cleaning, or data normalization before feeding the data into the model.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of dropout, which is a regularization technique used to prevent overfitting in neural networks. However, dropout is not a preprocessing step, but rather a technique used during training.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the only preprocessing step that can be confirmed is the use of batch normalization after each convolutional layer. However, it is likely that other preprocessing steps were involved, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.
