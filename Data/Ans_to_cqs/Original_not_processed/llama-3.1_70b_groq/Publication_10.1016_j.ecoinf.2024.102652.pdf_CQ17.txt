Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context only discusses the training process, including data normalization and standardization, batch size, optimizer (Adam), learning ratio, epochs, and loss function (cross-entropy loss function). It does not provide information on regularization techniques used to prevent overfitting. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
