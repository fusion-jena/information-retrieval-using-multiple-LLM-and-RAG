Answer:::
I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be focused on machine learning models, specifically grid search ML models and hyperparameter tuning, but it does not discuss deep learning or data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
