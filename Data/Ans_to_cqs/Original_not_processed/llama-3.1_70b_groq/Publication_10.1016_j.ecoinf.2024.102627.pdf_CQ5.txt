Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on a species assemblage model, which is a type of ecological model, and mentions the use of environmental context data, including WorldClim2 bioclimatic variables, Soilgrids pedological variables, and human footprint rasters. However, it does not provide information on the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
