Answer:

According to the provided context, the data augmentation techniques applied in the DeepLabV3+ model training process are:

1. Flipping the images and labels along the X or Y axis.
2. Exchanging between multiple image channels while the labels remain unchanged.
3. Randomly rotating the images and labels by 90Â°.
4. Randomly adding noise to the images while maintaining the labels unchanged.

These techniques are used to enhance the training set and increase the sample size, which helps to improve the model's performance and robustness.
