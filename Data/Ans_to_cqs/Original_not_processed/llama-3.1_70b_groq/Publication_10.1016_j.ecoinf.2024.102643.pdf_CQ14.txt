Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses the use of an ensemble model that combines the predictions of ten different algorithms, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process.

However, it does mention that the biomod2 package is used to implement the ensemble model, which suggests that the package's built-in functionality for hyperparameter tuning may have been used. But without further information, it is impossible to determine the specific method used for hyperparameter optimization (e.g., grid search, random search).

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the provided context does not contain enough information to determine how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.
