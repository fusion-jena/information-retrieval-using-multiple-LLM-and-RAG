Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. It mentions various sources such as GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility), but it is used as a data source for occurrence records of denitrifiers, not as a repository for a deep learning pipeline. The context also mentions various research papers and software packages, but it does not provide a link to a specific data repository for a deep learning pipeline.
