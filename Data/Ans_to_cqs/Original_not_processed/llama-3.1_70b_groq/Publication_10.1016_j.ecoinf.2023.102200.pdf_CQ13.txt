Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate and optimizer. The context appears to be related to a study on using LiDAR data for tree segmentation and classification, and it discusses various aspects of the study, including the LiDAR scanner model, data processing, and segmentation results. However, it does not provide information on the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
