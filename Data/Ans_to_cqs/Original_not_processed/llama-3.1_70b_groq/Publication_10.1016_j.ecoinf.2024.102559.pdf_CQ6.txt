Answer: The provided context does not specifically mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention the steps involved in creating a training dataset for a machine learning model. According to the text, the steps involved are:

* Creating a training set for a minority class in the landscape
* Sampling designs such as random sampling or allocating samples in proportion to expected class areas
* Generating training and test data
* Creating a reasonably balanced final training dataset

Additionally, the text mentions that the high spatial resolution of NAIP and the expanse of the study region allowed for the creation of a reasonably balanced final training dataset without having to discard, repeat, or create synthetic data points.

It's worth noting that the context provided is specific to a particular study and may not be generalizable to all deep learning models or preprocessing steps. However, the steps mentioned above provide some insight into the preprocessing steps that may be involved in creating a training dataset for a machine learning model.
