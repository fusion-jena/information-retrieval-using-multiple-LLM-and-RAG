Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention preprocessing steps for training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to metadata templates for environmental field measurements, specifically for organizing and documenting data collection and processing. It discusses the importance of transparent processing approaches, data originator QA/QC, and project-level QA/QC, but does not provide information on preprocessing steps for deep learning models.
