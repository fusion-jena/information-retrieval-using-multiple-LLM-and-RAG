Answer:::

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, specifically the Faster R-CNN, are as follows:

- Optimizer: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
- Momentum value: 0.9
- Initial learning rate: 0.001
- Learning rate decrease: to 0.0004 after 40 K steps

These hyperparameters were carefully chosen to achieve accurate identification of pests using the Faster R-CNN model.
