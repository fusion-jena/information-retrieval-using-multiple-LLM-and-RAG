Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. It mentions the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and other machine learning models, but it does not provide information on the frameworks used to implement these models. The context does mention the use of the y-data-synthetic Python package and the Synthetic Data Vault python package, but it does not provide information on the underlying frameworks used by these packages. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
