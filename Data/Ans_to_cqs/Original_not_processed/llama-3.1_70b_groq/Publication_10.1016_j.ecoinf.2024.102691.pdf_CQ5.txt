Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the architecture and training of a depth-attention YOLOv5 model, but it does not provide information about the datasets used for training or testing.

However, the context does mention a "prior synthetic dataset" in the reference [Jie, Z., Jin, L., Xinyan, Q., Bo, L., Zhaojun, L., Huidong, L., Yujie, Z., Jie, S., 2021], but it does not provide further details about the dataset.

Additionally, the context mentions several references to papers related to fruit detection and yield estimation, which suggests that the model may be applied to datasets related to agricultural or fruit detection tasks. However, without more information, it is not possible to determine the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
