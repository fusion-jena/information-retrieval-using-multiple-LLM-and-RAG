Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about the hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a research article on species distribution modeling using machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest and Generalized Linear Models, but it does not provide information on the specific hardware resources used for training a deep learning model.
