Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. However, it does mention that "well-known values of hyperparameters" were used to train the models. This suggests that the authors may have used commonly accepted or default values for the hyperparameters, but the exact values are not specified.
