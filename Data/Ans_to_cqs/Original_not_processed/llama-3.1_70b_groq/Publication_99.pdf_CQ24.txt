Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of various data augmentation techniques, such as height and width shift, flipping, zooming, and brightness changes, which can help reduce overfitting and improve the robustness of the models.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of dropout layers with a dropout ratio of 0.5 as a network regularizer, which can also help reduce overfitting and improve the generalization of the models.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of Adam optimizer, which is a stochastic optimization algorithm that can help reduce the impact of randomness in the training process.

However, the context does not provide information on whether a random seed value is set to ensure reproducibility of the results. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query based on the provided context.
