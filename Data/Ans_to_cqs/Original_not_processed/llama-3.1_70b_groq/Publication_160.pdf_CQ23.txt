Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the model was trained and evaluated on validation and test sets, which suggests that some form of data splitting was used.

Additionally, the context mentions that the patch size of 224 Ã— 224 pixels included enough contextual noise to regularize overfitting, which implies that the model was able to generalize better with this patch size. It also mentions that the ensemble network, which was based on the four tested patch sizes, improved classification performance, which could be an indication of increased generalizability.

However, without more information, it is difficult to say what specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model. It is also worth noting that the context does not mention anything about the dataset itself, such as its size, diversity, or how it was collected, which could also impact the generalizability of the model.
