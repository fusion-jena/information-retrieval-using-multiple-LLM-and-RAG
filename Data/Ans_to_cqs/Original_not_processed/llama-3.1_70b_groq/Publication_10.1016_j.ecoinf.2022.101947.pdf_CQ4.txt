Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a database and identification algorithm, with various codes and labels (e.g., V65-V96, L 14-15, A 01&05-A09&13), but it does not provide any information on data augmentation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
