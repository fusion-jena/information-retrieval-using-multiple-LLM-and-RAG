Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context appears to be focused on evaluating the performance of different models (DCT-PLS, ESTARFM, and SOWCEM) using metrics such as R2, MAE, RMSE, and ERGAS, but it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
