Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the optimization of feature extraction parameters and the performance evaluation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning model.

However, it does mention the use of stratified 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance, which is a technique used to reduce the impact of randomness in the data. Cross-validation helps to ensure that the model's performance is evaluated on unseen data, reducing the effect of overfitting and providing a more robust estimate of the model's performance.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a fixed batch size (32) and number of epochs (10) during training, which may help to reduce the impact of randomness in the training process. However, it does not provide information on whether a random seed value is set to ensure reproducibility of the results.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly mention strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does employ techniques such as cross-validation and fixed batch sizes to reduce the impact of randomness.
