Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the network, feature extraction, and classification results, but does not provide information on the optimization techniques employed. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
