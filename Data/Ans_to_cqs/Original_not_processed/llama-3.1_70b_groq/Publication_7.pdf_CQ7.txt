Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. It only mentions that a subset of the Benthoz15 dataset, specifically the Western Australia (WA) subset, was used to train the classifier. The context does provide some statistics about the WA subset, such as the number of images (4,750) and expert-annotated points (237,500), but it does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to split the data into three sets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to evaluate the model's performance during training and adjust hyperparameters, and the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance after training is complete. The exact criteria for splitting the data can vary depending on the specific problem and dataset, but common practices include random splitting, stratified splitting, and k-fold cross-validation.
