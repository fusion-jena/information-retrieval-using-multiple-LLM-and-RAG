Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, machine learning, and species distribution modeling, but it does not specifically discuss deep learning or regularization methods. Therefore, I cannot provide a relevant answer to the query based on the provided context.
