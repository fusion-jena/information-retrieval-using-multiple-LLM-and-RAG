Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, it does mention the use of a random forest model, which is a type of machine learning algorithm. In the context of random forests, hyperparameter optimization is often performed using techniques such as grid search or random search.

The context does mention that the authors "chose the optimal cut-off thresholds (in the case of identical F-scores, we used the mean of the thresholds)" which suggests that some form of hyperparameter tuning was performed, but the specific method used is not specified.

Therefore, I can only speculate that the authors may have used a grid search or random search to optimize the hyperparameters of the model, but I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer.
