Answer:::
I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a collection of references and citations related to machine learning, computer vision, and artificial intelligence, but it does not provide information about a specific data repository link. Therefore, I am unable to provide a link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other data repository.
