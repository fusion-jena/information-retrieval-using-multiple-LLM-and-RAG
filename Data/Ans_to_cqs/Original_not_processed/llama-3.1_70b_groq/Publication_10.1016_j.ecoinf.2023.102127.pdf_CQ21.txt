Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. However, it does mention that after specifying an engine and training the model, the resulting fit can be "visually interrogated, summarized and validated" (Fig. 1). This suggests that some form of evaluation or validation is possible, but the exact methods or metrics used are not specified.
