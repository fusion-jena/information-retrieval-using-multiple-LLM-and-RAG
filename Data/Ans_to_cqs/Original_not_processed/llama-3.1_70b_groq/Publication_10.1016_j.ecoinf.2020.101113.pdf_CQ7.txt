Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. It mentions that the training data consisted primarily of recordings targeting single foreground species, and a smaller validation set of annotated soundscapes was used. However, it does not provide information on how the data was split into training, test, and validation sets.

It does mention that the validation soundscape data was used in training and that adding background noise from the validation soundscapes to training samples significantly improved performance on the test soundscapes. This suggests that the validation set was used to fine-tune the model, but the exact criteria for splitting the data is not specified.

Therefore, I do not know the exact criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training in this specific study.
