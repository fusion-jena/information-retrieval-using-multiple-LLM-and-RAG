Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing, ecology, and forestry, with a emphasis on the application of machine learning and deep learning techniques to various problems in these fields.

However, it can be inferred that some form of preprocessing is likely necessary before training a deep learning model. For example, the context mentions the use of LiDAR, hyperspectral, and high-resolution RGB data, which may require preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning to prepare the data for training a model.

Additionally, some studies mentioned in the context, such as Marrs and Ni-Meister (2019) and Qin et al. (2022), may have involved preprocessing steps as part of their methodology, but these steps are not explicitly described in the provided context.

Therefore, while it is likely that some form of preprocessing is involved before training a deep learning model, the specific steps involved are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
