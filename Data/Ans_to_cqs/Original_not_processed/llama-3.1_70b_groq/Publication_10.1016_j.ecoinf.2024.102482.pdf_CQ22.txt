Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score. 

Accuracy is defined as the ratio of the sum of true positives (TP) and true negatives (TN) to the sum of TP, TN, false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN). 

Recall is defined as the ratio of TP to the sum of TP and FN. 

Precision is defined as the ratio of TP to the sum of TP and FP. 

F1 score is defined as the harmonic mean of precision and recall, calculated as 2TP / (2TP + FP + FN). 

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the model in detecting water pollution, where false negatives (FN) can lead to irreparable damage, making recall, precision, and F1 score important metrics to consider.
