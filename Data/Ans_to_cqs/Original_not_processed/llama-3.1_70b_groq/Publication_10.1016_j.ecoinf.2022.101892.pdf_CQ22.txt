Answer: 

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this study are Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Cumulative Score (CS). 

The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is defined as the average of the absolute differences between the predicted age and the true age of the pandas. It is calculated as 1/N * ∑|yi - ̂yi|, where N is the number of images, yi is the true age of panda xi, and ̂yi is the predicted age.

The Cumulative Score (CS) is defined as the percentage of images for which the absolute difference between the predicted age and the true age is less than a certain threshold (set to 3 years in this study). It is calculated as NI/N * 100%, where NI is the number of images for which |̂yi - yi| < I, and I is the threshold distance in years.

Accuracy (i.e., the true positive rate of classifying pandas' ages correctly) is not used as a metric in this study because it is not considered effective for age estimation tasks.
