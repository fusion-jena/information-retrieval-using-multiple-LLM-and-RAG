Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, time series analysis, and statistical modeling, but it does not specifically discuss deep learning models or their evaluation metrics.

However, I can provide some general information on common metrics used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models, including deep learning models. These metrics typically include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, mean squared error, and mean absolute error, among others. But without more specific information, I cannot provide a more detailed answer.

Therefore, my answer is that I don't know the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this context, as it is not mentioned in the provided text.
