Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to focus on the application of deep learning in image processing, particularly in extracting ecological information from camera trap images. It mentions various research papers and studies, but does not provide information on the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
