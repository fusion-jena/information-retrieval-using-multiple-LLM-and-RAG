Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the mentioned research papers and topics, we can make some educated guesses.

The context mentions the use of deep learning frameworks such as Theano, Torch, Caffe, TensorFlow, and deeplearning4j, which are commonly used for various types of data, including images, audio, and video.

One of the research papers, "Cormorant audiograms under water and in air," suggests that audio data might be used in the pipeline, as it deals with the analysis of bird calls.

Another paper, "Detection and discrimination of natural calls in masking noise by birds," also implies the use of audio data.

However, without more specific information, it is difficult to determine the exact data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. It is possible that the pipeline uses a combination of data formats, including CSV for metadata or annotations, and audio or image data for the actual inputs.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that we don't know the exact data formats used in the deep learning pipeline, but it is likely that audio data is used, and possibly other formats such as CSV or images.
