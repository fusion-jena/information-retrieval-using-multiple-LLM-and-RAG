Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily discusses the performance of models trained with different annotation sets, including expert and novice annotations, and the comparison of their performance using metrics such as AUC and mAP. It also mentions the use of a Kruskal-Wallis test to evaluate the null hypothesis, but this is related to the comparison of model performances, not the monitoring of model performance during training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
