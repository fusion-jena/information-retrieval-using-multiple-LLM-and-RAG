Answer:::
The purpose of the MTMI-SMF model is classification. Specifically, it is designed for hyperspectral target detection, where the goal is to classify pixels or groups of pixels as either containing an invader species or not. The model is formulated to work with imperfect data, where training locations may have locational errors or not ideally match with image pixels. The model groups pixels surrounding a training location that could have an invader and assigns confidence values, which can be thresholded to produce a classification result. This is in contrast to other machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest, which require a single pixel to represent a training location.
