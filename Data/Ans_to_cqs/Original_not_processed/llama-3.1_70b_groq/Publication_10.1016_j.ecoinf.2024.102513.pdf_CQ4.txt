Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of a convolutional neural network, the pooling layer, and the use of attention mechanisms and transfer learning for handling sparse historical data.

However, it does mention that the pooling layer, specifically max pooling, helps reduce the number of parameters and computations, enhances invariance to small shifts and scale changes, and improves the model's generalization ability. This can be seen as a form of implicit data augmentation, as it helps the model become more robust to variations in the input data.

But, it does not explicitly mention any specific data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query.

If you're looking for information on data augmentation techniques, I can tell you that common techniques include:

* Flipping (horizontal and vertical)
* Rotating (by a certain angle)
* Scaling (up or down)
* Color jittering (changing brightness, contrast, saturation)
* Random cropping
* and many others...

But, these are not mentioned in the provided context.
