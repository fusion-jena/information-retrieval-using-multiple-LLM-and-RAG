Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate and optimizer. The context primarily focuses on the importance of reducing memory access to improve model performance, the impact of model depth and width on accuracy and computational resources, and the evaluation of model performance on specific hardware. It also mentions the use of various models, including LigObNet, YOLOv5, YOLOv6, YOLOv7, and YOLOv8, but does not provide information on the hyperparameters used in these models.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
