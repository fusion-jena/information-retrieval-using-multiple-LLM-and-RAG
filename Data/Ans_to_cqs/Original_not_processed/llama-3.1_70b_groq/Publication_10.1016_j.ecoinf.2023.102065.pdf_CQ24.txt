Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention that the authors "randomly sampled" ROIs (Regions of Interest) to form training, validation, and test sets. This suggests that randomness is introduced in the data sampling process, but the context does not provide information on how this randomness is controlled or managed.

In the section 2.5, it is mentioned that "We randomly sampled 50 ROIs per species with 'presence' to form a held-out test set for accuracy assessment." and "We randomly sampled 100 of these ROIs per species to form a validation set...". This indicates that randomness is used to split the data into different sets, but it does not provide information on how the randomness is controlled or if a random seed value is set.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
