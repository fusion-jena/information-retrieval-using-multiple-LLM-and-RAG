Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that the process is repeated until convergence (no change) or a stopping point is reached. Additionally, it mentions that the final ten steps were used to check for stability with the number of clusters chosen for each taxon, and a stable outcome would have the same number of clusters for all ten final steps. This suggests that the training process may be considered complete when the model has converged or reached a stable state, but the specific criteria used to determine this are not specified.
