Answer:::

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows:

* Learning rate: 0.001
* Optimizer: Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014)
* Number of epochs: 50
* Batch size: Not specified
* Dropout rate: 0.4
* Number of filters in convolutional layers: 32
* Kernel size of convolutional layers: 4 Ã— 4
* Activation function: ReLU
* Number of units in fully connected layer: 64
* Softmax function units: 2 (for CNN1), 3 or 4 (for CNN2 depending on the number of species)

These hyperparameters were used for the customised CNN model. The pre-trained ResNet152V2 architecture was also used, but its hyperparameters are not specified in the provided text.
