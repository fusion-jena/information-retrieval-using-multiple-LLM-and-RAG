Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It mentions various funding sources and projects, such as TRIVIAL, CORTEX, and NL4DISMIS, but does not provide information on where the data is stored or shared. Additionally, it lists several references and authors, but does not include a link to a data repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
