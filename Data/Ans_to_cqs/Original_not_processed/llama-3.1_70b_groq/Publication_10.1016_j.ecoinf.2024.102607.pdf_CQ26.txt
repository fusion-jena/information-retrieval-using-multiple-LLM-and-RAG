Answer:

According to the provided context, several techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing, specifically in the context of land use and land cover (LULC) mapping. These techniques include:

1. Major category undersampling (Freeman et al., 2012): This involves reducing the number of samples from the majority class to balance the dataset.
2. Minor category oversampling (Rayhan et al., 2017): This involves increasing the number of samples from the minority class to balance the dataset.
3. Combinations of oversampling and undersampling (Naboureh et al., 2020): This involves using a combination of both oversampling and undersampling techniques to balance the dataset.
4. Hexagonal random-sampling strategy (Zhang et al., 2020): This involves using a hexagonal sampling strategy to improve the accuracy of LULC mapping.

Additionally, the context mentions that larger sample sizes can improve classification accuracy, but with larger improvements when the initial sample size is small.

It is worth noting that the context does not mention Stratified splitting or Diverse data collection as techniques used to address data bias. However, it does mention that the proposed method is deployed on the GEE platform, which can be easily applied to other regions or different study years, making it a versatile and accessible tool for RS and LULC classification tasks.
