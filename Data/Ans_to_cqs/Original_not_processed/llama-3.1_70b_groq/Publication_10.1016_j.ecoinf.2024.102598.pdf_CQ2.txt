Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the application of machine learning and deep learning algorithms for forest fire susceptibility prediction, but it does not provide information on the input data formats.

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the data used for forest fire susceptibility prediction might include remote sensing data, as mentioned in the paper "Forest fire susceptibility mapping by integrating remote sensing and machine learning algorithms" (Shahfahad et al., 2022). Remote sensing data can include various formats such as satellite images, which are often used in environmental monitoring and disaster management applications.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of various machine learning models, including random forest, support vector machines, and neural networks, which can handle different types of data formats. However, without explicit information on the data formats used, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.
