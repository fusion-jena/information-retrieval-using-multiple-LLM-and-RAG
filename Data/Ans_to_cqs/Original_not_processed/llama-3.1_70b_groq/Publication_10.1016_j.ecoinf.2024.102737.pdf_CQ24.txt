Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Siamese neural networks, to image classification tasks, including marine animal recognition and one-shot learning.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of techniques such as transfer learning, cross-layer pooling, and active learning, which may be related to handling randomness or uncertainty in the data. Nevertheless, these techniques are not explicitly mentioned as strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
