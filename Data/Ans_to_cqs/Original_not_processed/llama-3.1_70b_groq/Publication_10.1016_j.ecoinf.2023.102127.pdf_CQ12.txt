Answer:::
None of the provided context mentions the use of deep learning models such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer in the pipeline. The context only mentions various machine learning approaches and engines used for inferring species distribution, including regularized elastic net regressions, Bayesian regularized "Spike-and-Slab" regressions, Bayesian additive regression trees, monotonic gradient descent boosting, and Extreme Gradient Boosting. However, it does not provide information on the use of deep learning models.
