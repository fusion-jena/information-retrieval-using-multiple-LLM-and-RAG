Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context only discusses the development of a three-layer feedforward back-propagation neural network with a 30-20-10 architecture, the activation functions used, and the input factors and predicted output. However, it does not provide information on the hardware resources utilized for training the model, such as GPUs or TPUs.
