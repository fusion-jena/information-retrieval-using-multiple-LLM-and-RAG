Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided text does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the model was fine-tuned using the Adam optimizer with a default learning rate of 0.0001 and a weight decay of 0. However, it does not provide information on how the hyperparameters were searched or optimized.

It does mention that the parameter estimation of the latent space dimensionality (i.e., n_components) was determined according to the internal validation of the clustering quality and performance, and that clustering validation was performed on multiple combinations, with latent space dimensionality ranging in {5, 10, 15, 20, 25}. This suggests that some form of hyperparameter tuning was performed, but the specific method used (e.g., grid search, random search) is not specified.
