Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention a few techniques related to deep learning and data processing.

One technique mentioned is Dropout, which is a form of regularization that randomly removes a proportion of nodes to reduce overfitting (Srivastava et al., 2014). While Dropout is not directly related to addressing data bias, it can help prevent overfitting, which can be a consequence of biased data.

Another technique mentioned is the use of a high threshold for retaining frames in the DeepMeerkat model, which prioritizes minimizing false negatives at the potential expense of increasing false positives. This approach can help mitigate the effects of biased data, but it is not a direct technique for addressing data bias.

The context also mentions the use of a large-scale machine learning system, TensorFlow (Abadi et al., 2016), but it does not provide information on how data bias is addressed in this system.

In summary, the provided context does not provide a comprehensive answer to the query. However, it mentions a few techniques related to deep learning and data processing that may be relevant to addressing data bias. To provide a more complete answer, additional information would be needed.
