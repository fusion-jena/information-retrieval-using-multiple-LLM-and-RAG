Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of satellite data from the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS) and the Sentinel-2A multi-spectral instrument (MSI) data for burned area discrimination. Additionally, it mentions the use of field plots established within each ecosystem and land cover type for validating the vegetation recovery product in FIREMAP.

It can be inferred that the raw data collection methods may include:

* Satellite remote sensing data from sources like CEMS and Sentinel-2A
* Field observations and measurements from field plots established in different ecosystems and land cover types
* Possibly, other public datasets or sensors, although this is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

However, without more information, it is difficult to provide a comprehensive answer to this question.
