Answer:::
The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is the AudioSet-YouTube corpus, which is a large-scale audio dataset. Specifically, the YAMNet model, which is a pre-trained deep neural network, is trained on this dataset. The AudioSet-YouTube corpus consists of 521 classes. Additionally, a custom dataset of goat vocalizations is also used, which was collected over a period of one year to capture variations in goat vocalizations throughout the year. This dataset consists of approximately 10 million sound events lasting over 34,000 hours.
