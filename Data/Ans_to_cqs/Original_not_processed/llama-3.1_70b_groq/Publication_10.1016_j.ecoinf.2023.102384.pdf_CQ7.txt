Answer: The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training is not a typical per-image splitting approach. Instead, each image is vertically divided into halves, with one portion assigned to the training subset and the other to the validation set. This approach is used to mitigate potentially unbalanced sets arising from the varying insect numbers present in different images.
