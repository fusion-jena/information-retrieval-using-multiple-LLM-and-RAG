Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or any measures taken to ensure its generalizability. The context appears to be discussing forest inventory methods, specifically the use of different estimators (NN1, NN2, NN3, NN4) to calculate diversity indices in forest inventories. It mentions the use of simulations and comparisons of different estimators, but does not mention deep learning or any measures to ensure the generalizability of such a model. Therefore, I do not have enough information to answer the query.
