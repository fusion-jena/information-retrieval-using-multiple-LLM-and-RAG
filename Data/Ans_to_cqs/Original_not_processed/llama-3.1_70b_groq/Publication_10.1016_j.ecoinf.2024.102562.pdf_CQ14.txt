Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It provides information about the performance of the model on various benchmarks, the average precision and recall of the model, and some details about the experimental setup. However, it does not provide any information about the hyperparameter optimization process, such as whether grid search, random search, or any other method is used.
