Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. However, it does mention "sequential minimal optimization" in the context of support vector machines (SVMs), which is a method for training SVMs efficiently. This is mentioned in the paper "Fast training of support vector machines using sequential minimal optimization" by Platt (1998). 

It's worth noting that the context provided seems to be more focused on fisheries, sustainability, and environmental science, rather than deep learning or optimization techniques. Therefore, I couldn't find any information on the specific optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline.
