Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The text only mentions that the "performance scores" of all possible combinations of hyperparameters are compared to select the best model, but it does not specify what these performance scores are based on (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, etc.). Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
