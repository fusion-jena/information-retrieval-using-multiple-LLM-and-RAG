Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the deployment of a trained deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a study on species distribution modeling using the MaxEnt model, which is a type of ecological niche modeling. The text discusses the analysis of the MaxEnt model's output, the contribution of environmental and territorial variables to the model, and the permutation importance of these variables.

There is no mention of deep learning models, model serialization, or platform selection in the provided context. Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not relevant to the provided context.
