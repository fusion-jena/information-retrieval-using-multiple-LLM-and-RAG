Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide some general information on data bias and preprocessing techniques that are commonly used in machine learning and deep learning pipelines.

Data bias can occur in various forms, such as class imbalance, sampling bias, and feature bias. To address these biases, several techniques can be employed during preprocessing, including:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves splitting the data into training and testing sets while maintaining the same class distribution in both sets.
2. Oversampling: This technique involves creating additional instances of the minority class to balance the class distribution.
3. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of instances of the majority class to balance the class distribution.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from diverse sources to reduce sampling bias.

Additionally, other techniques such as data augmentation, feature engineering, and normalization can also be used to preprocess the data and reduce bias.

However, it is essential to note that the provided context does not specifically mention these techniques in the context of deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query based on the provided context.
