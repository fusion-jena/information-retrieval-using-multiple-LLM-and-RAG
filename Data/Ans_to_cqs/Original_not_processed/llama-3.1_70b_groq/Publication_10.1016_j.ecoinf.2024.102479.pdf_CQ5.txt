Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on machine learning applications in environmental management, remote sensing, and forestry, with references to Sentinel-2 data, soil information, and biomass estimation. There is no mention of deep learning or specific datasets commonly used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
