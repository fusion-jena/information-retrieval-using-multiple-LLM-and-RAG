Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the design and optimization of the AlexNet network, the importance of model depth, and the introduction of new ideas such as reducing memory space occupied by the model while increasing its complexity.

However, it does mention that the authors "re-examined the application strategies of deep learning" and "strive to maintain the model performance while reducing the computational complexity and deployment costs", which suggests that they may have considered generalizability in their approach. Nevertheless, the specific measures taken to ensure generalizability are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this query.
