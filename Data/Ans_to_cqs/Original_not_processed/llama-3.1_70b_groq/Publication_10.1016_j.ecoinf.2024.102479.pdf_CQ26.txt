Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on machine learning algorithms and their applications in biomass estimation, rather than deep learning pipelines or data preprocessing techniques.

However, I can provide some general information on the techniques mentioned in the query. Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection are all techniques that can be used to address data bias and imbalance in machine learning datasets.

Stratified splitting involves splitting the data into training and testing sets in a way that preserves the class balance of the original dataset. Oversampling involves creating additional copies of the minority class to balance the dataset, while undersampling involves reducing the number of samples from the majority class. Diverse data collection involves collecting data from a variety of sources to ensure that the dataset is representative of the population of interest.

While these techniques can be useful in addressing data bias, the context provided does not specifically discuss their application in deep learning pipelines or biomass estimation.
