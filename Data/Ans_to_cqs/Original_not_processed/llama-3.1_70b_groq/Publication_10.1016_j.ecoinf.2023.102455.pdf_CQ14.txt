Answer: The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using the Bayesian Optimization method. According to the text, "The Bayesian Optimization program was used in this study to optimize hyperparameters related to ML algorithms." This method is preferred over other methods such as grid search or random search because it can "accelerate and improve the optimization of hyperparameters." The Bayesian Optimization package uses Bayesian optimization to explore the hyperparameter space by selecting the next set of hyperparameters to estimate based on past evaluations.
