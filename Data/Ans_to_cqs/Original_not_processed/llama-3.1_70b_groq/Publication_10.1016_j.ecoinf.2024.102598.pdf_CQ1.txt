Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided pieces of context do not mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to forest fires, ecological informatics, and data analysis, but it does not provide information on data collection methods for deep learning.

However, I can provide some general information on common methods used for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines. These methods may include:

* Surveys: Collecting data through surveys, questionnaires, or other forms of self-reported data.
* Sensors: Using sensors to collect data from the environment, such as temperature, humidity, or image data.
* Public datasets: Utilizing publicly available datasets, such as those found on Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, or other data repositories.
* Crowdsourcing: Collecting data through crowdsourcing platforms, such as Amazon Mechanical Turk.
* Web scraping: Extracting data from websites, social media, or other online sources.

Please note that this information is not specific to the provided context, and I couldn't find any relevant information on data collection methods in the given context.
