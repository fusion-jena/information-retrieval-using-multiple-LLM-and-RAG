Answer: 
The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is the CLO-43SD dataset, which consists of 5428 flight calls from 43 different bird species. This dataset is used to evaluate the performance of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, as well as the other models (MFCC baseline and SKM) for large vocabulary bird species classification from flight calls.
