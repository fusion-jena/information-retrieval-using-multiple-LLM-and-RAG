Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The text primarily focuses on the model training process, the architecture of the CNN-LSTM hybrid model, and the data preparation steps. It does not provide information on the postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

However, it does mention that the model's prediction accuracy on the testing set has improved by about 20% compared to the original CNN, but it does not provide details on how this accuracy was calculated or what metrics were used.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
