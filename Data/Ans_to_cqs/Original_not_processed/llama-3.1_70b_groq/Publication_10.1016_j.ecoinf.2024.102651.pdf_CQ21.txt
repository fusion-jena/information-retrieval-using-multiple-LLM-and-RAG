Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context appears to be discussing the results of an experiment on image classification using a CA-Hybrid network, and it provides some tables with results, but it does not mention anything about saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
