Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a research study on the vulnerability of lowland and upland orchids to climate change and land cover change, and it discusses the methods used in the study, such as ensemble modeling and machine learning algorithms. However, it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing.
