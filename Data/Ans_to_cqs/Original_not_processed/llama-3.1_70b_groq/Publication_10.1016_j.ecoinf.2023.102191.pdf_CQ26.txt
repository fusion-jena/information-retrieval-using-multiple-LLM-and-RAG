Answer:

The provided context does not specifically discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on citizen science programs, data collection, and quality control in the context of marine species observation.

However, it does mention some techniques used to mitigate reporting bias in citizen science data collection, such as:

* Using a checklist of conspicuous species to ensure that common species are not underreported
* Having a knowledgeable dive guide conduct the interview and validate the species sighted and reported
* Restricting observations to one target taxonomic group or taxon, or to one location (although these approaches are mentioned as being used in other studies, not in the specific context of this study)

It does not mention techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, which are commonly used to address data bias in machine learning pipelines. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
