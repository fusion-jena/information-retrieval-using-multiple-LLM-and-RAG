Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be focused on the use of Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) for zoning and clustering, but it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
