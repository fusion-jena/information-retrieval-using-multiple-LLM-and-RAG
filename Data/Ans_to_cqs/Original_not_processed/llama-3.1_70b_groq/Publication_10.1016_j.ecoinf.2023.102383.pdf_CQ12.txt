Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, the context mentions the use of ResNet models (e.g., ResNet18, ResNet34, ResNet152) with a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) for object detection tasks. Additionally, the context references papers related to CNN-based object detection models, such as YOLOv4 and R-CNN. There is no mention of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers in the provided context.
