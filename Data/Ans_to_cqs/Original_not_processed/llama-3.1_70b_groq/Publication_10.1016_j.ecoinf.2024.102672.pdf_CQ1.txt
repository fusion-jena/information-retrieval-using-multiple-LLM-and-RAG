Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the data analysis framework, data pre-processing, and the development of machine learning models for predicting temperature profiles in water masses and detecting thermal stratification. It mentions that the data are supervised by the CHE ( likely a regulatory agency) before their publication through the SAICA and the SAIH, but it does not provide information on how the raw data were collected. Therefore, I don't know the specific methods used for collecting raw data in this context.
