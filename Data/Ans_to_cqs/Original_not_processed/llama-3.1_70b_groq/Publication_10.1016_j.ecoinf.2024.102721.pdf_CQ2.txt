Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on a research article about forecasting ecological water demand using deep learning methods, specifically LSTM models. It discusses the structure of the LSTM model, scenario analysis, and references various research papers, but it does not provide information on the data formats used in the pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
