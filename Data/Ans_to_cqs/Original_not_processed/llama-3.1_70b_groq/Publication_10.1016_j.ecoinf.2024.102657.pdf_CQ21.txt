Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the preprocessing steps, model training, and the results of the training process. It does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

However, it does mention that the accuracy levels of the CNN on noise-filtered data versus raw data were assessed, and the accuracy levels were similar. But it does not provide further details on how these accuracy levels were calculated or what other metrics were used to evaluate the model's performance.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
