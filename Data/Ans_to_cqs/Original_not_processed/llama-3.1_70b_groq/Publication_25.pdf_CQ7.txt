Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention the use of hand-annotated data and self-supervised learning approaches to address the data limitation in deep learning. It also mentions the importance of validation data and the need for large training datasets.

The context does mention that the model can be trained solely using hand-annotated data, and also in a semi-supervised framework that combines labeled and unlabeled data. However, it does not provide specific details on how the data is split for training, testing, and validation.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training.
