Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does provide information on the sample sizes for training, test, and validation groups for discriminant analysis of species and sex.

According to Table 1, the sample sizes for the training, test, and validation groups are:

* Marten: 82 (training), 43 (validation), 42 (test)
* Fisher: 184 (training), 92 (validation), 91 (test)

It appears that the data was split into training, validation, and test sets, but the specific criteria used to determine the proportions of each set are not specified in the provided context.
