Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. It appears to be related to a research article or study on land use and land cover (LULC) classification using remote sensing data, but it does not provide information on the deployment of a deep learning model. The context discusses the selection of training and testing samples, the calculation of spectral indices, and the use of random forest classification, but it does not mention model serialization or platform selection.
