Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context primarily discusses the comparison of training time, prediction time, and optimization time for CNN and XGB models, as well as the input variables used in these models. It also provides some background information on machine learning and deep learning. However, it does not provide information on data splitting criteria for model training.
