Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on various deep learning models and techniques for image processing and object recognition, particularly in the context of aquaculture and underwater image enhancement.

However, I can mention that some of the referenced papers discuss model compression and pruning techniques, which can be related to regularization. For example, the paper by Pattanayak et al. (2021) mentions a multi-objective based pruning technique for CNNs, and the paper by Polino et al. (2018) discusses model compression via distillation and quantization. These techniques can help reduce overfitting by simplifying the model and reducing its capacity.

But, I couldn't find any explicit mention of regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization in the provided context. If you're looking for information on regularization methods, I'd be happy to provide general information on the topic, but it wouldn't be specific to the provided context.
