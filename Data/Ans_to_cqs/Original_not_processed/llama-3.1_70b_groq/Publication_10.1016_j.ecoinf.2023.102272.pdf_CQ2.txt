Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that deep learning models can perform complex tasks with high performance, such as computer vision and natural language processing, as well as image and sound data classification. This suggests that the pipeline may be capable of handling image and audio data formats. Additionally, the context mentions the use of time series data as predictors, which is often stored in CSV or similar formats. However, it does not provide explicit information on the specific data formats used in the pipeline.
