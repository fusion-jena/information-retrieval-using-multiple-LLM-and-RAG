Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. However, it does mention a few strategies related to active learning and selecting samples for labeling.

One strategy mentioned is selecting queries at random, which is considered a naive approach. The context also mentions using model uncertainty criteria, such as confidence, margin, and entropy, to select samples for labeling. Additionally, it mentions using a margin-based active learning approach, which achieved a high overall accuracy in the experiment.

However, these strategies are not directly related to handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. They are more focused on selecting samples for labeling and improving the performance of the model.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know what strategies are employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values.
