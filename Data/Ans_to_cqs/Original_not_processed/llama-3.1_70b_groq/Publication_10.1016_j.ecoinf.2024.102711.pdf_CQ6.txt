Answer: According to the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model are not explicitly stated. However, it is mentioned that AutoGluon, an open-source AutoML library, automates feature engineering, data preprocessing, model training, and ensembling. This suggests that some form of preprocessing is likely involved, but the specific steps are not specified.

Additionally, the context mentions that k-fold cross-validation is used for hyperparameter tuning, which involves dividing the development dataset into training and tuning datasets. This implies that some form of data splitting or partitioning is involved in the preprocessing step.

However, specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning are not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question based on the provided information.

It is worth noting that the context does mention that AutoGluon emphasizes advanced data processing, which could potentially include preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, without further information, I cannot confirm this.
