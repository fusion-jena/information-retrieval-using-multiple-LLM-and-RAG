Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that one of the advantages of using TensorFlow was eliminating the need for preprocessing images for the identification system. This suggests that the authors may not have performed extensive preprocessing or data bias mitigation techniques.

However, it does mention that the authors adjusted two parameters from their default values: validation percentage and number of training steps. They increased the validation percentage from 10% to 16% due to the small number of images available for some species. This could be seen as a way to mitigate class imbalance, but it is not explicitly stated as a technique to address data bias.

The context does not provide information on techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query based on the provided context.
