Answer:

The provided context does not specifically address techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some techniques that can be used to enhance or augment data, which may be related to addressing data bias.

According to the context, some techniques that can be used to enhance or augment data include:

* Data augmentation (mentioned in the paper by Shorten et al., 2019)
* Combining disparate datasets (mentioned in the context as a way to enhance data)
* Using new tools to enhance data (mentioned in the context, but not specified what these tools are)

Additionally, the context mentions that neural networks typically require significant sample sizes for all classes, which suggests that techniques such as oversampling or undersampling may be used to address class imbalance issues.

However, the context does not specifically mention stratified splitting, diverse data collection, or other techniques that may be used to address data bias during preprocessing.

Therefore, while the context provides some information on techniques that can be used to enhance or augment data, it does not provide a comprehensive answer to the query on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
