Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the generation of ground-truth data, the challenges of the dataset, and the references to various research papers on deep learning-based pest detection and counting.

However, it does mention the use of "dilated convolutions" in the context of multi-scale context aggregation, which is a technique used in deep learning models. Additionally, it references the paper "Focal loss for dense object detection" by Lin et al., which proposes a loss function for object detection tasks.

While these references provide some insight into the techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, they do not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used, such as SGD or Adam. Therefore, I do not know the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
