Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to the LandTrendr (LTR) algorithm, which is used for land cover change detection, and discusses the optimization of parameters and data preparation, but does not mention deep learning or regularization methods. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
