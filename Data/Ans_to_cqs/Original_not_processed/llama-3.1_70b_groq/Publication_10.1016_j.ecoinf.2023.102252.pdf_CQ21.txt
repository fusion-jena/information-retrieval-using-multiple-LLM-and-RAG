Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about model training, postprocessing steps, saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context appears to be related to a different topic, possibly environmental modeling or ecological research, and discusses parameters, equations, and variables related to a model called FERM. There is no information about machine learning or model training, which is what the query seems to be asking about.
