Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention the creation of a confusion matrix to depict TensorFlow's initial results for Challenge 1. The confusion matrix is used to evaluate the model's performance, but the context does not provide information on other postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or metrics calculation beyond the overall correct identification rate and processing time.

It is mentioned that the overall correct identification rate was calculated for each challenge, and the correct identification rates for individual species were also evaluated. However, the specific metrics used for evaluation are not detailed in the provided context.

Therefore, based on the provided information, the only postprocessing step that can be confirmed is the creation of a confusion matrix for Challenge 1. Other postprocessing steps may have been involved, but they are not mentioned in the context.
