Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the deep learning pipeline or methods for collecting raw data in this context. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, specifically wildlife management and harvest summaries in Mississippi. It mentions reports from the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks, and references to R packages and statistical analysis.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is unrelated to the provided context.
