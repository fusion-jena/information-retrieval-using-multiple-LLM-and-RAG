Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not provide information on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context appears to be related to bird research, citizen science, and the use of machine learning algorithms for bird species identification. However, it does not mention the deployment process of a deep learning model.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query as it is not related to the provided context.
