Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. However, it does mention the use of Apache Spark, which is a unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing, in the paper "Apache spark accelerated deep learning inference for large scale satellite image analytics" by Lunga et al. (2020). This suggests that the authors may have used distributed computing resources, possibly including GPUs or other accelerators, to speed up the inference process. However, the specific hardware resources used for training the models are not mentioned.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of various deep learning frameworks and architectures, such as VGG, AlexNet, ConvNet, and others, but it does not provide information on the specific hardware resources used to train these models. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query.
