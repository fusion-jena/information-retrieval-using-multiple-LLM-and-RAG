Answer: 
The methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for water contamination analysis in IoT-enabled aquaculture include IoT-based real-time data collection from various sensors. Specifically, the data is collected from IoT devices that measure temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and nitrate concentration. This real-time data collection enables a holistic assessment of water quality and facilitates the calculation of a water contamination index, which is used for accurate segregation of data into contaminated and non-contaminated classes.
