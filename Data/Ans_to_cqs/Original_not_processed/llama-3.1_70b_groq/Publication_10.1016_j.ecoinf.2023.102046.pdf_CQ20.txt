Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models, such as GPUs or TPUs. The text only discusses the models themselves, their architectures, and the training procedures, but does not provide information about the hardware used for training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
