Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of the "signature method" to transform the data, which is used to extract features from time series data. It also mentions the use of pre-selection of predictors to reduce computation time and the risk of overfitting.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a linear combination of explanatory variables to approximate the object variable, which suggests that some form of feature engineering or data transformation may be involved. However, the specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning are not mentioned.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query. However, it can be inferred that some form of data transformation or feature engineering is involved in the preprocessing steps before training a deep learning model.
