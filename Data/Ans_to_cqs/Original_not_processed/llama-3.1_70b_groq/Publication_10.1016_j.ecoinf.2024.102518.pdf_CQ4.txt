Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The text appears to be discussing the results of a species distribution modeling study, including the selection of optimal model parameters and the evaluation of model performance using metrics such as AUC-ROC and CBI. There is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or data augmentation techniques.
