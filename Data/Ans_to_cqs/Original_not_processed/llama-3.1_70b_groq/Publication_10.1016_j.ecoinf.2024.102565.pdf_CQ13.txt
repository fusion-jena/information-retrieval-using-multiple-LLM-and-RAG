Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context only discusses the general architecture of the neural network (NN) model, including the number of neurons in the hidden layers, but does not provide details on the hyperparameters used for training the model. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
