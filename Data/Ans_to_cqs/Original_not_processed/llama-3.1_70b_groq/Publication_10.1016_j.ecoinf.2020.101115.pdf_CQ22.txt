Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or their performance metrics. The context appears to be related to a database design for storing information about fish scales and otoliths, and discusses data models, vocabularies, and metadata standards. There is no mention of machine learning or deep learning models, and therefore, no information about the metrics used to evaluate their performance.
