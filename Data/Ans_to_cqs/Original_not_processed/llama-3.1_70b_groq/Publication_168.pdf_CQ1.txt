Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of hyperspectral images (HSI) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in the context of forest species classification. This suggests that the raw data may be collected using hyperspectral imaging sensors mounted on UAVs. 

Additionally, the context mentions the use of hyperspectral images, which implies that the data may be collected using hyperspectral imaging sensors. However, the specific methods used for collecting the raw data are not explicitly stated.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of existing research papers and journals, which may indicate that the raw data is collected from publicly available datasets or existing research studies. However, without more information, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer to this question.
