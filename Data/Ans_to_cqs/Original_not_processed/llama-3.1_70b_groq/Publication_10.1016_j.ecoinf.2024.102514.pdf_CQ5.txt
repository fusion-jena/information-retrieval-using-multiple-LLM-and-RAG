Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on water quality assessment and machine learning applications in environmental science, rather than deep learning or computer vision.

The context mentions various research studies and papers related to water quality assessment, machine learning, and data splitting techniques, but it does not provide information on specific datasets used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
