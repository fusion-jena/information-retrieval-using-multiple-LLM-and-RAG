Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to focus on the development and application of neural network models, including deep learning algorithms, and their use in various fields such as ecology and economics. It discusses the limitations of traditional neural networks, the emergence of deep learning, and the use of support vector machines (SVMs) for modeling nonlinear relationships.

The context does mention data selection (Section 2.4) but does not provide details on data annotation techniques. It also mentions the use of a training dataset for ecological footprint (EF) calculation, but again, does not specify the annotation techniques used.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
