Answer: The provided context does not explicitly state the purpose of the deep learning model. However, based on the information provided, it appears that the model is being used for regression tasks, such as predicting continuous values like chlorophyll-a (CHL-a), Secchi depth (SD), and total suspended solids (TSS). The context mentions the use of metrics like coefficient of determination (R2), root-mean-square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE), which are commonly used to evaluate the performance of regression models. Additionally, the context mentions the use of algorithms like Random Forest, K-nearest neighbors, AdaBoost, and Artificial Neural Network, which are often used for regression tasks. Therefore, it can be inferred that the purpose of the deep learning model is likely regression, but the exact purpose is not explicitly stated.
