Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the data preprocessing, BirdNET-Analyzer application, and performance evaluation of the model on a specific dataset.

However, it does mention the calculation of recall and precision metrics for evaluating the performance of BirdNET-Analyzer on the annotated dataset (Section 3.1). The context also mentions the use of confidence thresholds to filter out predictions with lower confidence scores, which might be considered a postprocessing step. Nevertheless, it does not provide information on Saliency maps or Confusion matrix.

Therefore, I can only provide a partial answer, and I do not know the complete postprocessing steps involved after model training.
