Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the mention of "multidimensional data that follows a grid pattern" and "visual understanding" in the context, it can be inferred that the data format used is likely image data. The context also mentions "satellite-based observations" which further supports the use of image data. However, it is not explicitly stated, and other data formats like CSV might also be used for other purposes such as storing feature data or model outputs.
