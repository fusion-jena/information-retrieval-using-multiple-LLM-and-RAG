Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the classification methods in the provided context are Overall Accuracy (OA) and Kappa index. The Overall Accuracy (OA) represents the aggregate classification accuracy, and the Kappa index is a measure of separability, with values above 1.9 denoting excellent separability. These metrics are used to assess the performance of different classification methods, including MLC, SVM, ANN, and RF, in combination with various textural feature parameters and extraction windows.
