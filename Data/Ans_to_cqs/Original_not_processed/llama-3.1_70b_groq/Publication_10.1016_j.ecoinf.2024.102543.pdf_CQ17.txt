Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the preprocessing phase, data augmentation, and the training, validation, and testing sets, but it does not provide information on regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization.

However, it does mention that the validation set is used to "fine-tune hyperparameters and assess the model's performance on unseen data, helping to prevent overfitting and ensuring generalization." This suggests that some form of regularization or early stopping may be used, but the specific methods are not specified.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to the query.
