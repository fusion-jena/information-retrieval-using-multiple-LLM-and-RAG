Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The context appears to be a collection of references to various research papers and studies related to remote sensing and machine learning, but it does not provide information on the implementation details of the deep learning models used in these studies. Therefore, I do not know which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model.
