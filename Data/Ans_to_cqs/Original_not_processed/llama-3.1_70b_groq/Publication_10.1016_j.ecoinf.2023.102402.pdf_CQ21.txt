Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. However, it does mention the evaluation of the model's performance using the Area Under the receiver-operator Curve (AUC) and the True Skill Statistics (TSS).

According to the context, the AUC values range from 0 to 1, where values closer to 1 indicate a higher accuracy of model prediction. The TSS values range between -1 and +1, where a value of +1 means complete agreement between observed and predicted distributions, and values of â‰¤0 denote no better than random performance.

Additionally, the context mentions that the authors considered three performance classes based on the AUC values: poor (0.336-0.665), medium (0.666-0.835), and good (0.836-1).

It is not clear if any other postprocessing steps, such as Saliency maps or Confusion matrix, were involved in the analysis. Therefore, I can only provide information on the metrics calculation (AUC and TSS) mentioned in the context.
