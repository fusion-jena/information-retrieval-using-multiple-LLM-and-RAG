Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the application of machine learning methods, specifically random forest models, for tasks such as detecting time-delay water quality indicators and estimating soil heat flux. It mentions the use of remote sensing observations, but it does not provide information on the specific methods used for collecting raw data.

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that remote sensing observations might be one of the sources of data. The paper by Zheng and Jia (2022) mentions the use of remote sensing observations for soil heat flux estimation. Additionally, the context mentions the use of data from wastewater treatment plant influent, but it does not provide information on how this data is collected.

Therefore, while we can speculate that remote sensing observations and possibly data from wastewater treatment plants might be used as sources of data, we cannot provide a definitive answer to the question without more information.
