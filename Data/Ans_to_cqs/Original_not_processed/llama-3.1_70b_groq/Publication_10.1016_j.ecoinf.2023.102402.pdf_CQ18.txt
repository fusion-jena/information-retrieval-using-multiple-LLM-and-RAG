Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of the Area Under the receiver-operator Curve (AUC) and the True Skill Statistics (TSS). The AUC values range from 0 to 1, where values closer to 1 indicate a higher accuracy of model prediction. The TSS values range between -1 and +1, where a value of +1 means complete agreement between observed and predicted distributions, and values of â‰¤0 denote no better than random performance.
