Answer:::
The regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline include dropout and L2 weight regularization. Specifically, dropout layers were added to the network in an attempt to improve generalization. Additionally, L2 weight regularization was used with a factor of 0.0001, similar to ResNets.
