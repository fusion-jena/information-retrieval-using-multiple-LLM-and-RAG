Answer: 
The provided context does not mention the use of any deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. In fact, the context mentions the use of the scikit-learn library, which is a machine learning library for Python, but it does not specifically mention deep learning. The context appears to be focused on hyperparameter optimization for a Random Forest (RF) algorithm using RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV from scikit-learn. Therefore, I do not have enough information to answer the question about which frameworks are used to build a deep learning model.
