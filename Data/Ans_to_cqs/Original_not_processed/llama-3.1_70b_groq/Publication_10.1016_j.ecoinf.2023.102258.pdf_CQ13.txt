Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context primarily focuses on the methodology and approach used in the prototypical networks and transductive few-shot learning, but does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
