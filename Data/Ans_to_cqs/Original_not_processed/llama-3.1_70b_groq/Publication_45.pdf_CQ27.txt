Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It only discusses the potential of deep learning in ecological prediction, the basics of deep neural networks, and the importance of improving ecological prediction. It also mentions that a reproducible example (including code and data) of designing, training, and applying DNNs for ecological prediction is provided, but it does not go into details about the deployment process. Therefore, I do not have enough information to answer this question.
