Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The text discusses the importance of data quality, completeness, and spatial resolution for the analysis, but it does not provide information on how the data is split for training, testing, and validation.

However, it is mentioned that the Global Fishing Watch (GFW) data is aggregated at 0.01Â° resolutions with fishing activity cells already classified through a machine learning model. This suggests that some form of machine learning is used, but the details of the model training process, including data splitting, are not provided.

Therefore, I do not know the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training.
