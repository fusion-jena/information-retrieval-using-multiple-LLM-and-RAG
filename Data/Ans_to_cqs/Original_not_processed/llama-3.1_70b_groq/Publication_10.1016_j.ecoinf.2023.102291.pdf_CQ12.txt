Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, two types of CNN models are mentioned: a customized CNN architecture and a pre-trained ResNet152V2 architecture. The customized CNN model consists of three convolutional layers, followed by a fully connected layer, and is used for training and testing. The pre-trained ResNet152V2 architecture is also used for comparison. There is no mention of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers in the provided context.
