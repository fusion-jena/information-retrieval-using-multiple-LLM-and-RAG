Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the construction of training datasets, training of CNN models, and classification of new images. It mentions the use of very high-resolution satellite and aerial RGB images, but it does not provide information on how these images were annotated.

However, it does mention the use of a "phytolith index as a proxy of tree cover density" and "Leaf Area Index" in one of the referenced papers, which suggests that some form of annotation or labeling may have been used to relate the images to tree cover density. Additionally, the context mentions the use of a "Non-Forest" auxiliary class, which implies that some form of classification or labeling was used.

Unfortunately, without more information, it is not possible to determine the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
