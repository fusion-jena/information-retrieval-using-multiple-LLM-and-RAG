Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the training process, model evaluation, and performance metrics. It discusses the use of a custom dataset, optimized hyperparameters, and techniques to prevent overfitting and underfitting, but it does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

However, it does mention that the model is trained from scratch using a custom dataset, which suggests that some form of preprocessing may have been involved in preparing the dataset for training. Additionally, the context mentions that the input image size is set to 416, which could imply that some form of resizing or scaling may have been applied to the images. Nevertheless, without further information, it is impossible to determine the specific preprocessing steps involved.

Therefore, I must conclude that I don't know the exact preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model.
