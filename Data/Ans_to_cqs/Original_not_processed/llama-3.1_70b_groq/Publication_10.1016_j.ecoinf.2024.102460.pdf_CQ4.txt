Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a passage about a study on land use allocation and ecological environment, discussing models such as LSTM and FMOP, and presenting results on land use demand in 2030. There is no mention of data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, or scaling, which are commonly used in computer vision tasks.
