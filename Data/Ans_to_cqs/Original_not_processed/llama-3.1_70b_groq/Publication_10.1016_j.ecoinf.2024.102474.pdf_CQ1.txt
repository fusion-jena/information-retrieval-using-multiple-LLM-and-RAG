Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the data used was provided as part of the EarthNet2021 Challenge, which suggests that the data may have been collected through Earth observation data, possibly from satellites such as Sentinel-2. Additionally, the context mentions the use of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) which is a common index used in remote sensing to assess vegetation health and is often derived from satellite data. 

It can be inferred that the raw data may have been collected through remote sensing and Earth observation data, but the exact methods used for data collection are not specified in the provided context.
