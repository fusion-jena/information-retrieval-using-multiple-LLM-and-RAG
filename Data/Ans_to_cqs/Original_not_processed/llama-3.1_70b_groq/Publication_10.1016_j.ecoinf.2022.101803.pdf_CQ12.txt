Answer: None of the mentioned deep learning models (CNN, RNN, Transformer) are used in the pipeline. The text mentions the use of Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Random Forests (RF), and XGBoost, which are all types of ensemble learning models, but not deep learning models. XGBoost is a scalable tree boosting system, but it is not a deep learning model in the classical sense. The text does not mention the use of any deep learning models in the pipeline.
