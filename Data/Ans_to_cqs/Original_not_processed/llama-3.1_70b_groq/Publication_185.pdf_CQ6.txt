Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. It only mentions that the experiments were performed on a small-size dataset without data augmentation. 

However, it does mention that the model was trained using stochastic gradient descent and the backpropagation algorithm, and that the learning rate was decreased by a factor of 10 every 69 iterations. It also mentions that L2 weight decay with a penalty multiplier set to 5 Ã— 10-4, dropout ratio set to 0.5, and rectified linear units (ReLUs) were used.

It can be inferred that some form of initialization was performed, as the feature extractors were initialized with white Gaussian noise. However, specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning are not mentioned in the provided context.
