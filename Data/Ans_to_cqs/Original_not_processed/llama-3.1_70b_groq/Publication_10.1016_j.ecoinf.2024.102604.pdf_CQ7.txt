Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling, environmental covariates, and sampling bias, but it does not provide information on data splitting criteria for deep learning models.

However, in general, common criteria used to split data for deep learning model training include:

* Random splitting: dividing the data into training, validation, and testing sets randomly
* Stratified splitting: dividing the data into training, validation, and testing sets while maintaining the same proportion of classes in each set
* K-fold cross-validation: dividing the data into k subsets and using each subset as a testing set while the remaining subsets are used for training

But again, this information is not provided in the given context.
