Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics and landscape design, and it discusses the use of a convolutional neural network for analyzing landscape photographs, but it does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in the model.
