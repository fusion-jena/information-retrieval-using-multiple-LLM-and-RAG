Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models. It only mentions the architectures used, such as Deep Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (DeepConvLSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), but does not provide information on the frameworks used to implement these architectures.
