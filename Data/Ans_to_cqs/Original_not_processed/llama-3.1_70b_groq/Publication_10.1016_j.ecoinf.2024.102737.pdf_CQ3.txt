Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the performance of different classification methods, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and traditional methods like SVM and k-Nearest Neighbors, as well as the use of Siamese networks and feature extraction enhancement techniques.

However, it does mention that the authors performed initial experiments on an individuals labeled database, which suggests that some form of data annotation was used. Additionally, the context mentions the use of data augmentation techniques, but it does not provide details on the specific annotation techniques used.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
