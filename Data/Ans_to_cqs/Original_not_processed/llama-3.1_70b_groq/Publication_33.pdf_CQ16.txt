Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. It only discusses the two phases of the process: building a classification model by training a CNN on a given database T0, and tuning a risk threshold Ï„i specific to each class using a second and independent database T1. 

The context does mention the goals of the process, such as constraining the misclassification error rate to an upper bound of 5% while maximizing the correct classification rate (G2), and keeping the lowest misclassification rate while raising the correct classification error rate (G3). However, it does not provide information on how the training process is stopped or when it is considered complete.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete.
