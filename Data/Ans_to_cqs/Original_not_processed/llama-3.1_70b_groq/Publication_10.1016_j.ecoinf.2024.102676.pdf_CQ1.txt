Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data collection methods utilized in the deep learning pipeline are related to wildlife conservation and tracking. Specifically, the methods mentioned include:

1. Footprint recognition: The context mentions the use of footprints as a data source, with references to papers on footprint recognition of rodents and insects, as well as sex determination of Amur tigers from footprints in snow.
2. Citizen science data collection: The text highlights the potential of combining professional tracking with community involvement through citizen science data collection of footprints.
3. Surveys: Although not explicitly mentioned as a data collection method, the context references a book on "Multiple Imputation for Nonresponse in Surveys", which suggests that surveys might be a relevant data source.

However, it is unclear whether sensors or public datasets are utilized as data collection methods in this specific context. The provided references do not mention sensors, and while there is a mention of a "North-American Animal Tracks Database", it is not clear if this is a public dataset used for data collection.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline appear to include footprint recognition, citizen science data collection, and possibly surveys, but the use of sensors and public datasets is unclear.
