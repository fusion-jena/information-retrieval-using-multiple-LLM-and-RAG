Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the challenges of integrating insect classification and identification into the STARdbi infrastructure, the need for multiple models, and the potential cyber-security threats of allowing users to upload their own models. However, it does not provide information on the specific methods used for hyperparameter optimization, such as grid search or random search.
