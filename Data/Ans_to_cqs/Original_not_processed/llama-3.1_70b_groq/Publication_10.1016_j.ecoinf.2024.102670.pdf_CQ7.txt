Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided pieces of context do not mention the specific criteria used to split data for deep learning model training. The texts appear to be research papers and articles discussing various applications of deep learning and image analysis, but they do not provide information on data splitting criteria.

However, in general, common practices for splitting data for deep learning model training include:

* Random splitting: dividing the data into training, validation, and testing sets randomly, often using a fixed ratio (e.g., 80% for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing).
* Stratified splitting: dividing the data into training, validation, and testing sets while maintaining the same class distribution in each set.
* K-fold cross-validation: dividing the data into k subsets, using k-1 subsets for training and one subset for testing, and repeating the process k times.

It's worth noting that the specific criteria used to split data can depend on the problem, dataset, and research question, and may require careful consideration to ensure that the model is trained and evaluated fairly.

In this case, since the provided context does not mention data splitting criteria, I cannot provide a more specific answer.
