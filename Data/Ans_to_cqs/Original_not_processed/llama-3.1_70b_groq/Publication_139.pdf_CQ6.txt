Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention that the prediction records were normalized by the number of 8-s intervals actually recorded during that hour to account for missing audio data. This suggests that some form of normalization was performed, but the specific preprocessing steps involved in preparing the data for training the model are not mentioned.

It is also mentioned that the training database was assembled by manually labeling select spectrogram images via visual inspection, which implies that some form of data cleaning or filtering may have been performed to select the relevant images for annotation. However, the specific details of this process are not provided.

Overall, the context does not provide a comprehensive overview of the preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model.
