Answer:::

The provided context does not specifically discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention a few relevant concepts.

One relevant concept is the use of propensity score methods to reduce the effects of confounding in observational studies (Austin, 2011; Austin & Stuart, 2015). Propensity score methods can be used to balance the data and reduce bias, but it is not explicitly mentioned as a technique for addressing data bias in the context of deep learning.

Another relevant concept is the use of inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) using the propensity score to estimate causal treatment effects in observational studies (Austin & Stuart, 2015). IPTW can be used to balance the data and reduce bias, but again, it is not explicitly mentioned as a technique for addressing data bias in the context of deep learning.

The context also mentions the use of techniques such as stratified splitting, but only in the context of model evaluation and analysis (Barbosa et al., 2016).

The context does not mention oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection as techniques for addressing data bias.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive answer to the query. However, it can be said that propensity score methods and IPTW may be relevant techniques for addressing data bias, but their application in the context of deep learning is not explicitly discussed.

It is also worth noting that the context is primarily focused on soil organic carbon stocks, climate change, and agriculture, rather than deep learning or data preprocessing.
