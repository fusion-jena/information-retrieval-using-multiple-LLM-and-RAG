Answer:::
The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include cropping, flipping, scaling, rotating, adding noise, and color transformation. Additionally, the paper also mentions random erasing as a data augmentation technique used in the second stage of the pipeline. These techniques are used to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset, which is essential for training a robust deep learning model.
