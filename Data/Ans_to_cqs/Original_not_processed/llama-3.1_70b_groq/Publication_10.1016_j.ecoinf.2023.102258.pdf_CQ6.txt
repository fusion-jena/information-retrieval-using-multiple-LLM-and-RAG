Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention that many systems use Mel spectrograms with PCEN (Per-Channel Energy Normalization) as acoustic features, which suggests that some form of normalization is involved. Additionally, it mentions that some systems use delta-MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) features, which implies that some form of feature extraction and possibly scaling is involved.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions that deep learning models typically divide long audio files into shorter chunks (with fixed durations of e.g. 3 or 10 s) to fit inside the limited memory of GPUs, which may involve some form of data cleaning or preprocessing to handle the chunking process.

However, without more explicit information, it is difficult to provide a comprehensive answer to the query. Therefore, I must conclude that I don't know the exact preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model based on the provided context.
