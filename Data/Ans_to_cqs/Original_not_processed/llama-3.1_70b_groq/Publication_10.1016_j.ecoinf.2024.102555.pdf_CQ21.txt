Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context appears to be related to a study on remote sensing and ecological restoration, and it includes references to research papers and study areas. However, it does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps involved in model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
