Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on the methodology and algorithms used for modeling, such as stochastic gradient boosting, neural networks, and hyperparameter tuning, but it does not provide information on the hardware resources utilized. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
