Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on model development, training, and testing, including techniques such as early stopping to prevent overfitting, but it does not discuss data preprocessing techniques to address bias.

However, it does mention that the data set was randomly split into two sets, 80% for model training and 20% for model testing. This suggests that the data was split randomly, but it does not provide information on whether any techniques were used to address data bias during preprocessing.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
