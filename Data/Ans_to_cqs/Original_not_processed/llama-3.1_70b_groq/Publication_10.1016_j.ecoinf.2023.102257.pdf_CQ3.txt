Answer: The text does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as instance segmentation. However, it does mention the use of bounding box annotation as a technique for labelling data. The study compares the efficiency of three tagging methods, including one with Machine Learning (ML) bounding box assistance and two without assistance. The use of bounding box annotation is highlighted as a method that can offer significant improvement in tagging efficiency when labelling data, but its effectiveness is contingent on the ML algorithm's performance.
