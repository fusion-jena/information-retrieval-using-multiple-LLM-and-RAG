Answer:::

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, specifically the Wav2Vec model, are as follows:

* Optimizer: Adam
* Initial learning rate: 10e-5
* Epochs: 30
* Batch size: 1

These hyperparameters were chosen based on a manual fine-tuning process, which suggests that they were selected through experimentation and evaluation of the model's performance on a specific task, likely bird species classification. The use of the Adam optimizer with a small initial learning rate (10e-5) is consistent with common practices in deep learning, as it allows for stable and efficient optimization of the model's parameters. The choice of 30 epochs and a batch size of 1 may be specific to the particular task and dataset being used.
