Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on weakly supervised learning tasks, particularly in the context of regression and classification problems, and does not provide information on data collection methods.

However, based on the references provided, it can be inferred that the context is related to ecological informatics and predictive modeling of global vegetation cover. In this domain, data collection methods may include remote sensing, satellite imaging, and field surveys. For example, the reference to "Hydro1k documentation, US Geological survey" suggests that remote sensing and satellite imaging may be used to collect data on vegetation cover.

Additionally, the reference to "Using climatically based random forests to downscale coarse-grained potential natural vegetation maps in tropical Mexico" suggests that field surveys and observations may also be used to collect data on vegetation cover.

However, without more specific information, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer to the query. Therefore, I can only provide a speculative answer based on the context and references provided.
