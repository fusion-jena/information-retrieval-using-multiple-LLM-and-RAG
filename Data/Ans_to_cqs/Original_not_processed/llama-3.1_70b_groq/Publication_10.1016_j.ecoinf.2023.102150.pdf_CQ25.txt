Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model is image classification, specifically for animal detection and classification in camera trap images. The model is designed to separate empty images from images containing an animal, identify species, count individuals, and categorize animal behavior. The model's architecture is based on the ResNet50 architecture, and it was trained from scratch for 55 epochs using the adam optimizer. The model's performance matches or even outperforms human accuracy in image classification tasks.
