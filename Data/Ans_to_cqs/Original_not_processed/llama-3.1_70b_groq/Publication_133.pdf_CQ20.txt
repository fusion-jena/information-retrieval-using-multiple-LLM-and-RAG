Answer:::
The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses the model training process, the use of validation data, and the performance of the model, but it does not provide information about the hardware resources used. Therefore, I do not know which hardware resources (e.g., GPUs, TPUs) were used for training the deep learning model.
