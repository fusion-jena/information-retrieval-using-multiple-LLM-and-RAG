Answer:::
The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image. The study utilizes three image datasets: ImageNet, Snapshot Serengeti (SS), and Lasha Mountain (LSM). The ImageNet dataset contains 1.2 million training samples with varying image sizes, ranging from 75 × 56 pixels to 4288 × 2848 pixels. The study also mentions that the images in the SS and LSM datasets are captured by camera traps and are split into training and test sets while maintaining the integrity of capture events. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline.
