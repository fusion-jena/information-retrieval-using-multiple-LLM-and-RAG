Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the application of deep learning techniques, such as Mask R-CNN and Scaled-YOLOv4, to optimize instance segmentation of animal species in video clips from camera traps. It also mentions the use of neural networks for species identification and the potential for training bespoke neural networks for specific species sets.

However, the context does not delve into the details of the deep learning pipeline, including regularization methods used to prevent overfitting. Regularization methods like dropout and L2 regularization are common techniques used to prevent overfitting in deep learning models, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
