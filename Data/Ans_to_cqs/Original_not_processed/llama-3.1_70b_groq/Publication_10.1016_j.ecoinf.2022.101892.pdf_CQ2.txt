Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that images are used as input data. The context mentions "panda facial images" and "image recognition" tasks, which suggests that images are the primary data format used in the pipeline. Additionally, the context mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as VGG and ResNet, which are commonly used for image classification tasks. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats in the provided context.
