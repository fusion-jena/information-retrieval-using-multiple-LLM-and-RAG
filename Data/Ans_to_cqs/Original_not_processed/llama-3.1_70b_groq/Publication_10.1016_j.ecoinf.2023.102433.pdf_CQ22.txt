Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to the nasawebservice package, its functionality, and its applications in ecological studies, land cover, and land use mapping. It discusses the package's features, such as data retrieval, preprocessing, and analysis, but does not provide information on the evaluation metrics used for deep learning models.
