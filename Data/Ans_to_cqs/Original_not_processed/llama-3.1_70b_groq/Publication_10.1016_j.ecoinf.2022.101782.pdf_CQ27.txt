Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context discusses the training of the model, including the use of a batch size of 64, an ADAM optimizer, and a learning rate of 10^-5, as well as the application of image augmentation techniques. It also mentions the evaluation of the model's performance on an independent test set. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
