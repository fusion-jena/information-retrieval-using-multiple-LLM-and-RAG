Answer:::

The hyperparameters of the model, specifically the regularization parameter λ, are optimized using a grid search approach. According to the text, the iterative optimization of the objective function is repeated for 100 discrete candidate values of λ, which are chosen from a vector of equidistant values. The value of λ that minimizes the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) is then selected as the optimal value. This approach is similar to a grid search, where a range of possible values for the hyperparameter is defined and the model is evaluated for each value in the grid. The value that results in the best performance, as measured by the BIC, is then chosen as the optimal hyperparameter value.
