Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The references listed appear to be academic papers related to plant species identification using machine learning and deep learning approaches, but none of them provide a link to a data repository. Some papers mention the use of self-built datasets, while others mention specific datasets such as Mendeley, but no link is provided. Therefore, I am unable to provide a link to a data repository.
