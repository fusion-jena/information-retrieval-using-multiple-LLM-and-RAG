Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of existing well-known datasets, such as the PlantClef2015 dataset, which suggests that public datasets are one source of raw data. Additionally, the context mentions the use of images, which could be collected through various means such as cameras or sensors. However, the specific methods used for collecting raw data are not mentioned.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of a leaf database, which could be collected through surveys or other means, but this is not explicitly stated. Overall, the context suggests that public datasets and possibly images collected through cameras or sensors are used as sources of raw data, but the specific methods used for collecting this data are not provided.
