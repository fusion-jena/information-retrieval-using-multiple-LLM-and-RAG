Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. The context appears to be discussing the use of ensemble models, specifically Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Regression (SVR), and the optimization of their hyperparameters using the Optuna algorithm. The hyperparameters mentioned in the context are related to these models, such as the number of estimators (n_estimators) in the RF model. However, there is no mention of deep learning models or their associated hyperparameters.
