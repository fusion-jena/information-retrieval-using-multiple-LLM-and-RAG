Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on the prediction of dissolved oxygen concentration in water using various machine learning and deep learning methods, including ANN, LSTM, and others. It discusses the use of different models, architectures, and techniques for modeling DO concentrations, but it does not mention data annotation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not related to the provided context.
