Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the YOLO (You Only Look Once) family of models, is object detection and classification. According to the context, CNNs can be used for pattern recognition in a diverse range of insect images, and have been successfully used for detection and classification tasks. The YOLO family of models is specifically designed for detecting objects, and is used for tasks such as species detection and classification of organisms found in production sorghum fields. The context also mentions that deep learning approaches have the potential to expedite the monitoring process by automating tasks such as species detection and classification using imagery.
