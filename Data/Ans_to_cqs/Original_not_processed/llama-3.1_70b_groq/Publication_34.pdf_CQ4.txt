Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided pieces of context do not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the CNN model, the initialization of model parameters, and the training process using stochastic gradient descent. It does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used to preprocess or augment the input data.
