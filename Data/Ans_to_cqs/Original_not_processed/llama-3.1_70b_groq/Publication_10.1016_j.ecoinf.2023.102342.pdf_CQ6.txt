Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on data mining, knowledge discovery in databases (KDD), and the Apriori algorithm, which is a type of association rule learning algorithm.

However, it does mention "pre-selection of useful data to achieve the objective" as one of the steps in the KDD sequence. This step might involve some form of data preprocessing, but the context does not provide further details on what specific preprocessing steps are involved.

Additionally, the context mentions "optimisation and elaboration of the obtained results" as part of the KDD sequence, which could potentially involve some form of data preprocessing or transformation. However, the context does not provide enough information to determine what specific preprocessing steps are involved.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
