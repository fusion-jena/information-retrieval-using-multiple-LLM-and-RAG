Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics and ecosystem services, and it discusses data sources and characteristics, as well as spatial distributions of ecosystem services supply and demand in the Weihe River Basin. However, it does not provide information on deep learning pipelines or data collection methods.

That being said, the context does mention various data sources, including:

* DEM (Digital Elevation Model)
* Land use data
* NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data
* Soil data
* Population data
* GDP (Gross Domestic Product) data
* Meteorological data
* Vector data
* Statistical data from a yearbook

These data sources may be used as inputs for analysis or modeling, but the context does not provide information on how these data are collected or used in a deep learning pipeline.
