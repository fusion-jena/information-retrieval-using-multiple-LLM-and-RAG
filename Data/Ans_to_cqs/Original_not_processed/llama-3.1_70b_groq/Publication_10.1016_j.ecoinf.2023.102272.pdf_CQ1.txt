Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models for predicting disease vector abundances, the performance of different machine learning models, and the importance of integrating deep learning approaches into existing disease transmission or importation models.

However, it can be inferred that the data used for training and testing the deep learning models might be obtained from various sources such as environmental data, weather conditions, and possibly surveillance data on disease vectors. The context mentions the use of high-resolution environmental data, which suggests that the data might be collected from sources such as satellite imagery, sensors, or public datasets.

Additionally, the context cites several research papers that might provide more information on the data collection methods used in those specific studies. For example, the paper by Ripoche et al. (2019) mentions the use of weather conditions in southern Quebec, Canada, which might be obtained from public datasets or weather stations.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data, it can be inferred that the data might be obtained from various sources such as environmental data, weather conditions, and possibly surveillance data on disease vectors.
