Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of satellite images, specifically from Sentinel-2 and SPOT-6, as well as in-situ measured data. It also mentions the use of sensors, but does not provide further details on the types of sensors used or how the data is collected.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of MSI (Multispectral Instrument) and OLCI (Ocean and Land Colour Instrument) sensors, which are likely used to collect data from satellite images. However, it does not provide information on how the data is collected or processed.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that satellite images and in-situ measured data are used as sources of raw data, but the exact methods used for collecting this data are not specified.
