Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that each ML model was "optimized on the validation set", which suggests that the models were trained until they reached a certain level of performance on the validation set. Additionally, the context mentions that the hyperparameters of the base models were optimized in terms of accuracy, which indicates that the proportion of correctly classified samples among all samples in the validation set was used as a metric to evaluate the models. However, the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete is not mentioned.
