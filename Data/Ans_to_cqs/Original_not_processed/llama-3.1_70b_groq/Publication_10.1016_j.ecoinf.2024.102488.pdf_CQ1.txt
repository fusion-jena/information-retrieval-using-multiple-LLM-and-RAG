Answer:::

The provided context does not specifically mention the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of remote sensing data, including GF-1 optical imagery, GF-3 SAR imagery, and MODIS NDVI imagery, which suggests that satellite or aerial sensors are used to collect data.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of field surveys, as evidenced by the mention of "validation samples from field survey" in Table 2. This suggests that some data may be collected through in-person surveys or observations.

There is no mention of public datasets being used, although the context does mention that the China Centre for Resources Satellite Data and Application was accessed to retrieve GF-1 multispectral images.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of Recursive Feature Elimination and Cross-Validation (RFECV) for feature selection, which is a method used to reduce the dimensionality of the data and improve model performance. However, this is not a method for collecting raw data, but rather a method for processing and preparing the data for use in a model.
