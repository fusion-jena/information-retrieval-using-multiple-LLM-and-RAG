Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The text discusses the challenges of class-imbalance and the limitations of the loss function, but it does not provide information on the specific metrics used to evaluate the model's performance, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
