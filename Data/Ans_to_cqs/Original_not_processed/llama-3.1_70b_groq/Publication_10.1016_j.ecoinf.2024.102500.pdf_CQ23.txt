To ensure the generalizability of the machine learning models, several measures were taken. 

Firstly, the dataset was split into five equal-sized folds using fivefold cross-validation. This resampling technique helps to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data and prevents overfitting. The training and assessment process was validated five times, with each fold being used once for testing.

Secondly, hyperparameter tuning was performed using a grid search with cross-validation. This approach allowed for the evaluation of multiple hyperparameter combinations and the selection of the best ones that reduce prediction errors and improve model precision.

Lastly, the hyperparameters were carefully chosen to enhance the model's performance and prevent overfitting. For example, the LGBM model used subsamples to reduce overfitting, and the GB model used n_estimators, max_depth, and subsample to control the model's complexity and prevent overfitting.

There is no mention of using a diverse dataset or stratified splitting in the provided context.
