Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on discussing the concept of Transfer Learning (TL), Intuitionistic Fuzzy Transfer Learning (IFTL), and its application in predicting GDP using CO2 emission data. It also touches upon the limitations of traditional machine learning techniques and the benefits of using IFTL in handling data distribution differences between the source and target domains.

However, it does mention that the proposed approach efficiently captured the uncertainty produced by extreme variations in data distribution or predictive tasks across the source and target data. This suggests that some form of data preprocessing or normalization might be involved, but the specific steps are not explicitly mentioned.

Therefore, I don't know the exact preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model in this context.
