Answer: The criteria used to determine when training is complete is when the learning curve converges and loss values no longer decrease. Specifically, the authors stopped the learning process after 90 epochs, as shown in Figure 5, where the loss values had plateaued and were no longer decreasing. This indicates that the model had reached a point of convergence and further training would not lead to significant improvements.
