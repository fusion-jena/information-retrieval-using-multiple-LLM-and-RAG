Answer:::
The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Vertical flipping of images: This is achieved by setting the argument "flip_vert = TRUE" in the fastai get_transforms function.
2. Limiting overly exposing the images: This is achieved by setting the argument "max_lighting = 0.02" in the fastai get_transforms function.
3. Disabling the zooming augmentation: This is achieved by setting the argument "max_zoom = 1" in the fastai get_transforms function.
4. Reducing the memory load on the graphical processing unit (GPU): This is achieved by setting the argument "to_fp16 = TRUE" in the fastai get_transforms function.
