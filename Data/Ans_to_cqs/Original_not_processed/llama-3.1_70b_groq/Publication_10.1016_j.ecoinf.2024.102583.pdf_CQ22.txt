Answer:

According to the provided context, the performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the following metrics:

1. AUC-ROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve)
2. Overall Accuracy
3. Kappa Score
4. F1-Score

Additionally, the context also mentions the use of Precision, Recall, and Sensitivity (also known as True Positive Rate) in the evaluation of the model's performance. However, it is not explicitly stated that these metrics are used to evaluate the deep learning model specifically.

It is worth noting that the context provides formulas for calculating these metrics, such as:

* Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
* Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
* F1-Score = 2 × Precision × Recall / (Precision + Recall)

Overall, the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the deep learning model are a combination of accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics that provide a comprehensive understanding of the model's performance.
