Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. It only mentions that the validation set is used to fine-tune hyperparameters and assess the model's performance on unseen data, helping to prevent overfitting and ensuring generalization. However, it does not provide specific details on the stopping criteria for training.

The context does mention that the model is trained on a training set comprising 82% of the data (4000 images) and validated on a validation set consisting of 13% of the data (607 images). It also mentions that the model's performance is evaluated using various metrics, including Precision, Recall, mAP, Params, and FLOPs. However, it does not provide information on how these metrics are used to determine when training is complete.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete.
