Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The text appears to be discussing the development of a forest fire danger prediction model, but it does not provide information on the data splitting process. It mentions the use of different weighting approaches and the combination of data layers, but it does not specify how the data was split for training, testing, and validation. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
