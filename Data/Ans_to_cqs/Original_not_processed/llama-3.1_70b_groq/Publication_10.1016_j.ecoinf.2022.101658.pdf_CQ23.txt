To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the model was trained on a dataset collected from two field sites, Pelican Mountain (PM) and Calling Lake (CL), which were used for training and testing the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) semantic segmentation algorithm. This suggests that the model was trained on a diverse dataset from different locations.

However, it is not explicitly stated that the dataset was diverse in terms of other factors such as vegetation types, climate, or time of year. The dataset was also relatively small, consisting of only 290 training images, which was found to be insufficient to obtain satisfactory results.

To address this issue, data augmentation strategies were employed to increase the training set size fourfold. These strategies included horizontal flip, Gaussian noise addition, and contrast reduction. The contrast reduction strategy was specifically motivated by the expectation of images containing shadows occluding vegetation types, which can be expected in the dataset.

Additionally, the model was validated using an independent dataset collected from a third field site, Conklin (CK). This suggests that some form of independent validation was used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

However, it is not clear if cross-validation or stratified splitting were used to further ensure the generalizability of the model. Therefore, while some measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model, it is not possible to confirm if all the measures mentioned in the query were taken.
