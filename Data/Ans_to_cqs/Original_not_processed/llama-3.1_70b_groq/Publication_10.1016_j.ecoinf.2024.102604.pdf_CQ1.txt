Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a study on correcting sampling bias in environmental spaces, and it discusses methods such as aggregation background method and filtering method for mitigating sampling bias. However, it does not provide information on the methods used for collecting raw data.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
