Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily uses image data formats. The context mentions the use of hyperspectral imaging technology, multispectral images, and remote sensing data from various sources such as Sentinel-2, Landsat-8/9, and UAVs. These data sources are typically used to collect image data, which is then processed and analyzed using machine learning and deep learning techniques.

Specifically, the context mentions the use of colour images and chlorophyll-related spectral indices for spad value estimation, and the use of UAV multispectral images for monitoring sugar beet growth indicators. Additionally, the context mentions the use of vegetation indices derived from remote sensing data for various applications such as crop type classification, leaf chlorophyll content retrieval, and vegetation extraction.

There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline. CSV (Comma Separated Values) format is not explicitly mentioned either, but it is possible that CSV files are used to store and manage data, such as labels or metadata, associated with the image data.

Overall, based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily uses image data formats, specifically multispectral and hyperspectral image data.
