Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the challenges of manual annotation of seabed images, the emergence of computer tools for automatic analysis, and the use of deep learning architectures such as VGG and ResNet. It also mentions data augmentation techniques, including 90Â° rotation and vertical and horizontal flips, but does not provide information on specific data annotation techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.

However, it is mentioned that the context is related to marine image annotation, and the paper "marine image annotation: lessons learned and future directions" is cited. This suggests that the authors may have used some form of annotation technique, but the specific details are not provided in the given context.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to the query.
