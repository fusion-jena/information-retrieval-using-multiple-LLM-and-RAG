Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, it does mention that the hyperparameters are "based on the optimized values for YOLOv5 COCO training from scratch" (Table 2). This suggests that the hyperparameters may have been optimized using a pre-existing set of values that have been found to work well for YOLOv5 COCO training, rather than through a process such as grid search or random search. Unfortunately, the exact method used to optimize the hyperparameters is not specified in the provided context.
