Answer:

According to the provided context, the data augmentation techniques applied to the training dataset include:

1. Rotations between 0 and 360 degrees
2. Reflection by the vertical axis (i.e., flipping)
3. Vertical shifting by +/- 5 pixels

Additionally, standard image normalization for CNNs was applied, mapping the 8-bit pixel values to floating-point values between 0 and 1.

There is no mention of scaling as a data augmentation technique in the provided context.
