Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on image feature extraction using deep learning models, specifically ResNet-50, and discusses the performance of different variants of ResNet. It does not provide information on data preprocessing techniques such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
