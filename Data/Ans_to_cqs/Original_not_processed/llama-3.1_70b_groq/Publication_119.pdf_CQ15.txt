Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. However, it does mention that the hyperparameters, including the learning rate, were tuned to optimize the model's performance. The learning rate is a crucial hyperparameter in many optimization algorithms, including SGD and Adam. 

The context does mention that the optimized hyperparameter values for the learning rate and batch size were 0.007 and 48, respectively. This suggests that the model's performance was sensitive to the choice of learning rate and batch size, which is consistent with many deep learning optimization algorithms. However, without further information, it is not possible to determine the specific optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline.
