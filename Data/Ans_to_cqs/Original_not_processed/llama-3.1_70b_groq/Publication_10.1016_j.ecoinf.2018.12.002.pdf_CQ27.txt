Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a research paper on using machine learning for inferring animal behavior from location and movement data, but it does not provide information on the deployment process of a deep learning model. The context mentions various machine learning techniques, such as hidden Markov models and state space models, but it does not discuss the deployment process of a trained model.
