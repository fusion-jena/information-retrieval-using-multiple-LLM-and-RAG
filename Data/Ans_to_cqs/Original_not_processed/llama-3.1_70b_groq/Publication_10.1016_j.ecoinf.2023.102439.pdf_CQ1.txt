Answer:

Based on the provided context, it appears that the study utilizes satellite data and direct ground-truth measurements for collecting raw data. Specifically, the study uses infrared radiations measured on channels 31 and 32 using the MODIS-TERRA sensor to derive the Land Surface Temperature (LST) dataset. The data is obtained from the MOD11A2 product, which offers 8-day temporal and 1 km spatial resolutions covering 2005-2018.

Additionally, the study mentions the use of Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS NDBI data from 2014 to 2018. This suggests that the study also utilizes remote sensing data from satellite imagery.

There is no mention of surveys or public datasets as methods for collecting raw data in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the study applies machine learning to explore correlations between NDBI and various parameters, which may involve the use of sensors or other data sources not explicitly mentioned in the context.
