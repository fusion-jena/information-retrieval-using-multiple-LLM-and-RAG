Answer:

According to the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), include:

1. Resizing images to 224 pixels along the x-axis while preserving their aspect ratio.
2. Cropping the center of the images to make them square.
3. Normalizing RGB values by centering and scaling them to match the training dataset (ImageNet).

These steps are mentioned in section 2.2.2 of the provided context, which discusses data preparation for training a CNN. Additionally, the context mentions that the images are split into 80% training and 20% testing subsets, with stratified splits to preserve the class ratio.

It is worth noting that the context does not mention any specific cleaning steps, but it does mention that the images are normalized and scaled, which can be considered as part of the preprocessing pipeline.
