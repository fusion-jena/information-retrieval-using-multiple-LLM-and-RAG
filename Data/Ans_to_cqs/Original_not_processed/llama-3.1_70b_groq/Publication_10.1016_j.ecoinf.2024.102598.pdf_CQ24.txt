Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily discusses the use of machine learning models, including Random Forest, for forest fire occurrence prediction and susceptibility mapping. It also mentions the use of cross-validation and optimization of model parameters, but it does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of Random Forest, which is an ensemble learning method that can help reduce the impact of randomness by averaging the predictions of multiple decision trees. Additionally, the context mentions the use of a 10-fold cross-validation design, which can help evaluate the robustness of the models to randomness in the data.

Overall, while the context does not provide a direct answer to the query, it suggests that the use of ensemble methods and cross-validation can help mitigate the impact of randomness in machine learning models.
