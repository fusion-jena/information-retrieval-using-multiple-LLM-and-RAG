Answer:::
I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It mentions the use of the ImageNet database (http://www.image-net.org) for pre-training the ResNet-50 model, but it does not provide a link to a repository containing the specific pipeline used in the study.
