Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily uses image data formats. The context mentions the use of images for pest species classification, object detection, and insect identification. Specifically, it mentions the use of annotated images in the "Pest24" dataset, which consists of 25,378 images from 24 pest species. Additionally, the context mentions the use of sticky plate images and the application of the YOLOv5 model on these images.

There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is possible that CSV files may be used for storing metadata or annotations related to the images, but this is not explicitly stated in the context.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data.
