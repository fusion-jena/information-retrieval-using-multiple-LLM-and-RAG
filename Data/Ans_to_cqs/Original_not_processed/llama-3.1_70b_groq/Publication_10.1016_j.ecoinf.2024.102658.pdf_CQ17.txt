Answer: 

The provided context does not mention the use of regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. In fact, the context does not mention deep learning at all. It discusses the use of logistic regression and random forest models, and mentions that MLE and Bayesian logistic regression did not show signs of overfitting. However, it does mention that restricting the priors and the basis dimension of the model had a limited effect on preventing overfitting in the models fit on spatial-CV features. 

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline.
