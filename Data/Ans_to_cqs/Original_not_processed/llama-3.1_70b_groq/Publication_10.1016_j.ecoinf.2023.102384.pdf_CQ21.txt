Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. However, it does mention that during the validation phase, the overall output is reconstructed by combining the predictions from the patches, and subsequently, metrics are calculated over the complete image.

It is also mentioned that for the solution based on detection, the final global output is reconstructed using non-maximum suppression among the bounding boxes. This suggests that some form of postprocessing is involved, but the specific details are not provided.

Therefore, I can only partially answer the query. The context mentions that metrics are calculated over the complete image during the validation phase, but it does not provide information on saliency maps or confusion matrix.
