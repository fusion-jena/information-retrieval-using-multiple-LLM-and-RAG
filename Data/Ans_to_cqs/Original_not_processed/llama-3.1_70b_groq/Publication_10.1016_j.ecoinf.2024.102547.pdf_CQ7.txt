Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be related to a study on analyzing multifrequency acoustics data using Functional Data Analysis (FDA), but it does not provide information on the data splitting criteria.

However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to split the data into training, testing, and validation sets using techniques such as random sampling, stratified sampling, or k-fold cross-validation. The specific criteria used to split the data can depend on the problem, dataset, and model architecture.

In this case, I couldn't find any information on the data splitting criteria used in the study. If you have any further questions or context, I'll be happy to try and help.
