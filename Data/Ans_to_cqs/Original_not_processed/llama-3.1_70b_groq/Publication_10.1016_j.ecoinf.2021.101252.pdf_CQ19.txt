Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. It only discusses the use of AutoML (Automated Machine Learning) to generate and train candidate models with different architectures (e.g., ResNet, InceptionTime, LSTM, CNN) and hyperparameters. The context also presents the results of three case studies, showing the accuracy of candidate models and the AUC of selected models, but it does not provide information about the underlying frameworks used to implement these models.
