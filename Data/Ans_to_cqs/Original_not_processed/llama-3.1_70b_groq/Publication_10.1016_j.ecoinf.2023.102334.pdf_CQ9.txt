Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper or article discussing the use of vision transformers for image recognition, specifically for identifying sika deer. The text includes references to various studies and conferences, but it does not provide information about a data repository. Therefore, I am unable to provide a specific answer to the query.
