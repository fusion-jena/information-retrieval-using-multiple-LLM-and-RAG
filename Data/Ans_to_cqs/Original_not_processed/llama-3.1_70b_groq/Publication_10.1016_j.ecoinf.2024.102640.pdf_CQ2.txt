Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the pipeline involves image data. The context mentions the use of SegFormer, a state-of-the-art Transformer-based model for semantic segmentation, which is typically used for image data. Additionally, the context mentions the use of the ImageNet-1K dataset, which is a large-scale image dataset. Therefore, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is likely image data. However, it is not possible to confirm this with certainty without more information.
