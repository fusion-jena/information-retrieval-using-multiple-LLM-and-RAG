Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The text only discusses the classification algorithms used, hyperparameter tuning, and the data allocation for training and testing. It does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
