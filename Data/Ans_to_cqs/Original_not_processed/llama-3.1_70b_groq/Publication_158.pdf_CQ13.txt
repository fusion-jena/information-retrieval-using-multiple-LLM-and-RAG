Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the learning rate used in the deep learning model. However, it does mention the optimizer used, which is the Adam optimizer. Additionally, the context mentions that the categorical-cross entropy loss function was used, and the batch size was set to 64. The number of epochs used for training was 500. 

Furthermore, the context mentions that data augmentation was applied to enhance sample variation, which included rotation, reflectance bias of ±10%, and random noise of ±10% reflectance for 15% of the input image. Early stopping criteria was applied if no improvement was found in 50 epochs.
