Answer:::
The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. However, it does mention the hyperparameters tuned for a species-specific model using Bayesian optimization, which are:

* "mtry" (number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split)
* "min.node.size" (minimum size of terminal nodes)
* "num.trees" (number of trees to grow)

These hyperparameters are specific to the "ranger" R package and are used in the context of random forest modeling, not deep learning. Therefore, I do not have information on the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model.
