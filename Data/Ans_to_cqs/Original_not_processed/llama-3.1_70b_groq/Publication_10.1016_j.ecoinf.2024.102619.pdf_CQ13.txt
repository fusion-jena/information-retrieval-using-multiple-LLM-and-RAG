Answer:::

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, specifically the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), are as follows:

* Batch size: 32 images
* Loss function: Cross-entropy loss
* Optimizer: Adam learning rate optimizer
* Initial learning rate: 1e-03 (which is automatically adjusted by the Adam optimizer during training)
* Number of epochs: Initially set to 100, but with early stopping enabled if the validation error (loss) does not reduce for 10 epochs. The actual number of epochs used for each dataset was 14, 14, and 23 epochs for Datasets 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

These hyperparameters were chosen based on preliminary work, which showed that common default parameters were suitable for the data. The Adam optimizer was chosen for its computational efficiency and ease of use.
