Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the rising number of digitized herbarium sheets provides an opportunity to employ computer-based image processing techniques, such as deep learning. This suggests that the raw data in this specific context is likely collected through the digitization of herbarium sheets, which are essentially scanned images of plant specimens. 

There is no mention of surveys, sensors, or public datasets as methods for collecting raw data in this context. The focus is on utilizing existing digitized herbarium sheets as the source of raw data for deep learning applications, such as identifying species and extracting other useful information from the images.
