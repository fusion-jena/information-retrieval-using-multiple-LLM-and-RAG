Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the challenges of underwater optical images, the limitations of the original YOLOv8 network, and the introduction of new methods to improve feature extraction and object detection.

However, it can be inferred that the deep learning pipeline likely involves some form of annotation, as the context mentions the importance of extracting accurate feature information and detecting objects correctly. But the specific annotation techniques used are not mentioned.

Therefore, I don't know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context.
