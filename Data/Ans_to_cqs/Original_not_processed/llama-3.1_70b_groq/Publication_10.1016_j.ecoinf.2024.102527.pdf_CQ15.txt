Answer:::
The optimization technique applied in the deep learning pipeline is the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer with a momentum value of Î¼ = 0.9. This is mentioned in the context as the optimizer used to train the model. There is no mention of Adam or any other optimization techniques being used in the pipeline.
