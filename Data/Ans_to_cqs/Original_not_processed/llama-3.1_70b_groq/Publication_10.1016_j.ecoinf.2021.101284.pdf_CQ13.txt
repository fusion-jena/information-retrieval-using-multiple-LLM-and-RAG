Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate and optimizer. The text appears to be a research paper discussing the use of machine learning models, including multiple linear regression (MLR) models, to analyze data related to COVID-19 and air pollution. However, it does not provide information on the specific hyperparameters used in a deep learning model. The only mention of a deep learning model is in a reference to a paper by Castillo (2020), but the text does not provide details on the hyperparameters used in that model.
