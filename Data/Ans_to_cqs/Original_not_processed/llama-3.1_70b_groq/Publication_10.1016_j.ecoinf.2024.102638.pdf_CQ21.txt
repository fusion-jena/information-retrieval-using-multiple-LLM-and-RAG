Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the hyperparameter optimization process, model selection, and performance evaluation of various prediction models.

However, it does mention that the performance metrics detailed in Section 2.5 are meticulously evaluated using the designated test set. This suggests that some form of metrics calculation is performed, but the specific details are not provided.

Additionally, the context mentions that the negative mean square error is set as the target measure during the five-fold cross-validation process. This implies that some form of error calculation is performed, but it is not clear if this is part of a larger postprocessing step.

Regarding saliency maps and confusion matrices, there is no mention of these in the provided context. Therefore, it is unclear if these are part of the postprocessing steps involved after model training.

In summary, while the context provides some information on performance evaluation and metrics calculation, it does not provide a comprehensive overview of the postprocessing steps involved after model training.
