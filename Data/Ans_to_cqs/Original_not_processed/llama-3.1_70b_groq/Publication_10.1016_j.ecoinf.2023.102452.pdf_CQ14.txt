Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the use of Genetic Programming (GP) for input variable selection and modeling, as well as the use of the Eureka Pro software for GP modeling. However, it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
