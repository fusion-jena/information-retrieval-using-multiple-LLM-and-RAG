Answer: The text mentions several metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, including:

* Classification accuracy: This is the overall accuracy of the model in correctly classifying images.
* Class-wise metrics: This refers to metrics that are calculated separately for each class or species, such as FPR (False Positive Rate) values for larger classes.
* FPR (False Positive Rate) values: This metric measures the proportion of false positives (i.e., incorrect classifications) for a particular class or species.

Additionally, the text mentions that other studies have reported metrics such as precision and recall, but these are not explicitly mentioned as being used in the current study.

It's worth noting that the text also highlights the limitations of relying solely on classification accuracy as a metric, as it may not capture subtle errors or nuances in the model's performance, particularly for important or endangered species.
