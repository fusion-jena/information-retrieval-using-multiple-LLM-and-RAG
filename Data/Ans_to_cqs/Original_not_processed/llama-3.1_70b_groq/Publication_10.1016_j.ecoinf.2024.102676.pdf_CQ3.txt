Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the authors' contributions, methodology, and references, as well as the potential of utilizing lower-quality data in the Footprint Identification Technique (FIT) method. It does mention the use of machine learning and deep learning models, but it does not provide details on the data annotation techniques employed. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
