Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the use of synthetic data for training a deep learning model, the importance of data augmentation, and the application of the model for fuel model retrieval.

However, it does mention that a few samples of real MS point clouds are segmented using the methodology exposed in Section 2.3 to create a ground truth for validating the classifications using a deep learning model trained with synthetic data. This suggests that some form of annotation or labeling is performed on the data, but the specific techniques used are not specified.

Therefore, I do not know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.
