Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide some general information on the topic.

In the context of deep learning for ecology, data annotation is a crucial step in preparing datasets for training machine learning models. The type of annotation technique used depends on the specific task, such as image classification, object detection, or segmentation.

Some common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include:

* Bounding box annotation: This involves drawing a rectangular box around the object of interest in an image.
* Instance segmentation: This involves annotating each instance of an object in an image, including its boundaries and class label.
* Semantic segmentation: This involves annotating each pixel in an image with a class label, such as foreground or background.

While the provided context mentions the use of deep learning in ecology, it does not provide specific details on the data annotation techniques used. Therefore, I cannot provide a more detailed answer to this query.

It is worth noting that the paper by Wäldchen and Mäder (2018) mentions the use of machine learning for image-based species identification, but it does not provide details on the data annotation techniques used in their study.
