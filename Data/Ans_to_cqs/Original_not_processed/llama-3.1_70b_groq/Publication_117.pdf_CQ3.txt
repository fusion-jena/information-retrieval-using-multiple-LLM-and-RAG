Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the images were "tiled into 864 Ã— 864 subimages and then passed though a version of the YOLO DCNN using pretrained weights from the COCO dataset." This suggests that the deep learning pipeline used object detection, which typically involves bounding box annotation.

Additionally, the context mentions that the object detections were filtered by discarding any object detections that did not correspond to an identification from the Zooniverse data. This implies that the citizen science data was used to validate the object detections, but it does not provide information on the specific annotation techniques used.

Therefore, while we can infer that object detection with bounding box annotation was likely used, we cannot provide a definitive answer on the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
