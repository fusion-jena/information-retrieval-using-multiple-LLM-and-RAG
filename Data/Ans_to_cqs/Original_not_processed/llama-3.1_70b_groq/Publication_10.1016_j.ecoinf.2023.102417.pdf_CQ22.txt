Answer:::
The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are:

1. Classification accuracy: This metric gives a ratio of the correct classifications and all classifications, describing the percentage of correct classifications.
2. Intersection over Union (IoU): Also referred to as Jaccard Index, this metric is used to overcome the issue of unbalanced datasets, where the classification accuracy may not be significant. IoU is calculated as the ratio of the intersection of the predicted and actual classes to their union.
3. Precision: This metric measures the proportion of true positives among all predicted positive instances.
4. Recall: This metric measures the proportion of true positives among all actual positive instances.
5. F1-score: This metric is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of both.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the model on the Johnsbachtal dataset, with results showing an accuracy of 88.56% and a mIoU of 74.87% for the camera dataset, and an accuracy of 91.39% and a mIoU of 80.16% for the mobile phone dataset.
