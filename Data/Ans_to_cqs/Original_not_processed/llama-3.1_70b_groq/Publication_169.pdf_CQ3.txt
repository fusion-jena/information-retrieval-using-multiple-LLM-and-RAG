Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and applications of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and their variants, such as CNN-LSTM, in image recognition and plant species identification tasks.

However, it does mention the use of data augmentation to allow for the extraction of deep features and accurate identification of classes. Data augmentation is a technique used to artificially increase the size of a training dataset by applying random transformations to the existing images, such as rotation, scaling, and flipping. This can help improve the robustness and generalization of the model, but it is not a data annotation technique per se.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
