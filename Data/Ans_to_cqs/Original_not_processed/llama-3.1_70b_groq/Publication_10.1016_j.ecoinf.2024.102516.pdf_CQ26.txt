Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention data augmentation, specifically horizontal flipping, which is used in phase 1 of the network setup. This technique can help increase the diversity of the training data, but it is not explicitly stated as a method to address data bias.

Additionally, the context mentions that the network is trained on a dedicated plant cover dataset, and that the ImageNet dataset is used for pre-training. This suggests that the authors may be using transfer learning to leverage the knowledge gained from the larger ImageNet dataset to improve performance on their specific task. However, this is not directly related to addressing data bias.

The context does mention that annotating images for plant cover estimation is highly laborious, which could imply that data bias may be a concern due to limited training data. However, no specific techniques are mentioned to address this issue.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know what specific techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, beyond the use of horizontal flipping for data augmentation.
