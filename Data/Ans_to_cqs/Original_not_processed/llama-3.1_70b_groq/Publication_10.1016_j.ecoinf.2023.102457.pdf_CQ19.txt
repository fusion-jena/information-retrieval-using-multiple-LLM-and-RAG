The context does not explicitly mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model and code were run in Python version 3.10, and the code is based on the methods presented in the GitHub repository https://github.com/kahst/BirdNET-Analyzer. This suggests that the framework used might be compatible with Python, but the exact framework is not specified.
