Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The text only mentions that one of the applications of the approach could be automatic annotation of data, but it does not provide details on the specific techniques used.

However, it is mentioned that the dataset was used to verify whether the proposed approach can handle the issue of annotation, and that the dataset was shared by Jiang et al. (2020) through a Github repository. This suggests that the dataset may have been annotated using some technique, but the specific technique is not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.
