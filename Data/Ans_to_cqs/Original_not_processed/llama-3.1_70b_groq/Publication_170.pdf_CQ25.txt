Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is image classification, specifically to automatically filter empty camera images and identify images with wildlife. The model is trained to recognize and classify images, allowing it to distinguish between empty images and those containing wildlife. This is evident from the context, which mentions the use of a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model, specifically the AlexNet model, to classify images. The study aims to use this model to reduce the time and labor required to manually classify images from camera traps, which is a common challenge in wildlife surveys.
