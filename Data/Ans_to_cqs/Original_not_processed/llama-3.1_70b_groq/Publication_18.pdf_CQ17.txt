Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss two techniques used to overcome the limitations of building a dataset from scratch: Transfer learning and data-augmentation.

While data-augmentation is mentioned as a technique to increase the robustness and generalization capacity of CNNs, it is not typically considered a regularization method. Transfer learning is also not a regularization method, but rather a technique to leverage pre-trained models.

The context does not provide information on regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.

However, I can suggest that the mentioned papers and references might be related to the broader topic of deep learning and CNNs, but the specific information on regularization methods is not present in the provided context.
