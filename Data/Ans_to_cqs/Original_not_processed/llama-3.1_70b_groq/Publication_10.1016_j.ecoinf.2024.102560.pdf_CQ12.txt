Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It mentions the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in a study by Rahimi and Breuste (2021) for prognostic modeling with land-use data, but it does not provide information on the specific architecture of the model (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer).
