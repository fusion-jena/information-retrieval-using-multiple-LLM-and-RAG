Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on species distribution modeling, climatic suitability, and the use of various machine learning algorithms such as Maximum Entropy, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and others. 

However, it does mention the use of "coordinates" and "Georeferenced occurrence record of the species" which suggests that the data may be collected through field observations or surveys, but this is not explicitly stated. Additionally, the context mentions the use of QGIS for cropping bioclimatic layers, which implies that the data may be obtained from public datasets or other sources, but again, this is not explicitly stated.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to the query.
