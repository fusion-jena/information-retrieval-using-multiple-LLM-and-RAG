Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that a "retained test set of images annotated manually" is used for evaluation, and a "held-out test set" is used to evaluate the performance of a ResNet-50 classifier. This suggests that the data is split into training and test sets, but the exact criteria for splitting the data is not specified.

In general, common practices for splitting data into training, validation, and test sets include:

* Random splitting: randomly assigning a portion of the data to each set
* Stratified splitting: splitting the data in a way that maintains the same class distribution in each set
* K-fold cross-validation: splitting the data into k folds, using k-1 folds for training and 1 fold for testing, and repeating the process k times

However, without more information, it is not possible to determine the specific criteria used in this case.
