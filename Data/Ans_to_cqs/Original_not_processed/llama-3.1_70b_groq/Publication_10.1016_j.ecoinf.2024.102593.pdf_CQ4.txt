Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the use of embeddings for model selection, active learning, and understanding deep neural networks (DNNs). It discusses the application of DNNs in bioacoustics, specifically for bird species classification, and mentions various techniques like transfer learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the query.
