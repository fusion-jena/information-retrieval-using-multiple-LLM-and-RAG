Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily discusses the performance of the WT-HMM model with different dataset sizes, the importance of selecting appropriate sample sizes for effective model training, and the use of F1-score to evaluate model performance. It does not provide information on the stopping criteria used during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
