Answer: 
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. It appears to focus on the processing and encryption of satellite image data, as well as the performance of a CNN model on both plain and encrypted data. The context does mention the use of a dataset, but it does not provide information on how the data was collected. Therefore, I do not know the specific methods used for collecting raw data in this particular deep learning pipeline.
