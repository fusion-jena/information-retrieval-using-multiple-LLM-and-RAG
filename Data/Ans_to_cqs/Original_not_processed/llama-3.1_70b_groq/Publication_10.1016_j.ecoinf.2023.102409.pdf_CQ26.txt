Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the architecture of the Unet model, its components, and the configuration of the model's hyperparameters. It also provides some background information on the topic of image segmentation, fractional vegetation coverage, and ecological restoration in arid regions.

However, it does mention the use of a batch size of 2 and the Adam optimizer, which could be related to preprocessing or training the model, but it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias.

Therefore, I do not know the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline in this context.
