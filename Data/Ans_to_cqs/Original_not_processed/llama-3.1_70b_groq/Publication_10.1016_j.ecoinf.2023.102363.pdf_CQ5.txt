Answer:::
The text does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention that the EfficientNet B0 network was pre-trained for generic image classification, suggesting that it was trained on a large-scale image dataset, but the specific dataset is not specified. Additionally, the text mentions that the network is fine-tuned on a novel spectrogram representation of audio data, specifically PAM ( Passive Acoustic Monitoring) data frames, which is a domain-specific dataset.
