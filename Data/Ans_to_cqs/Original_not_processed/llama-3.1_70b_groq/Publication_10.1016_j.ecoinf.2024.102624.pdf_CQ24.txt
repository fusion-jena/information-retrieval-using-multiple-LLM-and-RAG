Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context appears to focus on the application of machine learning techniques, such as Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), to ecological informatics, particularly in the classification of plant populations using remote sensing data.

However, it does mention the use of k-fold cross-validation (KCV) in the model-building and accuracy assessment phase, which is a common technique used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models and reduce the impact of randomness in the data. Additionally, the context mentions the importance of involving machine learning techniques to gain better accuracy, but it does not provide specific strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
