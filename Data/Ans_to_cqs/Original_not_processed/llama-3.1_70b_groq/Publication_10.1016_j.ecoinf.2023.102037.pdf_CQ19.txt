Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the framework used to build the deep learning model. However, it does mention YOLOv5, which is a deep learning model for object detection, and it is typically implemented in PyTorch. Additionally, the context mentions CUDA Version 11.4, which is a parallel computing platform and programming model developed by NVIDIA, and is often used with PyTorch. Therefore, it can be inferred that PyTorch might be the framework used, but it is not explicitly stated.
