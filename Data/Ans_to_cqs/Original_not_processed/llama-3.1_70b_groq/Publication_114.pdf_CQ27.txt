Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It only discusses the performance of different deep learning algorithms (VGG16, ResNet50, and AlexNet) in classifying tree species and the results obtained from the VGG16 model. The context also mentions that the VGG16 network at 140,000 iterations was employed as the classification model for tree species prediction, but it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed.
