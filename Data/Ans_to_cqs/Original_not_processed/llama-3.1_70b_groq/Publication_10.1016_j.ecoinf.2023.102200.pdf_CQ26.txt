Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on various applications of remote sensing, LiDAR data, and deep learning methods for tasks such as image segmentation, object detection, and classification.

However, I can provide some general information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. Common techniques used to address data bias include:

* Stratified splitting: dividing the data into subsets based on the class labels to ensure that each subset has a similar class distribution.
* Oversampling: increasing the number of samples from the minority class to balance the class distribution.
* Undersampling: reducing the number of samples from the majority class to balance the class distribution.
* Diverse data collection: collecting data from diverse sources or environments to reduce bias.

These techniques are commonly used in machine learning and deep learning pipelines to address data bias and improve model performance. However, I couldn't find any specific information on these techniques being used in the provided context.

If you're looking for more specific information on data bias and preprocessing techniques in the context of remote sensing and LiDAR data, I recommend consulting additional resources or research papers on the topic.
