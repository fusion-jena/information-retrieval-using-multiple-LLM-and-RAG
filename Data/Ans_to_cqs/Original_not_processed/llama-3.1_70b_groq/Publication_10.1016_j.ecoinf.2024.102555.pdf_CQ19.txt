Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, remote sensing, and climate change, with references to various research papers and studies. However, it does not provide information on the technical details of building a deep learning model, such as the frameworks used. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
