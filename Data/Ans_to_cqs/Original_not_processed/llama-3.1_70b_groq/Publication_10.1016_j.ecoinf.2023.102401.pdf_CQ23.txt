Answer:

To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the model was trained on a diverse dataset, specifically the URPC dataset, which consists of 1201 images with four object categories: holothurian, echinus, scallop, and starfish. This diversity in the dataset helps the model learn robust features that can generalize well to different scenarios.

Additionally, the dataset was split into training and test sets following an 8:2 ratio, with 956 images used for training and 244 images used for testing. This division allows for a comprehensive assessment of the algorithm's performance.

Furthermore, the model was also tested on five additional datasets, including Aquarium, Trash-ICRA19, VisDrone, NWPU VHR-10, and HRSID, to evaluate its generalization capabilities. These datasets are diverse in terms of their categories, with some being part of the Marine Dataset and others being from different domains.

Lastly, data augmentation techniques were used to introduce diversity into the training dataset, enabling the model to learn robust features and improve its performance in real-world scenarios. The hyperparameters used for data augmentation are specified in Table 2, which includes the ranges and probabilities for each augmentation technique.

Overall, the combination of a diverse dataset, stratified splitting, and testing on additional datasets, along with data augmentation techniques, helps ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
