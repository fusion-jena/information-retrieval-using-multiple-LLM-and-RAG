Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. The context appears to be a collection of research papers and articles related to coral reefs, marine ecology, and machine learning, but it does not provide information on the deployment process of a specific deep learning model. The only mention of a deep learning model is in the paper by Do and Tran (2023), but it only discusses the combination of a deep learning model with an optimization algorithm for detecting the dispersal of spotted butterfish, without providing details on the deployment process.
