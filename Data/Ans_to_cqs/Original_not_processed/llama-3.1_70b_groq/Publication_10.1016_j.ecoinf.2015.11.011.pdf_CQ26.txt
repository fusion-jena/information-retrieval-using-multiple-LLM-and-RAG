Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing and ecological informatics, discussing topics such as segmentation and classification, scale sensitivity, and the use of historical imagery. It does not provide information on techniques like Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection.

However, it does mention the importance of validation and supervision using aerial photo interpretation techniques or other data sources, even with machine learning approaches. This suggests that the authors are aware of the need for careful consideration of data quality and bias, but do not provide specific techniques for addressing these issues.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
