Answer:::

The provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention several weed image datasets that are used for weed/weed-crop recognition tasks. These datasets include:

* DeepWeeds: a multiclass weed species image dataset for deep learning
* CropAndWeed dataset
* A dataset collected by Olaniyi et al. (2023) containing 36,374 RGB images from maize farmlands

Additionally, the context mentions a GitHub repository (https://github.com/vicdxxx/Weed-Datasets-Survey-2023) that provides links to several public weed image datasets for weed/weed-crop recognition.

It's worth noting that the context does not mention the use of MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet datasets, which are commonly used in deep learning pipelines for image classification tasks.
