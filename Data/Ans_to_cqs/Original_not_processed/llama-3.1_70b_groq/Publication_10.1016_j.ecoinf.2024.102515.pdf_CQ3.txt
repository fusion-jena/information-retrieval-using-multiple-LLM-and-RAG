Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to focus on the acquisition and processing of tweets for biodiversity observations, using techniques such as filtering out invalid tweets, eliminating tweets with images in GIF format, and searching for specific keywords and hashtags. It does not delve into the specifics of data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this query.
