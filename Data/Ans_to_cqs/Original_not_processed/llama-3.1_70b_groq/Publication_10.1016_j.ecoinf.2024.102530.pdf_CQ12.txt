Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model in the pipeline, nor does it mention any specific types of deep learning models such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. The context appears to be related to a fuzzy inference system (FIS) model, specifically an Apis-FIS model, which is used for decision-making and is implemented using the fuzzy logic toolbox of Matlab 2023b. There is no mention of deep learning models or their application in the pipeline.
