Answer: I don't know. The provided context does not mention the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to remote sensing and satellite image data, specifically discussing the use of MODIS products, Landsat-8, GF-1, and Sentinel-2A satellite images for estimating leaf area index (LAI) and other ecological parameters. There is no mention of deep learning pipelines or the datasets typically used in such pipelines.
