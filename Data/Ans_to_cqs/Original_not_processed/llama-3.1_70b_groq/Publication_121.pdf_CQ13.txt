Answer:::
The provided context mentions the optimizer used in the deep learning model, but it does not provide information about the learning rate. 

For the model with the base model of MobileNetV2, the Adam optimizer was used. For the models with the base model of MobileNetV3, the Gradient descent optimizer was used. 

Additionally, a dropout layer with a dropout rate of 0.2 was used to reduce the overfitting of the model. 

However, the learning rate is not mentioned in the provided context.
