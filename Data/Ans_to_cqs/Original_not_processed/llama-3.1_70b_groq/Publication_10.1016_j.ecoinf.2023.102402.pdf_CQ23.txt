Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or any measures taken to ensure its generalizability. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling (SDMs) and the evaluation of model performance using metrics such as the Area Under the receiver-operator Curve (AUC) and True Skill Statistics (TSS). The context mentions the use of multiple databases (e.g., GBIF, iNaturalist, OBIS, AQUAMAPS) for model validation, but it does not provide information on the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
