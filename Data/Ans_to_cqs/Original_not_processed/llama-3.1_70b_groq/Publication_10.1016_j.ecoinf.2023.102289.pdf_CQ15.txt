Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the LaDeco model, the use of pre-trained models, and the functionality of the semantic segmentation algorithm. It also discusses the use of MXNet and GluonCV, but does not delve into the specifics of optimization techniques.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
