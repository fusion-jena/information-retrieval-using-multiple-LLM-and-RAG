Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of a neural network, specifically the convolutional layer and pooling layer, as well as the use of attention mechanisms and transfer learning to improve the model's performance.

However, it does mention the use of auxiliary data, such as climate or soil characteristics, to fortify the neural network's generalization capability, which could be related to addressing data bias. But it does not provide specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
