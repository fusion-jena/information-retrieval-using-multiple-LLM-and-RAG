Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of augmentation techniques, including rotation, flipping, and brightness adjustments, to improve network generalization. This suggests that the authors are aware of the importance of handling randomness and variability in the data, but the specific strategies used to handle randomness in the pipeline are not mentioned.

It is worth noting that the use of an Adam optimizer, which is a stochastic optimization algorithm, implies that there is some level of randomness involved in the training process. However, the context does not provide information on how this randomness is controlled or managed.

In general, common strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines include setting a random seed value, using techniques such as data augmentation, and employing regularization techniques to prevent overfitting. However, without more information, it is not possible to determine which specific strategies were employed in this case.
