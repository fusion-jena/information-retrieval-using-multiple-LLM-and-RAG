Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context discusses the use of various species distribution models (SDMs) such as MaxEnt, GLM, GAM, RF, GBM, XGB, LGBM, and ANN, but it does not provide information on the specific techniques used to ensure generalizability, such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. It only mentions that the models require large amounts of observational data for the target species to learn appropriate environmental characteristics and that data shortage can lead to poor prediction performance due to overfitting or generalization failure.
