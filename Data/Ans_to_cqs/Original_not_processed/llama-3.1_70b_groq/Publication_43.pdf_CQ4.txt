Answer:::

Data augmentation techniques are used to artificially increase the number of samples in the training set by applying specific deformations on the input images. According to the provided context, the following data augmentation techniques are mentioned:

1. Rotation: This involves rotating the input images by a certain angle to create new samples.
2. Flipping: This involves flipping the input images horizontally or vertically to create new samples.
3. Translation: This involves moving the input images by a certain amount in the x or y direction to create new samples.
4. Cropping: This involves cropping a portion of the input image to create a new sample.
5. Changing the brightness of the pixels: This involves adjusting the brightness of the input images to create new samples.

These techniques are used to increase the size of the training dataset, which can improve the performance of the CNN model and make it more robust to changes in scales, brightness, and geometrical distortions. However, it is worth noting that the set of valid transformations that improves the performance of the CNN model depends on the particularities of the problem.
