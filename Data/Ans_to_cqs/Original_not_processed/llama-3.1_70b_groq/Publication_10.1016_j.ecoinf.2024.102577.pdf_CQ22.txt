Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the models are mean accuracy and standard deviation, as shown in Table 4. The mean accuracies and standard deviations of the 5 Ã— 10-fold cross-validations for each method and species are reported. However, it is not specified whether other metrics such as precision and recall are used to evaluate the performance of the models.
