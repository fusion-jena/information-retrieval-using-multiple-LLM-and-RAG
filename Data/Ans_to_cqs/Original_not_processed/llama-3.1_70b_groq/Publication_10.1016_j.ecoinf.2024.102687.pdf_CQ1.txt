Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the use of pre-trained CNN backbones, meta-learning algorithms, and the challenges of automatic identification of biophonic sources in soundscape recordings. It mentions the use of datasets such as ImageNet and the potential benefits of using features extracted from models trained on smaller but more specific datasets, like bird sound datasets. However, it does not provide information on the methods used for collecting raw data.

Therefore, I do not know the specific methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets, as this information is not provided in the given context.
