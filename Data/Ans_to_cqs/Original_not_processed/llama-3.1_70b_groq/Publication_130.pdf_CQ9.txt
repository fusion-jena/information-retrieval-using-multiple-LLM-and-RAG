The provided context does not mention the specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it does mention that a detailed explanation of the developed setup is available at github.com/AndreCFerreira/Bird_individualID. This suggests that the code and possibly some data or documentation related to the pipeline might be available on GitHub, but it does not provide information on a specific data repository like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
