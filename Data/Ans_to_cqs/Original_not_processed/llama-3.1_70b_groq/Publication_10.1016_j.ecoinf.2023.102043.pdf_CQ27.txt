Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context mainly discusses the data collection, preprocessing, and the use of YAMNet for goat vocalization detection. It also mentions the division of the dataset for training, validation, and testing purposes, but it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
