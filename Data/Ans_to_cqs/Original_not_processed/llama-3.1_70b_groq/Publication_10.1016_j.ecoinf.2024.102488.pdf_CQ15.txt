Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be related to remote sensing, feature selection, and classification models, but it does not discuss deep learning or optimization techniques specifically. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question based on the given context.
