Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The text primarily focuses on the model training process, optimization of parameters, and the implications of the proposed model on wildlife research. It does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
