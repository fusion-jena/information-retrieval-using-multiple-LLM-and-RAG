Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of feature elimination techniques, specifically Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Variable Selection Using Random Forests (VSURF), to select the most relevant variables for the model.

It also mentions the use of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as a termination condition for model performance, but it does not provide information on data normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I can only confirm that feature elimination techniques are used, but I do not know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training the model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.
