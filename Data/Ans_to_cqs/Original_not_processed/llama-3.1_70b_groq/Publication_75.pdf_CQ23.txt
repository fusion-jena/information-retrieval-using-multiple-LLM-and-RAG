Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model was tested on two different datasets (Canadian and local) and that the retrieval experiments involved matching every image with every remaining image in the database. This suggests that the model was evaluated on a diverse set of images, but it does not provide information on cross-validation or stratified splitting. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a complete answer to this question based on the provided context.
