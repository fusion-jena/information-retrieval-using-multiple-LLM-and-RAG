Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. However, it does mention that the model selection procedure involves randomly generating 5 models for each of the four available deep-ANN architecture types, and training each one with a small subset of the training data. This suggests that randomness is introduced in the model generation process, but the specific strategies used to handle randomness are not mentioned.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model with the highest performance is selected for training on the full training data, which implies that some form of evaluation or validation is used to mitigate the effects of randomness. However, the specific details of this process are not provided.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value.
