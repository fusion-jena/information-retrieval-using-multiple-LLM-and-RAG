Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a research article on land use and land cover (LULC) classification using Random Forest and spectral indices, but it does not provide information on deep learning models or their preprocessing steps.

However, it does mention the use of spectral indices such as NDVI, EVI, SAVI, BSI, MNDWI, and NDMI, which are calculated from the spectral bands of the datasets. It also mentions the use of a simplified random sampling strategy for selecting training areas, but this is not directly related to preprocessing steps for deep learning models.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
