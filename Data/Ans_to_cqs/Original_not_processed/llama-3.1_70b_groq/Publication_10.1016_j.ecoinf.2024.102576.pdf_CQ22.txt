Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. It only mentions that the "classification accuracy and performance improved as data increased during the training of a deep learning model using satellite imageries over multiple periods" (Kim et al., 2021b). This suggests that accuracy is one of the metrics used to evaluate the model's performance, but it does not provide information on other metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, etc. Therefore, I can only confirm that accuracy is one of the metrics used, but I don't know about the other metrics.
