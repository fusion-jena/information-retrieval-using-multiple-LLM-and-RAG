Answer: The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically a pre-trained ResNet-50 model. This is evident from the text, which mentions that "We trialled three depths, ResNet-18, 50 and 101, and compared their training times and validation accuracies" and that "ResNet-50 is made up of five convolutional blocks stacked on top of one another". This suggests that the model is a type of CNN, which is a common architecture for image classification tasks.
