Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the labeled pixels of the UAV hyperspectral image are split into the training set and test set with a ratio of 1:9. This suggests that the data is split in a way that may help to prevent overfitting, but it does not specifically address data bias.

The context also mentions that the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to reduce the dimension of the hyperspectral image along the channel dimension. While PCA can help to reduce the impact of noisy or irrelevant features, it is not typically used to address data bias.

In terms of the specific techniques mentioned in the query (Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, Diverse data collection), none of these are explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, it is not possible to say for certain which techniques are used to address data bias in this particular deep learning pipeline.
