Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the model selection procedure, architecture types, and performance metrics. It does mention that the data was randomly partitioned into training, validation, and testing sets, but it does not provide information on how data bias was addressed.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions that the data was randomly partitioned, which could help reduce bias to some extent. But without explicit information on techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
