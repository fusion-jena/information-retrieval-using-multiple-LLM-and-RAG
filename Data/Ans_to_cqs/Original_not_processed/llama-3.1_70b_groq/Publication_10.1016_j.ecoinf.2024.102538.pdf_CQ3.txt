Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and attention mechanisms for sound recognition and bird species classification tasks. It discusses various architectures, such as 3DCNN-LSTM, CRNN, and Xception, but does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I do not know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
