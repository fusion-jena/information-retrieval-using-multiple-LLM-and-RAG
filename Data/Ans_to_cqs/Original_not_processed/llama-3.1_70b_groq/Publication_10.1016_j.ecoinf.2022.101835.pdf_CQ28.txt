Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment platform used for the deep learning model. It only mentions the libraries and frameworks used to build the model, such as Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Optuna, as well as the Python version used (3.8.12). However, it does not provide information on the deployment platform, such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform.
