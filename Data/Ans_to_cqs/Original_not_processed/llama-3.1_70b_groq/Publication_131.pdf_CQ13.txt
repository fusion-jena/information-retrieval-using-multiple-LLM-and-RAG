Answer:::
The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. It only provides information about the architecture of the CNN, including the number of filters per convolution layer, kernel size, and the number of neurons in the fully connected layer. Additionally, it mentions the training and testing data split, but does not provide details about the training process, including the learning rate and optimizer used.
