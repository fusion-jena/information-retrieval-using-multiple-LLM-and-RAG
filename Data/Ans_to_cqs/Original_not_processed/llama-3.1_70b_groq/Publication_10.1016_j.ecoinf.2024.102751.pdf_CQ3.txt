Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to remote sensing, soil moisture estimation, and spatial modeling, but it does not delve into the details of deep learning pipelines or data annotation techniques.

However, it is mentioned that "it would be worthwhile in this context to test various methods of machine learning or deep neural networks" for estimating soil moisture, suggesting that the authors are considering the use of deep learning techniques in their research. Nevertheless, the specific data annotation techniques used in such a pipeline are not discussed.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to the query, and I cannot provide any information on the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
