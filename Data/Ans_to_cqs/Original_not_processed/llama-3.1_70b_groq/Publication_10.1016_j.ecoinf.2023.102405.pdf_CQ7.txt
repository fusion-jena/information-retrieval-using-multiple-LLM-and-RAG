Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention the use of a 10-fold cross-validation technique in Table 6, which suggests that the data is split into training and validation sets multiple times to evaluate the performance of the model.

In general, the criteria used to split data for deep learning model training can vary depending on the specific problem and dataset. However, common practices include:

* Random splitting: Splitting the data randomly into training, validation, and test sets.
* Stratified splitting: Splitting the data in a way that maintains the same proportion of classes in each set.
* K-fold cross-validation: Splitting the data into k subsets and using each subset as a validation set while the remaining subsets are used for training.

The specific criteria used to split the data in the provided context are not mentioned, but it is likely that a random or stratified splitting method was used, followed by 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate the performance of the model.
