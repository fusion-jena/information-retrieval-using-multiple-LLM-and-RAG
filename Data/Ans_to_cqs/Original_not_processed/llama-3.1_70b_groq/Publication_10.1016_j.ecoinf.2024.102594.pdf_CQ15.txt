Answer:::

The DeepLabV3+ algorithm utilizes the Adam optimization technique in combination with the ReduceLROnPlateau learning rate adjustment strategy. This approach was found to accelerate the convergence rate of model training and effectively reduce the risk of overfitting. The ReduceLROnPlateau strategy works by halving the learning rate if the validation loss value does not decrease after 5 consecutive epochs, and terminating the training process if there is no decrease in the validation loss value after 10 consecutive epochs. Additionally, the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm was also experimented with, but Adam in combination with ReduceLROnPlateau was found to be more effective. Other learning rate adjustment strategies, such as StepLR and CosineAnnealingLR, were also explored but not selected.
