Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model performance is evaluated based on the prediction accuracy and loss, as shown in the boxplot of the 10 times 10-fold CV prediction accuracy and loss of each DL classification model in five plant image datasets (Figure 3). 

Additionally, the model loss is computed by compound loss, which is added by softmax cross-entropy and regularization loss. The softmax cross-entropy measures the distance between the predicted distribution and the true distribution, while the regularization loss is inserted to reduce overfitting. This suggests that the model performance is monitored by tracking the loss value and the accuracy during training. However, the specific strategy or metrics used to monitor the model performance in real-time during training is not mentioned in the provided context.
