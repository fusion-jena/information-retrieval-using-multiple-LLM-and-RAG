Answer:::

The provided context mentions the use of annotation in the deep learning pipeline, specifically for image data. According to the text, the annotation technique used is manual labelling of data by assigning keywords/labels to the required areas in the image to assign metadata. The borders of objects were outlined to associate every single pixel of objects in an entire image with a particular tag/label.

The context also mentions the use of Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT) for annotating images, which is developed by Intel for labelling of data. The annotation data was then converted into COCO 1.0 dataset format, which includes object id, image id, category id, segmentation, area, bbox, attributes, etc.

While the context does not explicitly mention bounding box annotation, the mention of "bbox" in the COCO 1.0 dataset format suggests that bounding box annotation is indeed used. Additionally, the context mentions instance segmentation, as the annotation data includes segmentation information.

However, it is worth noting that the context does not provide an exhaustive list of data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions the specific techniques used in this particular research, which includes manual labelling, outlining object borders, and converting annotation data into COCO 1.0 format.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the data annotation techniques used in this research include manual labelling, outlining object borders, and bounding box annotation, as well as instance segmentation. However, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive list of data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
