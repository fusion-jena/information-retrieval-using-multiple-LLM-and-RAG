Answer:::
The provided context mentions that the learning algorithm used in the deep learning pipeline is "usually stochastic gradient decent". This suggests that Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is one of the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does not provide information on other optimization techniques such as Adam.
