Answer: To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model (IUC-NN), several measures were taken. 

Firstly, the dataset was randomly split into a training set (90% of the entries) and a test set (10%). This random splitting helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the model is evaluated on unseen data.

Secondly, 20% of the training set was used for validation. This validation set was used to tune the model's hyperparameters and evaluate its performance during training.

Thirdly, cross-validation was performed by shifting the validation set 5 times. This technique, also known as k-fold cross-validation, helps to evaluate the model's performance on different subsets of the data and provides a more robust estimate of its generalizability.

Lastly, the model was trained on a diverse dataset of species with IUCN Red List assessments and available occurrence records. This diversity in the dataset helps to ensure that the model can generalize well to different species and conservation statuses.

However, it is not mentioned whether stratified splitting was used to ensure that the training and test sets have the same proportion of species with different conservation statuses.
