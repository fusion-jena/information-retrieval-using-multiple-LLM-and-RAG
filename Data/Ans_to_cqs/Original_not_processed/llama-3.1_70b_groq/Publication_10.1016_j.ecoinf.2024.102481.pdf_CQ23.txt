Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not provide information on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context appears to be discussing the evaluation of a model's performance using metrics such as Cohen's kappa coefficient, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence, but it does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the model's generalizability.

However, it does mention that the model performance was evaluated using the Out-of-Bag (OOB) error and a confusion matrix, which suggests that some form of cross-validation may have been used. But without further information, it is impossible to say for certain what measures were taken to ensure the model's generalizability.

Additionally, the context mentions that the data used is confidential, which may limit the ability to assess the generalizability of the model.
