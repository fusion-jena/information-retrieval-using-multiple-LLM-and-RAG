Answer: I don't know. The provided context does not mention any specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to a study on estimating Above-Ground Biomass (AGB) using machine learning algorithms, specifically XGBoost and LightGBM, with a dataset consisting of 268 sample plots with 39 features.
