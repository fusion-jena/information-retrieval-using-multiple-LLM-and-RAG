Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, the pipeline uses a ResNet50 architecture with added Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) for the ImageNet baseline model, and a segmentation network for the segmentation pre-training approach.
