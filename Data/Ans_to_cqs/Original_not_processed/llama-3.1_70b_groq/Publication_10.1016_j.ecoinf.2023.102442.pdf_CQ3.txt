Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does mention the use of deep learning techniques for detecting artisanal small-scale mining in Ghana using Sentinel-2 data (Elmes et al., 2020) and mapping artisanal and small-scale mines at large scale from space with deep learning (Couttenier et al., 2022). These studies likely employed some form of data annotation, but the specific techniques used are not specified in the provided context.
