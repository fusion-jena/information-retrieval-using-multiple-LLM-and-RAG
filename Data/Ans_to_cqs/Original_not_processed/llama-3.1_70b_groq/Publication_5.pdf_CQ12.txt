Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly stated as a specific architecture like CNN, RNN, or Transformer. However, it is mentioned that the proposed models were based on the most typical type of neural network, using pixel-wise inputs due to the characteristics of the data used in this study. Additionally, it is mentioned that general image-based CNN architectures may not be appropriate for the data used in this study, and alternative approaches such as one-dimensional CNN, recurrent neural networks, or graph convolutional networks could be interesting topics for future research.
