Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The given text primarily focuses on the performance of the model, comparison with other research, and the flowchart of the deep learning approach. However, it does mention the calculation of user's and producer's accuracies, which suggests that some form of metrics calculation and possibly confusion matrix analysis might have been performed. 

Additionally, the text mentions the use of a flowchart (Figure 2) that includes three main steps for the identification of tree species based on deep learning approaches. However, the details of these steps are not provided in the given context.

Therefore, based on the provided information, we can only confirm that metrics calculation (in the form of user's and producer's accuracies) might have been performed, but the exact postprocessing steps involved after the model training are not explicitly mentioned.
