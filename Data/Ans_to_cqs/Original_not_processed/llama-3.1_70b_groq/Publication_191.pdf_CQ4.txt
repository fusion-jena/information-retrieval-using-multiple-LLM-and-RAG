Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The text primarily focuses on the limitations of existing plant datasets, the performance of various classifiers, and the exploration of local responses of individual filters in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It also provides a brief overview of deep learning and its application in plant identification.

However, it can be inferred that data augmentation techniques might be necessary to improve the performance of deep learning models, especially when dealing with limited datasets like the PlantClef2015 dataset. Common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, and color jittering. These techniques can help increase the size of the training dataset and reduce overfitting.

Unfortunately, without more information, it is impossible to determine the specific data augmentation techniques applied in this particular deep learning pipeline.
