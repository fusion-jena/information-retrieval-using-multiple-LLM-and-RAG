Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the effectiveness of single-algorithm ensemble methods and mixed-based algorithm ensembles in improving the predictability of Machine Learning (ML)-based Landslide Susceptibility Mapping (LSM). It also mentions the use of heterogeneous ensemble techniques to combine predictions of multiple models and improve overall performance.

However, it does mention that the authors plan to investigate the scalability and transferability of ensemble techniques and compare their performance with deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN) in the future. But it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
