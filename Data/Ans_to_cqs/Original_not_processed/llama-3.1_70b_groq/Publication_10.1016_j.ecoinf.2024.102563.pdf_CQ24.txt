Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing, digital soil mapping, and image classification, with some references to machine learning and deep learning techniques.

However, I can provide some general information on handling randomness in deep learning pipelines. In deep learning, randomness can arise from various sources, including random weight initialization, dropout, and data augmentation. To handle randomness, researchers often employ techniques such as:

1. Setting a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results.
2. Using techniques like batch normalization to reduce the effect of random weight initialization.
3. Employing regularization techniques, such as dropout, to prevent overfitting.
4. Using ensemble methods, such as bagging or boosting, to combine the predictions of multiple models trained on different random subsets of the data.

However, without more specific information from the provided context, I cannot provide a more detailed answer to the query.
