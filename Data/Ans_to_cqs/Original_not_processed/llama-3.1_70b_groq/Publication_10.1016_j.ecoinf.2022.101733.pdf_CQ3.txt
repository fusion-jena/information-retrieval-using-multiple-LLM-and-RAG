Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily discusses the use of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for classification tasks, feature batches used for analysis, and the challenges of gathering training samples in remote environments. It does mention that researchers may employ image interpretation for sample selection, but it does not provide details on the specific annotation techniques used. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to this question.
