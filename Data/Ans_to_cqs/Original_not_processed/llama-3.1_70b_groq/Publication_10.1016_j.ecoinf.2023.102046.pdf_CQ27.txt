Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the model selection, training, and fine-tuning of various deep learning models, including ResNet-50, Inception-V3, and ViT. It discusses the dataset used, optimizer selection, learning rate, and batch size, but it does not provide information on model deployment.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
