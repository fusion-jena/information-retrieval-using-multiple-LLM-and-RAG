Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics and spatial modeling, and it discusses various methods and functions for analyzing and modeling data, such as the ppmlasso package and the Loop methods. However, it does not provide information on the specific techniques used to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model.

That being said, the context does mention the use of cross-validation, as evidenced by the mention of "n.fits: the number of models to fit through the regularization path" and "median performance individual method". This suggests that some form of model evaluation and validation may have been performed, but it is not clear if this was specifically done to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to the query.
