Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. In fact, the context does not mention deep learning models at all. It discusses the use of random forest, Bayesian logistic regression, MLE logistic regression, and Bayesian GAM models, but does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation.

However, it does mention that a 10-fold cross-validation (CV) was used to calculate the validation scores of the models, with one fold pattern of spatial-CV feature selection. This suggests that the data was split into 10 folds, and each fold was used as a validation set once, while the remaining 9 folds were used as training data. But the exact criteria used to split the data into these folds is not specified.
