Answer:::
I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a collection of research papers and articles related to machine learning, vegetation studies, and remote sensing, but it does not include information about a specific data repository link. Therefore, I am unable to provide a link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other data repository.
