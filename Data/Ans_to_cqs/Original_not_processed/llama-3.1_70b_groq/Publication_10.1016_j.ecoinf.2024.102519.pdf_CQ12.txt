Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It mentions the use of artificial neural networks, but it does not provide further details on the architecture of the neural network. It also mentions the use of other machine learning methods such as genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization algorithms, and support vector machines (SVM), but it does not provide information on the specific type of deep learning model used. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
