Answer:

The provided context does not specifically mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. However, it does mention the use of genetic algorithms (GA) and other optimization techniques in various applications, including the identification of ecological nodes and function optimization.

It mentions that genetic optimization algorithms were used to adjust the hyperparameters to determine the algorithm parameters for a study, but it does not provide information on the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
