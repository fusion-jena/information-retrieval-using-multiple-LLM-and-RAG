Answer: 
The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention that the endemic bird data was "randomly split" into training and testing sets. This suggests that some form of randomness was introduced in the data splitting process, but the specific strategies used to handle this randomness are not mentioned.
