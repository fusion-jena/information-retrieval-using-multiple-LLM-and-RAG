Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The text only mentions that the model's prediction accuracy improved by about 20% after embedding LSTM into the CNN, even without any adjustments to the hyperparameters. However, it does not provide information on the values or settings of these hyperparameters.
