Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the training-testing process was repeated 10 times for each algorithm, and the results of these exploratory analyses are provided in Supplementary Tables S1â€“S6. This suggests that the performance of the models was evaluated and monitored through these repeated testing runs, but the specific strategy or metrics used to monitor performance during training are not specified.
