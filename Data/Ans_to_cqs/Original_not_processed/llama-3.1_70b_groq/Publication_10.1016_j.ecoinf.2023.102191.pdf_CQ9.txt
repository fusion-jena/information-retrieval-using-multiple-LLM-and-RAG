Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific location of the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The text appears to be a research paper discussing a crowdsourcing approach to collecting biodiversity data from recreational SCUBA divers using a mobile app called Dive Reporter. However, it does not provide information on where the data repository is hosted.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
