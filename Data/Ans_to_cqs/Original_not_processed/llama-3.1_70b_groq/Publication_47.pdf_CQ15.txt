Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for IUC-NN. It mentions the use of cross-validation by shifting the validation set 5 times to quantify the average validation cross-entropy loss and accuracy, and that the neural network with the lowest cross-entropy loss was used for predictions. However, it does not specify the optimization algorithm used, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam.
