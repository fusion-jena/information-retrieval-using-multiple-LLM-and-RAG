Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific deep learning frameworks used to build the model. It mentions the use of Word2vec, a word embedding technique, and LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis) spaces, but it does not provide information on the frameworks used to implement these techniques. The context also mentions the use of R packages, such as LSAfun, and Python libraries, such as Fastcluster, but it does not mention any deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
