Answer:::
The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. Specifically, the model consists of 20 layers, including 12 convolutional layers, 5 pooling layers, 1 fully connected layer, 1 LSTM layer, and 1 output layer with a softmax function for classification. The CNN layers are used for extracting features from images, while the LSTM layer is used to analyze time features and support effective aggregation of feature maps for precise classification.
