Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deep learning pipelines or optimization techniques such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be related to wildfire risk assessment, fire indices, and geographic information systems, but it does not provide any information about deep learning or optimization techniques. Therefore, I am unable to provide a specific answer to the query.
