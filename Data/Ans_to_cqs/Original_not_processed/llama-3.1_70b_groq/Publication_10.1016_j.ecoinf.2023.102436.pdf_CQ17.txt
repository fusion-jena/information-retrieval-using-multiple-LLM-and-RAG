Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to landscape planning, ecology, and environmental performance evaluation, with a focus on visual landscape elements and restorative potential. It does mention the use of convolutional neural networks for image-based methods, but it does not provide information on regularization methods.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
