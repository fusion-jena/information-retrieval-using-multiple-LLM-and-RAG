Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context appears to be focused on the results of the model, including the overall accuracy (OA) and kappa values for different models, as well as the reduction rates of OA and kappa in various UAV image models.

However, one of the references mentioned in the context is a paper titled "Enhancing Land Cover/Land Use (LCLU) classification through a comparative analysis of hyperparameters optimization approaches for deep neural network (DNN)". This suggests that the authors may have explored different hyperparameter optimization approaches, such as grid search or random search, but the specific details are not provided in the context.

Therefore, I don't know the specific answer to the query, and more information would be needed to provide a more detailed response.
