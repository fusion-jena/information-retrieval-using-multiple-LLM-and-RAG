Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of Deep Learning techniques, specifically Deep Neural Networks (DNN), for mapping burned areas in the Cerrado biome in Brazil, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
