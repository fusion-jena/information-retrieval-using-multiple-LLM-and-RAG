Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The text discusses the use of a simple CNN architecture, the Adam optimizer, and a learning rate of 0.0005, but it does not provide information on regularization techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
