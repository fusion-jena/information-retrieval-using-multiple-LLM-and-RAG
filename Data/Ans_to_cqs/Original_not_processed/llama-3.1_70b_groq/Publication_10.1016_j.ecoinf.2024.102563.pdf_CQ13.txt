Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. The context appears to be related to a study on classification methods for digital soil mapping, and it discusses the performance of different machine learning algorithms (MLC, SVM, ANN, and RF) using different features and window sizes. However, it does not provide information on the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model.
