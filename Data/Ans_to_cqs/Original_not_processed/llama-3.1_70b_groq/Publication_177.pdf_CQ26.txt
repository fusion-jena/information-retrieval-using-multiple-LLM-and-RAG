Answer: 
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of a "split balancing technique based on instance hardness" (sBal_IH) in one of the references ([33]), which suggests that the authors are aware of the importance of addressing class imbalance in datasets. 

Additionally, the context mentions the use of ensemble methods and stacked ensemble models, which can be used to improve the performance of deep learning models on imbalanced datasets. However, it does not provide specific information on techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
