Answer:::
The methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, as mentioned in the provided context, include the use of GPS devices and Time-Depth Recorders (TDRs). These devices are attached to seabirds, specifically European shags, common guillemots, and razorbills, to collect data on their diving behavior. The GPS devices provide location data, while the TDRs record dive profiles, including depth and duration. This data is then used to train deep neural networks to predict the diving behavior of these seabirds. Additionally, accelerometry data is also mentioned as a type of data that can be used to predict animal behavior, although it is not specifically mentioned as being used in this study.
