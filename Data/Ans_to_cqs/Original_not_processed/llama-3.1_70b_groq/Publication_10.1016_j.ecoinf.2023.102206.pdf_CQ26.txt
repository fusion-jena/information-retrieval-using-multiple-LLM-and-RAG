Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on transfer learning, domain adaptation, and fuzzy logic, with discussions on algorithms such as IFTL, FTL, GRNN, and SVR.

However, I can provide some general information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, although it's not directly related to the provided context. Some common techniques used to address data bias include:

* Stratified splitting: This involves splitting the data into training and testing sets while maintaining the same proportion of classes in both sets.
* Oversampling: This involves creating additional instances of the minority class to balance the dataset.
* Undersampling: This involves reducing the number of instances of the majority class to balance the dataset.
* Diverse data collection: This involves collecting data from diverse sources to reduce bias and increase representation.

Additionally, other techniques such as data augmentation, feature engineering, and using bias-reducing algorithms can also be used to address data bias.

Please note that these techniques are not mentioned in the provided context, and this answer is based on general knowledge of data preprocessing techniques.
