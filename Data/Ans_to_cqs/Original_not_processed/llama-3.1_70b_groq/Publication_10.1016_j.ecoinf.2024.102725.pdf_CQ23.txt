Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context appears to focus on the application of deep-learning enhanced fusion methods for improved NDVI reconstruction and long-term vegetation cover study, as well as the evaluation metrics used to assess the accuracy of the predicted images.

However, it is worth noting that the study utilizes a consistent color ramp and stretch function to render all of the NDVI images, which may help to ensure some level of consistency across the dataset. Additionally, the study employs four evaluation metrics (R2, RMSE, MAE, and ERGAS) to assess and contrast the disparities between the predicted and actual images.

Unfortunately, without more information, it is not possible to provide a more detailed answer to the query.
