Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process of deploying the trained deep learning model. The context only discusses the process of building and optimizing the machine learning models using various libraries such as Scikit-learn, LightGBM, and Optuna, but it does not provide information on how the trained models were deployed.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
