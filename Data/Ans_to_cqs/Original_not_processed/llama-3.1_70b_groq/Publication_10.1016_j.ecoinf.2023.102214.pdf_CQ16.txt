Answer: The criteria used to determine when training is complete is not explicitly stated as a specific validation loss plateau. However, it is mentioned that the model is considered to have converged to its most accurate state after 10-30 "training epochs", whereas the typical duration is between 70 and 250 epochs. This suggests that the training process is stopped when the model's performance on the training data stops improving, which is often referred to as convergence.
