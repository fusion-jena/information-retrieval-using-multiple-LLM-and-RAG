Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the deep learning pipeline or strategies to handle randomness in it. The context only discusses the Random Forest (RF) model, a machine learning algorithm, and its application in regression and classification tasks. It explains the basic idea of RF, its advantages, and the process of building an RF model, including the selection of optimal parameters using a grid search method.

However, it does mention that the randomness in the RF model is due to the random selection of samples and characteristic variables. This randomness is a deliberate design choice to improve the model's tolerance for noisy datasets and prevent overfitting.

Regarding the specific question about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, the context does not provide any information. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
