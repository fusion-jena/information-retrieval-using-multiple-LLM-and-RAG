Answer:::
The preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, as mentioned in the provided context, include mean centering the image with ImageNet values and then rescaling the image between 0 and 1. This is mentioned in the context as a preprocessing step applied to all input images. Additionally, data augmentation techniques such as height and width shift, flipping, zooming, and brightness changes were applied to the images during training. However, it is not explicitly mentioned if any cleaning steps were involved in the preprocessing.
