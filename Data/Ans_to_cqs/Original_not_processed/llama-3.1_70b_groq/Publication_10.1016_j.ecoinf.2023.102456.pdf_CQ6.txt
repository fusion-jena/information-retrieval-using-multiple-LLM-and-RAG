Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of a model that learns neighborhood relationships using a neural network and the Gumbel softmax function. It also discusses the importance of differentiability for computing gradients accurately.

However, it does mention that the model aims to learn non-linear relationships with an infection capacity greater than those established in previous work. This might imply that the data is not linearly separable, and some form of preprocessing might be necessary. Additionally, the context mentions that the model uses a sigmoid activation function to ensure that the output can be interpreted as probabilities.

While the context does not provide explicit information on preprocessing steps, it can be inferred that some form of preprocessing might be necessary to prepare the data for training the model. Common preprocessing steps in deep learning include normalization, scaling, and cleaning, but the specific steps used in this case are not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to the query.
