Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the use of LiDAR data, specifically GEDI LiDAR data, and the development of high-resolution CHMs (Canopy Height Models) using deep learning approaches, such as convolutional neural networks. It also mentions the fusion of GEDI samples with passive optical images in machine learning models, but it does not provide details on the data annotation techniques employed.

Therefore, I do not know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.
