Answer: I don't know. The provided context does not mention the location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the importance of fish biomass estimation, the challenges of manual methods, and the potential of deep learning techniques to address these challenges. It also mentions the use of specific architectures such as YOLO and Bidirectional LSTM with GloVe embeddings, but it does not provide information on where the data repository is hosted.
