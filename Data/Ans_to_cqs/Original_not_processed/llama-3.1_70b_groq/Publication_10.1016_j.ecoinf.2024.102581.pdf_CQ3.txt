Answer:::

The data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for plant image classification include:

* Random rotation
* Random cropping
* Random flipping
* Random color jittering
* Random noise addition

These techniques were applied using Kera's flow_from_directory method during the learning phase of the CNN. The specific annotation techniques used are not mentioned in the provided context, but it can be inferred that the images were likely annotated with class labels (e.g., "plant" or "disease") rather than bounding boxes or instance segmentation masks.
