Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information given, it can be inferred that image data is used, as the context mentions "historical images" and "image database" in the methodology diagram (Fig. 1). Additionally, the use of the ImageNet dataset for pre-training the ResNet50V2 model suggests that image data is a key component of the pipeline. No information is provided about the use of audio, video, or CSV data formats.
