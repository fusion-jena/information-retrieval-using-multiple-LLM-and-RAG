Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Flipping, Rotating, or Scaling. The context primarily discusses the use of machine learning models, including ensemble techniques and deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN), for landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM). It also mentions the use of XGBoost, a gradient boosting framework, and its advantages in handling imbalanced data and missing values.

However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques, which are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to artificially increase the size of the training dataset and improve model generalization. Therefore, I do not know the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context.
