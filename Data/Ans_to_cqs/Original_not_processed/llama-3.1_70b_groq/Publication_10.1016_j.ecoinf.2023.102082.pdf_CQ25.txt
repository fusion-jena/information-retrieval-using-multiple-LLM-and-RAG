Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is to create a high-resolution Canopy Height Model (CHM) of the Earth, specifically the "Lang10m" model, at a 10m resolution using Sentinel-2 optical images and a convolutional neural network. The model is used to fuse GEDI data and Sentinel-2 images to produce a more spatially precise CHM, which can be used to assess biodiversity patterns in forest ecosystems through the estimation of the Height Heterogeneity (HH) that is correlated to tree species diversity.
