Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of hybrid CNN-LSTM models, wav2vec pre-training and fine-tuning phases, and the application of deep learning in bird species classification. It does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
