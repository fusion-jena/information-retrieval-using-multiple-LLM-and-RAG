Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. However, it does mention the use of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as a metric to evaluate the performance of the models. Specifically, it mentions the percentage reduction in RMSE as a measure of the improvement in prediction accuracy. 

Therefore, based on the provided context, the answer to the query is that the performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) metric.
