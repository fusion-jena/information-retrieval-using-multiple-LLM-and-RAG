Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the data is "highly unbalanced" and suggests using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the data, which could potentially improve the model's performance and generalizability.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model was trained and evaluated on a dataset, but it does not provide information on whether techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting were used to split the data into training and testing sets.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions that the model was evaluated on a test set, as shown in the confusion matrix (Table V) and ROC curves (Figure 9), but it does not provide information on whether this test set was randomly sampled from the overall dataset or if it was a separate, independent dataset.

Overall, while the context provides some information on the model's performance and evaluation, it does not provide explicit information on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.
