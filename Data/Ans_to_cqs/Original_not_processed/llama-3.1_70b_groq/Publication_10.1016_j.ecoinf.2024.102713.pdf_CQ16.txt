Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention anything about training or validation loss plateau. The context appears to be related to a database schema and data analysis for a pest management system, specifically for the H. halys species. It discusses the relational schema, data validation process, and factors influencing H. halys presence, but does not touch on machine learning or training-related topics.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not relevant to the provided context.
