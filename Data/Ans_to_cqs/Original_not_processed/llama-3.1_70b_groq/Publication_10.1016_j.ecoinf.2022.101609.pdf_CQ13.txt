Answer:::

The deep learning model used in the study employed several hyperparameters, which were determined through experimentation. The learning rate was fixed at 1.3e-4, which was the point where the training loss started dipping (as shown in Fig. 11). The optimizer used was not explicitly stated, but the study mentions that several popular optimization functions were experimented with, including SGD, RMSProp, LAMB, LARS, and Adam. However, the specific optimizer used in the final model is not mentioned.

Additionally, the model was trained for 20,000 epochs, and the loss function used was a regression loss function, but the specific type of regression loss function is not specified. The model's architecture consisted of four layers, but the details of each layer, such as the number of neurons, activation functions, and regularization techniques, are not provided.

It is worth noting that the study mentions that the model was trained to make day-ahead predictions of three pollutants, but the specific pollutants are not mentioned. The study also mentions that the model was evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and root mean squared error (RMSE), but the specific evaluation metrics used are not provided.
