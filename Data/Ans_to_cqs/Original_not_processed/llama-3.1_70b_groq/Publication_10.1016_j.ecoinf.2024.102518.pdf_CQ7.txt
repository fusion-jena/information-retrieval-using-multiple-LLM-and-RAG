Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be focused on species distribution modeling, ecological niche models, and evaluating the performance of different algorithms. It mentions the use of cross-validation, but it does not provide details on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation.

However, it does mention that the threshold was derived from the average output of five models, suggesting that some form of cross-validation or ensemble method was used. Additionally, it mentions the use of a validation dataset to evaluate the performance of the models, but it does not provide information on how the data was split to create this validation set.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
