Answer:::
The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the MTMI-SMF model are overall accuracy, producer accuracy, and user accuracy. These metrics are calculated using a confusion matrix, which is generated based on the classification results of the model on the test data (20% of the data not used for training). The confusion matrix is used to evaluate the performance of the model in detecting Brazilian peppertree presence. 

In contrast, the performance of the Random Forest model is evaluated using a confusion matrix as well, but the specific metrics used are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, the confusion matrices for the Random Forest model are provided in Tables A.5 and A.6 for RapidEye and Landsat imagery, respectively. 

It is worth noting that precision and recall are not explicitly mentioned as metrics used to evaluate the performance of either model in the provided context.
