Answer: The text mentions that the sensitivity study was "reran this experiment five times to account for the random subsampling of annotations." This suggests that the authors employed a strategy of repeating the experiment multiple times to account for randomness in the subsampling of annotations. However, it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of random seed values. Therefore, I can only partially answer the question, and the answer is that the authors used repeated experiments to account for randomness in subsampling, but I don't know if they employed any other strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
