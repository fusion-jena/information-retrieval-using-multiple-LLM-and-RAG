Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) for unsupervised detection, which suggests that LIDAR data may be used as a source of raw data. Additionally, the context mentions the use of hyperspectral data, which implies that hyperspectral sensors may also be used for collecting raw data. Furthermore, the context mentions the use of data from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) site, which suggests that public datasets or datasets from observational networks may also be used. However, the context does not provide information on the use of surveys or other methods for collecting raw data.
