Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the model training process, including the use of a pre-trained ResNet50 model and the selection of a time-frequency input window size, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search.
