Answer:::
The text does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the primary data format used is images. The text mentions "4000 images for each category" and "image processing" in the data augmentation section, indicating that images are the primary input data for the deep learning models. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
