Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be discussing the performance of a WT-HMM (Wavelet Transform-Hidden Markov Model) algorithm on a specific dataset, and how varying dataset sizes affect its classification performance. There is no mention of deep learning or regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization.
