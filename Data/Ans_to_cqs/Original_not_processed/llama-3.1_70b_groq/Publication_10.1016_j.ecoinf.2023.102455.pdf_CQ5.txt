Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the configuration and hyperparameters of various deep learning models, including CNN-BiRNN, CNN-BiGRU, KELM, RVFL, and others. It discusses the importance of tuning parameters and mentions recent research on metaheuristic optimization and cross-validation schemes. However, it does not provide information on the datasets used in the pipeline. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
