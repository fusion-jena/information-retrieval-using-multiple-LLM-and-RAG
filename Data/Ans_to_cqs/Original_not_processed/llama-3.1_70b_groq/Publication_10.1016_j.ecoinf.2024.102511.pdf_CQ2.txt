Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the references to bioacoustic classification, acoustic data analysis, and echolocation signals, it can be inferred that audio data is likely used in the pipeline.

Some references, such as the one by Shorten et al. (2019), mention image data augmentation for deep learning, suggesting that image data may also be used in some cases. However, this is not explicitly stated in the context of bioacoustic classification.

There is no mention of video data or CSV files being used in the pipeline. It is possible that CSV files may be used for metadata or annotation purposes, but this is not explicitly stated.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that audio data is likely used in the deep learning pipeline, and possibly image data in some cases. However, the exact data formats used are not explicitly stated.
