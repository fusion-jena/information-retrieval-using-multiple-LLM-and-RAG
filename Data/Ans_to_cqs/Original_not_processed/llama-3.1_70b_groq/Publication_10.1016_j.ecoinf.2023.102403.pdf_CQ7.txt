Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be related to data curation and filtering of occurrence data from GBIF and OBIS, but it does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
