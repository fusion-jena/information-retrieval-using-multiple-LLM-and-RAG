Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context discusses the data acquisition process, the use of a pretrained DenseNet, and the fine-tuning of the CNN backbone, but it does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation.

However, it does mention that the maximum number of recordings allowed per species was set to 100 to avoid large imbalances between classes and ensure acceptable computing power. This suggests that the data may have been split in a way that balances the number of samples per class, but the exact criteria used for splitting the data is not specified.

Therefore, I do not know the exact criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, and I cannot provide a more detailed answer.
