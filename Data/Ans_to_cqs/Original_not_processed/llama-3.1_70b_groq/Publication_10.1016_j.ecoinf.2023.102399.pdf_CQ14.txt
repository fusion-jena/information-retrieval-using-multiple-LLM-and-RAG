Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context appears to be a research paper discussing the performance of different models, including YOLO and DL-YOLO, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
