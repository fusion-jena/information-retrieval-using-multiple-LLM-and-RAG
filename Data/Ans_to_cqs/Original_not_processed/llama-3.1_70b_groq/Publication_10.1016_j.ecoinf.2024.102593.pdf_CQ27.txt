Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It only mentions that "when a trained model is run through field recordings, we can again rely on EV to select possible calls of the Coxenâ€™s fig-parrot." This suggests that the model is being used to make predictions on field recordings, but it does not provide information on how the model was deployed or what steps were taken to prepare it for deployment, such as model serialization or platform selection.
