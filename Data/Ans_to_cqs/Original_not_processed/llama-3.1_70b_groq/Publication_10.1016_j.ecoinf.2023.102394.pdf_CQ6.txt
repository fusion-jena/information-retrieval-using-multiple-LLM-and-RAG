Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning techniques in ecological informatics, specifically in soil organic carbon (SOC) prediction and mapping. It discusses the use of multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithms and mentions the importance of deep learning in improving prediction accuracy.

However, it does mention the use of environmental covariates such as topography, parent material, soil variables, climate, and biota as input features for the MLP model. It also mentions the use of TerraClimate, a high-resolution global dataset of monthly climate and climatic water balance, as a reference.

While it can be inferred that some form of data preprocessing might be necessary to prepare the environmental covariates for use in the MLP model, the specific preprocessing steps involved are not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I do not know the exact preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model.
