Answer:::

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model. However, it does discuss the evaluation metrics used for predictive models, specifically the K-nearest neighbours regression model.

According to the context, the performance of the predictive models is evaluated using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metric. This metric is chosen because it is easily interpretable and naturally scales for predictions of fraction values between 0 and 1.

Additionally, for incomplete observations, the prediction accuracy is evaluated by checking whether the largest predicted fraction of each observation equals the dominant vegetation cover type. This is similar to a classification task.

There is no mention of accuracy, precision, or recall metrics in the provided context.
