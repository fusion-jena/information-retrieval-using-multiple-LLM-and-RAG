Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to environmental and ecological studies, discussing topics such as vegetation growth, rainfall, and flood susceptibility mapping. It does not provide information on data preprocessing techniques for deep learning pipelines.

However, I can provide general information on common techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. These include:

* Stratified splitting: dividing the data into subsets based on the class labels to ensure that each subset has a similar proportion of samples from each class.
* Oversampling: creating additional copies of the minority class samples to balance the class distribution.
* Undersampling: reducing the number of majority class samples to balance the class distribution.
* Diverse data collection: collecting data from diverse sources to reduce bias and increase representation of underrepresented classes.

Please note that these techniques are general and not specific to the provided context. If you are looking for information on data preprocessing techniques used in the context of environmental or ecological studies, I would recommend searching for more relevant sources.
