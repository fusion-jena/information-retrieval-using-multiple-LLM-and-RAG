Answer:::
The provided context mentions one regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, which is dropout. According to the text, "Dropout is a form of regularisation that randomly removes a proportion of nodes to reduce overfitting" (Srivastava, Hinton, Krizhevsky, Sutskever, & Salakhutdinov, 2014). However, it does not mention L2 regularization or any other regularization methods. Therefore, based on the provided context, the only regularization method mentioned is dropout.
