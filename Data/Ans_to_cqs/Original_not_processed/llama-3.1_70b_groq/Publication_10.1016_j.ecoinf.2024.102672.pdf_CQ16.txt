Answer: The criteria used to determine when training is complete is the stabilization of the loss curve. According to the text, "The number of epochs was adjusted to the minimum number of epochs that guaranteed the stabilization of the loss curve in the four folds of the cross-validation." This suggests that the training process is considered complete when the loss curve stops improving and stabilizes, indicating that the model has converged and further training is unlikely to result in significant improvements.
