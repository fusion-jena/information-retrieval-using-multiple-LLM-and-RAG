Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The text only mentions that image preprocessing was conducted using Python with the OpenCV library, and that the last step was image inversion, where white pixels were switched to black pixels, and black pixels were switched to white pixels. No other data augmentation techniques are mentioned.
