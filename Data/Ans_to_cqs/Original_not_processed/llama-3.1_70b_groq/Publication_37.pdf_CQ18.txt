Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is through the use of a validation set. The model is trained for 100 epochs and is checkpointed after each epoch. The validation set is used to identify the parameter setting (epoch) achieving the highest classification accuracy. This approach allows the model to be evaluated on unseen data during training, providing a more accurate estimate of its performance on new, unseen data.
