Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and optimization of the U-Net model, Deep Neural Network (DNN) model, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, as well as the use of pre-trained networks and hyperparameter tuning. It does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in the pipeline.
