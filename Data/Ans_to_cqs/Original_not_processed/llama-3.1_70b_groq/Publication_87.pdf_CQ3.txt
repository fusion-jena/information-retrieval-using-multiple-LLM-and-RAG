Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that deep learning relies on computational models learning from training data – a set of manually labelled images – and making predictions on new data – a set of unlabelled images.

It can be inferred that some form of image annotation is necessary for training the deep learning models, but the specific techniques used, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, are not mentioned in the provided context.

One of the references, "A Survey on Image Data Augmentation for Deep Learning" by Shorten and Khoshgoftaar (2019), might provide some insights into data annotation techniques, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
