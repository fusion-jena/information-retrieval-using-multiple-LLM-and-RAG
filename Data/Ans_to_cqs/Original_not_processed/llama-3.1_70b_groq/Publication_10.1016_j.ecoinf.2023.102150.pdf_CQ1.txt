Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of camera traps for monitoring cyclic vole populations (Kleiven et al., 2022) and the development of a camera trap by Soininen et al. (2015) that consists of a Reconyx camera mounted on the ceiling of a metal box that can be entered by small mammals.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of image-based ecological surveys (Kellenberger et al., 2020) and the availability of publicly available neural networks trained on large image datasets. This suggests that image data, possibly collected through camera traps or other visual sensors, may be one method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.

However, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive answer to the query based on the provided context, as it does not mention other methods that may be used for collecting raw data, such as surveys or public datasets.
