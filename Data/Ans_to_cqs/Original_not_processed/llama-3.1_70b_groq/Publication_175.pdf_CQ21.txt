The provided context does not mention the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. It only discusses the training process, model comparison, and testing on an independent dataset (T2). Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this query.
