Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the use of a multiple-instance learning algorithm to detect invasive species, specifically Brazilian peppertree, using multispectral airborne and satellite imagery. It discusses the challenges of training datasets, the formulation of the MTMI-SMF algorithm, and its comparison to other machine learning approaches. However, it does not provide information on the deployment process of the trained model, such as model serialization or platform selection.
