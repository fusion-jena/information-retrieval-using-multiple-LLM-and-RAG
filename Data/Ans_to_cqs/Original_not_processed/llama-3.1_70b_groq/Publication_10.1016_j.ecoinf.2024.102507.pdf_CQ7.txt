Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on data preparation, data augmentation, and the impact of different data formats on the model's performance. It also discusses the challenges of dealing with imbalanced data and the methods used to address them, such as data reduction and data augmentation.

However, it does mention that the research team took actions to address the imbalance in the training data, including inputting data according to the original data, data reduction, and data augmentation. But it does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation.

Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training.
