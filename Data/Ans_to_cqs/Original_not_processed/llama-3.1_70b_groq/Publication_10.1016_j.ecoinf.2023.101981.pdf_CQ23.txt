Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context only discusses the model's performance in detecting cow vocalizations and the differences in settings compared to another study (Karmiris et al., 2021). It also mentions the evaluation of the model's precision using a specific method, but it does not provide information on how the model was trained or validated to ensure its generalizability.
