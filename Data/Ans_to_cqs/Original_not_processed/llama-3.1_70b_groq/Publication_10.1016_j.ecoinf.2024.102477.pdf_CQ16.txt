Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the Support Vector Regression (SVR) method, its formulation, and its application in various studies. It also discusses the regularization parameter, fault tolerance, and model complexity, but it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training.

However, it is common in machine learning to use various stopping criteria, such as:

* Validation loss plateau: Training is stopped when the validation loss stops improving or reaches a plateau.
* Maximum number of epochs: Training is stopped after a fixed number of epochs.
* Early stopping: Training is stopped when the model's performance on the validation set starts to degrade.

Without more specific information, it is difficult to determine the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete in the context of the provided text.
