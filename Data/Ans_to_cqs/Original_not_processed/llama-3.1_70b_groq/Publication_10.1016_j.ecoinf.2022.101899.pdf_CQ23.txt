Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning and Bayesian model averaging for wildfire event prediction in Australia, but it does not provide information on the model's generalizability or the techniques used to ensure it. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
