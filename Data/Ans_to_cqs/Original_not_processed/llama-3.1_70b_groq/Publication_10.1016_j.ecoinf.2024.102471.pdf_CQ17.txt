Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, it does mention that "Diversity loss shown in (2) is also added to the objective function for regularization during pre-training" in the context of the Wav2Vec pre-training phase. This suggests that diversity loss is used as a regularization method, but it does not provide information on other regularization methods that may be used.
