Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deep learning pipelines or strategies for handling randomness in such pipelines. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, specifically a study on the western Himalayan pine-dominated ecosystem using flux tower measurements and a Temporal Information Partitioning Network (TIPNet) approach. There is no mention of deep learning or randomness in the context, so I am unable to provide a relevant answer to the query.
