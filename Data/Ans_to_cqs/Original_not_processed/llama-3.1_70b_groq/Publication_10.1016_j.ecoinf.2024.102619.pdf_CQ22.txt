Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score. 

Accuracy indicates the proportion of images that the model classifies correctly. Recall, or sensitivity, refers to the proportion of images of each class that were correctly classified. Precision determines the accuracy of the predictions themselves; it measures the proportion of images that were assigned a correct class when classified. The F1 score is not explicitly defined in the provided context, but it is often used to provide a balanced measure of precision and recall.

These metrics are calculated for each class and are scored between 0 and 1, with optimal performance reached at 1. The recall and precision for each class are calculated as follows:

Recallc = TPc / (TPc + FNc)
Precisionc = TPc / (TPc + FPc)

Where TPc is the number of true positives for class c, FNc is the number of false negatives for class c, and FPc is the number of false positives for class c.
