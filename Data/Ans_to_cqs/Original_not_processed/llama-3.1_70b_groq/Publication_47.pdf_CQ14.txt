Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses the use of machine learning, specifically Bayesian neural networks, and the evaluation of the conservation status of orchids, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
