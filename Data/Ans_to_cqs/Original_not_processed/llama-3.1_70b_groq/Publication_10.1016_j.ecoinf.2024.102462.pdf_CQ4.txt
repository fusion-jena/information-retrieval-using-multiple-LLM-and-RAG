Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context only mentions that data augmentation is used to expand the dataset, balance the classes, and improve the overall accuracy of the models. It also mentions that the training set included data augmentation, but it does not provide details on the specific techniques used.

However, it is common in deep learning pipelines to use techniques such as flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, and color jittering to augment the data. But without explicit information, we cannot confirm if these techniques were used in this specific pipeline.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
