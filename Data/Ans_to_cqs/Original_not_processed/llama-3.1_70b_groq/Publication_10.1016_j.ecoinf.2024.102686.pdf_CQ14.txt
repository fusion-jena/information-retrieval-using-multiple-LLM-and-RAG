Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, it does mention that "further optimization of the training algorithm is an urgent problem that needs to be solved" in the context of Support Vector Machines (SVM) for large sample datasets. This suggests that the authors acknowledge the need for hyperparameter optimization, but the specific method used (e.g., grid search, random search) is not specified.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to the query.
