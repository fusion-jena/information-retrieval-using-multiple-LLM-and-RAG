Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It mentions the use of a "DL model" and "Artificial NNs" (Neural Networks), but it does not specify whether it is a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), RNN (Recurrent Neural Network), Transformer, or another type of model. It does mention the use of a "SoftGroup semantic branch" and references other studies that used specific models such as U-Net and Deeplabv3+, but it does not indicate that these models are used in the pipeline being described.
