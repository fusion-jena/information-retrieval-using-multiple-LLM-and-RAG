Answer:::
According to the provided context, one preprocessing step involved before training a model is feature scaling. This is done through min-max scaling, where the input features are scaled to have a range of [0,1] while retaining the shape of the original distribution. The formula used for scaling is:

xscaled = (x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x))

Maximums and minimums of the variables are computed over the full modeling dataset. However, it is not explicitly mentioned whether other preprocessing steps such as normalization, cleaning, or handling missing values are performed. Therefore, the answer is limited to feature scaling through min-max scaling.
