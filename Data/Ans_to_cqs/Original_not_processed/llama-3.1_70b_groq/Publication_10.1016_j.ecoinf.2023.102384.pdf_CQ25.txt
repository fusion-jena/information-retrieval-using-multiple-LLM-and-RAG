Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is to count the number of insects, specifically whiteflies, in images of sticky traps. The model is trained to estimate the insect count within a given Region of Interest (RoI) and is implemented using multiple networks that belong to the main counting strategies found in the literature. These strategies include counting by detection, where bounding boxes are computed, and counting by regression, where a target map is predicted. Specifically, the regression-based approach explores two different methods that rely on distinct regressed target maps: counting by density estimation and counting by segmentation. The model is designed to distinguish between whiteflies and other insects that may be present in the images, as well as to ignore contaminants such as dust, fluff, or leaves that may be stuck to the traps.
