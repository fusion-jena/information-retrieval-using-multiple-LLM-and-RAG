Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is to plot the accuracy and loss curves over epochs. The X-axis represents the number of epochs, which are the iterations of the training process, and the Y-axis represents the values of accuracy or loss, which are the metrics of the model's performance. This allows for visualizing the trend and pattern of the model's performance over time, with the blue color representing the training results and the orange color representing the validation results.
