Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does mention that data augmentation was applied by randomly deforming input images in each training cycle due to the small sample size. This suggests that some form of preprocessing or data manipulation was performed, but the specific steps are not detailed.

Additionally, the context mentions that the images were collected under a lab-based protocol with fully controlled position of the larvae (ventral point of view), which may imply some level of standardization or preprocessing of the images. However, the exact preprocessing steps are not specified.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of a pretrained convolutional network, which may have been trained on a large dataset such as ImageNet. In this case, the preprocessing steps may have been performed as part of the pretraining process, but this is not explicitly stated.

Overall, while some form of preprocessing or data manipulation was likely performed, the specific steps involved are not detailed in the provided context.
