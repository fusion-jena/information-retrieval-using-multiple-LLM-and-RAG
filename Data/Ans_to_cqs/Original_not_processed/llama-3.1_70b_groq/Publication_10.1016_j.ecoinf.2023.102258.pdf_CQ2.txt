Answer: Audio. The text mentions that deep learning systems are used to process audio files, specifically in the context of bioacoustics. It mentions the use of Mel spectrograms, which are a type of audio feature representation, and the division of long audio files into shorter chunks for processing. There is no mention of image, video, or CSV data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline.
