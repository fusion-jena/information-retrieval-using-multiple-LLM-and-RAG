Answer:::
The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a fully convolutional neural network (CNN) with a specific architecture that includes residual blocks, Spatial and Channel Attention (SCA) modules, and transposed convolutional layers for upsampling. The model consists of an encoder and a decoder, where the encoder progressively reduces the spatial dimensions and learns features, and the decoder upscales the feature maps and fuses information from the encoder using skip connections.
