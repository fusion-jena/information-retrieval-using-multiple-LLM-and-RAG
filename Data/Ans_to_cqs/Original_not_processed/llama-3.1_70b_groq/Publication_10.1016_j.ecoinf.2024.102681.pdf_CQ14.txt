Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that introducing the hybrid model (embedding LSTM into the CNN) improves the model's prediction accuracy without any adjustments to the hyperparameters, but it does not provide information on the optimization process itself.
