Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models. It mentions various studies and papers related to remote sensing, digital soil mapping, and land use classification, but it does not provide information on the frameworks used to build the deep learning models. The context only mentions the use of artificial neural networks (ANN) and deep learning-based methods, but it does not specify the frameworks used to implement these methods.
