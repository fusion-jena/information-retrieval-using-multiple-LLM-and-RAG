Answer:

Based on the provided context, it appears that the preprocessing technique used to address data bias is data augmentation. Specifically, the text mentions that "we apply a simple augmentation strategy, flipping the patches horizontally and vertically with a 50% probability" during the training stage. This suggests that the authors are using data augmentation to artificially increase the size of the training dataset and potentially reduce bias.

Additionally, the text mentions that the authors are experimenting with various patch sizes (256, 320, 480, 640, and 800 pixels) during the training stage, which could also help to reduce bias by providing the model with a more diverse set of examples.

However, it's worth noting that the text does not mention any other techniques for addressing data bias, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling. It's also unclear whether the authors are using diverse data collection techniques to collect a more representative dataset.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the answer to the query is that data augmentation (specifically, flipping patches horizontally and vertically) is used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it's unclear whether other techniques are also being used.
