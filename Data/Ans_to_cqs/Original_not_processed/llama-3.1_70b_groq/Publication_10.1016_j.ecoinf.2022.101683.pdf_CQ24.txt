Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline or using random seed values. The context appears to be related to species distribution models, invasive species, and addressing sampling bias in ecological studies. It discusses different methods for reducing sampling bias, such as weighted background points, filtered records, and targeted background points, but does not touch on deep learning or randomness in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide an answer to the query.
