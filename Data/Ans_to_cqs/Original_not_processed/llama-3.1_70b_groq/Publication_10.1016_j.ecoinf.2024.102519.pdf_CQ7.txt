Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context discusses various machine learning and optimization techniques, such as genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization, and deep learning, but it does not provide information on data splitting criteria.

However, it does mention that the study used a genetic optimization algorithm to adjust hyperparameters, but it does not elaborate on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
