Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. It discusses the overfitting and underfitting problems in neural network models, the early stopping strategy, and the dropout approach to deal with overfitting. It also mentions the use of lag features (i.e., using K previous observations) in the GRU-DNN model, but it does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

However, it does mention that the training data is separated into training and validation groups, which is a common practice in machine learning and deep learning. But it does not provide any further details on the preprocessing steps involved.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to answer the query about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model.
