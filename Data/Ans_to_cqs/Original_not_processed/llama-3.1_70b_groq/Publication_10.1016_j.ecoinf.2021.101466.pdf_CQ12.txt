Answer:::
The pipeline uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, specifically the EfficientNet model, which is a type of CNN designed for image classification tasks. Additionally, the pipeline also utilizes YOLOv4, which is another type of CNN architecture, for object detection tasks. There is no mention of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers in the provided context.
