Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, mapping, and color gamut, but it does not discuss deep learning or data preprocessing techniques.

However, I can provide some general information on the techniques you mentioned. Stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling are indeed techniques used to address data bias and imbalance in machine learning and deep learning pipelines. Stratified splitting involves splitting the data into subsets based on the class labels, while oversampling and undersampling involve increasing or decreasing the number of instances in the minority or majority class, respectively. Diverse data collection involves collecting data from diverse sources to reduce bias and increase representation.

But, I don't know if these techniques are specifically used in the context of ecological informatics or the preprocessing of deep learning pipelines in this field.
