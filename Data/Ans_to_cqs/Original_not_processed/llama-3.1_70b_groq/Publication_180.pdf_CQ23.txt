Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the models were calibrated for Mexican and Brazilian species using different numbers of training steps, and that the validation percentage was adjusted from the default 10% to 16% due to the small number of images available for some species. This suggests that some consideration was given to the dataset and its limitations, but the specific measures taken to ensure generalizability are not mentioned.
