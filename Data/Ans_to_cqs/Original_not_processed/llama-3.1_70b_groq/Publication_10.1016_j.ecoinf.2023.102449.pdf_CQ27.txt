Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and design of the model, including the encoder and decoder, residual networks, and the use of batch normalization and ReLU activation functions. It does not provide information on model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related processes. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
