Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The text appears to be a research paper or academic article discussing weakly-supervised learning, regression problems, and a case study on global vegetation modeling. There is no mention of a specific code repository or link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket page.
