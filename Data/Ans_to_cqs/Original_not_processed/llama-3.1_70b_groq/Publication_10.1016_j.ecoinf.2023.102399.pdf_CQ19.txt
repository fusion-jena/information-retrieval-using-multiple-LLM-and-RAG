Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. The text only mentions that the YOLO model was improved by 4.31% and 9.33% compared to the basic framework, but it does not specify the framework used. It is possible that the framework is mentioned in the full article, but based on the provided context, I do not know the answer to this question.
