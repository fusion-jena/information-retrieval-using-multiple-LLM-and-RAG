Answer:::
The regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline is dropout regularization. Specifically, the model employs dropout regularization after each BiLSTM layer, where 50% of the neural connections are randomly deactivated. This is mentioned in section 2.1 of the provided context, citing Srivastava et al. (2014) as the reference for this method. There is no mention of L2 regularization or any other regularization methods being used in the provided context.
