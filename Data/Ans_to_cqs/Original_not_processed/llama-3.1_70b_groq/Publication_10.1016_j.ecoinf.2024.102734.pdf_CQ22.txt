Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, except for accuracy. It mentions that the baseline accuracy is calculated using a 2-shot, 2-way test accuracy without fine-tuning (81.4%). Additionally, it mentions that model performance is re-evaluated on the test set at 10 sample increments using each of the three sample orderings. However, it does not provide information on other metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, etc. Therefore, the only metric that can be confirmed is accuracy.
