Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention that the authors created their own dataset for the project due to a lack of existing quality data. The dataset is described as being relatively small in size, but it was sufficient for testing the model under difficult circumstances and complex backgrounds. The context also mentions that the dataset is used for object detection in ocean objects using synthetic aperture radar and YoloV3.
