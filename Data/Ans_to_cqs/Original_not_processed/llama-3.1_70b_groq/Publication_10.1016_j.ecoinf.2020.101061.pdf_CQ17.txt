Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The text only mentions that "data augmentation of random flips and translations was tested and found to have little effect on the final score." This suggests that data augmentation was explored as a technique to potentially improve the model's performance, but it does not provide information on regularization methods. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
