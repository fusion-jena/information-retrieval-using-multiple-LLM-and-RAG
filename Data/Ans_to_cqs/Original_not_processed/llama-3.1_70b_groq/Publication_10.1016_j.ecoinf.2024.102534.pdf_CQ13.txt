Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. The context appears to be related to a study on the impact of climate change on orchid species distribution, using ensemble models and species distribution models. It includes information on the evaluation metrics used (AUC and TSS), the classification of suitable areas, and the comparison of predictive maps for different groups of orchids. However, it does not provide any details on the specific hyperparameters used in a deep learning model.
