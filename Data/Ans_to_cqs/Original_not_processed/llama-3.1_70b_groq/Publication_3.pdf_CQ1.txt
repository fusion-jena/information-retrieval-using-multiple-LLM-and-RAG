The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the data are publicly available via Cornell University's Laboratory of Ornithology and Macaulay Library of Natural Sounds (https://www.macaulaylibrary.org). This suggests that the data may have been collected through public datasets or repositories, but the exact methods used for collecting the raw data are not specified.
