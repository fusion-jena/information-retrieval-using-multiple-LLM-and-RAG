Answer:::
The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data, specifically Sentinel-2 optical images. These images are fused with GEDI data using a deep learning algorithm, specifically a convolutional neural network, to produce high-resolution canopy height maps (CHMs), such as the Lang10m dataset.
