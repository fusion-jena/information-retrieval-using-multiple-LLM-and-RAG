Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that a dropout value of 50% has been used in the first three layers of the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model to improve generalisation and reduce overfitting. 

Overfitting is a related concept to data bias, as it can occur when a model is too closely fit to the training data and fails to generalise well to new, unseen data. However, dropout is primarily a technique for reducing overfitting, rather than addressing data bias specifically.

The context does not mention techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, which are commonly used to address data bias. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query based on the provided context.
