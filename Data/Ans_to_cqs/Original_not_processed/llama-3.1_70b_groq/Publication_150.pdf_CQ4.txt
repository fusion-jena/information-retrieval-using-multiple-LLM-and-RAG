Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that data augmentation is used and references a paper titled "Further advantages of data augmentation on convolutional neural networks" (Hernández-García & König, 2018).

While the context does not provide specific details on the data augmentation techniques used, it does suggest that data augmentation is an important aspect of the pipeline. Common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning include flipping, rotating, scaling, and cropping, but these are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query, but I can suggest that data augmentation is used in the pipeline, and it may include techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling, although this is not explicitly stated.
