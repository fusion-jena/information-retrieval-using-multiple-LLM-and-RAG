Answer:::
The provided context mentions one regularization method used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, which is dropout. This is mentioned in the paper by Srivastava et al. (2014), titled "Dropout: a simple way to prevent neural networks from overfitting." However, it does not provide an exhaustive list of regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline.

In the context, it is mentioned that "applied regularization techniques" were among the hyper-parameters evaluated iteratively, but it does not specify which techniques were used apart from dropout. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive list of regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline.

However, I can mention that dropout is a widely used regularization technique in deep learning, and it is used to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping out neurons during training.
