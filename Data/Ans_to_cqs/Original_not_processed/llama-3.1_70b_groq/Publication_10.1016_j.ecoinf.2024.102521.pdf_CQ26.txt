Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the importance of data sharing, the limitations of entomological field data, and the use of deep learning for computer vision in ecological research. It also mentions the use of large datasets and computational resources, but it does not delve into specific techniques for addressing data bias.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions the use of deep learning for computer vision in ecological research, which may involve techniques such as data augmentation, transfer learning, or domain adaptation to address data bias. Additionally, the context mentions the importance of diverse data collection, which can help to mitigate data bias.

Some of the papers mentioned in the context, such as the one by Teixeira et al. (2023), may discuss techniques for addressing data bias in the context of automatic insect detection using deep learning. However, without access to the full text of these papers, it is not possible to provide a more specific answer.

In summary, the provided context does not provide explicit information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
