Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context appears to be a list of references related to digital soil mapping, remote sensing, and machine learning, but it does not provide information on the deployment process of a deep learning model.

The references listed seem to focus on topics such as data collection, classification methods (e.g., MLC, SVM, ANN, RF), and feature extraction, but they do not discuss model deployment. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.

If you have any further context or clarification, I would be happy to try and assist you.
