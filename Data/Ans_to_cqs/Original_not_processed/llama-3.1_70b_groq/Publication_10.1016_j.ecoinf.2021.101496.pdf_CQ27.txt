Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. It only discusses the development and evaluation of three models (Simple Linear Model, Generalized Linear Model, and Artificial Neural Network) for predicting SPAD values using the Rasp2SPAD prototype. The context provides details on the model development, training, and testing, but it does not cover the deployment process.
