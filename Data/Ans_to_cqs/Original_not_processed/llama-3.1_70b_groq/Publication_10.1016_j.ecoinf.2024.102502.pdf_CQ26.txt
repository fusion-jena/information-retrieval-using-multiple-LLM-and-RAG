Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on data filtering, scaling, and aggregation in the context of environmental time series data, rather than deep learning pipelines or addressing data bias.

The context mentions data scaling, gap filling, and data matching levels, but it does not discuss techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, which are commonly used to address data bias in machine learning pipelines.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
