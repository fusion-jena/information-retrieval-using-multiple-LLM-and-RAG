Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, it does mention that the data augmentation technique was used, which acts as a regularizer and helps to reduce overfitting. 

Additionally, the context mentions that the model seems to be overfitted to the training data when the number of epochs exceeds 200, but it does not provide information on other regularization methods that may have been used to prevent overfitting. 

Therefore, based on the provided context, the only regularization method mentioned is data augmentation, but it is not clear if other methods such as dropout or L2 regularization were used.
