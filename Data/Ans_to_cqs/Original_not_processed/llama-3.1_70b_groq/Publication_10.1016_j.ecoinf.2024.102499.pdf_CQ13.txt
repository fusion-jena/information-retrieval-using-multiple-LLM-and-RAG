Answer:::

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows:

* Learning rate: 0.008
* Learning rate decay: cosine learning rate decay
* Batch size: 16 images per iteration
* Number of iterations: 200,000

The optimizer used is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the model was implemented in TensorFlow 2, which suggests that the Adam optimizer or a variant of it might have been used, but this is not confirmed.

Additionally, the model architecture used is NASnet with a Faster-rcnn backbone, and the model was trained on a GPU-cluster equipped with 4 RTX8000 GPUs.
