Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning pipelines or optimization techniques such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling and the evaluation of different correction methods for sampling bias effects. It discusses the performance of various methods, including BGenv, Fenv, and Fgeo, but does not mention deep learning or optimization techniques.
