Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). These metrics are used to assess the differences between predicted and actual values, indicating the accuracy of the model. The formulas for calculating MAPE and RMSE are provided in equations (19) and (20), respectively. Additionally, the coefficient of determination (R2) is also mentioned in equation (21), but it is not explicitly stated as a metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this specific context.
