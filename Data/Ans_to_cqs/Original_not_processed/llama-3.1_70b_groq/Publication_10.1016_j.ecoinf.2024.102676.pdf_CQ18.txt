Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The text discusses the parameters used for the FIT method, the experimental setup, and the results, but it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
