According to the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, specifically a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) for semantic segmentation, include data augmentation strategies to increase the training set size. These strategies are:

1. Horizontal flip
2. Gaussian noise addition
3. Contrast reduction

These preprocessing steps were employed to increase the training set size fourfold, as the initial set of 290 training images was found to be insufficient to obtain satisfactory results. The contrast reduction strategy was specifically motivated by the expectation of images containing shadows occluding vegetation types, which can be expected in the dataset.

Additionally, the context mentions that the dataset was collected from field measurements at three field sites: Pelican Mountain (PM), Calling Lake (CL), and Conklin (CK). However, it does not provide information on normalization or scaling as preprocessing steps.
