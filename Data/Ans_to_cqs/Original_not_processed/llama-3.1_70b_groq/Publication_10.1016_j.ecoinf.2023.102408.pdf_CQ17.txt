Answer:::

The provided context does not specifically mention the regularization methods used in a deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, it does mention some regularization methods used in the context of machine learning models.

In the context of the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, the study mentions that using a large number of predictors can increase model complexity and lead to overfitting. To mitigate this, the study systematically evaluated the "mtry" parameter from 1 to 10 to strike a balance between stability and minimize the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

In the context of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), the study mentions that the weights were randomly initialized using the Nguyenâ€“Widrow method, and the regularization parameter "decay" was used to avoid overfitting. The "decay" parameter was passed as an array of values from 0.025 to 1.

Additionally, in the context of optimizing the line fit, the study mentions that the parameter "c" was used to penalize the number of samples inside the margin and mitigate overfitting. The value of "c" was tuned within the range of 0.1 to 20 to ensure a balanced trade-off between the margin size and overfitting.

While these methods are used to prevent overfitting in the context of machine learning models, they are not specifically related to deep learning pipelines or methods like dropout or L2 regularization.
