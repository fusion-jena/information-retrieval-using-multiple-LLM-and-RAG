Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the use of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning techniques for image analysis and species identification in camera trap data. It mentions various studies and techniques, such as Mask R-CNN, Flow-Guided Feature Aggregation, and neural networks, but does not provide specific information on data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, or scaling.

However, it is common practice in deep learning pipelines to apply data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of the training data and improve model generalization. These techniques can include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, and color jittering, among others. But without explicit information in the provided context, I cannot confirm which specific techniques are applied in this case.

Therefore, I must conclude that I don't know the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context.
