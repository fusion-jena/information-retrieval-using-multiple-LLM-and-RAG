Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The context discusses the use of machine learning and deep learning models for river quality assessment and river health predictions, but it does not provide details on the evaluation metrics used.

However, it mentions that bias-variance decomposition is widely adopted for generalizability evaluations of ML models, which suggests that the authors may be interested in evaluating the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. Additionally, the context references several studies on machine learning and deep learning, but it does not provide specific information on the evaluation metrics used in those studies.

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the question, and I would recommend consulting the original research papers or contacting the authors for more information on the evaluation metrics used in their study.
