Answer::: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a research paper discussing the application of deep learning models, specifically the XGBoost model, to detect and categorize forest types using remote sensing data. However, it does not provide any information about the code repository link. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
