Answer:::
The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are precision, recall, and mean average precision (AP). These metrics are used to assess the model's object detection capabilities. 

Precision is defined as the ratio of true positives (TP) to the sum of true positives and false positives (FP), i.e., TP / (TP + FP). Recall is defined as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives (FN), i.e., TP / (TP + FN). 

Mean average precision (AP) is another evaluation metric used to assess the model's performance under different confidence thresholds. It is calculated as the sum of the differences between recall values at different precision levels, i.e., ∑n (rn+1 − rn) pinterp (rn+1). 

These metrics are used to evaluate the model's performance in detecting objects, specifically fish in this context, and to assess its ability to correctly classify and locate objects within images.
