Answer: The text does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that a 10-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models. This suggests that the data was split into 10 folds, with 9 folds used for training and 1 fold used for validation in each iteration. The process was repeated 10 times, with each fold used as the validation set once.
