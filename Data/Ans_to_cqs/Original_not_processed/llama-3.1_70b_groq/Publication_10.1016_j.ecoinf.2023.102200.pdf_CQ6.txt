Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be a collection of research papers and snippets related to remote sensing, computer vision, and deep learning, but it does not provide a clear answer to the query.

However, I can provide some general information about common preprocessing steps that are often involved before training a deep learning model. These may include:

* Normalization: scaling the input data to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model.
* Scaling: transforming the data to have zero mean and unit variance, which can help improve the stability of the training process.
* Cleaning: removing missing or erroneous data, handling outliers, and removing duplicates.
* Data augmentation: artificially increasing the size of the training dataset by applying transformations such as rotation, flipping, and cropping.

But please note that this is general information and not specific to the provided context.

If you're looking for specific information about the preprocessing steps used in the context of the provided papers, I would recommend checking the individual papers or searching for additional information that is not provided in the context.
