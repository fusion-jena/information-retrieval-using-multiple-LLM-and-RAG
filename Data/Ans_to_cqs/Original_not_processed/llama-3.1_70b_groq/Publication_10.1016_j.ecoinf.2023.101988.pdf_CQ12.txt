Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, based on the paper "Modelling animal biodiversity using acoustic monitoring and deep learning" by Chalmers et al. (2021), it can be inferred that the authors used a deep learning model for acoustic monitoring, but the specific type of model is not mentioned.

The paper mentions the use of "deep learning" and "acoustic monitoring" but does not provide details on the architecture of the model used. It is possible that the authors used a convolutional neural network (CNN) or a recurrent neural network (RNN) for audio classification, but without further information, it is impossible to determine the exact type of model used.

Therefore, I do not know the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
