Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention deep learning or strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of Random Forest, a machine learning approach, for classification in remote sensing, and compares it to MTMI-SMF. The context mentions the use of 5 K-fold cross-validations and the selection of a random pixel from the pixels in closest proximity to the training location, but it does not provide information on handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline.
