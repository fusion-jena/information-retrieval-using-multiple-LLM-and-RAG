Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on climate modeling, species distribution models, and microclimatic studies, but it does not provide information on the data collection methods used in the deep learning pipeline.

However, it does mention the use of existing datasets, such as WorldClim 2, which provides global climate surfaces for land areas. It also mentions the use of R packages, such as RANDOMFOREST and GBM, for fitting models, but it does not provide information on how the raw data was collected.

Therefore, I do not know the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, as this information is not provided in the context.
