Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. It discusses machine learning algorithms like random forests, support vector machines, and mentions neural networks, but does not specify the type of neural network or deep learning model used. The context appears to be focused on traditional machine learning algorithms rather than deep learning models.
