Answer: 
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It only discusses the application of deep learning methods, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification tasks, and the proposed Spectral-Spatial Paralleled Convolutional Neural Network (SSPCNN) framework. Therefore, I do not know which hardware resources (e.g., GPUs, TPUs) are used for training the deep learning model.
