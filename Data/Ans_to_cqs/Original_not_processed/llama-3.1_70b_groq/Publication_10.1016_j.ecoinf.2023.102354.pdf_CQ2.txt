Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper focused on exploring the potential of deep learning and machine learning algorithms for enhancing groundwater-climate interactions understanding, but it does not provide information on the data formats used in the pipeline. The context mentions various datasets, such as TWS, SMS, GWS, SPEI, and others, but it does not specify the formats in which these datasets are stored or used.
