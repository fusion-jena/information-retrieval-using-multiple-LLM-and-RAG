Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be focused on machine learning algorithms, hyperparameter tuning, and model performance evaluation, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.

However, I can suggest that data augmentation techniques are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to artificially increase the size of the training dataset and improve model generalization. These techniques can include random flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, and color jittering, among others. But without specific information from the provided context, I cannot provide a more detailed answer to this query.
