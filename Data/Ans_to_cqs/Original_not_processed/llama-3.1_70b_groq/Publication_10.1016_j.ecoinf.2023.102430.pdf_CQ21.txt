Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context only discusses the dataset, algorithm training and testing, and the roles of the researchers involved in the project. It does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
