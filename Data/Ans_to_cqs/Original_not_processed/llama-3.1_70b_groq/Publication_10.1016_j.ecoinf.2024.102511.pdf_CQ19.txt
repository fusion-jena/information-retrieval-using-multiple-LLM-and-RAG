Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific frameworks used to build deep learning models, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning in bioacoustic classification, particularly in marine mammal research, and discusses the potential of neural networks in this field. It also mentions the importance of large datasets and the need for significant sample sizes for all classes, as well as the existence of tools to enhance or combine disparate datasets. However, it does not provide information on the specific frameworks used to build these models.
