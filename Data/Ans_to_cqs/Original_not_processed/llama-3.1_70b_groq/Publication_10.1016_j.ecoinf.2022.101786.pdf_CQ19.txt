Answer: The text does not explicitly mention the deep learning framework used to build the model. However, it does mention that the model is based on YOLOv4, which is a real-time object detection system. YOLOv4 is typically implemented using the Darknet framework, which is a neural network framework written in C and CUDA. The text also mentions that the model was trained using a Colab notebook, which is a Google Colab environment that supports various deep learning frameworks, including TensorFlow and PyTorch. However, it does not specify which framework was used in this particular case.
