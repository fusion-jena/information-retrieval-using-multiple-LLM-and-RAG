Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a study on valve gaping in shellfish, using data from sensors and laboratory experiments. It discusses data analysis, clustering, and visualization, but does not mention deep learning or techniques for addressing data bias in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide an answer to the query.
