Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the development of the model using a CNN classifier, the use of various libraries such as Theano, Lasagne, and Librosa, and the training of the model. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed.

The context does mention that the ML pipeline was written in Python v.2.7.12, but it does not provide further details on how the model was serialized, which platform was used for deployment, or any other deployment-related information. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
