Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The text mentions the use of convolutional neural networks, but it does not provide information on the optimization techniques employed, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
