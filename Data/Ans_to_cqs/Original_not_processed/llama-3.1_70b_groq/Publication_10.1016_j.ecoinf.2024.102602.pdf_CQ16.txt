Answer: The criteria used to determine when training is complete is an early stop approach with a patience value of 16. This means that the training process is halted prematurely if the performance on a validation dataset fails to improve beyond a predefined threshold for 16 iterations. This approach is used to prevent overfitting and conserve computational resources.
