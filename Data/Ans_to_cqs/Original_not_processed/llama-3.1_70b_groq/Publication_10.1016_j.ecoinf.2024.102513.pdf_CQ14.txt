Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context appears to be discussing the architecture of a neural network, specifically the convolutional neural network (CNN) and its components, such as the convolutional layer and pooling layer. However, it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
