Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The text focuses on the architecture and performance of the model, including the use of dynamic convolutional kernels, attention mechanisms, and various activation functions. However, it does not provide information on the hardware resources used for training the model, such as GPUs, TPUs, or CPUs. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
