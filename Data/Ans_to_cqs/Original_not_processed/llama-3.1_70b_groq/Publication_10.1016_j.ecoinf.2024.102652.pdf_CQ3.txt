Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that semantic segmentation is applied to the image via the MU-NET deep learning method. This suggests that the data annotation technique used is likely instance segmentation, as semantic segmentation is a process of assigning a category label to each pixel of an image.

However, without more information, it is impossible to confirm this or rule out other data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation. The context only provides information on the training process, loss function, and optimizer used, but does not delve into the specifics of data annotation.
