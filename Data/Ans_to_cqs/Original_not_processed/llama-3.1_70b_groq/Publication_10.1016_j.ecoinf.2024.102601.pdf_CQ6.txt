Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on hyperparameter optimization using RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV for a Random Forest (RF) algorithm, and mentions the selection of predictors from S2 imagery. It does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

However, it does mention the creation of a comprehensive training dataset through a systematic three-step process using the dNBR model, but it does not elaborate on the specific preprocessing steps involved in this process.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
