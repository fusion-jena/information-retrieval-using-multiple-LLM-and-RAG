Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of deep learning models such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer in the pipeline. It mentions the use of GLM (Generalized Linear Model), GAM (Generalized Additive Model), and RF (Random Forest) in the context of model-specific embedding and model fitting, but it does not provide information on the use of deep learning models.
