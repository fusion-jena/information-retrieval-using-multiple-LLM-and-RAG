Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the hyperparameter tuning process using Grid Search Cross-Validation (GSCV) and the modeling algorithms used, but it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
