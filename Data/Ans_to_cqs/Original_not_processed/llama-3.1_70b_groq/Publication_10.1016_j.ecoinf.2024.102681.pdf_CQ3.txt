Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to drought assessment and prediction using deep learning models, specifically a hybrid CNN-LSTM model. It discusses the architecture of the model, the dataset used, and the influencing factors on drought propagation. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.
