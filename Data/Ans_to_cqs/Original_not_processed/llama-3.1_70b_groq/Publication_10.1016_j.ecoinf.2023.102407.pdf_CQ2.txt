Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling (SDM) and mentions various modeling packages and evaluation criteria, but it does not provide information on the data formats used in the pipeline.

However, based on the mention of pseudo-labeling and semi-supervised learning, it can be inferred that the pipeline might be using some form of labeled data, possibly in a CSV or similar format. But this is purely speculative, and without more information, it is impossible to determine the specific data formats used.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the context does not provide enough information to determine the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.
