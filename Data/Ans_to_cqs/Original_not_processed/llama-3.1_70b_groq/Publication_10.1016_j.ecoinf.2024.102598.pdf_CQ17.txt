Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on ensemble modeling, machine learning algorithms, and their application to forest fire susceptibility mapping. It discusses the use of ensemble modeling to enhance predictive accuracy, increase stability, and improve generalization, but it does not delve into the specifics of regularization methods used in deep learning.

However, it does mention that the ensemble modeling approach helps to provide robustness against overfitting by combining the predictions of diverse models. This suggests that the authors are aware of the importance of preventing overfitting, but the specific methods used to achieve this are not mentioned in the provided context.
