Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, bird surveys, and remote sensing, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.

Therefore, I must answer that I don't know what data augmentation techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline, as this information is not provided in the context.
