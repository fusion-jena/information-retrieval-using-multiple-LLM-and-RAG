Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is semantic segmentation, specifically pixel-wise classification. The model is used to locate and delineate artificial and natural objects in photos, with a focus on extracting meaningful information. The model is also used to detect the skyline and extract its detailed delineation, which is achieved by applying a Conditional Random Fields (CRF) to compensate for the limited performance of the net in generating precisely delineated objects.
