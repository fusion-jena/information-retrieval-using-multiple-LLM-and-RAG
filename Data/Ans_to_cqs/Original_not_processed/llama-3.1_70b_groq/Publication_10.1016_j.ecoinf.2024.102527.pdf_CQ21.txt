Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the model training process, hyper-parameter settings, and experimental results. It does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix, that were performed after model training.

However, it does mention that the model performance was tested on the test set and that the accuracies of transfer learning models on the test set were reported in the results section. But it does not provide details on how these accuracies were calculated or what other postprocessing steps were involved.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this query.
