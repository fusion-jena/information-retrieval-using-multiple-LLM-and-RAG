Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of "in-situ EC measurements" and "remote sensing" in the title of the article. 

In-situ EC measurements likely refer to in-situ electrical conductivity measurements, which involve collecting data directly from the soil using sensors. Remote sensing, on the other hand, involves collecting data from a distance, often using satellite or aerial imagery.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline may include in-situ EC measurements and remote sensing. However, without more information, it is unclear if other methods such as surveys or public datasets are also used.
