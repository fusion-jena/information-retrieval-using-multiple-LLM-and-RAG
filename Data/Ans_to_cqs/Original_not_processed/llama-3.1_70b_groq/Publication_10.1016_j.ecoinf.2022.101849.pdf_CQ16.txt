Answer: I don't know. The provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The text primarily discusses weakly supervised learning tasks, different types of noise and constraints in training data, and the challenges of evaluating predictive performance on incomplete data. It does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine the completion of training.
