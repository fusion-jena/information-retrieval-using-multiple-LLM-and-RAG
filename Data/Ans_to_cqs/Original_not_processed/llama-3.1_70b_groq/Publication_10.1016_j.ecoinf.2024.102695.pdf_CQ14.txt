Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It mentions that a learning rate of 0.0001 is used, but it does not provide information on how this value was chosen. Additionally, it mentions that the development of automatic parameter optimization techniques can help mitigate the issue of fine-tuning certain components, but it does not provide further details on this topic. Therefore, I do not know how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.
