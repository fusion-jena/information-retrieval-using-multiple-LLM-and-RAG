Answer:::

To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the authors applied a stratified random selection approach to overcome class imbalance within the evaluation data. This approach allowed for the calculation of reliable evaluation metrics. However, the authors note that this approach alters the distribution of data and prohibits evaluation metrics from being generalized to the unlabelled data.

Additionally, the authors used a grid search technique to tune hyperparameters of the final model, including the number of epochs, batch size, and learning rate. This suggests that they attempted to find the optimal hyperparameters that would result in a model that generalizes well to unseen data.

However, there is no mention of using a diverse dataset or cross-validation techniques to ensure the generalizability of the model. The authors do mention that additional research is needed to investigate more appropriate evaluation methods for highly imbalanced and unlabelled test data, which suggests that they are aware of the limitations of their approach.

It is also worth noting that the authors used a batch size of 64 and 10 epochs for active learning iterations, but it is not clear if this was the result of the grid search or a fixed choice. 

Overall, while the authors took some measures to ensure the generalizability of the model, such as using a stratified random selection approach and grid search, there are some limitations to their approach that are acknowledged by the authors.
