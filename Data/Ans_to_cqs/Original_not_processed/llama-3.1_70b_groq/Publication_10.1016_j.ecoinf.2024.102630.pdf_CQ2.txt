Answer: I don't know. The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or the data formats used in such a pipeline. It appears to be discussing remote sensing data, specifically NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) datasets, and their processing and analysis. The context mentions various datasets, such as MOD13Q1 V6 NDVI, CDR AVHRR NDVI, and GIMMS NDVI, but does not provide information on the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline.
