Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the evaluation of models commonly utilizes Average Precision (AP) as a mainstream performance metric. AP represents the area under the precision-recall curve, denoted as P (precision) and R (recall) at different thresholds. This suggests that the model's performance is evaluated using the Average Precision metric, but the specific strategy or approach used to monitor the model's performance during training is not provided.
