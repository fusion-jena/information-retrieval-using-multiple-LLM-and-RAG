Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be related to model evaluation metrics for species distribution modeling, and does not provide information on the optimization techniques used in the pipeline.
