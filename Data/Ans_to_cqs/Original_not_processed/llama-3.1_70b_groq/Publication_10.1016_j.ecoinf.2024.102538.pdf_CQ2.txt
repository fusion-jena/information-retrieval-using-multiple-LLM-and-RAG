Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that audio data is used, as the context mentions "sound amplitude", "mel-scale spectrogram", and "bird sounds". This suggests that audio data is likely used as input for the deep learning models.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of 2-D mel-scale spectrograms, which are a visual representation of audio data. This implies that the audio data is converted into a 2-D image-like format before being fed into the deep learning models.

There is no mention of video or CSV data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be concluded that audio data, specifically in the form of 2-D mel-scale spectrograms, is used in the deep learning pipeline.
