Answer:::
The provided context mentions one regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, which is weight decay with the Lagrange multiplier λ, also known as L2 regularization. This is mentioned in equation (1) as R(w), where R is the weight decay and λ is the Lagrange multiplier.

However, the context does not mention dropout as a regularization method used in the pipeline. It does mention that fine-tuning the entire network can lead to overfitting, especially among the first layers of the network, but it does not provide a specific method to prevent overfitting in this case.

It is worth noting that the context is focused on the use of pre-trained CNNs (ResNet and GoogLeNet) and fine-tuning them on a new dataset. The regularization method mentioned (L2 regularization) is used in the loss function to prevent overfitting, but other methods like dropout are not mentioned.
