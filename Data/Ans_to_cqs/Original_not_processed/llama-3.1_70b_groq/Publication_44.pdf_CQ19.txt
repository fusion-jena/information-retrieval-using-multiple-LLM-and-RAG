Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. It discusses various components and techniques used in the model, such as Atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP), ResNet-101, Xception, and Faster R-CNN, but does not mention the underlying framework. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the framework used based on the provided information.
