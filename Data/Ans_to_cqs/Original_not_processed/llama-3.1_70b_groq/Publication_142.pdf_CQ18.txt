Answer:::
 
The provided context does not explicitly mention a strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention "network training by reducing internal covariate shift" which is a technique used in the paper "Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift" (arXiv, 1502.03167). This technique is used to improve the training process, but it does not directly answer the question about monitoring model performance.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training.
