Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention anything about model training, postprocessing steps, saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices. The context appears to be related to environmental or ecological data, with sections on vegetation and human impact, but it does not provide any information about machine learning or data analysis. Therefore, I am unable to provide a relevant answer to the query.
