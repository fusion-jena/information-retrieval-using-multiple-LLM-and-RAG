I don't know. The provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily discusses the evaluation of model performance using accuracy metrics, variable reduction for correlation, and modeling approaches, but it does not provide information on the training process or the criteria used to determine its completion.
