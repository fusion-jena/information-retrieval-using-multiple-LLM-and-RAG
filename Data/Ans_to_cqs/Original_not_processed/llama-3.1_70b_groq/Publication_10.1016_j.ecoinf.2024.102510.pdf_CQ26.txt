Answer:::

The provided context mentions several techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. 

One of the techniques mentioned is data augmentation. Data augmentation expands a dataset by applying transformations, such as flipping, translation, and shear, to the existing data. This helps maintain dataset balance, reduce overfitting, and improve the generalization of deep learning models. In the context, horizontal and vertical translations were done within a range of -30 to 30 pixels, and shear distortion was applied within a range of -5 to 5.

Another technique mentioned is collecting more comprehensive and diverse datasets that better reflect the true variability of bird species. This is mentioned as a way to address the limitations and potential biases of the training dataset.

There is no mention of stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling as techniques used to address data bias in the provided context.
