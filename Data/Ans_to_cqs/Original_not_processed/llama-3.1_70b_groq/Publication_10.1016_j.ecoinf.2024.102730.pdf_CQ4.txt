Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning and deep learning in ecology, particularly in vegetation studies, and provides an overview of various machine learning models and techniques.

However, I can provide some general information on common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. Data augmentation is a technique used to artificially increase the size of a training dataset by applying random transformations to the existing data. Some common data augmentation techniques include:

* Flipping (horizontal and vertical)
* Rotating (by a certain angle)
* Scaling (resizing the image)
* Cropping (randomly cropping a portion of the image)
* Color jittering (randomly changing the brightness, contrast, and saturation of the image)
* Noise injection (adding random noise to the image)

These techniques can help improve the robustness and generalizability of deep learning models by exposing them to a wider range of possible inputs. However, without more specific information, I cannot determine which data augmentation techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context.
