Answer: I don't know. The provided context does not mention the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline, such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. It appears to be a research paper or article discussing the development of a deep neural network called BivalveNet for common cockle geographical traceability based on shell image analysis, but it does not provide information on where the code is hosted.
