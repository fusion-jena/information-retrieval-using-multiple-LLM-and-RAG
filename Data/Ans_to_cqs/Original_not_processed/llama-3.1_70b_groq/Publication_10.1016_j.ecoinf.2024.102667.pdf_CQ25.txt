Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its purpose. The context appears to be related to ecological research, specifically focusing on land use/cover changes, vegetation responses to climate change, and the impact of human activities on the environment. The texts mention various research papers, datasets, and methodologies, but there is no mention of a deep learning model or its application. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
