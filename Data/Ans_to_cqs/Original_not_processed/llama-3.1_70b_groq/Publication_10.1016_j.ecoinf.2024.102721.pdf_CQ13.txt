Answer: Unfortunately, the provided text does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The text only mentions that Bayesian optimization (BO) is used to optimize the hyperparameters in the ML model to achieve high simulation accuracy, but it does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters being optimized. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided text.
