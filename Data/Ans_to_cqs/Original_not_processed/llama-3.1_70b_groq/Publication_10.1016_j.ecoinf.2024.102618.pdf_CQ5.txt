Answer:::
The text does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, being used for training the models. However, it does mention that the EfficientNetB0 and ResNet50v2 models were trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database. Additionally, the text mentions a dataset called PlanVillage, which is used for training and testing the proposed deep learning models. It also mentions that the dataset is augmented using a complex data augmentation technique to produce a new dataset.
