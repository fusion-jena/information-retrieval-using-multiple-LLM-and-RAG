Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) for semantic segmentation of nadir photographs to estimate boreal forest ground cover vegetation composition. It discusses the challenges of class-imbalance in the dataset, the methodology used, and the results obtained. However, it does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
