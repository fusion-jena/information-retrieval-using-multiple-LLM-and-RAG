I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. It discusses the use of machine learning methods in ecological informatics, species distribution modeling, and pest and disease management, but it does not provide information on the deployment process of a specific model. The context mentions R packages and references various research papers, but it does not include details on model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related processes.
