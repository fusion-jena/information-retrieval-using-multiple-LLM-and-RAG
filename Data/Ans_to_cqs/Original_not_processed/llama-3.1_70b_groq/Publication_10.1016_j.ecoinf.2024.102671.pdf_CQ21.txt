Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention anything about model training, postprocessing steps, saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context appears to be related to ecological risk assessment, conservation planning, and carbon sink ecosystems, with references to various studies and models such as ZONATION 5.0.
