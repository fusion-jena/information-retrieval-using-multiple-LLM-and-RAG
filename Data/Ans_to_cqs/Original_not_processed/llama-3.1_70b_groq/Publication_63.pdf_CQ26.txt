Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the authors "extracted a random sample of 10% of the dataset of each trait before model training" to create a test dataset, and then split the remaining data into a training dataset and a validation dataset by a ratio of 4:1. This suggests that the authors used random sampling and splitting to create their datasets, but it does not provide information on whether they used techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling to address data bias. Additionally, there is no mention of diverse data collection as a technique used to address data bias.
