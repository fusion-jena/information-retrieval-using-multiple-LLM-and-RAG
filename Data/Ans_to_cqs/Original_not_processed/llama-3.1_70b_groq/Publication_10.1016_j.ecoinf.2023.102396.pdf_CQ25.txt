Answer: 
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its purpose. The context appears to be related to a research article on ecological informatics, specifically discussing the classification of animal population time series using feature-based and shape-match approaches. It mentions techniques such as hierarchical clustering, machine learning, and trend analysis, but does not mention deep learning. Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query.
