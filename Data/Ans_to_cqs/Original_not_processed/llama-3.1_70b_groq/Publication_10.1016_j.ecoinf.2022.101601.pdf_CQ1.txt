Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific methods for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to permafrost and soil properties, with various variables and measurements listed, but it does not provide information on data collection methods for a deep learning pipeline.

However, based on general knowledge, common methods for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline include:

* Surveys: Collecting data through questionnaires, interviews, or other forms of human feedback.
* Sensors: Using physical sensors to collect data on environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, or soil moisture.
* Public datasets: Utilizing existing datasets that are publicly available, such as government datasets or datasets from research institutions.

It's worth noting that the context provided does mention various measurements and variables related to permafrost and soil properties, but it does not provide information on how these data are collected. If you have any further questions or would like more information on a specific topic, please let me know.
