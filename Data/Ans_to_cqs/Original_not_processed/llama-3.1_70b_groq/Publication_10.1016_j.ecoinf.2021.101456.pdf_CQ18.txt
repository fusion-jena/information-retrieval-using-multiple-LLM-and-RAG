Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention a specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention that the model was trained and evaluated on a dataset, and the performance was compared to a non-adaptive VAE. Additionally, it mentions that the model collapsed frequently during training, suggesting that some form of monitoring or evaluation was being performed.

It can be inferred that the model's performance was being monitored through the evaluation of the loss components (ℒrec, ℒreg, and ℒcls) and the clustering performance. The context also mentions that the model's performance was visualized through the latent representation, which was limited to two dimensions for visualization purposes.

However, the exact strategy or metrics used to monitor the model's performance during training are not specified in the provided context.
