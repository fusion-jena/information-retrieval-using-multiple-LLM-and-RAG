Answer::: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context primarily focuses on the DeepLabV3+ model's architecture, its application to land cover classification, and the preprocessing steps taken to prepare the data for training. It also discusses the effects of different cropping sizes and redundancy rates on the model's performance.

However, it does mention that the training set was enhanced through various techniques, including flipping, exchanging image channels, rotating, and adding noise to the images. Additionally, it mentions that 70% of the dataset was used for training and the remaining 30% for validation.

To determine the specific hyperparameters used in the model, such as the learning rate or optimizer, additional information or context would be required.
