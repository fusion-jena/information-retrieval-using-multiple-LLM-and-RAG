Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on optimizing machine learning models (RF, ANN, and GBDT) for predicting flowering dates, but it does not provide information about the datasets used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
