Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing and land use land cover (LULC) mapping using machine learning algorithms, specifically mentioning the use of satellite image data and various machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Networks, Artificial Neural Networks, and k-Nearest Neighbors.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide an answer to the query about the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline.
