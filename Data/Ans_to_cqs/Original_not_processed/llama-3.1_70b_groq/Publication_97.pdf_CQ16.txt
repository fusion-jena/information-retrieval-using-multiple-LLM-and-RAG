Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly state the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention that the training process was stopped after 1500 epochs, at which point the average values for the loss function were less than 0.1. This suggests that the training process may have been stopped based on a combination of the number of epochs and the convergence of the loss function to a low value. However, it does not provide information on whether a validation loss plateau was used as a stopping criterion.
