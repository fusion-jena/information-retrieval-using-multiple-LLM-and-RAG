Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. Specifically, the model is designed to classify bird species based on their sounds. The model uses audio files as input and outputs the predicted bird species. The study aims to investigate the effectiveness of fusing different deep learning models to improve the classification performance. The model is trained on the CLO-43DS dataset, which contains audio files of 43 bird species, and the goal is to achieve a high accuracy in classifying the bird species.
