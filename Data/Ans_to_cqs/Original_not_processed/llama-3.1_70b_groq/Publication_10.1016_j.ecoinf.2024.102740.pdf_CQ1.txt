Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of remote sensing techniques and images acquired in March, April, and May, which suggests that satellite or aerial imagery might be used as a data source. Additionally, the context mentions the use of ground data points for machine learning training, which implies that some form of field data collection might be involved.

The context also mentions the use of QGIS software for processing and analyzing remote sensing images, and SAGA software for performing classification using the Random Forest technique. However, it does not provide information on how the raw data was initially collected.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that remote sensing images and field data collection might be used as methods for collecting raw data, but the exact methods used are not explicitly stated.
