I don't know. The provided context does not mention the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of a deep learning model. It appears to be a snippet from a research article discussing wetland use intensity, ecosystem health, and the use of Sentinel-2 images, but it does not provide information on the evaluation metrics used for a deep learning model.
