Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on functional data analysis, spatial-functional data analysis, and fisheries acoustics techniques, with a specific study on analyzing a multifrequency acoustics dataset. The context discusses dimension reduction techniques, principal component analysis (PCA), and empirical covariance functions, but does not mention deep learning or data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide an answer to this query.
