Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the references to image classification tasks, such as ImageNet classification and plant species identification, it can be inferred that image data is used in the pipeline. The context mentions "thousands of pictures per class" and "training image data," which further supports the use of image data. No information is provided about the use of audio, video, or CSV data formats in the pipeline.
