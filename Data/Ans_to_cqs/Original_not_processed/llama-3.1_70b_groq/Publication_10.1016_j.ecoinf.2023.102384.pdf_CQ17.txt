Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the data preprocessing, patch-based training, and validation procedures, as well as the challenges associated with the dataset, such as the presence of contaminants and bycatch insects. It also references several research papers related to deep learning-based pest detection and counting, but does not provide information on the specific regularization methods used.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
