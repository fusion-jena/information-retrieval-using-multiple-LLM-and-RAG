Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as cross-validation or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that both data sets (SSLs' and elephants') were split into training and testing images with a ratio of 80:20, respectively. This suggests that the data was split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

Additionally, the context mentions that the models were trained on pre-trained weights based on the Imagenet data set, which is a large and diverse dataset. This could potentially help improve the model's generalizability to new, unseen data.

However, without further information, it is unclear whether other measures such as cross-validation, stratified splitting, or data augmentation were used to ensure the generalizability of the model.
