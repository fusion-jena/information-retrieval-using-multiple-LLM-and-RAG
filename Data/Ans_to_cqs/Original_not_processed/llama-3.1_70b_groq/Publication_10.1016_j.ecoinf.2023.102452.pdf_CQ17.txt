Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. The context appears to be focused on various applications of machine learning and data-driven approaches in fields such as hydrology, ecology, and signal processing.

However, I can provide some general information on regularization methods commonly used in deep learning. Regularization techniques are used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function or by modifying the model's weights. Some common regularization methods include:

* Dropout: randomly drops out neurons during training to prevent the model from relying too heavily on any single neuron.
* L2 regularization (also known as weight decay): adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the magnitude of the model's weights.
* L1 regularization: adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the absolute value of the model's weights.

These methods are widely used in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization performance. However, I couldn't find any specific information on these methods in the provided context.

If you're looking for information on regularization methods used in specific studies or applications, I recommend checking the references provided in the context or searching for relevant literature in the field.
