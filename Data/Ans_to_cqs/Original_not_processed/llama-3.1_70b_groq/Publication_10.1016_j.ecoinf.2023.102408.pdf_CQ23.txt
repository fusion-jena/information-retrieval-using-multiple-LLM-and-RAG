Answer:::

To ensure the generalizability of the model, a stratified sampling method was applied to all AGB observations. This technique randomly allocated 70% of the samples to the training dataset and the remaining 30% to the validation dataset. This approach helps to maintain the same distribution of data in both the training and validation sets, which is essential for evaluating the model's performance and preventing overfitting.

Additionally, the model's performance was evaluated using three error statistics: R2, mean absolute error (MAE), and RMSE. These metrics provide a comprehensive understanding of the model's accuracy and help identify potential issues with overfitting or underfitting.

It is also mentioned that the value of the parameter (c) was used to optimize the line fit and penalize the number of samples inside the margin, which suggests that regularization techniques were employed to prevent overfitting.

However, there is no mention of using a diverse dataset or cross-validation techniques to ensure the generalizability of the model.
