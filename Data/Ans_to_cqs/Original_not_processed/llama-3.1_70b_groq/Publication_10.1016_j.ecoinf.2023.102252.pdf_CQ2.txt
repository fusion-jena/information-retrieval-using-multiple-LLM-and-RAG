Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or any specific data formats used in such a pipeline. The context appears to be related to a research article about a floodplain ecological response model, and it discusses topics such as environmental flows, riparian ecosystems, and biodiversity maintenance. However, it does not provide any information about data formats used in a deep learning pipeline.
