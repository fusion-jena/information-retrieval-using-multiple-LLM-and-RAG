Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the application of deep learning models in various environmental studies, such as forest fire prediction, land use/land cover classification, and assessing the impact of flooding on fish populations. It does not provide information on the specific techniques used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning models.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
