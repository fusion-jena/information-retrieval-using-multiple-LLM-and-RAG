Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily discusses techniques for handling unbalanced training data in land use and land cover (LULC) mapping, including undersampling, oversampling, and combinations of oversampling and undersampling. It also mentions the use of a hexagonal random-sampling strategy and a tile model to improve the accuracy of LULC mapping. However, it does not delve into the specifics of deep learning pipeline regularization methods. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to this query.
