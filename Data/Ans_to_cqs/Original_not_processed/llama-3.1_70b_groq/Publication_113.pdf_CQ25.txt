Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model in the provided context is object detection. According to the text, "Object detection models facilitate the handling of multiple species in images and can effectively eliminate background pixels from subsequent classification tasks." This suggests that the model is designed to detect objects (in this case, species) within images, and then potentially classify them. The model is also compared to image classification models, implying that its primary function is object detection rather than classification.
