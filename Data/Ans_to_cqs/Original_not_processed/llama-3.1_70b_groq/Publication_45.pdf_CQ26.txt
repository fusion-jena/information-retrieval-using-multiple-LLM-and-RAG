Answer:::
The provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the available data is frequently split into a training data set and a test data set to gauge the accuracy of predictions for new input data. This suggests that data splitting techniques, such as stratified splitting, may be used to ensure that the training and test data sets are representative of the overall data distribution.

Additionally, the context mentions that the details of the network architecture and the training process strongly determine the prediction accuracy of the network, and that these details are usually problem-specific. This implies that different techniques may be used to address data bias depending on the specific problem being addressed.

Some of the references provided, such as Reichstein et al. (2019) and Rumelhart et al. (1986), are related to deep learning and machine learning, but they do not specifically mention techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive answer to the query. However, it can be inferred that data splitting techniques, such as stratified splitting, may be used to address data bias during preprocessing. Other techniques, such as oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, may also be used, but this is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
