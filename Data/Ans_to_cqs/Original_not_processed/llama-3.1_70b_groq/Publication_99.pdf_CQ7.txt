Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that "For each training epoch, a model was evaluated using the validation set and was saved as the best model based on a validation loss." This suggests that the data was split into training and validation sets, but the exact criteria or proportions used for the split are not specified.

Additionally, the context mentions that the dataset was balanced, but it does not provide information on how the data was split for testing. It is common practice to split data into training, validation, and testing sets, but the exact proportions and criteria used can vary depending on the specific problem and dataset.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
