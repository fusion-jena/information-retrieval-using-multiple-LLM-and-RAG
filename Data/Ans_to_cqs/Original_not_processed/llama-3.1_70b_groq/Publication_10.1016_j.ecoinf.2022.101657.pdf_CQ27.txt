Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context discusses the potential for training bespoke neural networks for species sets, the possibility of reducing power consumption by implementing neural networks in hardware, and references various research papers on related topics. However, it does not provide information on the specific steps taken to deploy the trained model.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
