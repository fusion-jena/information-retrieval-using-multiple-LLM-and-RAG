Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does describe the data augmentation techniques used to enhance the training set for the DeepLabV3+ model. These techniques include:

* Flipping the images and labels along the X or Y axis
* Exchanging between multiple image channels while keeping the labels unchanged
* Randomly rotating the images and labels by 90Â°
* Randomly adding noise to the images while maintaining the labels unchanged

These techniques can help increase the diversity of the training data and potentially reduce bias, but they do not specifically address data bias. The context also mentions that 70% of the dataset was used for training and the remaining 30% for validation, but it does not mention stratified splitting or other techniques to address data bias.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know what specific techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, beyond the data augmentation techniques mentioned.
