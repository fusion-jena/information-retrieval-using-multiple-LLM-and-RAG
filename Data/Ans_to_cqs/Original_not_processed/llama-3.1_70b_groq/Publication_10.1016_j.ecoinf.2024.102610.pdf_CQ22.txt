Answer: The provided context does not specifically mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. However, it does mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models in general. 

According to the context, the model performance was assessed based on the "out-of-bag" R2 and RMSE values, which is an indication of how well the model generalizes the unseen data. R2 values ranging from 0.38 to 0.41 were mentioned as the attained performance of the trained models. 

Additionally, the context mentions the use of area under curve (AUC) values to evaluate the performance of deep learning and classical machine learning models in predicting the abundance of yellow fever mosquitoes. The AUC values mentioned are 0.83 for deep learning and 0.75 for classical machine learning. 

It is also mentioned that the R2 values for predicting tick abundance in Southern Scandinavia were 0.69 for tick larvae and nymphs, and 0.1 for adult ticks. 

Therefore, the metrics mentioned in the context for evaluating model performance are R2, RMSE, and AUC. However, it is not explicitly stated which metrics are used for the deep learning model specifically.
