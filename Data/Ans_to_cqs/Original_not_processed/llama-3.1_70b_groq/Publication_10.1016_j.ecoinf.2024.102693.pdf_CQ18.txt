Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that standard evaluation metrics such as accuracy, macro-precision, macro-recall, and macro-F1 score were employed to assess the performance of the models. Additionally, the parameters of the basic models were exclusively updated using the training set, whereas the weights of the ensemble methods were calculated on the validation set. This suggests that the model performance was monitored and evaluated on the validation set during training, but the specific strategy or criteria used to monitor performance is not provided.
