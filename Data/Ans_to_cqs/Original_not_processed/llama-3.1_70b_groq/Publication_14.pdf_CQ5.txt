Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the author collected images for each class and trained a fine-tuned neural network with a batch size of 100 for 20,000 steps. This suggests that the author used a custom dataset, but the exact composition of the dataset is not specified.

The context does mention the use of pre-trained models, which could be based on popular datasets such as ImageNet. However, this is not explicitly stated. The author also mentions the use of Google Cloud DataFlow to extract feature vectors for the frozen layers, which could be related to the dataset used, but again, this is not explicitly stated.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
