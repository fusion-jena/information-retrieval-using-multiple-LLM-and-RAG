Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It mentions the use of deep learning models for predicting soil organic carbon (SOC) and other ecological components, and references various studies and tools such as Keras, R, and modEvA. However, it does not provide information on the deployment platform used. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
