Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Specifically, it is a dynamic Î²-VAE, which is a variant of the traditional VAE model. The VAE model is used for unsupervised and semi-supervised learning tasks, and it consists of an encoder neural network and a decoder neural network. The encoder maps the input data to a latent representation, and the decoder reconstructs the input data from the latent representation. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and the PyTorch framework.
