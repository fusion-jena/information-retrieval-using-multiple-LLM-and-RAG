Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on the use of deep learning models, particularly Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) and Transformer-based architectures, for tasks such as precipitation nowcasting and vegetation response prediction. It also mentions the use of Earth observation data, including Sentinel-2 data, but does not provide information on data annotation techniques.
