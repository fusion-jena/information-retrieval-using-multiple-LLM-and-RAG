Answer:::

To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. 

Firstly, the models were initialized with the pre-trained weights of ImageNet, which is a large and diverse dataset with around 1.28 million images over 1000 generic object classes. This fine-tuning approach allows the model to leverage the knowledge learned from a large and diverse dataset, which can improve its generalizability.

Secondly, data augmentation techniques were applied to increase the size of the dataset from 100 to 6000 images. Data augmentation involves generating new training data by applying transformations to the existing data, such as rotation, flipping, and cropping. This can help to increase the diversity of the dataset and reduce overfitting.

However, there is no mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting in the provided context. Cross-validation is a technique used to evaluate the performance of a model on unseen data, and stratified splitting is a technique used to split the data into training and testing sets while maintaining the same class distribution. It is unclear whether these techniques were used in this study.

Overall, the use of pre-trained weights and data augmentation techniques can help to improve the generalizability of the deep learning model, but the lack of information on cross-validation and stratified splitting makes it difficult to fully assess the generalizability of the model.
