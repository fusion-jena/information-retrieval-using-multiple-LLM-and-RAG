Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context appears to be focused on crop classification, chlorophyll content estimation, and vegetation extraction using remote sensing data and machine learning methods. It does not discuss deep learning pipelines or randomness handling strategies.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
