Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the model development, specifically the optimization of the BatNet model and the use of batch normalization layers to prevent overfitting. It also discusses the training process and the use of a large batch size. However, it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps that occur after the model training.
