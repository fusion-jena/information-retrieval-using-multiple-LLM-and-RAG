Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The text only mentions that a sample of 500 individuals is "randomly selected" during the port sampling process, but this refers to the sampling of fish for species identification and size measurement, not to the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know what strategies are employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
