Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of the "Overlap Sampler" technique in the context of the Faster RCNN method. This technique is used to balance the disparity between background and foreground when generating boxes.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of focal loss, which is a loss function that is designed to address class imbalance problems. Focal loss diminishes the impact of straightforward samples on training loss while amplifying the significance of challenging ones.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of a classification network that is designed to mitigate overfitting through the use of a Dropout layer. However, this is not directly related to addressing data bias during preprocessing.

Overall, the provided context does not provide a comprehensive answer to the question of what techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention a few techniques that are used to address related issues, such as class imbalance and overfitting.
