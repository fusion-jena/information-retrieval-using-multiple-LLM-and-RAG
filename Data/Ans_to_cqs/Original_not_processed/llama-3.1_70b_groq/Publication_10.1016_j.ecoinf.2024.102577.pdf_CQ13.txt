Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context appears to be related to a research paper on using machine learning to aid sustainable Indian Ocean tuna purse seine fishery, but it does not provide specific details on the hyperparameters used in the model. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
