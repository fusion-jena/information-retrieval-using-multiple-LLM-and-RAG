Answer:

The provided context does not specifically mention the use of a deep learning model, but rather discusses the evaluation of thematic maps produced by a calibrated statistical prediction method. However, it does mention the use of certain metrics to evaluate the performance of the model.

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model are:

1. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
2. Mean Error of Commission (MEC)

These metrics are used to evaluate the accuracy of the model's predictions. Additionally, the context mentions the use of relative deviations of these metrics from their reference values, expressed as percentages (e.g., relative RMSE).

It's worth noting that the context does not mention the use of accuracy, precision, or recall, which are common metrics used to evaluate the performance of classification models. The focus of the context appears to be on evaluating the accuracy of continuous predictions, rather than classification performance.
