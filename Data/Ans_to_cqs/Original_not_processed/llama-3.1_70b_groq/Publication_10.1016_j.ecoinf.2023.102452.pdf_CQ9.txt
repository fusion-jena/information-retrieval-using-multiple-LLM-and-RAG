Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a collection of academic references and a snippet of text discussing the use of Genetic Programming (GP) for modeling and feature selection. There is no mention of a data repository or a specific deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to the query.
