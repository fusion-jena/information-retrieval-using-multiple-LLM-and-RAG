Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of pre-existing datasets such as ImageNet and Herbarium255, Herbarium1K, which suggests that public datasets are utilized in the pipeline.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of images of herbarium specimens and non-dried plant images, which implies that the data may be collected through digitization of physical specimens or through photography. However, the exact methods used for collecting these images are not specified.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of a PC challenge, which may imply that the data is collected through some form of competition or crowdsourcing effort. However, without further information, it is difficult to say for certain.

Overall, based on the provided context, it appears that public datasets and possibly digitized or photographed images of physical specimens are used in the deep learning pipeline. However, the exact methods used for collecting raw data are not explicitly stated.
