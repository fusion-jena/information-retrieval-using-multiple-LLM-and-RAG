Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a research paper on Human Activity (HA)â€“Natural Endowment (NE) coupled zoning, and it discusses the use of Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for clustering and zoning. However, it does not provide information on the preprocessing steps for training a deep learning model.

That being said, the context does mention data preprocessing steps in Section 2.3, which includes using ArcGIS10.5 software for spatial data processing. However, these steps are specific to the spatial data processing and do not provide general information on preprocessing steps for training a deep learning model.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. If you have any further context or clarification, I would be happy to try and assist you.
