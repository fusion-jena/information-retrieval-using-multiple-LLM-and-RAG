Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. The text appears to be a research paper or article discussing carbon sinks, ecological risk, and ecosystem services, with references to various studies and publications. There is no mention of a code repository or a deep learning pipeline, so I am unable to provide an answer to the query.
