Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the dataset was unbalanced, with iceplant being the minority class, and that multiple methods exist in the literature to improve balance in a dataset (He and Garcia, 2009). 

It is mentioned that the authors were able to create a reasonably balanced final training dataset having 38% iceplant points and 62% other vegetation points without having to discard, repeat, or create synthetic data points. This suggests that some form of sampling or data collection strategy was used to balance the dataset, but the specific technique is not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not know the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline in this study.
