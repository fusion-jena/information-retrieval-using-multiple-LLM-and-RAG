Answer: None of the mentioned deep learning models (CNN, RNN, Transformer) are used in the pipeline. The text mentions the use of a Random Forest (RF) model, which is a type of ensemble learning model, but not a deep learning model. Additionally, the text mentions the potential application of "neural networks" in future research, but it does not specify the type of neural network or its architecture.
