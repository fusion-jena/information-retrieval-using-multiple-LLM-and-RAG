Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning for wildfire event predictions in Australia, seasonal prediction systems, and other related topics. It does not delve into the specifics of data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the development of an algorithm to collect data automatically by Halgamuge et al. (2020), but it does not provide further details on the data augmentation techniques used. Similarly, the context mentions the use of deep learning technology and methodology, but it does not specify the data augmentation techniques applied.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
