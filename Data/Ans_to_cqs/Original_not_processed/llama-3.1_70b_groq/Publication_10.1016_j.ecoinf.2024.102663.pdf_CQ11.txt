Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of deep learning techniques for fish biomass estimation, the architecture of the YOLO model, and the challenges of estimating fish biomass in turbid environments, but it does not provide information about a data repository link.
