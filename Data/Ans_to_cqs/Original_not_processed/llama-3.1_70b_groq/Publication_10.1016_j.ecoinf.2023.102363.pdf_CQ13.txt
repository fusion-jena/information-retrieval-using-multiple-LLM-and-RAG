Answer:

The deep learning model uses the following hyperparameters:

* Learning rate: 0.001 (for the base model) and 0.0004 (for fine-tuning with a cyclical learning rate)
* Optimizer: Adam optimizer
* Decay factor: 0.75 (for the base model)
* Step size: Not specified
* Dropout rate: 0.2 (used during fine-tuning)
* DropConnect: Employed during fine-tuning
* Number of epochs: 50 (for fine-tuning)
* Early stopping: Set to deploy if the validation loss does not improve within 10 epochs (for fine-tuning)

Note that these hyperparameters are used in conjunction with the EfficientNet B0 network, which is a pre-trained network that has been fine-tuned for the specific task at hand.
