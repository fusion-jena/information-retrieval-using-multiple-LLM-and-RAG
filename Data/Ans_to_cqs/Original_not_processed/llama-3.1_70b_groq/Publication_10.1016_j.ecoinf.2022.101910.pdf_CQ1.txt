Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of sound recordings for bird vocalization detection and classification. Specifically, it mentions the use of AudioMoth, a low-cost and open-source sound recorder, for passive acoustic monitoring. Additionally, it mentions the use of external microphones with AudioMoth to potentially improve the detection range.

It can be inferred that the raw data for the deep learning pipeline, in this case, is likely collected through sound recordings obtained from AudioMoth or other similar devices. However, the context does not provide information on other methods that might be used for collecting raw data, such as surveys or public datasets.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the answer to the query is that sound recordings obtained from devices like AudioMoth are used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive answer to the query as the context does not provide information on other methods that might be used.
