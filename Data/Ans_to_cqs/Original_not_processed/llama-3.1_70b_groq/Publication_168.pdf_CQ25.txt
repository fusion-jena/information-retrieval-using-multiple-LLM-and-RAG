Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model in the provided context is classification. Specifically, it is used for forest species classification of UAV hyperspectral images. The model is designed to classify different types of forest species, such as Osmanthus, Holly, Platanus orientalis, and others, based on the spectral features of the hyperspectral images. The model uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to extract features from the images and classify them into different categories.
