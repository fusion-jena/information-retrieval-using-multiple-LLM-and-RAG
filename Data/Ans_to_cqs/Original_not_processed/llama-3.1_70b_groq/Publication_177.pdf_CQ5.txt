Answer:::
The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are UBD_45 and VP_200. These datasets are used to evaluate the performance of various deep neural network models, including InceptionResnet2, Resnet50, Xception, Inceptionv3, Mobilenetv2, and Googlenet. The UBD_45 dataset is used to train and test the models, and the VP_200 dataset is also used for training and testing. The models are initialized with pre-trained ImageNet weights and then fine-tuned to the UBD_45 and VP_200 datasets.
