Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context only provides information about the constitutive layers and tensor/vector shapes for the unstained/stained CNN and the clubmoss/spikemoss CNN, as well as supplementary materials that include notebooks used to define and train the CNNs. However, it does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in the models. To find this information, one would need to access the Mathematica notebooks or PDF files provided in the supplementary materials.
