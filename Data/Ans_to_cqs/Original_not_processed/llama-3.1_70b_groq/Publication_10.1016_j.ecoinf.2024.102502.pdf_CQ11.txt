Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. It only mentions the GEE online repository (https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/) as a source for retrieving the EOS data catalogue, but this is not related to a deep learning pipeline.
