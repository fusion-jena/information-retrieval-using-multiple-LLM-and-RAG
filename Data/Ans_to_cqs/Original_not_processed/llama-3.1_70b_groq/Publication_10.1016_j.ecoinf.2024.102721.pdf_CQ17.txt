Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning methods, specifically LSTM, for forecasting ecological water demand and scenario analysis of oasis NDVI. It does not provide information on the regularization techniques used to prevent overfitting. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
