Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Flipping, Rotating, or Scaling. The context appears to focus on Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and their architecture, optimization objectives, and applications in generative modeling and unsupervised learning tasks. It does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. 

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
