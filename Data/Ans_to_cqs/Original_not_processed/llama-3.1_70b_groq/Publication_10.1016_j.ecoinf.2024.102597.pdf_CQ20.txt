Answer: 
The text does not explicitly mention the use of deep learning models, but it does mention the training of machine learning models, specifically CatBoost, RF, GBDT, LightGBM, and XGBoost. According to the text, a GPU was not used for training the CatBoost model, but it does not provide information on the hardware resources used for the other models.
