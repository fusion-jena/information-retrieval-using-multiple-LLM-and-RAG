Answer:::

The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training is the Leave-One-Group-Out (LOGO) cross-validation approach. In this approach, each multitemporal transect is used once as a test set while the remaining transects are used for training. This means that the data is split into training and testing sets based on the multitemporal transects, with each transect being held out once for testing.

In the classification problem (Q1), a complete 450 m multitemporal transect is omitted from the training process and subsequently tested. This approach ensures that every multitemporal transect undergoes testing and that the model's performance is assessed accounting for the data constraints.

In another testing strategy, three transects (~17% of the data) are excluded for testing in each iteration, specifically one from each target class - "Plateau" (p), "White-sand" (w), and "Riparian" (r). This approach is used to measure the model's performance across all transects, and a cumulative evaluation is performed using the coefficient of determination (R2) between true vs predicted for all 648 multitemporal transects predictions.

There is no mention of a validation set in the provided context, so it is unclear if a separate validation set is used in addition to the training and testing sets.
