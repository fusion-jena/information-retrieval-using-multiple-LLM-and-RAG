Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a project called SMARTLAGOON, which involves collecting water quality data from satellite remote sensing services. It discusses the development of a tool for collecting historical and near real-time data from different SRS products, but it does not mention data annotation techniques or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide an answer to the query.
