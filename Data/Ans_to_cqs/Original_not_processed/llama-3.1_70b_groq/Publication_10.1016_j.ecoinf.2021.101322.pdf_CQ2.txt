Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the references to image datasets (e.g., Salmon scale 9056 image dataset) and the use of a CNN-based architecture (EfficientNet), it can be inferred that the primary data format used in the pipeline is images. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
