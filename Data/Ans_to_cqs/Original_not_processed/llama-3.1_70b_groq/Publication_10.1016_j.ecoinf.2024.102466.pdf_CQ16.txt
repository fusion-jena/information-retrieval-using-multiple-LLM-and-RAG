Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily discusses the challenges of object detection in complex environments, the importance of dataset quality, and the performance of different object detection approaches. It also provides some details about the dataset, including the number of images for training and validation, and the division of the metric area into three distinct ranges. However, it does not provide information on the training process or the criteria used to determine when training is complete.
