Answer:::
The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE). The MAE of the validation dataset was computed after each epoch to track the training progress. The Mean Squared Error was used as the loss function during the training process.
