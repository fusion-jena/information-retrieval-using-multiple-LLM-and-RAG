Answer:::
The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. In fact, the context does not mention a deep learning model at all. It appears to be discussing a Random Forest (RF) model, specifically its implementation in Google Earth Engine (GEE) and its application to wildfire events and vegetation recovery. The only hyperparameter mentioned is the number of trees in the RF model, which was set to 500 to improve computational efficiency.
