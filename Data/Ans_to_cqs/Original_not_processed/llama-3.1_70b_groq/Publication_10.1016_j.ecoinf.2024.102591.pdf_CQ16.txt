Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to focus on the FIREMAP algorithm, its functionality, and the datasets used for training and validation, but it does not provide information on the training process itself or the criteria used to determine its completion. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
