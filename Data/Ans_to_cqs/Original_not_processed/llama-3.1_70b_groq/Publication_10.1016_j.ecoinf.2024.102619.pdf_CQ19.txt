Answer: PyTorch is used to build the deep learning model. Specifically, the PyTorch ML framework is used for deep learning, particularly for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Additionally, the skorch library, which is a scikit-learn compatible neural network library that wraps PyTorch, is also used to keep the model training and analysis pipelines comparable.
