Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the use of machine learning (ML) models, including Lasso and Random Forest (RF), and their performance in comparison to each other. It also mentions the use of the signature method for data transformation and the importance of dataset size on model accuracy.

However, it does mention the use of Lasso, which is a type of regularization method that uses L1 regularization to prevent overfitting. Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) is a regularization technique that adds a penalty term to the loss function to reduce the magnitude of the model's coefficients, thereby preventing overfitting.

Other regularization methods like dropout and L2 regularization are not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot confirm if they are used in the deep learning pipeline or not.

In summary, the only regularization method mentioned in the context is Lasso, which uses L1 regularization. Other regularization methods like dropout and L2 regularization are not mentioned.
