Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the training set was further randomly sampled to select training and validation sets to obtain optimized model hyperparameters. This suggests that the model performance was evaluated on a validation set during the hyperparameter tuning process. Additionally, the Optuna package was used for hyperparameter tuning, which is a Bayesian optimization framework that can be used to optimize model performance. However, the specific strategy or metrics used to monitor model performance during training are not provided.
