Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning pipelines or optimization techniques such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be focused on the use of Random Forest classification for mapping coastal and seagrass habitats, and references various studies related to this topic. There is no mention of deep learning or optimization techniques, so I am unable to provide a specific answer to this question.
