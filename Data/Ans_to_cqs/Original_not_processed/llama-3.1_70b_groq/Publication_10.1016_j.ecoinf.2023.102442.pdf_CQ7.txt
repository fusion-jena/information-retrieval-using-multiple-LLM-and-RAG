Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context primarily focuses on the process of selecting mining pixels, collecting training data, and using cluster classification maps to guide class selection. It also mentions the use of a stratified (by class) random sampling approach to select 70 training sites for each of the five classes, but it does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions the use of a supervised classification algorithm and the collection of training data, which suggests that the data was likely split into training and testing sets. But the exact criteria used for this split are not specified.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to the query.
