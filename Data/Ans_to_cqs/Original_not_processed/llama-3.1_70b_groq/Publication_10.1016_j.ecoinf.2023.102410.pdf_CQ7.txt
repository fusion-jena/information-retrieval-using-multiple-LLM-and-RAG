Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deep learning model training, data splitting, or criteria used for train, test, and validation sets. The context appears to be related to data analysis of vocalisations, specifically tracking and localisation of vocalisations, and mentions methods such as Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) and visual verification of localisation estimates. However, it does not provide any information about deep learning model training or data splitting.
