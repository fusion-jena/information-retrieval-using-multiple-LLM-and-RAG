Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and design of the EfficientNetV2 model, its improvements over previous models, and its applications. It also mentions other related concepts and models, such as Bottleneck Transformers and MobileNetV2, but does not provide information on hyperparameters.

However, it does reference a paper by Ruder (2016) on gradient descent optimization algorithms, which may be relevant to understanding the optimization techniques used in the model. But without further information, it is not possible to determine the specific hyperparameters used in the model.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
