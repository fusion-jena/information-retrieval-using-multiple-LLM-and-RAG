Answer: The text does not specifically mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that a "stratified random sampling approach" was used to split the data into training and testing sets. This approach was chosen to ensure that the training and testing datasets accurately represented the distribution of AGB values within the LiDAR-derived AGB maps. The text also mentions that a "randomly selected half of the pixels" were used for the training and testing split, but it does not provide further details on the specific criteria used for splitting the data.
