Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model performance is being monitored through the calculation and reporting of various loss values during training and validation.

The loss values for the training and validation datasets are provided for epoch 20, including the total loss, RPN anchor classifier loss, RPN bounding box loss, Mask R-CNN classifier loss, Mask R-CNN bounding box loss, and Mask R-CNN mask loss. The validation loss values are also reported, including the validation RPN bounding box loss, validation RPN classifier loss, validation Mask R-CNN bounding box loss, and validation Mask R-CNN mask loss.

This suggests that the model performance is being monitored through the tracking of these loss values during training and validation, which is a common strategy in deep learning model training. However, the specific strategy or metrics used to evaluate the model performance are not explicitly stated in the provided context.
