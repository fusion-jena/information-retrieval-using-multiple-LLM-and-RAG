Answer: The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training is k-fold cross-validation, specifically with k = 5. This means that the data is split into 5 different training-test sets, and the model is trained on each training split separately. The split with the highest mAP50 value, which indicates the highest number of correctly predicted labels, is used as the ideal split for the model. In this case, the ideal split has a mAP50 value of 0.987. Additionally, the data is split using functions from the Python library scikit-learn.
