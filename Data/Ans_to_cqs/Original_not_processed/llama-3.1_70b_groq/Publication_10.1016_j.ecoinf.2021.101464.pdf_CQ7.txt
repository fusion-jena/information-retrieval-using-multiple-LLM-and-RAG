Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be related to a Random Forest (RF) model, not a deep learning model. It discusses the results of the RF model, including the RMSE and R2 values, and the process of tuning the model's parameters. However, it does not provide information on data splitting criteria for deep learning models.
