Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and its application in ecological studies, but it does not provide information on the evaluation metrics used for deep learning models. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
