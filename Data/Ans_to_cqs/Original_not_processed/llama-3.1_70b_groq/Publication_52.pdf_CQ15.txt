Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the theoretical framework of Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) and their application in handling and analyzing Big Data. It also briefly mentions the GRELMA algorithm for clustering, but it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
