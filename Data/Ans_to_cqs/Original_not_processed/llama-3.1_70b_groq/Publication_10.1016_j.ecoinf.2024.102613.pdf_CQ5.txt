The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to IoT, smart farming, and data visualization, but it does not provide information about the datasets used in deep learning. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
