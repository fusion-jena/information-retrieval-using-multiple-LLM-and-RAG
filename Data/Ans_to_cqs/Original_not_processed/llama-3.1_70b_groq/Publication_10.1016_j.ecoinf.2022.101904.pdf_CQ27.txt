Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the performance of different deep learning models, including Vision Transformer (ViT), Swin Transformer, and the proposed 3DUNetGSFormer, on wetland classification tasks. It also discusses the challenges of limited ground-truth data for large-scale wetland mapping and the potential of the proposed model to adaptively synthesize wetland training data.

However, the context does not provide information on how the trained models were deployed, such as model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related processes. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
