To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the dataset was divided into training (80%), validation (10%), and test sets (10%). This 80-10-10 split ensured a more extensive training set, potentially leading to a better-generalized model. The test set, which the model had not previously seen during the training or validation phases, indicated the model's performance in real-world scenarios.

Another measure taken was the use of cross-validation with a fixed number of folds, specifically tenfold cross-validation. This provided a reliable estimate of the model's performance, balancing the trade-off between bias and variance and guarding against overfitting.

Additionally, hyperparameter tuning was performed using GridSearchCV with cross-validation. This process involved a detailed and systematic search across a predefined grid of hyperparameter values, ensuring that the eventual choice of hyperparameters was not arbitrary but was backed by empirical evidence. This helped to reduce bias in the model predictions.

While the text does not explicitly mention the use of a diverse dataset or stratified splitting, the measures taken, such as the 80-10-10 split and cross-validation, helped to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
