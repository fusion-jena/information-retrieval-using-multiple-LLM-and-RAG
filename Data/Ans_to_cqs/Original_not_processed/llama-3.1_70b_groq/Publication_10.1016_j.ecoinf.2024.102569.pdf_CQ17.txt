Answer:::

The provided context does not specifically mention deep learning or the regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, it does mention the use of L1 penalty (also known as Lasso regularization) in the context of penalized loss function for shrinkage estimation and variable selection.

According to the context, the L1 penalty is defined as ∑p k=0 ϕk|βk|, where ϕk is a constant tuning parameter, and βk is the coefficient parameter. This penalty is used to regularize the model and prevent overfitting by adding a term to the loss function that penalizes large values of the coefficients.

While the context does not mention dropout or L2 regularization, it does mention the use of L1 penalty, which is a type of regularization method used to prevent overfitting. However, it is not specifically mentioned in the context of deep learning pipelines.
