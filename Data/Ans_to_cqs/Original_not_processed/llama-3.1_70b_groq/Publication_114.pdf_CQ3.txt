Answer: 
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that Flood et al. [35] manually labeled a selection of 1 km2 for training a U-net convolutional neural network to extract woody vegetation extent from high-resolution three-band Earth-I imagery. This suggests that manual labeling was used as a data annotation technique in this specific study. 

Additionally, the context mentions that the final results of Flood et al.'s research were pixel-wise and only two types (trees and large shrubs) were mapped. This implies that pixel-wise annotation might have been used, but it is not explicitly stated.

For the specific study mentioned in the context, which includes a classification of various tree types (Table 2), the data annotation technique used is not mentioned.
