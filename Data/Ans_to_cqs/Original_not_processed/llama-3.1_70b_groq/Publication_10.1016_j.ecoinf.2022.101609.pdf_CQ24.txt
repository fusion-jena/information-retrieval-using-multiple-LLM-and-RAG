Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning for air quality prediction, model evaluation, and the use of distributed computing clusters. It does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of Horovod, a distributed deep learning framework, which might imply the use of techniques to manage randomness in the training process. Nevertheless, without explicit information, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer to this question.

If you're looking for strategies to handle randomness in deep learning, some common techniques include setting a fixed random seed, using techniques like dropout and batch normalization to reduce overfitting, and employing ensemble methods to average out randomness. However, these are general strategies and not specifically mentioned in the provided context.
