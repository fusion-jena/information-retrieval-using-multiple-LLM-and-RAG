Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is to validate the model by combining the original base model validation set with 100 frames per class from the labelled December 3rd 2019 training set, randomly pooled per experiment. This allows the model's performance to be assessed across both environments simultaneously. Additionally, the model is set to deploy if the validation loss does not improve within 10 epochs, which is a form of early stopping.
