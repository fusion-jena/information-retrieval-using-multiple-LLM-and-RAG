Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It mentions the use of TensorFlow, which is an open-source machine learning library, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. The references listed at the end of the text also do not provide any information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
