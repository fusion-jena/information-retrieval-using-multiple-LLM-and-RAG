Answer:::
The data augmentation technique applied in the deep learning pipeline, as mentioned in the context, is random saturation adjustments to each training example. This technique introduces variations in color intensity, contributing to a more comprehensive and robust training dataset. However, it does not mention other common data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling.
