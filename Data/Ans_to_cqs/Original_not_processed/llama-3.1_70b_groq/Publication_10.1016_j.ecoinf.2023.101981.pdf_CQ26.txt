Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to the analysis of animal vocalizations, specifically deer vocalizations, and discusses the use of machine learning algorithms for detection and classification. It does not provide information on data preprocessing techniques or strategies for addressing data bias. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
