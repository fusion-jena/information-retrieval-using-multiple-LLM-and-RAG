Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be focused on digital soil mapping, remote sensing, and land cover classification, with references to various machine learning algorithms and techniques, including artificial neural networks, random forests, and support vector machines.

However, I can suggest that data augmentation techniques are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to artificially increase the size of the training dataset, reduce overfitting, and improve model generalization. Common data augmentation techniques include:

* Flipping (horizontal and vertical)
* Rotating (by a certain angle)
* Scaling (resizing images)
* Color jittering (changing brightness, contrast, and saturation)
* Cropping (randomly cropping images)
* Noise injection (adding random noise to images)

But, I don't know if these specific techniques are applied in the context of the provided references.
