Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are used to evaluate the model's performance. 

The context mentions that the performance metrics are reported separately for each defined class, and averages over all classes are also reported. This suggests that the model's performance is being monitored and evaluated using these metrics during training. Additionally, the context mentions hyperparameter tuning, which implies that the model's performance is being monitored and adjusted during training to achieve optimal results. 

However, the specific strategy or technique used to monitor the model's performance during training, such as validation sets or early stopping, is not mentioned in the provided context.
