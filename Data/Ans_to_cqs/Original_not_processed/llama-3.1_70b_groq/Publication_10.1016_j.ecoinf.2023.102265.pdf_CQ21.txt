Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the manual classification algorithm, automatic classifier training and validation, and the computational expense of the proposed method.

It does mention the use of 5-fold cross-validation during the training and validation of the classifier, but it does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps taken after model training. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this query.
