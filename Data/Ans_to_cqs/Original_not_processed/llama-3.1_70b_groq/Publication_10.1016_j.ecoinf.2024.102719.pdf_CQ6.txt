Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on the comparison of different machine learning models, including ensemble methods, and their performance on a specific task. It discusses the bias-variance decomposition, the use of different algorithms, and the evaluation of their performance.

However, it does mention the use of bootstrapping, which is a resampling technique that can be used to generate different subsets of the data for training and testing. This can be considered a preprocessing step, but it is not directly related to normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model.
