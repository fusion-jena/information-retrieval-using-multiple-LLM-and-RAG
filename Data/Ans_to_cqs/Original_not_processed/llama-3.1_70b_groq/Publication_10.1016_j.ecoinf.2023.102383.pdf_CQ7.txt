Answer: According to the provided context, the dataset is initially divided into separate subsets based on the number of deer in each image. Within each subset, the images are further partitioned into three sections using a ratio of 75:15:15. This suggests that the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are:

1. Stratification by the number of deer in each image
2. Random partitioning within each stratum using a 75:15:15 ratio for training, validation, and testing subsets, respectively.

This approach is used to address the issue of an unbalanced distribution of deer numbers across the different images in the dataset, which could raise concerns if the dataset were randomly divided into training, validation, and testing subsets.
