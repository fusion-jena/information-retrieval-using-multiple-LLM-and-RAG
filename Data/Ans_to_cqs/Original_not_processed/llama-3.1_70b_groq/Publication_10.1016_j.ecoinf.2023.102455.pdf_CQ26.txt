Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the configuration of the model, the use of metaheuristic optimization and cross-validation schemes for hyperparameter tuning, and the application of a pooling layer for data compression. It also discusses the importance of data preprocessing methods in analyzing and extracting non-linear behaviors between predictor-predictand relationships.

However, it does mention that conceptual machine learning (ML) and data preprocessing methods are highly recommended and considered reliable tools to effectively analyze and extract non-linear behaviors between the predictor-predictand relationships. This suggests that data preprocessing is an important step in the pipeline, but it does not provide specific techniques used to address data bias.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
