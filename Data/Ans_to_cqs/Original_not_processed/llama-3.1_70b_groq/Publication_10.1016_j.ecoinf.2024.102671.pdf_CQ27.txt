Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. The context appears to be related to ecological research, carbon sink risk zones, and the use of the InVEST model for simulating ecosystem services. It does not provide any information on deep learning models or their deployment.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question as it is not relevant to the provided context.
