Answer: The deep learning pipeline uses audio and image data formats. The audio clips are first converted into spectrograms, which are then used as input images for model training. The spectrograms are essentially images with a height of 438 pixels and a width of 436 pixels. The model training process involves merging four original spectrograms into one big input image, which is then used to train the YOLOv5s model. There is no mention of video or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
