Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention anything about model training, postprocessing steps, saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices. The context appears to be related to a study on land use/cover changes, climate change, and ecological engineering programs in China, using remote sensing data and metrics such as Growing Season NDVI (GSN) and CHFA.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not relevant to the provided context.
