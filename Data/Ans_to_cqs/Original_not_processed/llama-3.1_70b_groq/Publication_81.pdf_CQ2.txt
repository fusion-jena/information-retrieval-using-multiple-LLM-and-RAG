Answer:::
The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is numerical data, which is obtained by converting DNA barcode sequences into numerical data using one-hot encoding. The original data is in the form of DNA sequences, which are first aligned to obtain sequences of the same length, and then converted into numerical data for processing by the deep learning model.
