Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention a specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention that users should consider the quality of their supplied mask annotations for training dataset images and that they should anticipate iteratively training models with different sized training datasets and parameters until suitable performance is achieved. This suggests that the model performance is monitored through evaluation metrics, but the specific metrics or evaluation methods used are not mentioned.
