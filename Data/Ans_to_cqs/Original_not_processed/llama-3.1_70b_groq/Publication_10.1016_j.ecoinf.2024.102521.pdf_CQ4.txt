Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline of STARdbi. The text describes the pipeline as including steps such as sampling flying insects, scanning images, uploading images and metadata, and automatic detection of insects in the images. However, it does not provide details on data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
