Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or any measures taken to ensure its generalizability. The context appears to be discussing species distribution models (SDMs) and the effects of sample size on their performance, as well as methods for addressing sampling bias in SDMs. 

However, it does mention the importance of having a sufficient number of presence sites to build an effective SDM, and that many datasets suffer from both sampling bias and a low number of presence sites. It also mentions the use of different approaches to transform the model input data to address sampling bias, such as modifying the presence dataset to tend towards a uniform distribution, and using a uniform random selection for the background set.

But it does not provide information on the use of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or diverse datasets in the context of SDMs or deep learning models.
