Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on the configuration and evaluation of machine learning models for streamflow forecasting, including the use of various algorithms and models such as CNN-BiGRU, KELM, RVFL, and CNN-BiRNN. It does not provide information on data annotation techniques.
