Answer:

According to the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models are:

1. Validation Accuracy: measures the proportion of correctly classified instances in the validation dataset.
2. Precision: quantifies the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances among all instances predicted as positive.
3. Recall (also known as sensitivity or true positive rate): measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all actual positive instances.
4. F1-Score: not explicitly defined in the context, but mentioned as a performance metric used to evaluate the performance of classification models.

These metrics are used to assess the performance of the model on a given task, and are commonly used in evaluating the effectiveness of machine learning models.
