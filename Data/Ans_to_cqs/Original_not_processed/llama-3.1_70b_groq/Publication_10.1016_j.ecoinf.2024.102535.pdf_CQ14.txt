Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses the results of experiments using different network architectures (VGG, ResNet, and Xception) and substratum characterization criteria, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
