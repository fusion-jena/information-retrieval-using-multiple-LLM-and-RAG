Answer: The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, the text mentions the use of pre-trained CNNs such as VGG16, ResNet101V2, and ResNet152V2, which are fine-tuned for bioacoustics research. The text also mentions the use of ResNet50 in other studies, but the primary focus is on the use of CNNs for analyzing vocalisations. There is no mention of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers in the provided context.
