Answer:::
The criteria used to determine when training is complete is the highest Mean IoU (MIoU) value. According to the text, "the highest MIoU value was employed to determine the point at which the DNN attained optimal performance." This suggests that the training process is considered complete when the model achieves the highest MIoU value, indicating optimal performance. There is no mention of validation loss plateau as a criteria for determining the completion of training.
