Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model for insect classification using STARdbi. The text discusses the importance of training data, labeling of individual insects by experts, and the need for a modular classification scheme, but it does not delve into the specifics of preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

However, it is mentioned that STARdbi provides a built-in mechanism for users to manually label some of their images and trigger retraining, which suggests that some form of data preparation or preprocessing may be involved. Additionally, the text mentions that the performance of a task-specific classifier is presented in the Results section as a case study, but it does not provide details on the preprocessing steps used in that case study.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model using STARdbi.
