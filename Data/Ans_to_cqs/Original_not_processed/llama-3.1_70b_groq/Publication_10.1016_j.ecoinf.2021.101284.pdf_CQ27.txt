Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a research paper on COVID-19 and air pollution, and it discusses various models (M1, M2, M3, M4, M5) and their results, but it does not provide information on the deployment of a deep learning model.

However, it does mention a paper by Castillo (2020) that uses a deep learning algorithm for early diagnosis of COVID-19-affected patients based on X-ray and computed tomography images. But it does not provide details on the deployment process of this model.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
