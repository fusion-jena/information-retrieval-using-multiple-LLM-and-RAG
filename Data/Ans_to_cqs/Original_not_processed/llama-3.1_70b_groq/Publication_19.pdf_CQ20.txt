Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. It mentions the use of Keras for implementing the models and TensorFlow Lite for edge computing, but it does not provide information about the training hardware. Therefore, I do not know which hardware resources (e.g., GPUs, TPUs) were used for training the deep learning models.
