Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the LASSO model are optimized. It only mentions that the LASSO model is used for variable selection and statistical regularization, and that the analysis was performed using the lars() function in the lars package in R. However, it does not provide information on the specific method used for hyperparameter tuning, such as grid search or random search.
