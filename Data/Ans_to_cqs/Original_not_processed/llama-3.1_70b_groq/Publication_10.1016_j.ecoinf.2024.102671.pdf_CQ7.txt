Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be related to ecological research, data sources, and research papers, but it does not provide information on data splitting criteria for deep learning model training.

However, it is common practice in machine learning to split data into training, testing, and validation sets using techniques such as random sampling, stratified sampling, or k-fold cross-validation. The specific criteria used to split the data can depend on the research question, data characteristics, and the goals of the study.

In the context of ecological research, data splitting criteria might consider factors such as spatial and temporal autocorrelation, hierarchical structures, and the need to maintain representative samples of different ecological zones or features.

Without more specific information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query.
