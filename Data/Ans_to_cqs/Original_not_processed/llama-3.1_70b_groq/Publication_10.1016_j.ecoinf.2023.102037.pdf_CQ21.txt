Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training. The text primarily discusses the data splitting and image tiling process, as well as the model's performance and its potential application in automated insect monitoring. It does mention the use of "Slicing Aided Hyper Inference" (SAHI) when applying the YOLOv5 model on a sticky plate image, but it does not elaborate on the postprocessing steps.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query. If you have any additional context or information, I would be happy to try and assist you further.
