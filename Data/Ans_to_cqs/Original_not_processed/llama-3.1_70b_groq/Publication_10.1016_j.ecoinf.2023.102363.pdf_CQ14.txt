Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text only mentions the specific hyperparameters used for fine-tuning the model, such as the cyclical learning rate of 0.0004, the number of epochs (50), and the dropout rate (0.2). However, it does not provide information on the method used to optimize these hyperparameters, such as grid search, random search, or other methods.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
