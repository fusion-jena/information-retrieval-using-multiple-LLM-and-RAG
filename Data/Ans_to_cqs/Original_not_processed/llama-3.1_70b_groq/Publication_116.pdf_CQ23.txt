Answer:::

To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the experiment used a dataset with images from at least two different specimens for each species. This was done to avoid the Single Specimen Per Batch (SSPB) bias, which can occur when images from the same specimen are used in both the training and testing datasets.

In the unbiased dataset experiment, the unique specimen identifier was used to place images from the same specimen in either the training dataset or the testing dataset. This restriction was used to avoid the SSPB bias and to approximate a 70%-30% distribution between the training and testing datasets.

However, it is not mentioned in the provided context whether cross-validation or stratified splitting were used to further ensure the generalizability of the model. The experiment did use a biased dataset and an unbiased dataset to compare the results and check for the SSPB bias, but the specific measures taken for cross-validation or stratified splitting are not mentioned.

It is also worth noting that the dataset was created to preclude scenarios where there are photos of several leaves from the same specimen, which could make it harder to approximate the ideal 70%-30% distribution. However, the exact measures taken to ensure diversity in the dataset are not specified in the provided context.
