Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. However, it does mention the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the machine learning algorithms.

According to the context, the algorithms are evaluated using Precision, Recall, and F-measure. The F-measure is used to rank the algorithms, as it is considered a more suitable measure for this dataset due to its imbalance.

The context also provides the formulas for calculating Precision, Recall, and F-measure, which are:

Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
F-measure = 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)

where TP is the number of true positive predictions, TN is the number of true negative predictions, FP is the number of false positive predictions, and FN is the number of false negative predictions.

While the context does not explicitly mention the calculation of a Confusion matrix, it is likely that one was used to calculate the evaluation metrics, as the formulas provided are typically used in conjunction with a Confusion matrix.

As for Saliency maps, there is no mention of them in the provided context.
