Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, it does mention the evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance, which are:

1. Precision
2. Recall
3. mAP0.5
4. mAP0.5:0.95
5. Params(M)
6. Flops(G)
7. Inference(ms)
8. Time(h)

These metrics are used to evaluate the model's performance on the validation and testing sets. However, the context does not provide information on other postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrices. Therefore, I do not know the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training beyond the calculation of these metrics.
