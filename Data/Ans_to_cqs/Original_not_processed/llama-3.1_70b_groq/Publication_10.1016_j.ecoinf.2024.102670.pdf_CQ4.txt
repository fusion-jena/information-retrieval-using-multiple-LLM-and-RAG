Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily discusses the challenges of obtaining ground truth data, the use of crowd-sourcing for annotation, and the application of deep learning-based models for image analysis. It also mentions the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the models, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
