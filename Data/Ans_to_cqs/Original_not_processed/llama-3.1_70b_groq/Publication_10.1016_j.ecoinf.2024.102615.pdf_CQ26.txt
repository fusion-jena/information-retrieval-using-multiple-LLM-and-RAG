Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the raw dataset was randomly shuffled and divided into training, validation, and test sets with a ratio of 8:1:1, and this process was repeated ten times to reduce the influence of random splitting. This suggests that the authors attempted to reduce bias by using random sampling and repeated partitioning.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of batch normalization and dropout layers in the MLP model, which can help to reduce overfitting and improve generalization. However, these techniques are not specifically aimed at addressing data bias.

The context does not mention stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection as techniques used to address data bias. Therefore, it is unclear whether these techniques were used in this specific study.

It is worth noting that the context does mention the use of metaheuristics for optimizing weights in neural networks, which could potentially be used to address data bias. However, this is not explicitly stated in the provided context.
