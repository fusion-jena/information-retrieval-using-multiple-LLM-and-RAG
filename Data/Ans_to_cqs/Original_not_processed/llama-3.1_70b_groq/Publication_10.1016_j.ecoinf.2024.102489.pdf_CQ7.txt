Answer: 

The provided context does not specifically mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that for the Random Forest (RF) model, the training samples were randomly divided according to proportions of 80% and 20% and used for the training and test datasets, respectively. Additionally, a five-fold cross-validation method was used to search for the optimal parameters of the model.

It is also mentioned that the study used a grid search method (GridSearchCV) based on the out-of-bag (OOB) error to search for the optimal parameters of the model. However, this is specific to the RF model and not deep learning models in general.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query regarding the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training.
