Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the description of the Wind2TSM model, which utilizes five machine learning methodologies, including Neural Networks (NN), but it does not provide information on the deployment process.

However, it does mention the use of Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Neural Networks (NN) in the context of the Wind2TSM model, but it does not elaborate on the deployment process.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
