Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be focused on the development and application of neural network models, including the backpropagation neural network (BPNN) and deep learning algorithms. It discusses the architecture and training of neural networks, but does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
