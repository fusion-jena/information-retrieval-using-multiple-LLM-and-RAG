Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context only provides the primary hyperparameter settings of the three detection models (YOLOX, YOLOv8, and VFL) in Table 2, but it does not discuss the optimization process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
