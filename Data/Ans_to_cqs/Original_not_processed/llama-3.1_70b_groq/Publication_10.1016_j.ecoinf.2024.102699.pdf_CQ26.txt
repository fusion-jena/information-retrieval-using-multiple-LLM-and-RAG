Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection. However, it does mention the use of data augmentation techniques to improve the performance of the models.

The context mentions the use of various data augmentation techniques, including adding noise, pitch shift, time mask, frequency mask, gain, loudness normalization, horizontal flip, vertical flip, time stretch, and tanh-based distortion. These techniques are used to artificially increase the size of the training dataset and reduce overfitting.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of "randomized partial time and frequency stretching" and "randomly added weighted noise samples extracted from audio chunks that did not contain bird events." These techniques may help to reduce bias in the data by increasing the diversity of the training samples.

However, it is not clear if these techniques are specifically used to address data bias or if other techniques such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling are used. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the question.
