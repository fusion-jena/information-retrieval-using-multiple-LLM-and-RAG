Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is cross-validation. Due to the low amount of data available, cross-validation was used to ensure the statistical results and prevent overfitting. This technique involves randomly shuffling the dataset and dividing it into a training and evaluation set K times. A new model is trained for each cross, resulting in K different models, each trained on a different version of the dataset. The performance of each model is then evaluated, and the results are averaged to better understand the model's capability on the dataset. This approach allows for a more robust evaluation of the model's performance and helps to identify potential issues with overfitting.
