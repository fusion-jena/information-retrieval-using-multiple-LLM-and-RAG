Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information given, it can be inferred that the pipeline involves high-resolution imagery, as mentioned in the context of individual tree species mapping in tropical forests and large-scale semantic classification of aerial images.

Therefore, it is likely that the pipeline involves image data formats, but the exact format (e.g., TIFF, JPEG, PNG) is not specified. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
