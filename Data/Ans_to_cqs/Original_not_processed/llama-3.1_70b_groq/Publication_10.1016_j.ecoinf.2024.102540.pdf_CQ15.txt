Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the use of deep learning models, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the YOLOv5 model family, for image classification and object detection tasks. It discusses the dataset splitting ratio, characteristics of deep learning models, and the use of a NVIDIA A100 GPU for processing, but does not provide information on optimization techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
