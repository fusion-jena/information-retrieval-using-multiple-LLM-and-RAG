Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. The context appears to be related to a study on land use and land cover (LULC) classification using Random Forest and spectral indices, but it does not provide information on deep learning models or their hyperparameters.
