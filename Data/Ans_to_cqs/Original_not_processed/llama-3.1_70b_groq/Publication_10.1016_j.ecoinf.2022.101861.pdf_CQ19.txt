Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. It mentions the use of machine learning algorithms and the development of a machine-learning-powered app called BirdNET, but it does not provide information on the specific frameworks used to build the model. The context appears to be focused on the application of machine learning in bird research and citizen science, rather than the technical details of the model's implementation.
