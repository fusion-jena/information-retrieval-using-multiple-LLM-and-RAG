Answer: 

The provided context mentions two methods used for collecting raw data: surveys and commercial fishing data. Specifically, it mentions "survey data" and "commercial data" as two separate sources of information. The survey data was collected over a period of two months, covering an area between 29째S and 39째S, while the commercial data was collected over eleven months, covering a broader spatial range between 33째S and 42째S. 

Additionally, the context mentions "acoustic surveys" as another method used for collecting data, citing Lillo et al. (2005) for further details on the sampling design. However, it does not provide information on the use of sensors or public datasets as methods for collecting raw data.
