Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be discussing the results of a study on bird call classification using different feature extraction methods, including Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), BirdNET, VGGish, Wav2Vec 2.0, and acoustic indices. It discusses the classification accuracy of these methods at different distances, but it does not provide information on the training process or the criteria used to determine when training is complete.
