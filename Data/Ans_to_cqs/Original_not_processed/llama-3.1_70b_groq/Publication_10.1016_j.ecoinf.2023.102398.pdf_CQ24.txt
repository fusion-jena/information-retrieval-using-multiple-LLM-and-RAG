Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and training of a deep learning model, specifically a YOLOv5 model with a SENet attention mechanism, and discusses hyperparameter tuning, training results, and performance metrics. It does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the pipeline.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of optimized hyperparameters and a restrictive and gradually increasing training cycle to avoid over-training and biased training. This suggests that the authors may have taken steps to ensure the reproducibility and stability of the training process, but the specific strategies used to handle randomness are not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this question.
