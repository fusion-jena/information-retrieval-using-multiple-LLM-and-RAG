Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and performance of the EfficientDet model, as well as its application to seagrass coverage estimation and mapping. It does not provide information on the dataset used, data preprocessing, or evaluation protocols employed to ensure the model's generalizability.

However, it is mentioned that the EfficientDet model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark Microsoft Common Objects in Context (MS COCO) dataset, which suggests that the model has been evaluated on a large and diverse dataset. Nevertheless, without further information, it is unclear whether other measures such as cross-validation or stratified splitting were employed to ensure the model's generalizability.
