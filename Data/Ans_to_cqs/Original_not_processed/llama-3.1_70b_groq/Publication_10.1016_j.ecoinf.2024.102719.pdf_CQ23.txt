Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The text discusses the importance of generalizability in machine learning models for predicting river health and mentions that bias-variance decomposition is widely adopted for evaluating the generalizability of ML models. However, it does not provide specific information on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model used in the study.

The text does mention that the study aims to evaluate the generalizability of various ML models, including deep learning models, but it does not provide details on the methods used to achieve this. It also mentions that the study uses bias-variance decomposition to evaluate the generalizability of the models, but it does not provide information on other measures such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know what specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
