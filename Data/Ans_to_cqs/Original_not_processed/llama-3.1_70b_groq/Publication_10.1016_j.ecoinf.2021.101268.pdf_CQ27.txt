Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the performance of different deep learning models (AlexNet, VGG-19, ResNet-101, and DenseNet-201) on a Peruvian Amazon Forestry Dataset, including their accuracy on raw and pre-processed images, and the effect of swapping testing sets between pre-processed and raw images. It also discusses the importance of interpretability in deep learning models and the contributions of the paper, including the introduction of the Peruvian Amazon Forestry Dataset. However, it does not provide information on the deployment process of the trained model, such as model serialization or platform selection.
