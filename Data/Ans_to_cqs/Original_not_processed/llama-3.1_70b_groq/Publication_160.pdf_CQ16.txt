Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. It only mentions that the "deeply learned features and the different layer outputs of the training, validation, and test sets were extracted in advance" and that "LRs were trained and optimised using the grid search tool implemented in scikit-learn on the validation set." This suggests that the training process was optimized using a grid search, but the specific stopping criteria are not mentioned.
