Answer:

The provided context does not specifically mention the evaluation metrics used for a deep learning model. However, it does mention the evaluation metrics used for a Random Forest (RF) model, which is a type of machine learning model. According to the context, the performance of the RF model is evaluated using the following metrics:

* adj_R2 (adjusted R-squared)
* RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
* MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
* KGE (Kling-Gupta Efficiency)

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the RF model in predicting chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations in Poyang Lake. However, it is not clear if these metrics are also used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model, as deep learning is only mentioned in the context of a state-of-the-art review on applications of deep learning in water quality management.
