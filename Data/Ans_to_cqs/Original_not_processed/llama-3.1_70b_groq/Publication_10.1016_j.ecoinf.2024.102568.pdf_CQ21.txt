Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context appears to be focused on the experimental design and results of a study on air quality monitoring using machine learning models, specifically LSTM and VR + SVR. It discusses the performance of the models under different conditions, such as limited training data and varying weather conditions, but does not provide information on postprocessing steps like saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
