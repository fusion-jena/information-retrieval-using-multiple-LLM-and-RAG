Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. However, it does mention the evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance, which are the coefficients of determination (R2) and the root mean squared error (RMSE). 

It is mentioned that the R2 values are calculated as the squared Pearson's correlation coefficient, which measures the percentage of variation in the response variable explained by the model. The RMSE is calculated as the square root of the mean of the squared differences between the actual and predicted values.

Additionally, the context mentions that the overfitting was assessed by comparing the model's performance on the training, validation, and test datasets. However, it does not provide information on other postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrix.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the answer to the query is that the postprocessing steps involved after model training include the calculation of evaluation metrics such as R2 and RMSE, and the assessment of overfitting by comparing the model's performance on different datasets. However, other postprocessing steps such as saliency maps and confusion matrix are not mentioned.
