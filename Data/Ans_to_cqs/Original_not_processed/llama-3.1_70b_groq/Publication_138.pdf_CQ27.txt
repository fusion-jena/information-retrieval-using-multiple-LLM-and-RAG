Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context mainly discusses the architecture and performance of various deep learning models, including LeNet, AlexNet, and GoogLeNet, as well as the proposed ICSNet model. It also provides some experimental results and discusses the relationship between mini-batch size and accuracy. However, it does not provide any information on model deployment, such as model serialization or platform selection.
