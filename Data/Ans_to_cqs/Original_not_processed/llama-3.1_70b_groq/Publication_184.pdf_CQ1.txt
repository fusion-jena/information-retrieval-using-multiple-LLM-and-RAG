Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of images and annotations for training a model, specifically a Yolo model for fish tracking and counting. 

It can be inferred that the raw data might be in the form of images, possibly collected from underwater environments, as suggested by the mention of seagrass, corals, and fish in different environmental circumstances. However, the exact methods used for collecting these images, such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets, are not specified in the provided context.
