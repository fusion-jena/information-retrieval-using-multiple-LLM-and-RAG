Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific deep learning frameworks used to build a model. It discusses the use of machine learning techniques in combination with segmentation to classify images, but it does not provide information on the specific frameworks used. The context appears to be focused on the application of machine learning and segmentation techniques in ecological informatics, rather than the implementation details of deep learning models.
