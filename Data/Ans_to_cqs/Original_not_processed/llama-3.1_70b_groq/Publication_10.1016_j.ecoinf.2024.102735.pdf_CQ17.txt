Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily discusses the use of machine learning models, including random forest, multilayer perceptron, long-short term memory, and support vector regression, for predicting algal-related parameters and identifying drivers of harmful algal blooms. It also mentions the tuning of parameters such as the kernel function, epsilon, regularization parameter (C), and degree to improve model performance, but it does not provide information on the specific regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
