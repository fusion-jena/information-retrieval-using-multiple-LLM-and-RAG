Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the active learning framework, hyperparameter tuning, and the application of the model to bird call recognition. It does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in the pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
