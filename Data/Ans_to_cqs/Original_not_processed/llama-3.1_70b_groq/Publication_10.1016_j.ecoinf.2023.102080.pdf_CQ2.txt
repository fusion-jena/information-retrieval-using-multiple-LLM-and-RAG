Answer: I don't know. The provided context does not mention the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. It appears to be related to a package called "covsel" for covariate selection in species distribution modeling (SDM), and discusses algorithms, correlation coefficients, and data frames, but does not mention deep learning or specific data formats like image, audio, video, or CSV.
