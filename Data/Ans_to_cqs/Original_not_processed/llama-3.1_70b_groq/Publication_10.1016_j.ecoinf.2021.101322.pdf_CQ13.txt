Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The context only mentions that the CNN hyperparameters configurations used for all four networks during training are shown in Table 1, but the actual table is not provided. Therefore, I do not know the specific hyperparameters used in the model.
