Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model is image segmentation. Specifically, it is designed to automate the segmentation of fish images, isolating the target fish body from the background. The model uses transfer learning with pre-trained COCO weights to successfully automate image segmentation of fishes currently unrepresented within COCO out-of-the-box. The model aims to facilitate the rapid execution of accurate, high-throughput image segmentation of digitized organisms, requiring no extensive programming knowledge.
