Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. It discusses the importance of reducing device bias in audio recordings, the applicability of acoustic indices for broader comparative analyses, and proposes a preprocessing approach to tackle issues related to audio signal processing. However, it does not provide information on the deployment process of a trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection.
