Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention that a pre-trained VGG16 network was adapted for transfer learning on the dataset. This implies that the dataset was likely preprocessed to match the format and requirements of the VGG16 network, which was trained on the ImageNet dataset.

Typically, when using a pre-trained network, the input data is preprocessed to match the format of the pre-trained network. This may include resizing the images to a specific size, normalizing the pixel values, and possibly applying data augmentation techniques. However, the specific preprocessing steps used in this case are not mentioned in the provided context.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of a modified ResNet-101 and Xception models, which may have different preprocessing requirements. However, without further information, it is not possible to determine the specific preprocessing steps used in this case.
