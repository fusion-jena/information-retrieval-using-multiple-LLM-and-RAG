Answer: I don't know. The provided context does not mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. It mentions the use of species observation data from a public authoritative repository (GBIF) and the application of a data pre-processing algorithm to obtain 17 datasets, but it does not specify the format of these datasets (e.g., image, audio, video, CSV).
