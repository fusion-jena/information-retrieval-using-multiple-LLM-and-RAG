Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, confusion matrix, or specific metrics calculation beyond the ones mentioned for model performance evaluation.

However, it does mention that to assess the model's performance, the following metrics were calculated: the coefficient of determination (R2), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Relative Root Mean Square Error (RRMSE). These metrics are used to evaluate the model's performance, but it does not provide information on other postprocessing steps like saliency maps or confusion matrix.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I can only confirm that metrics calculation is one of the postprocessing steps involved after model training, but I do not have information on other specific postprocessing steps.
