Answer: I don't know. The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the spatial resolution of the FWI and FFMC data layers, the nine-cell approach, and provides some tables with vegetation and human impact measures, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization.
