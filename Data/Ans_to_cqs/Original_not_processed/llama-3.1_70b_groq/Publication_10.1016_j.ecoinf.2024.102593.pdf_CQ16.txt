Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The text primarily focuses on the use of Embedding Visualization (EV) for model selection, active learning, and input selection, but it does not delve into the specifics of training completion criteria.

However, it does mention that model performance is evaluated using statistical comparisons between model predictions and known classes from a held-out part of the training dataset or an unrelated labelled dataset. This suggests that some form of performance metric is used to assess model performance, but the exact criteria for determining training completion are not specified.

Therefore, I do not know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, as this information is not provided in the given context.
