Answer:::
The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image. The paper mentions that the endemic bird data was split into 3,132 images for training and 760 images for testing, and that the training dataset was augmented 10 times, resulting in a total of 31,320 images. This suggests that the deep learning models were trained on image data. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
