Answer:::

To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. However, based on the provided context, I can only identify one technique that is mentioned, which is bootstrapping. According to the text, a bootstrapping approach using the spThin package in R was employed to address spatial sampling biases and spatial autocorrelation challenges. This approach involved 50 iterations of bootstrapping with a minimum thinning distance of 1 km, resulting in 12,577 unique locations. This process effectively minimized the removal of records while significantly mitigating sampling bias.

The other techniques mentioned in the query, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, are not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I do not know if these techniques were used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.

It is worth noting that the context primarily focuses on ensemble modeling, machine learning algorithms, and data mining techniques for forest fire dynamics, rather than deep learning pipelines specifically. Therefore, the information provided may not be directly applicable to the query.
