Answer: 
The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. According to the provided context, the model is designed to predict whether plant species images belong to any of the 100 categories of plant species. The model uses a softmax function for classification in the output layer, and after analyzing the time features, it sorts the plant species images through a fully connected layer to predict the required time.
