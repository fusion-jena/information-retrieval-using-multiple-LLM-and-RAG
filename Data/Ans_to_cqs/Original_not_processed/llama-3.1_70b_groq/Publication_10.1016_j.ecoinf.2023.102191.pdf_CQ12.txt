Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or any specific type of model such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. The context appears to be related to a research paper about crowdsourcing biodiversity data from recreational SCUBA divers using a mobile app called Dive Reporter. It discusses the use of citizen science, biodiversity monitoring, and marine taxa, but does not mention deep learning models or any specific type of model.
