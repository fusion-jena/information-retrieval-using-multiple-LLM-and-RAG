Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. It only mentions that the programming language used is Python 3.7 (64-bit) and the integrated development environment is Anaconda 3. However, it does mention that the sklearn package is used for support vector regression and PyWavelets is used for the wavelet transform. But for deep learning, it only mentions the use of LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) without specifying the framework.
