Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. It only provides information on the number of files and duration of the recordings for each species in the train, validation, and test sets.

However, it can be inferred that the data was split into three sets: train, validation, and test. The train set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to monitor the model's convergence and adjust hyperparameters, and the test set is used to evaluate the model's performance.

The context also mentions that the test recordings were split into five-second chunks with one second of overlap, and the model predicted all five-second excerpts and averaged their outputs to indicate the recording-level decision. However, this is a strategy used for making predictions on the test set, not for splitting the data.

Therefore, the exact criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not specified in the provided context.
