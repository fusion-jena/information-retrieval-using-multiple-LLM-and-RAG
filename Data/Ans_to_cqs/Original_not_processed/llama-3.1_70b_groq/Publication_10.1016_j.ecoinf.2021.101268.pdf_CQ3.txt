Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The text only mentions that the dataset includes "detailed metadata" and that the images were "pre-processed" and "segmented", but it does not provide further details on the annotation techniques used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
