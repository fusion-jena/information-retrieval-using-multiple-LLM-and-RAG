Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the architecture and training of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), as well as various research papers and techniques related to deep learning. However, it does not provide information on the datasets used.

The only dataset mentioned in the context is the "GREMM dataset", which is used in Table 7 to report the discrimination accuracy of ensemble MIA and SNN. However, no further information is provided about this dataset.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query. If you have any additional context or information, I would be happy to try and assist you further.
