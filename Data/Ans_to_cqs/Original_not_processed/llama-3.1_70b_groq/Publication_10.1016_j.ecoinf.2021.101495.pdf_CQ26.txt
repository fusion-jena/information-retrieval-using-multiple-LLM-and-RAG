Answer:

Based on the provided context, it appears that data augmentation is used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. According to the text, "Data augmentation: x12" is mentioned, indicating that the dataset is augmented 12 times to increase its size and diversity. This technique is used to artificially increase the size of the training dataset, which can help to reduce overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.

Additionally, the text mentions that the dataset is split into training and testing sets, with a train/test split of 0.9/0.1 and 0.8/0.2 for the segmentation and classification models, respectively. This suggests that stratified splitting may be used to ensure that the training and testing sets are representative of the overall dataset.

However, there is no mention of oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection techniques being used to address data bias. Therefore, it is unclear whether these techniques are used in the preprocessing pipeline.

It is worth noting that the context provided is limited, and it may not be a comprehensive overview of the preprocessing pipeline. Therefore, it is possible that other techniques may be used to address data bias that are not mentioned in the provided text.
