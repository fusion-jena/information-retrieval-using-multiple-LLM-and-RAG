Answer: The provided context does not explicitly state the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. It only mentions that the structure and hyperparameters of the model are determined by assessing the effectiveness of validation data forecasts using data from points A, B, and C. The context also mentions that the adjustment process of the solver for training the network and the input time series length for all models is illustrated in Table 1, but it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training.

However, it is mentioned that the RMSE of the validation data forecasting results is used to evaluate the performance of the models, and the hyperparameters are selected based on the optimization of the validation data forecast results. But the specific criteria for determining when training is complete are not specified.
