Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of the Python library scikit-learn for splitting the data and investigating the results of each trained model. Additionally, it mentions YOLO, which is a deep learning model for object detection, but it does not specify the framework used to implement YOLO. Therefore, I do not know the specific framework used to build the deep learning model.
