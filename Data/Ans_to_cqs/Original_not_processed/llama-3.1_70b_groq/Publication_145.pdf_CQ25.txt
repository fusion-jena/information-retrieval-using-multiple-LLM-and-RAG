Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the U-net model mentioned in the context, is semantic segmentation. This is evident from the keywords provided, which include "U-net", "Semantic segmentation", and "deep learning". Additionally, the context mentions that the validation dataset and the model segmented 1195 objects, further supporting the idea that the model is used for segmentation. The model is used to identify and segment individual tree species in tropical forests from very high-resolution images.
