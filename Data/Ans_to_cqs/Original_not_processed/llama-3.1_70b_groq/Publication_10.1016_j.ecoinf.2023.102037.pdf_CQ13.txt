Answer:::

The provided context mentions some of the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, specifically the YOLOv5 model. According to the text, the following hyperparameters were used:

* Optimizer: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
* Momentum: 0.9
* Batch size: 16 tiles
* Number of epochs: 150

However, the learning rate is not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I do not know the learning rate used in the model.

Additionally, the context mentions that the default data augmentation techniques of YOLOv5 were applied during training to improve the model robustness, but it does not specify what these techniques are.
