Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention that the dataset type can be one of the following: Color, Gray scale, or Leaf Segmented. This suggests that some form of preprocessing may have been involved in converting the images to gray scale or segmenting the leaves.

Additionally, the context mentions that the experiments were conducted using a fork of Caffe, which is a deep learning framework. Caffe provides various tools for preprocessing data, such as data augmentation, normalization, and scaling. However, the context does not provide specific details on which preprocessing steps were used.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we can only infer that some form of preprocessing may have been involved, but the specific steps are not mentioned.
