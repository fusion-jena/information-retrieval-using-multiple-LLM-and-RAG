Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context discusses the challenges of class-imbalance and the use of data augmentation strategies to increase the training set size, but it does not provide information on regularization methods. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
