Answer: The pipeline uses a combination of different deep learning models, including:

1. Hybrid CNN-LSTM: This model combines the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to learn spatial and temporal features from data.
2. Vision Transformer: This model is based on the Transformer architecture and is used for image processing tasks. It treats input images as patches and uses self-attention mechanisms to learn long-range relationships between them.
3. Wav2Vec: This is a state-of-the-art model for Automatic Speech Recognition and other audio-related tasks. It is based on the Transformer encoder architecture and uses a self-supervised training objective.

These models are used in different parts of the pipeline, with the Hybrid CNN-LSTM and Vision Transformer being used for image processing tasks, and the Wav2Vec model being used for audio processing tasks.
