Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. However, it does mention a few techniques related to data augmentation, which can introduce randomness into the training process.

One technique mentioned is "Random Erasing" (Zhong et al., 2020), a data augmentation method that randomly erases a portion of the input image. Another technique mentioned is "Randaugment" (Cubuk et al., 2020), a practical automated data augmentation method that uses a reduced search space to generate random augmentations.

While these techniques do introduce randomness into the training process, they are not specifically designed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to this question.

If you're looking for strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, you may want to consider techniques such as:

* Setting a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility
* Using techniques like dropout or batch normalization to reduce the impact of randomness
* Averaging the results of multiple models trained with different random seeds

However, these techniques are not mentioned in the provided context, and I do not have enough information to provide a more detailed answer.
