Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context provides information about the model architecture, training parameters, and performance metrics, but it does not mention data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
