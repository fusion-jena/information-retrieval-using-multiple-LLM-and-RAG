Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, permafrost modeling, and validation of a model called PermaBN. It discusses changes made to the pre-validation model, node renaming, and refinement explanations, but does not provide information on preprocessing steps for deep learning models.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model based on the provided context.
