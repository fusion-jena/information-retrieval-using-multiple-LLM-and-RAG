Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, it appears that the data is related to water quality parameters, temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and dissolved oxygen concentration. The context mentions the use of a dataset (listed in Table 1) and various machine learning and deep learning methods, such as SVR, LSTM, and neural networks.

Given the nature of the data, it is likely that the data format used is CSV (Comma Separated Values) or a similar tabular format, as the data appears to be numerical and tabular in nature. However, without explicit mention of the data format, it is impossible to confirm this with certainty.

There is no indication of the use of image, audio, or video data formats in the provided context.
