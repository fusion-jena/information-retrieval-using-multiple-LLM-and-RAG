Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be related to a research paper on animal track identification and analysis, and it discusses various methods for handling missing data, such as deleting cases, mean imputation, and the FIT method. However, it does not provide information on data splitting criteria for deep learning model training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
