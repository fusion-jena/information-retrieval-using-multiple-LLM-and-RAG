Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context only provides information about the model architecture (Unet), hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size, optimizer), and data preprocessing steps (e.g., resampling climate and DEM data to 10 m spatial resolution). It does not provide details on how the dataset was split for training, validation, and testing, or whether any techniques were used to ensure the model's generalizability. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
