Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the references and the research papers mentioned, it can be inferred that satellite imagery is one of the methods used for collecting data.

For instance, the paper by Hanintyo et al. (2021) mentions the use of Landsat 8 data for retrieving chlorophyll-a and total suspended matter over Wangi-Wangi Island, Indonesia. Similarly, the paper by Cao et al. (2023) mentions the use of time-series satellite imagery for lake total suspended matter retrieval.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of nephelometric turbidity data in the paper by Bright et al. (2018), which suggests that sensor data may also be used for collecting raw data.

However, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive list of methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context. Other methods such as surveys, public datasets, and other types of sensors may also be used, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.
