Answer: The optimization technique applied in the deep learning pipeline is the Adam optimizer. According to the text, "The deep feature loss bird noise reduction network model was trained for 50 epochs on an RTX 2080 Ti GPU using the Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014) with a learning rate of 10". This indicates that the Adam optimizer is used to optimize the model's parameters during training.
