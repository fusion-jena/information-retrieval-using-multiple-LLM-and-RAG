Answer:

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in the provided context include:

1. Accuracy
2. Precision
3. F1-score
4. AUC-ROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve)
5. Sensitivity
6. Specificity
7. Miss rate (also known as False Negative Rate, FNR)
8. Fall-out (also known as False Positive Rate, FPR)

These metrics are used to measure the true and false classification probabilities of the model. Specifically, the context mentions that sensitivity, specificity, miss rate, and fall-out are the most used metrics to measure the true and false classification probabilities.

Additionally, the context provides a comparison of the performance of different models using these metrics, as shown in Tables 2 and 3. For example, Table 2 compares the performance of the semi-supervised contrastive learning DNN and the weakly-supervised XGBoost ensemble of DNNs with recent publications in the literature, using metrics such as accuracy, precision, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
