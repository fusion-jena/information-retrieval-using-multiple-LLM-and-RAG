Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The text appears to be discussing the use of machine learning tools for image classification in the context of ecological informatics, but it does not delve into the specifics of deep learning pipeline implementation or regularization techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a meaningful answer to this query based on the given context.
