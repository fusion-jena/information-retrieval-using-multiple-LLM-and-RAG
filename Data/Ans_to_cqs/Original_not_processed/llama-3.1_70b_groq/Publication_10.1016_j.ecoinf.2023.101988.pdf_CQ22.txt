Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The context appears to be related to the use of unmanned aircraft systems and deep learning for wildlife research and biodiversity monitoring, but it does not provide specific information on the evaluation metrics used for the deep learning model.

However, I can suggest that common metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and mean squared error, among others. But without more specific information, I cannot determine which metrics were used in this particular case.

It's worth noting that the context does provide some numerical values and statistical results, but they appear to be related to the results of the study rather than the evaluation metrics used for the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a more specific answer to this question based on the provided context.
