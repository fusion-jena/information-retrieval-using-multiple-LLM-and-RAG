Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. However, it does mention that a random hyperparameter search was conducted to determine the optimum model structure. The number of layers and hidden nodes per layer were varied, from one to four layers and from 20 hidden nodes to 1,000. This suggests that the hyperparameter search was focused on the architecture of the model, but the specific hyperparameters used are not specified.
