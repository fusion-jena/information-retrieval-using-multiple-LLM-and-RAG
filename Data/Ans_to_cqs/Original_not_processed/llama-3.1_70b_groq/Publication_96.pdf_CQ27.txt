Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly describe the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that the analysis was conducted using graphics processing units (GPUs) and specialized hardware components for running parallel arithmetic operations on the Google Cloud suite of cloud platform.

It is mentioned that the access to GPUs was implemented on the Google Cloud suite of cloud platform (https://console.cloud.google.com), but the specific process of model deployment is not described. Therefore, I do not know the exact process followed for model serialization, platform selection, or deployment.
