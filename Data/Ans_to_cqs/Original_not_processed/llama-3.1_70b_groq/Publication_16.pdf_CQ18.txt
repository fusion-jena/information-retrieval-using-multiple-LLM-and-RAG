Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves tracking the loss and accuracy of the model on both the training and validation data. This is evident from Figure 9, which shows the loss of the model using both the test and validation data during model training, and Figure 10, which shows the train and validation accuracy during the training session. 

Additionally, the model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as sensitivity and specificity, as shown in Table 1. The model's performance is also compared across different classes, with the Eurasian Collard Dove being the best performing class and the Lesser Spotted Woodpecker being the worst performing class.

The use of dropout layers is also mentioned as a strategy to help with model regularization and prevent overfitting. The results show that there was no overfitting during training, and the loss continued to decrease throughout the specified epochs. This suggests that the model was able to learn effectively and generalize well to the validation data.
