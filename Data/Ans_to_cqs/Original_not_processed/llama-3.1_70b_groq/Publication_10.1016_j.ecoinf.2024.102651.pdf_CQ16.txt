Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to focus on the performance of the proposed classification network, comparing its accuracy with other models like ResNet50 and ViT, and discussing the improvement in classification accuracy for objects of different sizes. It does not provide information on the training process or the criteria used to determine when training is complete.
