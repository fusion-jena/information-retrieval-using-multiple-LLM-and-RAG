Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The text only mentions the architecture of the deep neural network (DNN) and the long short-term memory (LSTM) block, including the number of neurons in each layer and the activation functions used (ReLU and sigmoid). It also mentions that the implementation was carried out in Python using the libraries TensorFlow and Scikit-learn, but it does not provide further details on the hyperparameters used.
