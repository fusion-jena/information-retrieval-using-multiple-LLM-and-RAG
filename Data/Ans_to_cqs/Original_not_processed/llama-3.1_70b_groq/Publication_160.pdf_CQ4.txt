Answer:::
The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Random rotations between 0 and 180 degrees.
2. Brightness scaling between 0.4 and 1.6.
3. Horizontal and vertical flipping.

These techniques were applied to all patches on the fly as data was fed to the networks, in order to compensate for the high class imbalance and allow a better generalization.
