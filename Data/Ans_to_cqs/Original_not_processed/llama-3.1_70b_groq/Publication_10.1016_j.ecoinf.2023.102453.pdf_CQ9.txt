Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it does mention that "Data will be made available on request." This suggests that the data is not publicly available in a repository like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF, but can be obtained by contacting the authors directly.
