Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning for image processing and object detection in the field of entomology, particularly for pest monitoring and management.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to employ strategies to handle randomness, such as:

* Setting a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results
* Using techniques like data augmentation to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset
* Employing regularization techniques, such as dropout, to prevent overfitting
* Using ensemble methods to combine the predictions of multiple models trained on different random seeds

But, these strategies are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide a more specific answer to this question based on the given information.
