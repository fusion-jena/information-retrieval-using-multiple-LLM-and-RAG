Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to species conservation, bioclimatic analysis, and human-wildlife conflicts, with references to various research papers and studies. There is no mention of deep learning or data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
