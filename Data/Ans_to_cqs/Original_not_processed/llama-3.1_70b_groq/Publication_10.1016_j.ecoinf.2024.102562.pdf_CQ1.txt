Answer: The text does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the data was gained from micro-fluidic platforms and image analysis-based methods. It also mentions that the approach uses AI-aided soil chip analysis, which suggests that the data may be collected through some form of imaging or microscopy of soil samples. Additionally, the text mentions that the sampling sites were chosen to provide large differences in environmental conditions, which suggests that the data may be collected through field observations or experiments. However, the specific methods used for collecting raw data are not clearly stated.
