Answer: 

Based on the provided context, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is primarily images. The text mentions the use of images from the web along with their captions for training the CLIP model, and the use of images resized to specific pixel dimensions (e.g., (299, 299) for Inception-V3 and (224, 224) for ViT and ResNet) for training various convolutional neural network models. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
