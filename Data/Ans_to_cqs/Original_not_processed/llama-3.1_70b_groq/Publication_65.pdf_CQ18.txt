Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention that Figure 11 shows the convergence of the evaluated networks, which suggests that the model performance was monitored during training by tracking the convergence of the networks. This implies that the model performance was likely monitored by tracking metrics such as loss or accuracy over time, but the specific details of the strategy are not provided.
