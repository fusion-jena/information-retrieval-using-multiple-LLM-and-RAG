Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. It mentions the importance of eliminating device bias to expand the applicability of ecoacoustic indices (EAI) to emerging fields like machine learning and deep learning, but it does not provide any information on the evaluation metrics used for the deep learning model.
