Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided pieces of context do not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The papers mentioned in the context discuss various deep learning-based approaches for fish detection, species classification, and biomass estimation, but they do not provide details on the specific data augmentation techniques used.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to apply data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling to increase the diversity of the training dataset and improve the model's robustness. But without explicit information from the provided context, I cannot confirm whether these specific techniques were applied in the mentioned papers.

If you're looking for information on data augmentation techniques in general, I can provide some general information. Data augmentation is a technique used to artificially increase the size of a training dataset by applying random transformations to the existing data. Common data augmentation techniques include:

* Flipping: flipping the image horizontally or vertically
* Rotating: rotating the image by a certain angle
* Scaling: scaling the image up or down
* Color jittering: changing the brightness, contrast, or saturation of the image
* Cropping: cropping a random portion of the image

These techniques can help increase the diversity of the training dataset and improve the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data. However, the specific techniques used can vary depending on the problem and the dataset.
