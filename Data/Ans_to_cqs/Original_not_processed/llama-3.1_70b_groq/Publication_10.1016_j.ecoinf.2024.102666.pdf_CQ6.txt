Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on atmospheric correction and remote sensing, discussing various algorithms and techniques for improving the quality of remote sensing data.

However, it does mention the use of artificial neural networks (ANN) and the importance of adjusting parameters, such as pixel sizes, when working with water bodies at different resolutions. But it does not provide specific information on preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model based on the provided context.
