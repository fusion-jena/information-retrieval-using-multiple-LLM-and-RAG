Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a research paper on ecological informatics, specifically discussing various machine learning models and their performance metrics. However, it does not provide information on model deployment.

The context mentions the use of MATLAB R2016a for performing SVM (Support Vector Machine) and the libsvm package in MATLAB for establishing the training model. However, it does not discuss the deployment of the trained model.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
