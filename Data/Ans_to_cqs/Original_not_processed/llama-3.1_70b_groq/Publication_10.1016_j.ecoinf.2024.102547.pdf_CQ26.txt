Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on functional data analysis (FDA) and its applications in oceanography and marine science. It discusses dimension reduction techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA), and mentions various studies related to oceanography and marine science.

The context does not mention deep learning, data bias, or techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a relevant answer to the query.

If you could provide more context or clarify the relationship between the query and the provided text, I would be happy to try and assist you further.
