Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention a code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a snippet of text from a research paper or academic document, discussing the challenges of obtaining ground truth data for deep learning methods and a specific approach to annotating karyotyping images of chromosomes. There is no mention of a code repository or a link to one.
