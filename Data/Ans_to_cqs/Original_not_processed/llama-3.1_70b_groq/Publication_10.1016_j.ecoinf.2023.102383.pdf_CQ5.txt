Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to focus on object detection tasks, particularly in the context of animal recognition and counting, and mentions the use of UAV thermal images and camera trap images. However, it does not provide information on the specific datasets used for training or testing the models. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
