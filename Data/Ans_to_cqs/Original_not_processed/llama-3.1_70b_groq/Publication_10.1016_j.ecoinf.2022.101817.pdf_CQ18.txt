Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is cross-validation. The provided context mentions "cross-validation phase of the designed CNN models" and presents confusion matrices generated during this phase. This suggests that the model performance was evaluated using cross-validation, which is a common technique used to assess the performance of machine learning models by training and testing them on multiple subsets of the data.
