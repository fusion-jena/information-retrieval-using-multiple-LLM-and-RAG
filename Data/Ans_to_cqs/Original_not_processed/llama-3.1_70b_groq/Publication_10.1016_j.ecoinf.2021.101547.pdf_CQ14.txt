Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It mentions that the range of possibilities for hyperparameter tuning can seem overwhelming, especially to non-expert users, and suggests that a sensible approach is to initially set options based on a review of published studies involving similar analysis tasks, then attempt to refine certain settings through trial and error.

However, it does not provide information on specific methods used for hyperparameter optimization, such as grid search or random search. It only mentions that the computationally laborious process of training a CNN imposes a practical limit on the extent of trial and error that can be undertaken.

Therefore, I do not know the specific method used for hyperparameter optimization in this case.
