Answer: 

The data formats used in the deep learning pipeline, as mentioned in the provided context, are primarily image-based. Specifically, the following types of image data are mentioned:

* RGB-images of a commercial orchard
* RGB-images and point cloud data of a commercial orchard
* RGB-images of a single tree branch
* RGB-images of urban streets
* Synthetic images and natural images of forests
* RGB-images of a modern apple orchard
* RGB-images of complex urban scenes

There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline. The focus appears to be on processing and analyzing image data for tasks such as object detection (OD), segmentation (Seg), and saliency detection (SOD).
