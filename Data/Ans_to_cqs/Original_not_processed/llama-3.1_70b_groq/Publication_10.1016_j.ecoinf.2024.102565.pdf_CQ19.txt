Answer:::
None of the provided frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) are mentioned in the given context. However, it is mentioned that "MATLAB programming software (MathWorks, 2021) served as the primary tool" for crafting and assessing the models. This suggests that MATLAB is the primary tool used for building and testing the models, but it does not provide information on the specific deep learning frameworks used.
