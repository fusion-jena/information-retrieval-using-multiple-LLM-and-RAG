Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context primarily focuses on the preprocessing of text data, the use of the ERNIE model for emotional analysis, and the application of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling. It does not provide information on the data splitting process for deep learning model training.

However, it does mention that the final available data elements totaled 6802, but it does not specify how this data was split for training, testing, and validation. Without further information, it is not possible to determine the specific criteria used for data splitting.
