Answer:::
The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned as popular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it is mentioned that the authors decided to build their own dataset instead of using existing datasets like Fish4Knowledge. They used 3 independent fish images datasets from the Mayotte Island (Western Indian Ocean) to train and test their CNN model and post-processing method. These datasets were created from 175 underwater high-definition videos recorded in the Western Indian Ocean.
