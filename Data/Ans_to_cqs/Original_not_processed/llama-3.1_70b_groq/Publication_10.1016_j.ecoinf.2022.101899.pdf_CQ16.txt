Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be discussing the results of a Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) approach and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) diagnostics, but it does not provide information on the training process or the criteria used to determine its completion. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
