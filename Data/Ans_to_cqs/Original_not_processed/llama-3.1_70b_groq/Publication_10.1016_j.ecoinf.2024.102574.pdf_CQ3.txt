Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the application of remote sensing and LiDAR data for forest management, biomass estimation, and ecological construction programs. While some papers mention the use of machine learning and deep learning techniques, they do not provide details on the specific data annotation techniques used.

However, one paper by Marrs and Ni-Meister (2019) mentions the use of co-registered LiDAR and hyperspectral data for tree species classification, which may involve data annotation techniques such as instance segmentation or spectral annotation. Another paper by Qin et al. (2022) uses UAV-based LiDAR, hyperspectral, and ultrahigh-resolution RGB data for individual tree segmentation and tree species classification, which may also involve data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.

Despite these hints, the context does not provide a clear answer to the query. Therefore, I must conclude that I don't know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
