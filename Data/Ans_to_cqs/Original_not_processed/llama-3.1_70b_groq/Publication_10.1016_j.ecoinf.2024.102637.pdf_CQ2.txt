Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that audio data is used, as the context mentions "bird sound recognition", "audio feature extraction", and "Mel frequency cepstral coefficient of the audio" as the feature input. Additionally, spectrograms are mentioned, which are visual representations of audio data.

There is no mention of image or video data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline. CSV (Comma Separated Values) is also not mentioned as a data format used in the pipeline.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that audio data is used in the deep learning pipeline, and possibly spectrograms as a visual representation of audio data.
