The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is the ImageNet dataset, which is used for pre-training different architectures. Additionally, the paper introduces a new dataset called the Peruvian Amazon Forestry Dataset, which includes 59,441 samples from ten of the most profitable and endangered species. This dataset is used for fine-tuning the pre-trained models.
