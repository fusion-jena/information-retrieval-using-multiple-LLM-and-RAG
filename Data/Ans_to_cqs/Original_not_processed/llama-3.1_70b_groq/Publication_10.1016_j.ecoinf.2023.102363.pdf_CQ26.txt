Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the training batches are equal across classes, but the contributing frames to each training batch cannot be equal due to overrepresentation of ambient frames. This suggests that the data may be imbalanced, but the specific techniques used to address this issue are not mentioned.

The context does mention the concept of bias-variance trade-off (Neal et al., 2018), which is related to data bias and overfitting. However, it does not provide information on how data bias is addressed during preprocessing.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know what specific techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
