Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to focus on the results of the discriminant analysis for species and sex identification, including the accuracy of the models and the misclassification rates. It does not provide information on the training process or the criteria used to determine when training is complete. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
