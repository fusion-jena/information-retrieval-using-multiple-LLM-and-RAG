Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the models, algorithms, and research papers related to natural language processing, text mining, and ecosystem services. It does not provide information on the hardware resources used for training the models.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions the use of R packages and Python libraries, which are commonly used for data analysis and machine learning tasks. But it does not specify the hardware resources used for training the models.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
