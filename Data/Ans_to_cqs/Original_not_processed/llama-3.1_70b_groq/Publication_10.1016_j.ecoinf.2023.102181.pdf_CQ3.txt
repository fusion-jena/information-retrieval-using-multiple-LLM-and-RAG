Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on machine learning for geospatial modeling, specifically addressing issues of biased model training and validation with clustered data. It discusses techniques such as covariance-weighted bagging and bootstrapping, but does not touch on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
