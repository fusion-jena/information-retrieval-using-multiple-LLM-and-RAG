Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is for fully automatic fish biomass estimation, specifically for detecting and estimating the body weight of fish. The model uses fish body area as a parameter to estimate body weight, and it aims to minimize the workload and complexity of image preprocessing, thereby increasing the efficiency and robustness of body weight estimation.
