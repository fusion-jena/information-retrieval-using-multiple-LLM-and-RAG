Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. The context appears to be related to a research study on animal vocalizations, ecology, and conservation, but it does not provide information on a specific deep learning pipeline or data repository. Therefore, I am unable to provide a link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other data repository.
