Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, based on general knowledge of machine learning and deep learning, I can provide some common preprocessing steps that are typically involved.

Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically performed on the data. These steps may include:

1. Data cleaning: This involves removing any missing or duplicate values, handling outliers, and correcting any errors in the data.
2. Normalization: This involves scaling the data to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model.
3. Feature scaling: This involves scaling the data to have zero mean and unit variance, which can help improve the stability and speed of training.
4. Encoding categorical variables: This involves converting categorical variables into numerical variables that can be processed by the model.
5. Handling imbalanced data: This involves techniques such as oversampling the minority class, undersampling the majority class, or generating synthetic samples to balance the data.

It's worth noting that the specific preprocessing steps may vary depending on the specific problem, dataset, and model being used.
