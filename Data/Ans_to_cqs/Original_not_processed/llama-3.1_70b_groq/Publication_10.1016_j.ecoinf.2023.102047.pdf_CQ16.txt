Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily discusses data augmentation techniques, dataset composition, and evaluation metrics (e.g., mean Average Precision (mAP)), but it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
