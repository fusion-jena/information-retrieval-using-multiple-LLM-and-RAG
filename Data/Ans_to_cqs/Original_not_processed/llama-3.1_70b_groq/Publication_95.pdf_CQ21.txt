Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. It discusses the training procedure, including the adaptation of the final classification layer, the effect of input image size on processing time and classification accuracy, and the training of network models on different image sizes. However, it does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

The context does mention the calculation of recall for the ResNet50V2 models on the validation set as a function of the annotation size relative to image size, as shown in Figure 8. Additionally, it provides an overview of the training, validation, and test sets in Table 2, including the number of clusters, images, and polygons for each species. However, this information is not directly related to the postprocessing steps.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training.
