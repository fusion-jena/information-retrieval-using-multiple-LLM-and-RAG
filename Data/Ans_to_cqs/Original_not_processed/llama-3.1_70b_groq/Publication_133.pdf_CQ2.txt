Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information given, it can be inferred that images are used as the primary data format. The context mentions "trap images" and "annotated images" being used for the project, and the application of deep learning methods for image classification and object detection. There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used. CSV (Comma Separated Values) format is not mentioned either, but it is possible that it might be used for storing or processing metadata associated with the images.
