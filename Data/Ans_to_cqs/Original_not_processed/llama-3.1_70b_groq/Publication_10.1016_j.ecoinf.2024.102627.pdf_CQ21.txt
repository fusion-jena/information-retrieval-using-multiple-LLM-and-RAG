Answer:::

The post-processing steps involved after the model training are mentioned in the provided context. According to the text, after validating and calibrating the model on the validation set for predicting species assemblages, a new training is started from scratch on the entire dataset. Once the model is trained, the following post-processing steps are performed:

i) Predictions outside the continents where species are known to occur (according to the observation dataset) are removed.

ii) Conditional probabilities associated with orchids are normalised.

These post-processing steps are mentioned in Section 2.2.1 of the provided context. There is no mention of saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix as part of the post-processing steps.
