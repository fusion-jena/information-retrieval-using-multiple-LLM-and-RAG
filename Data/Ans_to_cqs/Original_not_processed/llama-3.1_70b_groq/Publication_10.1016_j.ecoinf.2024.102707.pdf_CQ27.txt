Unfortunately, the provided context does not provide information on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context mentions that the trained machine learning model was published, but it does not provide details on the deployment process.

However, I can provide some general information on common practices for deploying deep learning models. Typically, model deployment involves several steps, including model serialization, platform selection, and deployment to a production environment.

Model serialization involves converting the trained model into a format that can be easily loaded and used in a production environment. This can be done using various techniques such as saving the model to a file or storing it in a model repository.

Platform selection involves choosing a suitable platform to host the deployed model. This can include cloud-based platforms such as AWS SageMaker, Google Cloud AI Platform, or Azure Machine Learning, or on-premises platforms such as Docker containers or Kubernetes clusters.

Once the platform is selected, the serialized model can be deployed to the production environment, where it can be used to make predictions on new data.

Unfortunately, without more specific information, I do not know the exact process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model mentioned in the context.
