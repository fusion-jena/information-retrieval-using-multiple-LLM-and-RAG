Answer: The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using GridSearchCV with cross-validation. A detailed and systematic search is performed across a predefined grid of hyperparameter values, with a unique parameter grid defined for each model considered. This process ensures that the eventual choice of hyperparameters is not arbitrary but is backed by empirical evidence. The GridSearchCV uses tenfold cross-validation, which provides a reliable estimate of the model's performance and balances the trade-off between bias and variance, guarding against overfitting.
