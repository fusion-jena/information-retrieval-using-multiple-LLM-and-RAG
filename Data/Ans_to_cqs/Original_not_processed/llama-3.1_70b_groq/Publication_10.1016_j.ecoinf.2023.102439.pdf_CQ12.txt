Answer: 
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model, specifically a NARX (Nonlinear Autoregressive with Exogenous inputs) model. This is mentioned in the text as "the NARX feedback ANN model was utilised to define vegetation biomass density for 2030." Additionally, a hybrid model was developed by combining wavelet analysis and the NARX ANN algorithm to enhance the performance of the NARX ANN model.
