Answer:::
The deep learning pipeline in the provided context primarily uses image data, specifically RGB photographs, as input for the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The images are obtained from the iNaturalist plant photograph database. Additionally, bioclimatic data, such as temperature, precipitation, and their seasonality, are used as contextual constraints in the CNN models. This data is likely in a format such as CSV or a similar tabular format, but the exact format is not specified. There is no mention of audio or video data being used in the pipeline.
