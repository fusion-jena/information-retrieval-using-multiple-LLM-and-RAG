Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be related to various research papers and studies on topics such as ecosystem service value, food supply and demand, environmental challenges, and teacher self-efficacy, but it does not provide information on deep learning pipeline optimization techniques.
