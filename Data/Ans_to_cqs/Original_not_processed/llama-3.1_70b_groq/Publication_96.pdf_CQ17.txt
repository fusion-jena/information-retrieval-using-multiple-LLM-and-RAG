Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the use of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for mapping burned areas in the Cerrado biome in Brazil, but it does not provide information on the specific regularization techniques used, such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
