Answer: 

The regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline include dropout and early stopping. Specifically, the text mentions that a step-wise reduction of dropout probabilities by 0.1 was used, starting at an initial probability of 0.5. Additionally, early stopping with a cooldown of 3 epochs was employed to prevent overfitting. There is no mention of L2 regularization being used in the provided context.
