Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the use of machine learning (ML) models for accelerating the data labeling process in wildlife monitoring, specifically using a ML model that produces bounding boxes around animals, people, and vehicles in remote camera imagery (MegaDetector). It discusses the experiment design, materials, and methods, but does not provide information on the specific regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline.
