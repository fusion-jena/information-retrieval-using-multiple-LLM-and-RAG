Answer:::

The text does not explicitly state the criteria used to determine when training is complete. It mentions that the validation set was used to tune the hyperparameters of the CNN, but it does not specify what criteria were used to determine when the training process was complete, such as a validation loss plateau or a certain number of epochs. The only information provided is that the training and validation sets, totaling 80% of the full dataset, were used to train and validate the CNN spectrogram classifier and to train the k-NN location classifier.
