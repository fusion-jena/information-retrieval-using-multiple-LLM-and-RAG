Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be related to remote sensing and crop coverage estimation, and it mentions various machine learning models (e.g., random forest, support vector machine, multi-layer perceptron) and vegetation indices (e.g., EVI, SAVI), but it does not provide information on optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline.
