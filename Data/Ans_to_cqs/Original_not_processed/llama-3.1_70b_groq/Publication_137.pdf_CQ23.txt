Answer: 
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the researchers used the hold-out method to split the original data into a training set and a test set at a ratio of 3:7. This means that 70% of the data was used for training the model, and 30% was used for testing. This approach helps to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data and prevents overfitting. However, there is no mention of using cross-validation, stratified splitting, or a diverse dataset to further ensure the model's generalizability.
