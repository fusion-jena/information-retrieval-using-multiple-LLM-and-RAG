Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context only provides the accuracy results for different models on train, test, and validation sets, but it does not explain how the data was split into these sets. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
