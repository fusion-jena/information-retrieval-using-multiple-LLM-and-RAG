Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the training process of SVM and CNN models, data management, feature extraction, and hyperparameter tuning. It does not provide information on the data collection process.

However, it does mention the importance of accurate and reliable annotations, suggesting that manual analysis and annotation of data may be part of the process. Additionally, it mentions the use of a "ground-truth" dataset, which implies that the data may be collected through some form of observation or measurement. Nevertheless, the specific methods used for collecting raw data are not specified in the provided context.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
