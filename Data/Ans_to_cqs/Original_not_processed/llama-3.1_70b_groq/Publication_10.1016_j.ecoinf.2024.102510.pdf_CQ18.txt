Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on hyperparameter optimization (HPO) techniques, model performance evaluation, and comparison of different models. It discusses various HPO techniques such as manual search, grid search, random search, and Bayesian search, but it does not provide information on how the model performance is monitored during training.

However, it can be inferred that the model performance is evaluated using metrics such as validation accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, as shown in Table 8. The performance metrics are likely used to monitor the model performance during training, but the specific strategy or technique used for monitoring is not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to the query.
