Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention that the feature set was randomly divided into four mutually exclusive folds through stratified sampling, which suggests that randomness is introduced in the data splitting process. Additionally, random under-sampling (RUS) was applied to the training set to address imbalances, which implies that randomness is also involved in the data preprocessing step. 

However, it does not provide information on whether a random seed value was set to ensure reproducibility of the results. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query.
