Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is object detection. Specifically, it is used to detect and count wildebeest within survey images. The model employed is a multilayer deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), which is a form of deep learning that extracts relevant features from the images without requiring hand-crafted features. The model is trained on a dataset of images and then used to detect and count wildebeest in new images. The results are compared to counts from citizen scientists and expert counts to evaluate the accuracy of the model.
