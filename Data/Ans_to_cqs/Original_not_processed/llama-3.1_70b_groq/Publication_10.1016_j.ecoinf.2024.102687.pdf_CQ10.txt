Answer: I don't know. The provided context does not mention a code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper or article discussing the results of experiments with different convolutional neural network (CNN) backbones and few-shot learning methods on the Darksound dataset. There is no information about a code repository or a link to one.
