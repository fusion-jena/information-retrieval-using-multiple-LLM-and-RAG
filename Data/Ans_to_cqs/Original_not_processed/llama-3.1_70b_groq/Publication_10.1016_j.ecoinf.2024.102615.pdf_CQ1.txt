Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the processing and analysis of spectral reflectance data, particularly in the context of soil science and remote sensing.

However, it can be inferred that the raw data is likely collected through remote sensing technologies, such as satellite or airborne sensors, given the mention of spectral reflectance data and the reference to papers on remote sensing and soil science. Additionally, the context mentions the use of Landsat 8, Sentinel-2, and Gaofen-2 images, which are satellite-based remote sensing platforms.

It is also possible that the raw data is collected through field surveys or laboratory measurements, but this is not explicitly stated in the provided context. Without further information, it is difficult to provide a more specific answer to this question.

Therefore, the answer to this query is that the context does not provide explicit information on the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, but it can be inferred that remote sensing technologies may be involved.
