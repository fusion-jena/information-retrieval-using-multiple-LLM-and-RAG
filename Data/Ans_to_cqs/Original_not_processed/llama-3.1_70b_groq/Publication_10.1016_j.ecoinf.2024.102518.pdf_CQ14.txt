Answer: The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a grid search approach. The text mentions that the feature class is set as 'L', 'Q', 'LQ', 'LQP', and the regularization multiplier is varied from 0.5 to 5. The model performance is evaluated using the delta Akaike information criterion (delta.AICc) as the metric, and the optimal model is selected based on the minimum delta.AICc value. This suggests that a grid search is performed over the specified range of hyperparameters to find the optimal combination.
