Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context appears to be focused on the experimental setup, results, and discussion of a machine learning model for pose recognition. It mentions the use of different loss functions, such as contrastive loss, but does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training.

Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete in this context.
