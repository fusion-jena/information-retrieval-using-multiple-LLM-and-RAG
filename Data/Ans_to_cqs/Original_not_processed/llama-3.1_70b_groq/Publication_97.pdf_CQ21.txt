Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the training data generation, model training, and some references to related research papers. It does mention that the network training assessment was performed on sub-images generated from image #2 (Table 1), and images #4 and #6 were used for visualization and demonstration of the algorithm efficacy. However, it does not provide information on specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.
