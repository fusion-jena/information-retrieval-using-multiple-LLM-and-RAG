Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. The context only mentions that the research aims to explore the potential of deep learning and machine learning algorithms for enhancing groundwater-climate interactions understanding, but it does not provide details about the specific models used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
