Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that the dataset was used for training and validation, and that the chosen model was evaluated based on its F1-score, precision, and recall. 

It can be inferred that the dataset was likely split into training and validation sets, but the exact criteria or proportions used for the split are not specified. The context also mentions that the model was prone to overfitting when using large deep learning networks, suggesting that the validation set was used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. However, the exact details of the data split are not provided.
