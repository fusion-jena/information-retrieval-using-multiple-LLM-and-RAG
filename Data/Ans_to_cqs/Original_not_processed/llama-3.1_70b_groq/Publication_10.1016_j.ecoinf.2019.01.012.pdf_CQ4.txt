Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the convolutional neural network (CNN) and the process of splitting images into 50 Ã— 50 pixel tiles for training and testing. It also mentions resizing photographs to a maximum width of 2500 pixels to reduce computing time, but this is not a traditional data augmentation technique.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
