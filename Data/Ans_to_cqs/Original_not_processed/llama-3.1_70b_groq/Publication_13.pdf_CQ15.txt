Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided pieces of context do not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context mentions the use of TensorFlow 2.5.0, but it does not specify the optimization techniques used. It also mentions the use of focal loss for calibrating deep neural networks, but it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used for training the models.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions the use of domain adversarial training of neural networks (DANN), which is a technique used to improve the performance of deep neural networks on unseen data. But it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used for training the DANN model.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot determine the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
