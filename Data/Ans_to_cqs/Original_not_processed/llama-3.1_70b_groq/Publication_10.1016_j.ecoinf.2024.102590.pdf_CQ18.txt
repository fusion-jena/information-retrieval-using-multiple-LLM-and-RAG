Answer: 

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the authors created a separate geometry, 'add trees', to balance the training set and address the issue of misclassification of smaller woody plants. Additionally, they randomly separated 80/20% of the classified points to generate a training/validation dataset for accuracy assessments. This suggests that the authors used a validation set to evaluate the model's performance during training, but the specific strategy or metrics used to monitor performance are not provided.
