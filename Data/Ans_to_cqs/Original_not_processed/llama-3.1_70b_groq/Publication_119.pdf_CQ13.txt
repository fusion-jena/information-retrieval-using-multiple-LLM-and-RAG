Answer:::
The provided context mentions some of the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. For the Deep Neural Network (DNN) model, the optimized hyperparameter values for learning rate and batch size were 0.007 and 48, respectively. The number of epochs was also tuned, but the optimized value is not specified. 

Additionally, the context mentions the use of dropout and batch normalization layers to reduce over-fitting and increase generalization on testing data. However, it does not provide information on the specific optimizer used in the model.

For the U-Net model implemented within the arcgis.learn module, the context mentions that the best model uses an input patch size of 64 Ã— 64 pixels and a ResNet-50 backbone. However, it does not provide information on the learning rate, optimizer, or other hyperparameters used in the model.
