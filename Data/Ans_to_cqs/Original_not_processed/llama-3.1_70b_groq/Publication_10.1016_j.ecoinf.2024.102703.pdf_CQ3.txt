It appears to be a passage about a study on the spectral characteristics of dissolved organic matter in Plateau Lakes in Southwest China, specifically in the Erhai watershed. The passage discusses the study area, field sampling, and sample collection, but does not mention anything related to data annotation techniques or deep learning pipelines.
