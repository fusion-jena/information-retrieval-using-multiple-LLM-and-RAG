Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. The context discusses the use of deep neural networks for bioacoustic classification, but it does not provide details on the architecture of the models used. It mentions the potential of deep learning methods, but it does not specify whether CNN, RNN, Transformer, or other types of models are used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
