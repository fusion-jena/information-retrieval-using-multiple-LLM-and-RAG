Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the design of machine learning models for predicting reservoir stratification and thermocline depth, as well as the use of open data sources. It does mention the use of an unsupervised ML model to determine the threshold of the thermal gradient to consider if the reservoir is stratified or not, but it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias.

However, it does mention the creation of a new categorical binary variable that stores the existence of stratification or not, which could potentially be used to address class imbalance issues. But it does not explicitly mention techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
