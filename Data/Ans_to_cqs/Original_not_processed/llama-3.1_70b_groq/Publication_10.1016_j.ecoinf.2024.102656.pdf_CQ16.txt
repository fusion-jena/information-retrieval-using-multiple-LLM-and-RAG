Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context discusses the methodology used for predictive modeling, including the use of an ensemble framework, statistical models, and evaluation metrics (AUC and TSS). However, it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
