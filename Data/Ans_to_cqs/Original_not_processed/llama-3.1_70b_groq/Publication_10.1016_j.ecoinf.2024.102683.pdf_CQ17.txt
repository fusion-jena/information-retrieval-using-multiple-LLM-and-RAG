Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that data augmentation (DA) is used as a basic method to quantitatively increase and diversify training data, which can help alleviate overfitting.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of attention mechanisms, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and Bayesian optimizers, but it does not specifically mention regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
