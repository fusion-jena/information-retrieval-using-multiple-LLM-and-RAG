Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the model training process, hyper-parameter settings, and the use of the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer with a momentum value of Î¼ = 0.9, but it does not provide information on regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
