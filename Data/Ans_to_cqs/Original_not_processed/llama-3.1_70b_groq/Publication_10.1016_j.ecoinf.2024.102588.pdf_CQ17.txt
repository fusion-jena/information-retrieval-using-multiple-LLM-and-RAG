Answer: 

The regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the provided context are batch normalization and dropout. 

Batch normalization is used to perform feature generalization of the input mini-batch by calculating the mean and standard deviation of the batch normalization layer to avoid covariate shifts. 

Dropout is used to reduce overfitting of the CNN model by inactivating random nodes that contain learnable weights. In the specific architecture mentioned, a dropout layer is placed after the last convolutional layer with a random node inactivation of 40%. 

There is no mention of L2 regularization in the provided context.
