Answer:::
The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows: 

- The optimizer used is stochastic gradient descent with a momentum of 0.9.
- The initial learning rate is 10−2.
- The learning rate is divided by 10 every 20 epochs until it reaches 10−6.

These hyperparameters are used for training all the deep learning architectures.
