Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of air quality sensors and legal stations for collecting data. The context also mentions the use of a database to store information related to air quality sensors and legal stations, which suggests that the data may be collected through these sensors and stations.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a framework called HypeAIR for LCAQ sensor calibration, which suggests that the data may be collected through a network of sensors. However, the specific methods used for collecting raw data are not mentioned.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the methods used for collecting raw data may include air quality sensors and legal stations, but the exact methods are not specified.
