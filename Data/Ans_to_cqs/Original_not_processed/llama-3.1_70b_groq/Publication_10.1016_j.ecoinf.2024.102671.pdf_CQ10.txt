Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. The text appears to be a research paper or academic article discussing carbon sinks, ecological risk, and ecosystem services, with references to various studies and formulas. There is no mention of a code repository or a deep learning pipeline, so I am unable to provide a link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other code repository.
