Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. It only reports the performance of the models at different levels of taxonomic identification (species, genus, and subfamily) and mentions that the results improved when fine-tuning was applied in the second training phase. However, it does not provide information on the stopping criteria used during training.
