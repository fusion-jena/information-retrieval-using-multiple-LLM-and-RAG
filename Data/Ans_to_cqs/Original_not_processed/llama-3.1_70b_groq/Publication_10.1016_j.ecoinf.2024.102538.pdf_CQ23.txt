Answer:::

To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the datasets used for training and testing were diverse and representative of different bird species. Specifically, the model was trained and tested on three datasets: BirdCLEF2018 (abbreviated as "BC-S" and "BC-L"), Lishui-Zhejiang Birds data (referred to as "LS"), and a supplementary small-scale training set ("LS*").

Secondly, the datasets were divided into three exclusive groups: 80% for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing. This stratified splitting approach helped to ensure that the model was trained and evaluated on separate datasets, reducing the risk of overfitting and improving its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

Additionally, the use of stratified sampling method to select birds of different class sizes from BirdCLEF2018 dataset ("BC-S" and "BC-L") and Lishui-Zhejiang Birds data ("LS") helped to maintain the class balance and representation in the training and testing datasets.

While the text does not explicitly mention cross-validation, the use of a separate validation set (10% of the data) suggests that some form of validation was performed to evaluate the model's performance during training and adjust hyperparameters accordingly.

Overall, the combination of diverse datasets, stratified splitting, and separate validation sets helped to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
