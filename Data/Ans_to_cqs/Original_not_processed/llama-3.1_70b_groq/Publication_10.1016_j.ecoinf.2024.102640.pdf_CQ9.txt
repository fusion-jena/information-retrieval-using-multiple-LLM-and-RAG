Answer: I don't know. The provided context does not mention the location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the construction of a new dataset called UGE-D (Urban Green Extraction Dataset) for GVI extraction and the use of a deep-learning model called SegFormer for semantic segmentation, but it does not provide information on where the data repository is hosted.
