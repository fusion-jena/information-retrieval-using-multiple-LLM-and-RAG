Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this study are:

1. Nashâ€“Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE)
2. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
3. Percentage bias (PBIAS)

These metrics are used to measure the accuracy of the performance of the deep learning models, including the CNN model and CNN with an autoencoder, in estimating aquatic ecosystem health indices such as TDI, BMI, and FAI. 

Note that the text does not mention accuracy, precision, or recall as evaluation metrics. The NSE is a commonly used score in hydrological and environmental models, and it measures the relative magnitude of the residual variance, indicating the degree of 1:1 line fitness of the observed versus estimated data plot.
