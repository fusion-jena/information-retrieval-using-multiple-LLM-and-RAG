Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning pipelines or strategies for handling randomness in such pipelines. The context appears to be related to remote sensing and forest biomass estimation using satellite data and machine learning algorithms, specifically random forest. There is no mention of deep learning or random seed values. Therefore, I cannot provide a relevant answer to the query based on the provided context.
