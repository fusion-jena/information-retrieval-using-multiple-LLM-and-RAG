Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. It only mentions that the authors plan to focus on further optimizing the detection model and implementing migration learning during model training to improve detection accuracy in their subsequent work. However, it does not provide details on how they plan to monitor the model performance during training.
