Answer: The provided context does not specifically mention the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the Marine Institute (MI) is involved in routine sampling of fish for government-mandated stock assessment. This suggests that the MI may be collecting data through field sampling methods, such as collecting fish scales and otoliths. Additionally, the context mentions that the MI has an environmental data catalogue, which may be a source of data for the deep learning pipeline. However, the specific methods used for collecting raw data are not specified in the provided context.
