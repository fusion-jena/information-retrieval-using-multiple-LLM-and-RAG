Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be focused on the performance evaluation of various deep learning models for image retrieval tasks, and it does not provide information on the training process or the stopping criteria used. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
