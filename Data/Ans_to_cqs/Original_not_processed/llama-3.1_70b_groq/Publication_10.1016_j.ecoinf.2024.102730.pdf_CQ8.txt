Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or where it is available. The context appears to be a collection of research papers and articles related to machine learning, vegetation studies, and remote sensing, but it does not provide information about a specific code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
