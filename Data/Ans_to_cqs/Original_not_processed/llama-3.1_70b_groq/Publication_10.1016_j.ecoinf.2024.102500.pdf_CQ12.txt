Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention the use of deep learning models such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. It mentions the use of machine learning models like XGB, RF, and ET, which are used to build a stacking-based ANN meta model, but it does not provide information about the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
