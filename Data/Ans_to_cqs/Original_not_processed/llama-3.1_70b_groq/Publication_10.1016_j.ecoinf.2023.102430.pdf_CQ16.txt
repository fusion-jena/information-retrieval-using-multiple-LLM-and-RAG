Answer:::
The text does not explicitly state the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that the maximum number of epochs for the stochastic gradient descent with momentum optimizer was set to 15 after preliminary tests. This suggests that the training process was stopped after a fixed number of epochs, rather than being based on a specific validation loss criterion.
