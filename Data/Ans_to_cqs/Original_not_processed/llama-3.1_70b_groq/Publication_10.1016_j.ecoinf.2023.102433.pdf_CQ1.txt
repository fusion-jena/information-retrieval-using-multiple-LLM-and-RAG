Answer: The provided context does not specifically mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of satellite images from space agencies and the implementation of a DataHarvester component that detects new satellite images and downloads the data using internal scripts. Additionally, it mentions the use of various Python packages for interfacing with APIs to search and download satellite images, such as Landsat Collections scenes and Sentinel satellite images. 

It also mentions the use of MODIS data, which is a type of satellite data. However, it does not provide information on the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, the answer to the query is that the context does not provide enough information to answer the question about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
