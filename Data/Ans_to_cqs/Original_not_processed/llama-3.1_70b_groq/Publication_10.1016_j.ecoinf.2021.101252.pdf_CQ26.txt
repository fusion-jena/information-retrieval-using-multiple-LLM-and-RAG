Answer:::

To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, the technique used in the provided context is balancing the data by randomly duplicating presence records and deleting absence records until a balance of ~50:50 is obtained. This is done using the ROSE package for R. This technique is a form of oversampling the minority class and undersampling the majority class.

Specifically, the context mentions that the data is balanced by "randomly duplicating presence records and deleting absence records until a balance of ~50:50 is obtained". This is done to address the issue of strong class imbalance, where one or several classes have a much higher number of samples than others. This technique is used to prevent the models from being biased towards the prediction of majority classes.

It is not mentioned in the provided context whether other techniques such as stratified splitting or diverse data collection are used to address data bias. However, it is clear that oversampling the minority class and undersampling the majority class is the technique used to balance the data.
