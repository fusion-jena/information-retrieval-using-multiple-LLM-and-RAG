Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the importance of training deep learning models on datasets that resemble the data they will be applied to, the concept of data drift or domain drift, and the use of domain adaptation to increase the transferability of models. It also discusses the application of deep learning models for biocrust image classification and semantic segmentation.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
