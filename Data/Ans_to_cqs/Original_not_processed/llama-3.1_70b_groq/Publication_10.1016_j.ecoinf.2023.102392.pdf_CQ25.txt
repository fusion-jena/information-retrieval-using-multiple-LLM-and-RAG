Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification, specifically for categorizing forest types utilizing high spatial and ultra-high resolution remote sensing data. The model aims to identify features and patterns in large image datasets to enhance the performance of the fire risk prediction model. The classification of forest types is crucial as different forest conditions have varying levels of susceptibility to wildfires. The study aims to integrate a hybrid model for predicting forest fires vulnerability with a deep learning model-based approach for forests classification.
