Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be focused on the PLUS model, land use data, and various datasets such as NDVI, vegetation type data, DEM, and others. It does not provide information on the specific criteria used for splitting data for deep learning model training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
