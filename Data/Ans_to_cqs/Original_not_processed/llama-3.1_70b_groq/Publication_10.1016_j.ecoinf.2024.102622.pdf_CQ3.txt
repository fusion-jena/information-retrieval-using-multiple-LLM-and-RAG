Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. It appears to be focused on remote sensing and crop classification using Sentinel-2 data, and discusses methods such as random forest classification, support vector machine classification, and decision tree classification. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, which are typically used in computer vision tasks.
