Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research article discussing the use of deep learning algorithms for bird detection in camera trap images, but it does not provide information on where the code is hosted. If you are looking for the code repository, you may want to try contacting the authors of the article or searching online for additional resources.
