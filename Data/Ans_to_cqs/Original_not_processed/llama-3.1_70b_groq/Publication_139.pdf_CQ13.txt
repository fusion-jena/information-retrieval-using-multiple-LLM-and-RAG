Answer:::
The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model include the optimizer Adam with an initial learning rate of 0.0007. Additionally, early stopping was used to prevent overfitting. The model was trained for 10-15 epochs, with each epoch taking approximately 1 minute on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU. The learning rate decay is 1Ã—10^-4.
