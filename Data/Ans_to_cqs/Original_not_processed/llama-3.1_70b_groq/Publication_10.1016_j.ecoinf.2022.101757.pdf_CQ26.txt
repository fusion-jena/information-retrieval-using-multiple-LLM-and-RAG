Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on semantic segmentation, Conditional Random Fields (CRF), and the extraction of meaningful information from images, but it does not discuss data bias or preprocessing techniques.

However, I can provide some general information on the techniques you mentioned. Stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling are common techniques used to address class imbalance and data bias in machine learning datasets. Diverse data collection is also an important aspect of reducing data bias, as it involves collecting data from a wide range of sources and scenarios to ensure that the model is trained on a representative sample of the population.

If you're looking for specific information on how to address data bias in the context of deep learning for semantic segmentation, I would recommend consulting additional resources or research papers that focus on this topic.
