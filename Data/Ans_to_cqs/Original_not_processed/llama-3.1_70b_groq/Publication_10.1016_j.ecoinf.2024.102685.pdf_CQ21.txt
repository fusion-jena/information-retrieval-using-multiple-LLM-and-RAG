Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, based on the information provided in Table 2, it can be inferred that some form of metrics calculation and confusion matrix analysis were performed.

The table presents classification performances calculated on the confusion matrices, including overall accuracy, user accuracy, and producer accuracy for seagrass meadows and species meadows mapping. This suggests that the model's performance was evaluated using these metrics, which is a common postprocessing step in machine learning.

However, there is no mention of saliency maps or any other postprocessing steps beyond metrics calculation and confusion matrix analysis. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive answer to the query based on the provided context.

In summary, the postprocessing steps that can be inferred from the provided context include metrics calculation and confusion matrix analysis, but no information is available on saliency maps or other postprocessing steps.
