Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing, environmental monitoring, and mining detection using satellite imagery and machine learning techniques.

However, I can suggest that the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines typically include techniques such as dropout, L2 regularization, and batch normalization. But without specific information from the provided context, I cannot confirm if these methods were used in the specific deep learning pipeline mentioned.

Therefore, my answer is that I don't know the specific regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context.
