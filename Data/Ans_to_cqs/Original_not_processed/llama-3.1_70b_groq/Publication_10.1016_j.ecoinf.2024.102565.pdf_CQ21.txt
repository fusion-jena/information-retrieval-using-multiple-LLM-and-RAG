Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the model fitting process, hyperparameter determination, and validation phase using K-fold cross-validation. It also presents the performance metrics (R2, RMSE, MAE, and MBE) for different machine learning algorithms, but it does not delve into the specifics of postprocessing steps. Therefore, I don't know the exact postprocessing steps involved after model training based on the provided context.
