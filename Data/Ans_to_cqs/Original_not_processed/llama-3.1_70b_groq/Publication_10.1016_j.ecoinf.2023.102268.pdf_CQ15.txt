Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The text only mentions that a SVM (Support Vector Machine) with a cubic polynomial kernel was used as the classifier model, and that a 10-fold cross-validation was used to define the score-to-posterior-probability transformation function. However, it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used during the training process.
