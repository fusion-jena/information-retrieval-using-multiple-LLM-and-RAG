Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is to inspect the model outputs and error outcomes for signs of overfitting after tuning the number of required epochs. Additionally, the model's performance is assessed on held-out test data after each training epoch. The model is considered to have converged to its most accurate state when its performance on the test data stops improving, typically after 10-30 epochs. If subsequent training does not improve the model's performance or even decreases it, it is considered to be overfitting, meaning that the model is memorizing its training set rather than learning a generalized matching strategy.
