Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the architecture and hyperparameters of the neural network, specifically the encoder-decoder structure and the various layers involved. It also mentions the application of the model to reconstructing caesium-137 chronics particulate concentration in rivers, but it does not provide information on the format of the input data.

However, based on the fact that the model is designed to reconstruct time-series data (caesium-137 chronics particulate concentration in rivers), it is likely that the input data is in a format that can represent temporal information, such as CSV (Comma Separated Values) or a similar tabular format. But without further information, it is impossible to determine the exact data format used in the pipeline.
