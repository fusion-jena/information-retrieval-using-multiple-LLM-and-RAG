Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model in a pipeline, nor does it specify the type of deep learning model used (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer). The context appears to be related to remote sensing, satellite imagery, and machine learning, but it does not provide information about the specific deep learning model used in a pipeline.
