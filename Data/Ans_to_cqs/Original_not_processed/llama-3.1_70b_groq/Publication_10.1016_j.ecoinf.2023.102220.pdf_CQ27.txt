Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only discusses the implementation of the machine learning methods, including Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), in Python using the libraries TensorFlow and Scikit-learn. It also mentions the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the models, but it does not provide information on how the trained models were deployed.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
