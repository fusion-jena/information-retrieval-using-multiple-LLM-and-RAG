Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The text only mentions the structure of the Backpropagation Artificial Neural Network (BP-ANN) model, including the number of hidden layers and neurons, but does not provide information on the hyperparameters used for training the model.

However, it is mentioned that the 'neuralnet' package of R 4.1.2 software was used for developing the BP-ANN model. This package may have default settings for hyperparameters, but without further information, it is not possible to determine the specific hyperparameters used in this study.

Therefore, I do not know the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer.
