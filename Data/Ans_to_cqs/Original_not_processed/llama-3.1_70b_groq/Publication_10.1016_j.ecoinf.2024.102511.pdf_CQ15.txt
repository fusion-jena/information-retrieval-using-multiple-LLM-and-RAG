Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning and machine learning techniques for bioacoustic classification, particularly in the context of marine mammal research. It mentions the use of deep neural networks and the importance of significant sample sizes for all classes, but it does not delve into the specifics of optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of image data augmentation for deep learning, which is a technique used to artificially increase the size of the training dataset by applying random transformations to the existing images. This can help improve the performance of the deep learning model, but it is not an optimization technique per se.

In summary, the provided context does not provide information on the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam.
