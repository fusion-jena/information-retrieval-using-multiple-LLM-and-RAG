Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the pipeline involves image data, as the research focuses on facial recognition of sika deer using computer vision techniques and deep learning. The context mentions the use of a Vision Transformer (ViT) model, which is typically used for image classification tasks. Additionally, the mention of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and ResNet blocks also suggests that the pipeline involves image data. However, the specific format of the image data (e.g., JPEG, PNG, etc.) is not mentioned. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
