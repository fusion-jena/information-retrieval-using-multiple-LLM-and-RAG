Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a list of references and a brief description of a study area, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.

However, I can suggest that the query might be related to the first reference "Verification of novel integrations of swarm intelligence algorithms into deep learning neural network for flood susceptibility mapping." But without more information, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.

If you have more context or information about the deep learning pipeline, I might be able to provide a more accurate answer.
