Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention "field recordings" of a threatened species, the southern black-throated finch, which suggests that data collection may involve recording audio data in the field. Additionally, the context mentions "bioacoustics" and "passive acoustic monitoring", which implies that audio data may be collected using sensors or recording devices. However, the specific methods used for collecting raw data are not clearly stated.
