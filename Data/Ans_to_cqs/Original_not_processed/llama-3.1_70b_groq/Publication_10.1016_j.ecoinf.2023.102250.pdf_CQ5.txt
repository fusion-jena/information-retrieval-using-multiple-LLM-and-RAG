Answer: The provided context does not mention specific datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention various datasets used in the experiments, including:

* Ori
* G1_Dataset1
* G1_Dataset2
* G1_Dataset3
* G1_Dataset4
* G1_Dataset5
* G2_Dataset1
* G2_Dataset2
* G2_Dataset3
* G2_Dataset4
* G3_Dataset1
* G3_Dataset2
* G3_Dataset3
* G3_Dataset1_mixup
* G3_Dataset2_mixup
* G3_Dataset3_mixup

These datasets are used for classification experiments with ResNet18, VGG16, and MobileNetV2 as the base classifier models. The context also mentions that the datasets were split into train and test sets in an 8:2 ratio, and all evaluation metrics were computed on the test set.
