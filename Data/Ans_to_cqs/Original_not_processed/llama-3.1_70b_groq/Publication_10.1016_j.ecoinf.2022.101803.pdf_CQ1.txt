Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the analysis and modeling of existing datasets, specifically in the field of ecological informatics. It mentions the use of simulated datasets and real-life datasets, such as the Sparrow population dataset, but does not provide information on how the raw data was collected. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
