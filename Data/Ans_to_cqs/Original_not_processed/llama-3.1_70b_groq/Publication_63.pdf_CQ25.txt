Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is regression, specifically to predict plant functional traits from simple RGB photographs. The model is designed to extract a set of plant functional traits, such as plant and organ size (GH, LA) and the leaf economics spectrum (SLA), from images. The model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, which is typically used for image classification tasks, but in this case, it is used for regression tasks. The model is trained to output exactly one prediction value for each trait, indicating that the goal is to predict a continuous value rather than classify images into categories.
