Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, specifically SegFormer, are Intersection over Union (IOU), Pixel Accuracy (PA), and F1-score. Additionally, the model's performance is also compared in terms of inference time and number of parameters. The IOU and PA metrics are used to evaluate the model's performance on each category, as shown in Table 2. The F1-score is mentioned as one of the metrics used to compare the performance of SegFormer with other models, such as FCN, HRNet, PSPNet, and DeepLabV3+.
