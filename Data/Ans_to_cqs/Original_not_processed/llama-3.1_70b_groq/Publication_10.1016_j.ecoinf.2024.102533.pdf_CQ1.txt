Answer:

Based on the provided context, it appears that sensors are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, the context mentions the use of a "portable spectrometer" (Wang et al., 2023) and "spectral handheld devices" (Moser et al., 2023) for assessing the freshness of fish. Additionally, the context mentions the development of a "portable, non-destructive freshness indicative sensor" for Indian Mackerel (Kunjulakshmi et al., 2020). These sensors are likely used to collect data on the physical and chemical properties of the fish, which can then be used to train deep learning models for automated fish grading (Jayasundara et al., 2023) and freshness categorization (Lalabadi et al., 2020). There is no mention of surveys or public datasets being used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
