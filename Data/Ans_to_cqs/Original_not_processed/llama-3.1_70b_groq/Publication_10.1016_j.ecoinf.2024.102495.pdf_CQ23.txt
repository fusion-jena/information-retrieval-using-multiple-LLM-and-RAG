Answer:::

To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. According to the provided context, the model was evaluated using stratified 10-fold cross-validation. This means that the dataset was split into 10 folds, and the model was trained and evaluated on each fold, with the remaining 9 folds used for validation. This approach helps to ensure that the model is not overfitting to a specific subset of the data and can generalize well to unseen data.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model was trained using a categorical cross-entropy loss function, which is a common choice for multi-class classification problems. The use of a categorical cross-entropy loss function helps to ensure that the model is learning to predict the correct class labels, rather than simply memorizing the training data.

The context also mentions that the model was evaluated using a range of performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score, and area under the curve (AUC) score. This comprehensive evaluation helps to ensure that the model is performing well across a range of different metrics, rather than just optimizing for a single metric.

Overall, the use of stratified 10-fold cross-validation, a categorical cross-entropy loss function, and a comprehensive evaluation using multiple performance metrics helps to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
