Answer: 
The criteria used to determine when training is complete is not explicitly stated as a validation loss plateau. However, it is mentioned that the choice of 30 epochs was made based on the empirical observation that in all of these experiments, the learning always converged well within 30 epochs. This suggests that the convergence of the learning process is the primary criteria used to determine when training is complete.
