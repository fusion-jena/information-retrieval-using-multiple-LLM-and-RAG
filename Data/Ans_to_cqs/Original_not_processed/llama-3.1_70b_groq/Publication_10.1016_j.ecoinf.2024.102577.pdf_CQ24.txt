Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention deep learning or strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on research related to tuna species, fisheries oceanography, and machine learning applications in these fields.

However, one of the references mentions "Random Forests" which is a machine learning algorithm that can handle randomness. According to the reference "A comparison among interpretative proposals for Random Forests" by Aria et al. (2021), Random Forests are a type of ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve the accuracy and robustness of predictions. The algorithm can handle randomness by using techniques such as bagging and random feature selection.

But, this is not directly related to deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I couldn't find any information on strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value, in the provided context.
