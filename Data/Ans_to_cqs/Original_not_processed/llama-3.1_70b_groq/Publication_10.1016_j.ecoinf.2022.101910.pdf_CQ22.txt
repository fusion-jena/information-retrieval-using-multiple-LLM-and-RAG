Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the BirdNET model are recall rate and the percentage of occurrences detected. The recall rate is an index commonly used in bioacoustics technique, which measures the proportion of true positives that are correctly identified by the model. The percentage of occurrences detected refers to the proportion of bird vocalizations that are correctly detected by the model. 

Note that the provided context does not mention the use of accuracy or precision as evaluation metrics for the BirdNET model. However, it does mention that the model's performance may result in increased recall and false positive rates, which suggests that the model's precision may be affected by the chosen confidence threshold.
