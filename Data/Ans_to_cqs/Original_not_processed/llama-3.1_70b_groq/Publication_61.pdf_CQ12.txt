Answer: 
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the text, which mentions the use of a CNN for cactus recognition in aerial images. The text also provides details about the architecture of the CNN, including the use of max pooling, flattening, and fully connected layers.
