Answer:::
The provided context primarily focuses on image data formats in the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, it mentions the use of high-resolution images, such as those found in the ImageNet database, which comprises over 14 million images across nearly 22,000 categories. Additionally, it discusses the use of pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image recognition tasks.

While the context does not explicitly mention other data formats like audio or video, it does mention the use of segmentation mask annotations, which are typically used in image processing tasks. There is also a mention of VGG Image Annotator (VIA), a tool used for annotating images.

There is no mention of CSV (Comma Separated Values) files in the provided context. However, it is common for deep learning pipelines to use CSV files for storing and managing metadata, such as image labels or annotations.

In summary, the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline, as per the provided context, is image data.
