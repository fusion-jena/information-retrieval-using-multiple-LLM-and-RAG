Answer:::

The provided context does not specifically mention deep learning or strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss data splitting approaches and hyperparameter tuning in the context of Gradient Boosting Regression Trees (GBRT).

Regarding data splitting, the context mentions two approaches: Random Year (RY) data splitting and a more general approach to randomly splitting individual observations. The RY approach groups observations by year and randomly selects years for inclusion in the train and test datasets. This approach may introduce systematic differences between the test and train datasets but ensures that the model is tested on previously unseen combinations of explanatory variables.

As for hyperparameter tuning, the context mentions that it was done manually. The learning rate was set as low as possible, and the number of iterations was set as high as computationally feasible. The learning rate, also known as the shrinkage parameter, determines the contribution of each tree to the model.

There is no mention of random seed values or strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
