Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, species distribution modeling, and crowdsourcing data analysis, but it does not provide information about the code repository.

Therefore, I must answer that I don't know where the code repository is available.
