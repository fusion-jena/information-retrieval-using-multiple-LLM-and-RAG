Answer:::

The provided context does not specifically mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context is focused on Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and the trade-off between reconstruction and regularization losses.

However, it does mention the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) term as a regularization loss, which is used to enforce the encoder density to match the prior over the latent variable. Additionally, it mentions β-annealing and cyclic β as methods to balance the reconstruction and regularization losses, but these are specific to VAEs and not general regularization methods.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query about regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
