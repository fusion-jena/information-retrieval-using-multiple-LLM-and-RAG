Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of recordings, specifically mentioning "a set of manually validated recordings" and "a large set of recordings" in the context of a single-species bioacoustics study. This suggests that audio recordings may be one method of collecting raw data, possibly through the use of sensors or audio recording devices.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of acoustic indices and mentions a study on the poor performance of acoustic indices as proxies for bird diversity in a fragmented Amazonian landscape. This suggests that acoustic sensors or audio recording devices may be used to collect data on bird sounds or other acoustic signals.

However, the context does not provide information on the use of surveys or public datasets as methods for collecting raw data. Therefore, I can only provide a partial answer based on the information available.

It is also worth noting that the context appears to be focused on the processing and analysis of existing data, rather than the collection of new data. Therefore, the methods used for collecting raw data may not be the primary focus of the research.
