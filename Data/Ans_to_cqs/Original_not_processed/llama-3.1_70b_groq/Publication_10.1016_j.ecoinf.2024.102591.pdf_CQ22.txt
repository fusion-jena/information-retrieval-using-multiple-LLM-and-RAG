Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to wildfires, remote sensing, and vegetation recovery, but it does not provide information on the evaluation metrics used in a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
