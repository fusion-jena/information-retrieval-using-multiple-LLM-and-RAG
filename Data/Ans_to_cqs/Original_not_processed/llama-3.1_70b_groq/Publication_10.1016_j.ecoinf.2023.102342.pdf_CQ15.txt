Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning pipelines or optimization techniques such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be focused on data mining, knowledge discovery in databases (KDD), and association rule learning using the Apriori algorithm. It discusses the process of identifying patterns or relationships within a dataset, but it does not mention deep learning or specific optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines.
