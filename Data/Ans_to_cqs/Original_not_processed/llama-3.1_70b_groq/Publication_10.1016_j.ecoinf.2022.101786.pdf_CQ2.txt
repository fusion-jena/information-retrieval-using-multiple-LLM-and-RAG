Answer: 

The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image. The study uses a large dataset of images taken by an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) 1200 m deep in the North-East Atlantic. The images are used to train a YOLOV4 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to count and measure a single class of objects, specifically the xenophyophore Syringammina fragilissima. The predictions made by the CNN are stored in a JSON file, which contains the coordinates of the bounding box of each tentative annotation as well as a confidence score.
