Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context only mentions that Halgamuge et al. (2020) developed an algorithm to collect data automatically and analyzed six different optimizer models using deep learning technology, but it does not provide further details on the hyperparameters used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
