Answer: The provided context does not specifically mention strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline or the use of a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of Random Forest (RF) as a machine learning technique, which involves the iterative, random creation of decision trees. This implies that randomness is an inherent part of the RF algorithm.

In the context of RF, the randomness is handled by creating multiple decision trees and using the majority vote of the trees to classify pixels. This approach helps to reduce the impact of randomness on the model's predictions.

Regarding the use of a random seed value, the context does not provide any information on this topic. However, in general, setting a random seed value can help to ensure reproducibility of results in machine learning models that involve randomness, such as RF. By setting a fixed seed value, the same sequence of random numbers can be generated, which can help to ensure that the results are consistent across different runs of the model.

Overall, while the provided context does not provide specific strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline or the use of a random seed value, it does provide some insight into how randomness is handled in the RF algorithm.
