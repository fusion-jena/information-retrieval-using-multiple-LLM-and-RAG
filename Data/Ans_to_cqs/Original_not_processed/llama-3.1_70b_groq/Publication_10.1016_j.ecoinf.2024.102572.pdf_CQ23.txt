Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The context appears to be discussing the use of satellite data and machine learning techniques for land cover classification and fire severity analysis, but it does not specifically address the generalizability of a deep learning model.

The context does mention the use of a dataset with a wide range of values (min: 0.928; max: 41.2145 tons per hectare) and the application of machine learning techniques to classify fire-damaged monuments, but it does not provide information on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
