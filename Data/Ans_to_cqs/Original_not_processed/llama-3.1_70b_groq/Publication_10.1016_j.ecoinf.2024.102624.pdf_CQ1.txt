Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the analysis and processing of existing data, such as hyperspectral remote sensing images, rather than the collection of new data.

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the data used in the study may have been collected through remote sensing technologies, such as satellite or aerial imaging. The mention of "hyperspectral remote sensing images" and "Planetscope spectral data" suggests that the data may have been collected through these types of technologies.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of indices such as NDVI, NDRE, and vNDVI, which are commonly used in remote sensing applications. This suggests that the data may have been collected through sensors or other remote sensing technologies.

Unfortunately, without more information, it is not possible to provide a more specific answer to the query.
