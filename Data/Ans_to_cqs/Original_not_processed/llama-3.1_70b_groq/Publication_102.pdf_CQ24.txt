Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of a Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer in Model-K, which implies that randomness is involved in the training process. Additionally, the context mentions the use of the Adam optimizer in Model-2, which also involves randomness.

While the context does not provide information on how randomness is handled, it is common practice in deep learning to set a random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results. However, this is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
