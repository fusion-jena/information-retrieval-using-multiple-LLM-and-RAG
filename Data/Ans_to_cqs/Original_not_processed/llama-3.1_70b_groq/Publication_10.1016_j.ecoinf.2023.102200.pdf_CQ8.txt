Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or where it is available. The context appears to be a collection of academic papers and research articles related to remote sensing, computer vision, and machine learning, but it does not include information about the code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
