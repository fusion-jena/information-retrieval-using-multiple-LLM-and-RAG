Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context only discusses the experimental configurations, including the choice of deep learning architecture, training mechanism, dataset type, and training-testing set distribution. It also provides some details about the hyperparameters used in the experiments, such as momentum, weight decay, and batch size. However, it does not provide any information about data augmentation techniques.
