Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification. Specifically, the model is used to classify detected signals into two categories: 'boatwhistles' and 'other' signals. The model uses a pre-trained ResNet-50 convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from spectrogram images of the detected signals. These features are then fed into a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to identify the optimal decision boundary between the two classes. The SVM classifier is trained on a labeled dataset, and its performance is evaluated using a confusion matrix on test data not seen during training.
