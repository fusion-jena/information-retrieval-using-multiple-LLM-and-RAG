Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions that data augmentation is used to address the requirement for large training datasets in DNNs, which can be achieved using an external simulator. It also mentions that current research on LiDAR point-cloud simulations predominantly embraces two perspectives: aerial and terrestrial, but it does not provide details on the specific data augmentation techniques used.

Therefore, I do not know the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, scaling, etc.
