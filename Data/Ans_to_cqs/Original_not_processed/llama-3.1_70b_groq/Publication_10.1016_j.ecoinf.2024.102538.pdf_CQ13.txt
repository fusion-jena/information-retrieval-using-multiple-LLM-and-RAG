Answer:

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows:

* Optimizer: Adam optimizer
* Learning rate: Initially set at 0.001, and subsequently reduced by a factor of 0.1 in a step-wise manner whenever the validation loss remained constant for five epochs. The minimum learning rate was established at 1 × 10^(-5).
* Batch size: Fixed at 16
* Weight decay: 1 × 10^(-5)
* Hyper-parameter λ: Set to 0.8
* Hyper-parameter β: Set to 0.4
* Hyper-parameter Mk: Defined as 2k+1 (k = 1, 2, …K)

These hyperparameters were used to train the model over 200 epochs.
