Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of dropout in the context of the neural network (NNET) and deep neural network (DNN) models. Specifically, the parameters "hidden_dropout" and "visible_dropout" are listed for the NNET and DNN models, respectively, with values of 0 for all years. This suggests that dropout was not used in these models. 

There is no mention of L2 regularization or any other regularization methods in the provided context. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a complete answer to the query.
