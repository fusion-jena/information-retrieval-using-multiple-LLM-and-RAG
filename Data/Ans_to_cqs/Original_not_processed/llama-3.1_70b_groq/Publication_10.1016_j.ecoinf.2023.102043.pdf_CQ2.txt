Answer: 

The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is audio. Specifically, the audio data is processed as follows: 

1. The audio is converted to a monophonic channel and resampled at 16 kHz. 
2. The spectrogram is extracted and created using STFT magnitudes of 25 ms overlapped by 15 ms. 
3. The Mel spectrogram is calculated by mapping to 64 bins of the Mel scale within the range of 125â€“7500 Hz. 

These audio features are then fed into the YAMNet model for extracting embeddings, which are then used for goat vocalization detection.
