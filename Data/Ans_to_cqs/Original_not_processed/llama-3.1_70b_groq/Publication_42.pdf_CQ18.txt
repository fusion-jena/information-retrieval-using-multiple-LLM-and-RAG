Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention that the chosen model was evaluated based on its F1-score, precision, and recall. The F1-score is a measure of a model's accuracy, and it is mentioned that the chosen model had an F1-score of 92.75%. This suggests that the model's performance was monitored and evaluated using metrics such as F1-score, precision, and recall during the training process. However, the specific strategy or techniques used to monitor the model's performance during training are not mentioned in the provided context.
