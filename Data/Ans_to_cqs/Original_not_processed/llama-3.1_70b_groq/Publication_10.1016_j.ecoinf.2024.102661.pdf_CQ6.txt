Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context primarily focuses on hyperparameter optimization using the TPEBO algorithm for an LSTM neural network, discussing the importance of hyperparameters, the search range for certain hyperparameters, and the optimization process. It does not provide information on preprocessing steps.

However, it does mention the input dataset being integrated into the TPEBO-LSTM model, but it does not elaborate on any preprocessing that may have been performed on the dataset before integration. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
