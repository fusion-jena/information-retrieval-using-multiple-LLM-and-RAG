Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily discusses the selection of the LSTM-CNN-based sentiment analysis framework, the performance of the model, and references to other studies. It does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix, that were performed after the model training.

However, it does mention that Lundberg, S.M., and Lee, S.-I. (2017) proposed a unified approach to interpreting model predictions, which might be related to postprocessing steps. But without further information, it is unclear how this approach was applied in the context of the study.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
