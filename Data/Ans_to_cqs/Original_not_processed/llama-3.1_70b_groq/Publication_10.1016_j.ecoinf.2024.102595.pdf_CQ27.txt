Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only discusses the development stage, where the data was divided into training, validation, and test sets, and various machine learning and deep learning models were trained and tested. It also highlights the importance of machine learning and deep learning in the oil palm sector, but it does not provide information on the deployment process.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
