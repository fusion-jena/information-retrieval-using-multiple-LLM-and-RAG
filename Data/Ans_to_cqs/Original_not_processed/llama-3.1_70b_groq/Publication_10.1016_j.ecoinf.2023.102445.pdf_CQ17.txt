Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text primarily focuses on the experimental design, network architecture, and evaluation results of the YOLO_MRC model. It discusses the use of various techniques such as attention mechanisms, feature concatenation, and weight assignment, but it does not mention specific regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to this question. If you have any further context or clarification, I would be happy to try and assist you further.
