Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention anything about regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. The context appears to be related to land use, soil science, and ecological informatics, with no mention of deep learning or regularization methods.

Therefore, I must say that I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
