Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps. However, it does mention that the authors will use various metrics to evaluate the performance of their model, including accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrices. 

According to the text, the use of confusion matrices will provide detailed information regarding both correct and incorrect classifications made by the model, allowing the authors to identify potential deficiencies in classifying specific classes or categories. The results of the evaluation will be presented through figures and numerical data, with graphical visualizations effectively portraying the performance estimation achievement.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after model training include:

* Calculation of metrics such as accuracy and F1-score
* Creation of confusion matrices to evaluate the model's performance
* Presentation of results through figures and numerical data
* Graphical visualizations to effectively portray the performance estimation achievement

However, it is not clear if Saliency maps or other postprocessing steps are involved.
