Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the Mask-RCNN algorithm, is instance segmentation. This means that the model is designed to accurately segment bacteria within complex images, allowing for the identification and quantification of individual bacterial cells. The model is also capable of detecting differences among bacterial communities from different locations, making it a useful tool for microbial ecology research.
