Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention that the model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as overall accuracy (OA) and mean Intersection over Union (mIoU). The context also mentions that the model's performance is compared across different parameter settings, such as voxel size, batch size, and regularization strength, to determine the optimal combination of parameters. 

It can be inferred that the model's performance is monitored by tracking these metrics and adjusting the parameters accordingly. However, the specific strategy or technique used to monitor the model's performance during training, such as validation loss or learning rate scheduling, is not mentioned in the provided context.
