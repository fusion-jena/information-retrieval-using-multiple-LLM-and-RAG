Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The text only discusses the structure of the CNN, the creation of the metadata file, and the training process, but it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
