Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the use of deep learning for image classification, specifically for automatically identifying and filtering empty camera images in wildlife surveys. It mentions the use of a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model, specifically the AlexNet model, but does not provide details on the data annotation techniques used.

However, it does mention that the study used a "newly-labeled images" and "extended training set" to retrain the model and improve its accuracy. This suggests that some form of data annotation was performed, but the specific techniques used are not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
