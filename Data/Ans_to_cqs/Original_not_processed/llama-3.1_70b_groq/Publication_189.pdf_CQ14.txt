Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It does provide information on the specific hyperparameters used, such as the learning rate (Î± = 0.001), the number of epochs (20), and the number of steps per epoch (500 for training and 100 for validation). However, it does not mention the method used to optimize these hyperparameters, such as grid search, random search, or other optimization techniques.

Therefore, I do not know how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.
