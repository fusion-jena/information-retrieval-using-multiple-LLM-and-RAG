Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention a code repository or a deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research article about ecological informatics, specifically a study on feature-based and shape-match classifications of animal population time series. The context includes information about the authors, their affiliations, and the journal where the article was published, but it does not provide any information about a code repository.
