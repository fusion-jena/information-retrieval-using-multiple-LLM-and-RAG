Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection. However, it does mention the use of a MinMaxScaler to transform each feature by scaling it to a [0â€“1] range, which is a common preprocessing technique used to normalize data.

Additionally, the context mentions that the distribution of values in the training set is more similar to the one of the test period, which suggests that the data may have been split in a way that tries to maintain a similar distribution between the training and test sets. However, it does not provide further details on how the data was split.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the only technique mentioned that could be related to addressing data bias is the use of a MinMaxScaler for normalization. Other techniques such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection are not mentioned.
