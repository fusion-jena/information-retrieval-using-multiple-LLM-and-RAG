Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically address techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide some general information on techniques used to address imbalanced data, which is related to data bias.

According to the context, He and Garcia (2009) discuss learning from imbalanced data, which is a common problem in machine learning. They propose several techniques to address this issue, including oversampling the minority class, undersampling the majority class, and generating synthetic samples.

While the context does not explicitly mention stratified splitting or diverse data collection, these techniques are commonly used to address data bias and imbalance. Stratified splitting involves splitting the data into subsets based on the class labels, ensuring that each subset has a similar class distribution. Diverse data collection involves collecting data from diverse sources to reduce bias and increase representation.

It's worth noting that the context is focused on a specific research paper and its authors, and it does not provide a comprehensive overview of techniques used to address data bias. Therefore, I cannot provide a more detailed answer to this query based on the provided context.
