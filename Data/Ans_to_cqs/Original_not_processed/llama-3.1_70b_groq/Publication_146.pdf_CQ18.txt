Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is through the evaluation of various metrics at different stages of training. The model was trained for 350 epochs and evaluated using the scores precision, recall, F1, GIoU, and mAP. These scores were calculated from model validation data, consisting of 321 image tiles. The metrics were evaluated at different iteration stages, specifically at epochs 100, 200, 300, and 350. This allows for the monitoring of the model's performance and progress throughout the training process.
