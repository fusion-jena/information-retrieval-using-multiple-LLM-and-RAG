Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context appears to focus on the performance evaluation of different CNN models (Model 2 to Model 5) on a classification task, specifically environmental condition classification. It provides various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, F1 score, and others, but it does not discuss the training process or the criteria used to determine when training is complete.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
