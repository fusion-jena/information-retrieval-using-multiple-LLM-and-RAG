Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is to track the validation EarthNet Score (ENS) and stop the optimization when the validation ENS repeatedly fails to improve compared to the score evaluated from previous epochs. This approach allows the model to select the epoch with the highest attained validation score, indicating the best performance of the model during training.
