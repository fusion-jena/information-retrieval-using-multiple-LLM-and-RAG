Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on bathymetry retrieval methods, including linear regression models, artificial neural networks, and machine learning techniques like CART and RFR. It also discusses the use of remote sensing data, such as GF-6 (WFV) data, and the preprocessing steps involved.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query about data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline.
