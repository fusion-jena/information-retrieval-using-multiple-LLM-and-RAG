Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. The context appears to be related to academic papers and research studies in the fields of ecology, agriculture, and environmental science. There is no mention of a specific code repository or a link to GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I am unable to provide a code repository link as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
