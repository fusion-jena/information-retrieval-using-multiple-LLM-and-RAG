Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. It discusses the PLUS model, which consists of two main modules: the transformed specification mining framework based on the land expansion analysis strategy (LEAS) module and the cellular automata (CA) model based on a multi-type random patch seed mechanism (CARS). It also discusses the CASA model, which is used to estimate Net Primary Productivity (NPP). However, it does not provide any information on how the model performance is monitored during training.
