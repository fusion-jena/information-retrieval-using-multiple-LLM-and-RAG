Answer: 
The hyperparameters of the model, specifically the SVM model, were optimized using a sensitivity analysis method. The "kernelType" was set to "RBF" (Gaussian function), and the "gamma" and "cost" parameters were optimized by testing different values. For the "gamma" parameter, values of 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, and 300 were tested, while for the "cost" parameter, values of 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, and 50 were tested. The optimal values for "gamma" and "cost" were selected based on the highest overall accuracy achieved from different parameter combinations, which were 2 and 10, respectively. 

However, for the SAE classifier, the hyperparameters were optimized by testing a range of values for each parameter. The number of nodes in the first, second, and third hidden layers were tested in the range of 6 to 60 with a step of 6, 0 to 60 with a step of 6, and 0 to 60 with a step of 6, respectively. The batch size was tested in the range of 10 to 100 with a step of 10. The optimal values for these parameters were selected based on the highest J-M value, but the exact method of optimization (e.g., grid search, random search) is not specified.
