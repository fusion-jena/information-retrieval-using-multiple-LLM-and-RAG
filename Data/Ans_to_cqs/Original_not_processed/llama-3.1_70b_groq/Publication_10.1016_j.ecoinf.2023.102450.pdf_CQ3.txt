Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning techniques for animal recognition, tracking, and behavior analysis. It discusses the use of Siamese networks, ResNet-50, and region-based convolutional neural networks, but does not provide information on data annotation techniques.

However, it can be inferred that some form of annotation is necessary to train and evaluate the deep learning models. For example, the context mentions the use of labeled samples for training the Siamese network, which suggests that some form of annotation is required to assign labels to the data.

Common data annotation techniques used in computer vision tasks, such as bounding box annotation and instance segmentation, may be relevant in this context. However, without explicit information, it is impossible to confirm the specific annotation techniques used in this pipeline.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the context does not provide explicit information on the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
