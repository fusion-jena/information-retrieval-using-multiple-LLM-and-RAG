Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the performance metrics used to evaluate the models, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, as well as the comparison of different deep learning models and their ensembles.

However, it can be inferred that the dataset used for training and testing the models is diverse, as the context mentions that the dataset is used after pre-processing steps, and the added image enhancement technique enabled the proposed systems to reach high accuracy values. This suggests that the dataset may have been pre-processed to reduce noise and improve quality, which could contribute to the generalizability of the model.

Additionally, the context mentions that the results in Figs. 7 and 6 show the accuracy and loss along with the epochs, which could indicate that the models were trained and evaluated using a validation set or cross-validation technique. However, this is not explicitly stated, and the exact measures taken to ensure generalizability are not clear.

Therefore, while some inferences can be made about the dataset and training process, the exact measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model are not explicitly stated in the provided context.
