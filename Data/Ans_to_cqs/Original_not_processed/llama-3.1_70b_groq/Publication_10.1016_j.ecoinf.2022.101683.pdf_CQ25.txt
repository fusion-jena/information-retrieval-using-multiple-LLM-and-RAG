Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its purpose. The text appears to be discussing species distribution modeling (SDM) and evaluating the performance of different models using various metrics. It mentions the use of different treatments, such as spatial filtering and targeted selection of background points, to test the impact of potential biases and errors on the models. However, it does not mention deep learning or the specific purpose of a deep learning model.
