Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. The context only provides information about the AODEGRU model architecture, the training process, and the input/output sequences, but it does not discuss the hardware resources used for training the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
