Answer: According to the provided context, the hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a grid-search strategy. Specifically, it is mentioned that "We used a grid-search strategy to determine the optimal parameters for the base and metamodels." This suggests that the model's hyperparameters are tuned using a systematic and exhaustive search over a predefined range of values, rather than a random search or other optimization methods.
