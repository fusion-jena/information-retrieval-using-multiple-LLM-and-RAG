Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is classification. Specifically, the model is used to classify input images into three categories of water quality levels: Class I, Class II, and Class III. The model is trained on a dataset of images, and its performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The study aims to employ the model to classify water quality levels in Lake Dianchi, with the goal of monitoring and assessing the ecological health of the lake.
