Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. Specifically, the model is used for plant leaf classification, as mentioned in the context. The model is trained to classify images of plant leaves into different categories, with a reported accuracy of 98.97%. The context also mentions other classification tasks, such as pine tree classification and plant disease classification, which were performed by other models, but the proposed approach is focused on plant leaf classification.
