Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, except for accuracy. The text mentions that the accuracy of the transfer learning model was better than that of the model trained from scratch, and it provides specific accuracy values for different transfer strategies and sample sizes. However, it does not mention precision, recall, or any other metrics. Therefore, based on the provided context, the only metric mentioned is accuracy.
