Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the authors adjusted the regularization strength, voxel size, and batch size to obtain the best results. 

However, it can be inferred that the authors used a manual tuning approach, as they fixed certain hyperparameters (voxel size and batch size) and adjusted others (regularization strength) to observe the effects on the model's performance. 

There is no mention of grid search, random search, or any other automated hyperparameter optimization techniques. The authors seem to have relied on trial and error to find the optimal hyperparameters.
