Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. However, it does mention some techniques that involve introducing randomness or variability to the data or models, which might be related to handling randomness.

For example, the context mentions "Random tanh distortion" as a technique used to introduce a "soft clipping" type of distortion to the data, with a probability of 0.25. Additionally, it mentions "Random clipping and splicing" as a technique used to expand the sample size by randomly cropping and concatenating spectrograms.

It also mentions the use of "stratified sampling" to divide the datasets into training, validation, and testing sets, which might help to reduce the impact of randomness in the data.

However, these techniques do not directly address the issue of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting random seed values. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to this question.

If you're looking for strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, some common techniques include:

* Setting a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility
* Using techniques such as dropout or data augmentation to introduce randomness during training
* Averaging the results of multiple models trained with different random seeds
* Using ensemble methods to combine the predictions of multiple models trained with different random seeds

However, these techniques are not mentioned in the provided context, and I do not have enough information to provide a more detailed answer.
