Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily discusses the performance evaluation of different regression methods, including Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models, and the use of metrics such as Adjusted R2, Mean Squared Error (MSE), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to evaluate their performance.

However, it does mention that the selection of hidden layers and neurons in the ANN model was determined through a process of trial and error, aiming to optimize the network's structure. This suggests that the training process may have involved some form of iterative evaluation and adjustment, but the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete are not specified.

Therefore, I do not know the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete, and I cannot provide a more detailed answer based on the provided context.
