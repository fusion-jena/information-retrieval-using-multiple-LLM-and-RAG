Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the performance and evaluation of the DEPP model on simulated data sets, its training and parameter sensitivity, and its comparison with other methods such as EPA-ng and APPLES+JC. It does not provide information on data preprocessing techniques used to address data bias.
