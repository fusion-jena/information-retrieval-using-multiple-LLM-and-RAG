Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and training of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), including the use of batch normalization, dropout layers, and autoencoders for feature extraction and learning. It also mentions the challenges of estimating or classifying aquatic ecosystem health, but does not provide information on data preprocessing techniques to address data bias.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of an autoencoder to extract complicated feature data efficiently, which may be related to addressing data bias. Additionally, the context mentions the importance of avoiding covariate shifts through batch normalization, which may be relevant to addressing data bias.

But, to directly answer the query, the context does not provide information on techniques such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
