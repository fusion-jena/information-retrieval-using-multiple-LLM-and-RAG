Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning techniques for mapping burned areas in the Cerrado biome in Brazil using Landsat 8 imagery and Google Cloud computing. It discusses the study region, methodology, and results, but does not delve into the details of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
