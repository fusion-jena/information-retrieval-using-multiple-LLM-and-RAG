Answer:

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are precision, recall, and their variants. Specifically, the metrics used are:

1. Precision (P): measures the proportion of true positives among all predicted positive instances.
2. Recall (R): measures the proportion of true positives among all actual positive instances.
3. Average Precision (AP): a weighted average of precision values at different recall thresholds, which summarizes the precision-recall curve.
4. Mean Average Precision (mAP): the average of AP values across all classes, which provides an overall measure of the model's performance.

These metrics are used to evaluate the model's performance on a multiclass classification task. The precision-recall curve is plotted to analyze the trade-off between precision and recall at different thresholds. The AP and mAP values are used to summarize the performance of the model in a single value.

Additionally, the F-score (Fβ) is also mentioned, which is a measure that combines precision and recall into a single value. The F-score is calculated as the harmonic mean of precision and recall, with a coefficient β that controls the relative importance of precision and recall. In this case, the β coefficient is set to 0.5, which gives more weight to precision than recall.
