Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that traditional machine learning methods can show more false-positive cases in imbalanced cases, which implies that data imbalance is a concern.

One of the references (Srivastava, N.; Hinton, G.; Krizhevsky, A.; Sutskever, I.; Salakhutdinov, R. Dropout: A simple way to prevent neural networks from overﬁtting. J. Mach. Learn. Res. 2014, 15, 1929–1958) discusses dropout as a technique to prevent overfitting, but it does not directly address data bias.

Another reference (Ioﬀe, S.; Szegedy, C. Batch normalization: Accelerating deep network training by reducing internal covariate shift. arXiv 2015, arXiv:1502.03167v3) discusses batch normalization, which can help with internal covariate shift, but it does not directly address data bias.

The context does not provide enough information to give a comprehensive answer to the query. However, it can be inferred that techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection might be used to address data bias, but these are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
