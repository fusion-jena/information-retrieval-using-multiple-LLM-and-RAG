Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on oil palm yield prediction using machine and deep learning techniques, and it mentions the use of various agronomic parameters, such as soil composition, climatic conditions, plant age, and farming techniques. However, it does not provide information on the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
