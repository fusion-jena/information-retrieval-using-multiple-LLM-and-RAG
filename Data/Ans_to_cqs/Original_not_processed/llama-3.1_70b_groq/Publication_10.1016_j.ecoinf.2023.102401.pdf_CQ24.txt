Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context appears to focus on the performance of different attention mechanisms and networks, as well as data augmentation techniques. It does not discuss the specific topic of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
