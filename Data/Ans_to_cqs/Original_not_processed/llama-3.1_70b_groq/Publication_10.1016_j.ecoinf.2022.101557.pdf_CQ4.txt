Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The text only mentions that generative methods can be used to create realistic augmentations of the original dataset, but it does not provide further details on the specific techniques used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
