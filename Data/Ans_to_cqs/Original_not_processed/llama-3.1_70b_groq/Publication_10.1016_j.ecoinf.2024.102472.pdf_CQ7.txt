Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that the network was trained using a training phase and validated using validation data, with the lowest error being chosen. This suggests that the data was split into training and validation sets, but the specific criteria used for this split are not mentioned.

In general, common criteria for splitting data into training, test, and validation sets include:

* Random sampling: randomly selecting a portion of the data for each set
* Stratified sampling: splitting the data into subsets based on class labels or other relevant features
* Time-based splitting: splitting the data based on time, such as using historical data for training and more recent data for testing

However, without more information, it is impossible to determine the specific criteria used in this case.
