Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the training and optimization of machine learning models, including gradient boosting and artificial neural networks, for tasks like carbon stock estimation and urban forest classification.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to set a random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results. This is because many deep learning algorithms, including neural networks, rely on random initialization of weights and other parameters. By setting a fixed random seed, researchers can ensure that the same sequence of random numbers is generated, which can help to reproduce the same results.

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the use of random seed values or other strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a more specific answer to this question based on the provided context.
