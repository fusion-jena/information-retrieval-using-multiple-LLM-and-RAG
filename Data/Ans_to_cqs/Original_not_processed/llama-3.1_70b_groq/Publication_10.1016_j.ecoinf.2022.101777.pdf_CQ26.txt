Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a study on water retention measures, land use conversion, and image classification, but it does not discuss data bias or deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. The techniques mentioned in the query, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and Diverse data collection, are common methods used to address data bias in machine learning, but I cannot confirm if they are used in this specific context.
