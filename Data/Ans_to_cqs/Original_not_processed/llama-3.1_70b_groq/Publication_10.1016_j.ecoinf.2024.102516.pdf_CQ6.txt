Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention that the network is trained with the mean scaled absolute error as regression loss, which suggests that some form of normalization or scaling might be involved.

Additionally, the context mentions that only horizontal flipping is used for data augmentation, which implies that the data might not undergo extensive preprocessing steps like cleaning or normalization.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I can only speculate that some form of normalization or scaling might be involved, but the exact preprocessing steps are not explicitly mentioned.

If more information about the preprocessing steps is required, it would be necessary to refer to the original paper or the code used for the experiment.
