Answer:::
The text mentions that the eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model is used, which is a type of deep learning model. However, it does not explicitly state that XGBoost is used in the pipeline. It only mentions that XGBoost has gained popularity due to its ability to identify features and patterns in large image datasets. 

Additionally, the text mentions that a hybrid model is proposed, which integrates a deep learning model-based approach for forest classification. However, it does not specify the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. 

Therefore, based on the provided context, I can only confirm that XGBoost is mentioned as a type of deep learning model, but I do not know if it is the specific model used in the pipeline.
