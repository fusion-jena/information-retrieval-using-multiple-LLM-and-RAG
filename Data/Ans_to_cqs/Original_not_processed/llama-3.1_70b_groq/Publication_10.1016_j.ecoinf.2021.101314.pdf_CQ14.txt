Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It mentions that the method requires manually setting several parameters, and that the user guide provides more details on these parameters. However, it does not discuss the optimization process for these hyperparameters.

It does mention that the parameters were set to specific values in two different runs, with different constraints on the complexity of the queries and the accuracy gain. For example, in the second run, the requirement of accuracy gain was tightened, and a candidate query could only be extended by adding the next variable if the accuracy, as measured by the Jaccard coefficient, increased by at least 0.1. However, this is not an optimization process, but rather a constraint on the model's complexity.

Therefore, I don't know how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, as this information is not provided in the context.
