Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically address techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on research papers related to ecological informatics, agriculture, and environmental sustainability, with some mentions of machine learning and deep learning algorithms.

However, I can provide some general information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, although it is not directly based on the provided context.

Common techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline include:

* Stratified splitting: dividing the data into subsets based on the class labels to ensure that each subset has a similar proportion of samples from each class.
* Oversampling: creating additional copies of the minority class samples to balance the class distribution.
* Undersampling: reducing the number of majority class samples to balance the class distribution.
* Diverse data collection: collecting data from diverse sources to reduce bias and increase representation of underrepresented groups.

Other techniques include data augmentation, feature engineering, and using algorithms that are robust to class imbalance, such as cost-sensitive learning and anomaly detection.

Please note that this answer is not directly based on the provided context, and I would recommend consulting relevant literature on deep learning and data preprocessing for more information on addressing data bias.
