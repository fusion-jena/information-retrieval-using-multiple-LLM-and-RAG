Answer: The criteria used to split the data for model training is to divide the dataset into training sets, which comprise 80% of the data, and a test set representing the remaining 20%. This division is done by random sampling to ensure that both subsets are representative of the overall dataset and minimize the risk of bias. The purpose of this split is to maximize model training while maintaining a sufficient amount of data for robust model validation.
