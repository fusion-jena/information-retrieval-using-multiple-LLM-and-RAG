Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does mention that preprocessing the input instead of relying on data augmentation is a preferred way with significantly better results. It also mentions that the face processing methods can be categorized as “one-to-many augmentation” and “many-to-one normalization”, but this is specific to face recognition and not general preprocessing steps.

Additionally, the context mentions that the images in the training and test sets varied in their poses and other image characteristics, such as contrast and brightness, but it does not provide information on how these variations were handled or if any preprocessing steps were applied to address them.

Therefore, the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model are not mentioned in the provided context.
