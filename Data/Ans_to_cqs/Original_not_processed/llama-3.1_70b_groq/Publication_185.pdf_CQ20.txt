Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of specific hardware resources such as GPUs or TPUs for training the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model was trained in "CPU mode". This suggests that the training was performed using the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer, rather than specialized hardware accelerators like GPUs or TPUs.
