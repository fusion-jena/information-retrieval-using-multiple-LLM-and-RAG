Answer:::
The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned as popular public datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the context suggests that the datasets used are specific to the task of Arctic wildlife monitoring using time-lapse camera images. The datasets are described as being collected from camera traps in Finnmark and Yamal, with approximately 15,000 images of "Bad quality" and 57,000 images of "Good quality" for each location. These images were manually classified and used to train a ResNet-50 model for image quality classification.
