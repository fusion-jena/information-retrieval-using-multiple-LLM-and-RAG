Answer:

The provided context mentions several non-invasive survey methods used for collecting data on wildlife species. These methods include:

1. Camera traps: used for species detection, but identifying sex can be challenging.
2. Acoustic recorders: used for species detection, but no further details are provided on their use.
3. Non-invasive genetic sampling: includes collecting scat, hair, urine, or feathers for DNA analysis. However, this method can be cost-prohibitive, require laboratory analysis, or be limited by DNA quantity and quality.
4. Track collection: used for species and sex identification, as shown in Table 1, which provides sample sizes for training, test, and validation groups for discriminant analysis of species and sex.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of FIT (no further details are provided on what FIT stands for) as a non-invasive survey method that can expand non-invasive survey data beyond just species presence/absence to sex identification.

No information is provided on the use of surveys, sensors, or public datasets in the context.
