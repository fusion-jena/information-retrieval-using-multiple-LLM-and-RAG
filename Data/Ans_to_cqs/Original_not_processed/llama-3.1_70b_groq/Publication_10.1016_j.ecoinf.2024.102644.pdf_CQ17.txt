Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be focused on the use of MaxEnt models for predicting species distribution patterns and trends, particularly in the context of climate change and biodiversity conservation in fragile ecosystems like wetlands.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
