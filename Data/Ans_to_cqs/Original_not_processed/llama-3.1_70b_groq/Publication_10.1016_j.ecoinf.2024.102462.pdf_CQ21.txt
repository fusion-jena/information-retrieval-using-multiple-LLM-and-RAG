Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention the use of confusion matrices to present the classification results for both the training sets (Fig. 6, bottom row) and the observer study (Fig. 5). This suggests that confusion matrices are one of the postprocessing steps used to evaluate the performance of the model.

Additionally, the context mentions the evaluation of the network on an independent data set (the testing data set) after the training process is finished. This implies that some form of metrics calculation is performed to assess the model's performance on the testing data. However, the specific metrics used are not mentioned.

There is no mention of saliency maps as a postprocessing step in the provided context. 

Therefore, based on the available information, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training appear to include the creation of confusion matrices and the calculation of performance metrics, but the specific details of these steps are not provided.
