Answer:::
The provided context mentions several hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. 

The learning rate policy was set to "step", and the initial learning rate was set to 10^-2 for all layers. The learning rate was decreased by a factor of 10 every 69 iterations.

The optimizer used was stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with a momentum of 0.9. 

Additionally, L2 weight decay was applied with a penalty multiplier set to 5 Ã— 10^-4. The dropout ratio was set to 0.5. 

The batch size was set to 69.
