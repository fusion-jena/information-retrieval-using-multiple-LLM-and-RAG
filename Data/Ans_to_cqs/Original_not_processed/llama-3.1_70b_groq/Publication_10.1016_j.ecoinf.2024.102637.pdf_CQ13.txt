Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context only mentions a hyperparameter 位 (lambda) that is used to adjust the balance between the nonlinear factors of the activation function and the identity mapping of A使(x). The value of 位 is expressed as 位 = e/E, where e represents the current number of rounds of training and E represents the total number of rounds of model training.

No other hyperparameters are mentioned in the context. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a complete answer to the query.
