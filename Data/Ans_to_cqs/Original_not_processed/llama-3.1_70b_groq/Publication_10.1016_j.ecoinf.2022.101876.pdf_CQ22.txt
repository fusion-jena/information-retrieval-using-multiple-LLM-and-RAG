Answer:

The performance of the deep learning model, specifically the Microsoft AI for Earth MegaDetector, is evaluated using various metrics. These metrics include:

1. True Positive Rate (TPR) or Recall: This measures the proportion of true positives (correctly detected wildlife images) out of the total actual positives (all wildlife images).

2. False Discovery Rate (FDR): This measures the proportion of false positives (incorrectly detected wildlife images) out of the total predicted positives.

3. False Omission Rate (FOR): This measures the proportion of false negatives (missed wildlife images) out of the total actual negatives.

4. Accuracy (ACC): This measures the proportion of correctly classified images (both true positives and true negatives) out of the total images.

5. Error Rate (ERR): This measures the proportion of incorrectly classified images (both false positives and false negatives) out of the total images.

6. F1 Score: This is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of both.

7. Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC): This measures the correlation between the predicted and actual labels, providing a more comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the MegaDetector model at different confidence thresholds (> 0%, ≥ 25%, ≥ 50%, and ≥ 75%) for detecting wildlife in camera trap images from Arctic Alaska.
