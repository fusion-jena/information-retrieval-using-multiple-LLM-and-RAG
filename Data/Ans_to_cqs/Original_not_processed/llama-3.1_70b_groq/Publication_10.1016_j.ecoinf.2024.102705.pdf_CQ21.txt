Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the training process, evaluation metrics (Average Precision), and the architecture of the proposed model (NLPP network). It does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps taken after training the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
