Answer: I don't know.

The provided context appears to be a collection of academic papers and equations related to environmental science and ecology, but it does not mention deep learning models or their hyperparameters. The context includes equations and variables related to vegetation responses to climate change, land use/cover changes, and gross primary production, but it does not provide any information about deep learning models or their hyperparameters. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to the query.
