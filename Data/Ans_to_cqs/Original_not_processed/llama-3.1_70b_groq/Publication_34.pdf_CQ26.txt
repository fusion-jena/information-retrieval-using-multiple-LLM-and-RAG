Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention a few techniques that can be related to addressing data bias or improving model performance.

One technique mentioned is batch normalization, which can help reduce internal covariate shift and improve model performance. However, it is not explicitly stated as a technique to address data bias.

Another technique mentioned is the use of a stochastic mini-batch selection, which can help regularize the model and prevent it from relying on a single neuron activation. This can be seen as a way to reduce overfitting, but it is not directly related to addressing data bias.

The context also mentions the use of average pooling, which can help reduce the spatial dimensions of the data and improve model performance. However, it is not explicitly stated as a technique to address data bias.

The context does not mention stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection as techniques used to address data bias.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive answer to the query. However, it can be said that batch normalization and stochastic mini-batch selection are used to improve model performance, but it is not clear if they are used to address data bias specifically.
