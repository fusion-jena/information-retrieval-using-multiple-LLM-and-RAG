Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only discusses the model training process, where a deep neural network is used to output a classifier for prediction, and the result output, where the point cloud test set is segmented to obtain the final segmentation results. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed.

The context does mention the use of certain techniques and frameworks, such as PointNet and GRU, but it does not provide information on model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this question.
