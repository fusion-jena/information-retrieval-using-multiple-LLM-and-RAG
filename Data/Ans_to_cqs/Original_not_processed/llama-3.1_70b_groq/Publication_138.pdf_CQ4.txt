Data augmentation techniques are methods used to increase the size of the training dataset, which is used to improve the performance of a machine learning model. These techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline to artificially increase the size of the training dataset, allowing the model can learn from the data and learn to make better of the data. The most common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning are:

1. **Data augmentation by flipping**: This involves flipping the input image horizontally, vertically, or rotating the input data to increase the size of the training dataset. This technique is commonly used in image classification tasks.
