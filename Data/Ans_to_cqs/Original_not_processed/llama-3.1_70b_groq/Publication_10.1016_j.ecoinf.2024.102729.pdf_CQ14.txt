Answer: The text does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the RF model with 25 trees as hyper-parameters achieved the highest accuracy, but it does not provide information on the optimization process. Therefore, I don't know how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.
