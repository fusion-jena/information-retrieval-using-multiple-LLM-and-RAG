Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any information about a pipeline or a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to land cover classification, urban areas, and vegetation, as well as some research papers on topics such as habitat suitability models and urban heat-prone areas. There is no mention of deep learning models or their types (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer). Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
