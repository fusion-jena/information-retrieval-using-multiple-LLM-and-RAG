Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the study involves analyzing audio signals recorded during the OHASISBIO program, specifically at the SWAMS site in the Indian Ocean. The recordings were made using a hydrophone deployed at a depth of 1000 m, with a sampling rate of 240 Hz. This suggests that the raw data collection method used in this study involves the use of underwater acoustic sensors, specifically hydrophones, to record audio signals. Additionally, the context mentions that the study leverages multi-annotation campaigns involving both expert and novice annotators, which implies that human annotation is also a part of the data collection process. However, it does not provide information on other methods such as surveys or public datasets.
