Answer:

The process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model involved three phases. First, the model was evaluated to prevent overfitting. Second, the model was evaluated with a completely new dataset independent from the first and second datasets. Finally, the model was evaluated by field experts. If the model passed these three phases successfully, it could be deployed. 

Additionally, the experimental design of data utilization and data processing phases with their targeted objectives were outlined in Table 3 regarding the APEM's database. The viability of the methodology was ensured in 4 phases. However, the specific details of model serialization and platform selection are not mentioned in the provided context.
