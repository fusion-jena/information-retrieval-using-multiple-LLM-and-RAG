Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are sample-wise mean average precision (mAP), class-wise mean average precision (cmAP), top-1 accuracy, F0.5 score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC). These metrics are used to assess the model's performance in a multi-label classification scenario, where the goal is to classify 984 bird species. The use of both sample-wise and class-wise evaluation metrics provides a balanced measure of the model's performance, as the sample-wise evaluation benefits from the imbalance in the training dataset, while the class-wise evaluation provides a more precise measure of the model's performance for each species.
