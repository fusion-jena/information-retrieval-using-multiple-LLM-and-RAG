Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information given, it can be inferred that the input data consists of two features: Day of Year (DOY) and Growing Degree Days (GDD), which are likely numerical values. The output is a prediction of the BBCH (Biologische Bundesanstalt, Bundessortenamt und CHemische Industrie) value, which is also a numerical value.

The context mentions that the data is standardized and that the output is converted to the BBCH scale through a dictionary. This suggests that the data is likely in a tabular format, such as CSV, but this is not explicitly stated.

Therefore, based on the available information, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is likely a tabular format, such as CSV, containing numerical values. However, this is not explicitly confirmed in the provided context.
