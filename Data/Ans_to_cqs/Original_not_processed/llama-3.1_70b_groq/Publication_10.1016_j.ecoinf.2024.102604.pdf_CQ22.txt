Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model are not explicitly stated as traditional metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. However, the text mentions the use of two indicators to evaluate the effectiveness of each model in correcting the sampling bias: the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and ΔD. The text also mentions ΔAUC, which suggests that the change in AUC is being used as a metric to evaluate the performance of the model.
