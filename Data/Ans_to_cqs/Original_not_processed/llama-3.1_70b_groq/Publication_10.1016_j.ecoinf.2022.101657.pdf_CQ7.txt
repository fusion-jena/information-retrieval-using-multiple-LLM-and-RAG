Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly state the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that the WCS dataset has a recommended data split, which was used for transfer-learning. Additionally, it mentions that the GBIF database was curated to create a subset of 330 videos, which were then split into training (30) and validation (300) sets.

It can be inferred that the data split for the GBIF database was likely done randomly or based on some unknown criteria, as the context does not provide further information. The exact criteria used to split the data are not specified.

It is worth noting that the context does provide information on the evaluation metric used, which is the mean average precision (mAP) score, specifically mAP50. However, this does not provide insight into the data split criteria.
