Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be related to a study on predicting Above Ground Biomass (AGB) using machine learning models, specifically Random Forest (RF) algorithms. It discusses the importance of variable selection, model performance evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning, but does not mention data augmentation techniques.
