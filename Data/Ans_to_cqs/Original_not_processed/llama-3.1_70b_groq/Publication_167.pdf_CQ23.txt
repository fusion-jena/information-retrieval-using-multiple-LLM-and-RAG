Answer:::

To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. 

Firstly, the data was divided into training, validation, and testing sets using a specific ratio of 5.4:0.6:1. This division helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the model is evaluated on unseen data.

Secondly, the 10-fold cross-validation method was used to divide the training and validation set into ten parts. Nine parts were used as the training set, and one part was used as the validation set. This method helps to evaluate the model's performance on different subsets of the data and reduces the risk of overfitting.

Additionally, the input data was normalized using batch normalization, which helps to reduce the differences in the distribution between different batches of training data and between the training set and the test set.

Furthermore, the model was trained using a weighted loss function to address the imbalance in the categorical data. This ensures that the model performs well on categories with small sample sizes.

However, there is no mention of using a diverse dataset or stratified splitting to ensure generalizability. The dataset used is a 40-dimensional data with a large time span and large land area, which may help to increase the diversity of the data, but it is not explicitly stated as a measure to ensure generalizability.
