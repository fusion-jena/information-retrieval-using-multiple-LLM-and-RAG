Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) for modeling and predicting vegetation biomass density, land use/land cover changes, and urban heat island effects. It also mentions the use of a hybrid model combining wavelet analysis and the NARX ANN algorithm, but it does not provide information on regularization methods.

However, it does mention that "excessive neurons may lead to over fitting and compromise the network's performance" in the context of determining the optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer. This suggests that the authors are aware of the issue of overfitting, but they do not discuss specific regularization methods used to prevent it.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
