Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. It mentions that the analysis uses artificial neural networks (ANNs), particularly multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), but it does not provide information on the frameworks used to implement these models. The context does mention Python as a programming language, citing the "9th Python in Science Conference" and the "Statsmodels" library, but it does not provide enough information to determine the specific deep learning framework used.
