Answer:::

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, specifically the Res_AUNet network, are as follows:

* Batch size: 8
* Number of epochs: 120
* Initial learning rate: 0.001
* Learning rate adjustment strategy: StepLR (equal-interval adjustment), which halves the original rate every 10 epochs of iteration.

Additionally, the network was trained with random rotations, flips, and other image augmentation operations to enhance its robustness.

It is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context what optimizer was used in the model. However, it is mentioned that the PyTorch library was used to construct the Res_AUNet network, which suggests that one of the optimizers available in PyTorch was likely used, but the specific optimizer is not specified.
