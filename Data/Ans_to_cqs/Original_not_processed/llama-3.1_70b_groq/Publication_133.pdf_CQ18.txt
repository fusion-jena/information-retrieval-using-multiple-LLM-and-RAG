Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of validation data. The validation data are set aside while training and their annotations by the model are monitored. This helps to limit the training duration and reduce the risk of overfitting. Additionally, the model's average precision (AP) is tracked over the training epochs, and the mean AP (mAP) over the three insect classes is plotted to provide a different perspective on the model's performance. The validation loss is also monitored, and in this case, it stabilizes after 30 epochs, suggesting that further training might lead to overfitting.
