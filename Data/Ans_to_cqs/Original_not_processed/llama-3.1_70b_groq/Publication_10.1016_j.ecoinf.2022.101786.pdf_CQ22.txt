Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are precision and recall. According to the text, "The number of iterations for which the CNN was trained has a strong influence on its performances as well as on the confidence it gives to its predictions... In general, longer model training past 1000 iterations tended to give higher recall but lower precision." This suggests that both precision and recall are being used to evaluate the model's performance. However, accuracy is not mentioned as a metric used for evaluation.
