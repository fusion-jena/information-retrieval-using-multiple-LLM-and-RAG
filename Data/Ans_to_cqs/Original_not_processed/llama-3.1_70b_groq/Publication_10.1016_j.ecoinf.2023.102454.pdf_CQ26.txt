Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a research paper on carbon emission estimation, and it discusses data sources, methodology, and data preprocessing steps such as converting the coordinate system of nighttime light images and extracting images of the target area. However, it does not mention any techniques for addressing data bias in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
