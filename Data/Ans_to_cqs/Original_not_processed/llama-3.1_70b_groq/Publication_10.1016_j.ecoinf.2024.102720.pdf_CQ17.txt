Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context mentions deep learning algorithms and models, but it does not provide specific details about the regularization methods used.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions the use of deep learning models in various studies, such as Ren et al. (2021) and Wu (2022), but it does not provide information about the specific regularization methods used in these studies.

Therefore, I do not know the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
