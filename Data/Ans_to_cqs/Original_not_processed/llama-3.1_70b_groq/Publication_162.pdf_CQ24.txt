Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning for fauna and flora recognition, the authors' backgrounds, and some specific research papers and techniques.

However, it does mention the use of additional images obtained from internet image search engines to augment the training dataset, which can introduce noise and require filtering different types of label noise. This suggests that the authors are aware of the potential for variability and noise in the data, but it does not specifically address randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this question based on the provided context.
