Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context appears to be related to a study on fuel load estimation and semantic segmentation using deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search.

Therefore, I don't know how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized in this specific study.
