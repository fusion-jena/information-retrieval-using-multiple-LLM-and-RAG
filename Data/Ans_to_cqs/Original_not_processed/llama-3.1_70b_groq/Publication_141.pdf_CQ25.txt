Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. The model is designed to classify images of chironomid taxa into different categories. The model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, specifically a ResNet-50 network, to extract features from the images and then uses a fully connected layer to classify the images into different taxonomic categories. The model outputs a probability distribution over the different classes, indicating the likelihood of each class given the input image.
