Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the model architectures, training parameters, and evaluation metrics used for image reconstruction and classification tasks. It mentions data augmentation techniques such as height and width shift, flipping, zooming, and brightness changes, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques.
