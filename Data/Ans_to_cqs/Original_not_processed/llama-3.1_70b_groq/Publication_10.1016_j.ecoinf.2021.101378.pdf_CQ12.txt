Answer: None of the mentioned models (CNN, RNN, Transformer) are used in the pipeline. The text mentions the use of machine learning methods such as random forest (RF) and maximum entropy modeling (Maxent) for predicting the potential occurrence of pine wilt disease. It also mentions the use of an ensemble model that integrates the RF and Maxent models. However, it does not mention the use of deep learning models like CNN, RNN, or Transformer.
