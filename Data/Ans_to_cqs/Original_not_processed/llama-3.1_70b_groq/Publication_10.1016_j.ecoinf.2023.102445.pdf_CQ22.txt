Answer:

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are:

1. Average Precision (AP): calculated using the formula ∫[0,1] P(r)dr, where P(r) is the precision at recall r.
2. Mean Average Precision (mAP): calculated using the formula mAP = ∑Nk=1APk / N, where APk is the average precision for class k and N is the number of classes.
3. Precision (P): calculated using the formula P = TP / (TP + FP), where TP is the number of true positives and FP is the number of false positives.
4. Recall (R): calculated using the formula R = TP / (TP + FN), where TP is the number of true positives and FN is the number of false negatives.
5. Time: calculated by summing the runtimes for the preprocessing, network inference, and post-processing stages.
6. Model size: measured in megabytes (MB).
7. Average accuracy: measured as a percentage (%).
8. mAP@0.5: mean average precision at an IoU threshold of 0.5.
9. mAP50-95: mean average precision across all classes at different IoU thresholds, spanning from 0.5 to 0.95 in increments of 0.05.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the YOLO_MRC model and compare it with other state-of-the-art models, such as YOLOv5, YOLOv6, YOLOv7, and YOLOv8.
