Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the training and evaluation of the models, including the use of transfer learning, multitask learning, and the comparison of different models. It also discusses the training process, including the choice of optimizer and hyperparameters, but it does not provide information on the deployment process.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
