Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or where it is hosted (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket). The context appears to be a collection of academic papers and research articles related to ecology, conservation biology, and environmental science, but it does not include any information about a specific code repository.

Therefore, I must answer that I don't know where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
