Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the Support Vector Regression (SVR) method, its formulation, and its application in machine learning. It also mentions some studies and papers related to machine learning, but it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, as this information is not provided in the given context.
