Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on research related to El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), climate modeling, and land cover/land use classification using deep neural networks. It does not provide information on the datasets used in a general deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
