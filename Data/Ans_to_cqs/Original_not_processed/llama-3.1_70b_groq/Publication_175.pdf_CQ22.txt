Answer: 

The provided context mentions that the performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the metric of "mean accuracy" (i.e., percentage of correct classification). The standard deviation (SD) of the accuracy is also reported. Specifically, the deep ResNet model trained on the large AT0 dataset achieved a mean accuracy of 78.00% with a standard deviation of 15.16%. 

However, it does not mention the use of other metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, etc. to evaluate the performance of the model. Therefore, based on the provided context, the only metric mentioned for evaluating the performance of the deep learning model is accuracy.
