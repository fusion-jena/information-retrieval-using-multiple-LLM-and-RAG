Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a monitoring program for the dive community, species identification, and data collection, but it does not mention deep learning or data augmentation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know what data augmentation techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline, as this information is not present in the provided context.
