Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the ICSNet model, including the number of layers, inception modules, and activation functions used. It also provides the results of experiments comparing the performance of ICSNet with other models, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC. However, it does not provide information on the hyperparameters used during training.
