Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. The context appears to be focused on the application of machine learning and remote sensing techniques for tasks such as tree species classification, biomass estimation, and digital terrain model creation, but it does not provide details on the specific hyperparameters used in the models.
