Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on various research papers, tools, and methods related to deep learning, event-stream processing, and machine learning. However, it does not delve into the specifics of optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

Although the context mentions deep learning frameworks such as Theano, Torch, Caffe, TensorFlow, and deeplearning4j, it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used in these frameworks.

Some of the papers mentioned in the context, such as "Deep Learning" by LeCun et al. (2015), may discuss optimization techniques, but this information is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
