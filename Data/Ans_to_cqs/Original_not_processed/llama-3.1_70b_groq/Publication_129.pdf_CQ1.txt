Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention a few datasets and studies related to agricultural pest recognition and water pollution analysis.

For example, reference [19] mentions the "IP102: A Large-Scale Benchmark Dataset for Insect Pest Recognition" which was presented at the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2019. This suggests that public datasets may be one source of raw data for deep learning pipelines in agricultural pest recognition.

Additionally, reference [18] mentions a study on "smart near-infrared analysis of water pollution for agricultural irrigation resources" which may involve the use of sensors to collect data.

However, the context does not provide information on the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, such as surveys or other data collection methods. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive answer to this question based on the provided context.
