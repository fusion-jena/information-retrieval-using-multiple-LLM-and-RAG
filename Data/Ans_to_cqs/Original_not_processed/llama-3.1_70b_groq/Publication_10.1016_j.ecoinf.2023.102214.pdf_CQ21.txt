Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the model training process, detection algorithm, and evaluation metrics (top-k accuracy). It also discusses overfitting and the declaration of competing interests, data availability, and acknowledgments.

However, it does mention that the model outputs and error outcomes were inspected for signs of overfitting, which suggests that some form of evaluation or analysis was performed after training. Additionally, the context mentions that the top-k accuracy was computed on a test set, which implies that some metrics calculation was performed. Nevertheless, the specific details of the postprocessing steps are not provided.

Therefore, I can only provide a partial answer, and I do not have enough information to fully address the query.
