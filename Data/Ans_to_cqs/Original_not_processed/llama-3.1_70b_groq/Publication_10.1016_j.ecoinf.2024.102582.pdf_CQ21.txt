Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the post-processing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. However, it does mention that post-classification processing was applied to the images. 

According to the context, a manual visual interpretation approach was used to correct the image classification results for mangroves within a 10-km buffer zone extending inland from the coastline. This procedure effectively corrected misclassifications between forest and mangroves resulting from “spectral confusion”. 

Additionally, the context provides information on the calculation of user's accuracy, total accuracy, and Kappa coefficient for each year, which suggests that some metrics calculation was performed. However, it does not provide further details on the specific post-processing steps involved.
