Answer:::

The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a combination of methods. For the Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Decision Tree (DT), and Random Forest (RF) models, a grid search is applied to determine the optimal hyperparameters. This involves testing a predefined set of hyperparameter values to find the combination that results in the best performance.

In addition to grid search, the proposed model also utilizes the Tree Parzen Estimator (TPE) method in the Hyperopt package for parameter finding and optimization. This method is used to obtain the optimal model hyperparameters in a distributed asynchronous manner.

It's worth noting that the specific hyperparameters that are optimized vary depending on the model. For example, in SVR, the degree, kernel, epsilon, and gamma are adjusted to reach the highest accuracy, while in RF, the max_depth, max_features, min_samples_split, and n_estimators are tuned.
