Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. However, it does mention that the average of Overall Accuracy (OA) and F1-score were computed over ten runs, each run with a different choice of training samples for the class "no deforestation". This suggests that the authors may have used some form of randomization or sampling to evaluate the robustness of their models, but the specific strategies used to handle randomness are not mentioned.

It is also worth noting that the context does not provide information on the use of random seed values, which is a common strategy used to ensure reproducibility in deep learning experiments. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a more detailed answer to this question.
