Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model. The text discusses the training process, model architecture, and comparison with a random forest model, but it does not provide information on data preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, I do not know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this case.
