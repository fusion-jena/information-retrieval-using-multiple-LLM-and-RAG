Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention data augmentation techniques or a deep learning pipeline. It appears to be discussing species distribution modeling (SDM) and model evaluation in the context of biodiversity datasets. The text mentions techniques such as factor interactions, convolutional neural networks, and joint species distribution models (jSDM), but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, or scaling.
