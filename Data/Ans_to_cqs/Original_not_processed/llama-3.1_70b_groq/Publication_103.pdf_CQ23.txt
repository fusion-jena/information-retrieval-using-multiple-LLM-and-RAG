Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as cross-validation or stratified splitting. However, it does mention the use of a diverse dataset and transfer learning across different datasets.

The context mentions that the model was trained on a big available dataset (dataset A) and then fine-tuned on a scarcer domain-specific dataset (dataset B). This suggests that the model was trained on a diverse dataset, which can help improve its generalizability.

Additionally, the context mentions experiments on transfer learning across herbarium data from different regions and transfer learning from herbarium data to non-dried plant images. This suggests that the model was tested on different datasets, which can help evaluate its generalizability.

However, the context does not provide information on cross-validation or stratified splitting, which are common techniques used to ensure the generalizability of machine learning models. Therefore, it is unclear whether these techniques were used in this study.
