Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that bounding box annotation is used, as the text mentions "the coordinate of the bounding box of each tentative annotation" in the context of model evaluation. 

Additionally, the text mentions that a true positive is considered if the centre of the automatic annotation falls within a 30 pixel distance from a manual annotation centre in the same image, which suggests that the annotations are in the form of bounding boxes around objects of interest.

There is no mention of instance segmentation in the provided context. Instance segmentation is a more complex annotation technique that involves segmenting individual objects within an image, whereas bounding box annotation involves drawing a box around the object.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be concluded that bounding box annotation is used in the deep learning pipeline, but the use of instance segmentation is not mentioned.
