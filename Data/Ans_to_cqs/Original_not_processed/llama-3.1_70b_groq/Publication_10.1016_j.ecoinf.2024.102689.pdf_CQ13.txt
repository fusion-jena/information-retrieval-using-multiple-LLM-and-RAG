Answer:

According to the provided context, the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows:

* Learning rate: The initial learning rate is set at 0.001, and the minimum learning rate is 0.0001.
* Optimizer: The Adam optimizer is used with a Momentum of 0.9.
* Batch size: The batch size is 16.
* Number of epochs: The training spans 300 epochs.

These hyperparameters are used in conjunction with Pytorch version 1.8.0 and CUDA version 11.4 on a GPU.
