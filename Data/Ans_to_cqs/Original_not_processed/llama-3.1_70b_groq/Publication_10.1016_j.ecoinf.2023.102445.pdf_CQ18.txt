Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention the evaluation indices used to assess the model's performance, such as average accuracy for all classes at an IoU threshold of 0.5, mAP50-95, and time metric. These metrics are likely used to evaluate the model's performance after training, but the context does not provide information on how the model's performance is monitored during training.
