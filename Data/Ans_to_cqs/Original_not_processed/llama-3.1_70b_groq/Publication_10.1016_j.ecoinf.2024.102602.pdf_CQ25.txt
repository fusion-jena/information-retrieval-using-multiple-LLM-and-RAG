Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is classification. Specifically, the model is designed to classify images into two categories: "With Cortaderia selloana" and "Without Cortaderia selloana". The model is trained to predict the presence or absence of Cortaderia selloana in the images. The study also mentions object detection, but it is not the primary purpose of the model. The object detection model Faster R-CNN ResNet50 is mentioned as a separate model, but it is not the main focus of the study. The classification task is the primary objective, and the study evaluates the performance of different convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on this task.
