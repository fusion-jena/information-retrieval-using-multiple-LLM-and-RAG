Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is to predict the Mn (Manganese) content based on the spectral reflectance data. The model is designed to learn the nonlinear relationship between the input spectral reflectance data and the output Mn content. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as correlation coefficient (R), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R2). The model is optimized using a grid search method to maximize the R value on the validation set. The optimal model architecture and parameters are determined through a two-stage optimization process, which involves adjusting the neural network structure, number of neurons, dropout rate, learning rate, and batch size. The final model consists of multiple layers, including input, dense, batch normalization, dropout, and output layers. The model's output is a one-dimensional value representing the predicted Mn content.
