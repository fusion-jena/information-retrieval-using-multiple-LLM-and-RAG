Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the active learning approach, model development pipeline, and evaluation of the model. It discusses the use of a grid search technique to tune hyperparameters, the application of an active learning approach to iteratively train and improve the CNN model, and the challenges associated with active learning in bioacoustic deep learning. However, it does not provide information on model deployment, such as model serialization or platform selection.
