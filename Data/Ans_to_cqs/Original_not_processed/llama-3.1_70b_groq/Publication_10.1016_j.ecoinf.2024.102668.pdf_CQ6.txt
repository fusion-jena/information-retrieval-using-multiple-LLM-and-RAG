Answer:::

According to the provided context, the proposed preprocessing approach involves three steps, but only one of them is explicitly mentioned, which is:

1. Normalization of the signal amplitude (Step-3).

This step is mentioned as a way to tackle the differences in gain among recording devices, which can be caused by factors such as manufacturing materials and degradation.

The other two steps are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, so I don't know what they are. However, it is common in deep learning pipelines to include additional preprocessing steps such as:

* Cleaning: removing noise, outliers, or irrelevant data from the dataset
* Scaling: scaling the data to a common range to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model

However, I don't have enough information to confirm if these steps are part of the proposed preprocessing approach.
