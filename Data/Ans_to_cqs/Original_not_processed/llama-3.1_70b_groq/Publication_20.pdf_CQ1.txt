Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of "baited video stations" and "diver video transects" in the context of a study on fish assemblages (Langlois et al., 2010). This suggests that underwater video footage may be one method used for collecting raw data.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of "thumbnails of whole fish, part of fish species and environment" as input data for the deep learning model. This implies that the raw data may be in the form of images or videos of fish and their environments, which could be collected through various methods such as underwater cameras, surveys, or public datasets.

However, without more information, it is difficult to provide a comprehensive answer to this question. The context does not provide enough details on the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
