Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. It only mentions that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used for LULC classification and that they can automatically extract sophisticated features from satellite imagery. However, it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used to train the CNNs.
