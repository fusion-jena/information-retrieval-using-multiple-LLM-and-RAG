Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. The text appears to be discussing a workflow for estimating fishing pressure on stocks and other species, using data from various sources such as the Global Fishing Watch (GFW) and the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS). It mentions the use of a machine learning model for classifying vessel data, but does not provide information on the hardware resources used for training the model.
