Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on marine science, data management, and ecological informatics, with a emphasis on data repositories, metadata, and sample management. It does not provide information on deep learning models or preprocessing steps.

However, I can suggest that typical preprocessing steps for deep learning models may include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and feature engineering, but this is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

If you're looking for information on preprocessing steps for deep learning models, I recommend consulting a relevant source or documentation on deep learning, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch documentation, or research papers on deep learning.
