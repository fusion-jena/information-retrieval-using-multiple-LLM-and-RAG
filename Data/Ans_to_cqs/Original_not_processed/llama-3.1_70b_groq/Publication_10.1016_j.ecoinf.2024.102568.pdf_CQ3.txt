Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the configuration and training of an LSTM model for air quality prediction, including the use of a MinMaxScaler for preprocessing and a dropout layer for regularization. It also mentions the comparison of LSTM with other RNN architectures and the selection of the temporal window size. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
