Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and training of the DR-ACGAN model, particularly the generator structure and attention mechanisms. It does not discuss methods for managing randomness or setting random seed values. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
