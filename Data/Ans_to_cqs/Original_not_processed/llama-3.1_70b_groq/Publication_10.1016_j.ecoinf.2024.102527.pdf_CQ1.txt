Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the datasets used in the study, which are ImageNet, Snapshot Serengeti (SS), and Lasha Mountain (LSM). 

It is mentioned that the ImageNet dataset is a benchmark dataset in the field of computer vision, where each image is manually annotated. The Snapshot Serengeti (SS) and Lasha Mountain (LSM) datasets are camera trap image datasets, where images are captured by camera traps triggered by animals. The context also mentions that the camera traps capture multiple images in succession, called a capture event, which frequently comprises three images.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Manual annotation of images (for ImageNet dataset)
2. Camera traps (for Snapshot Serengeti and Lasha Mountain datasets)

However, it is not clear if other methods such as surveys or sensors are used for collecting raw data.
