Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. The text mentions that the model is a "deep-learning classifier" and that it is used for classification tasks, such as evaluating the classification results against the test sample and reporting error matrices, summary accuracy measures, and class accuracies. Additionally, the text compares the performance of the deep learning model with a random forest classifier, which further supports the idea that the primary purpose of the model is classification.
