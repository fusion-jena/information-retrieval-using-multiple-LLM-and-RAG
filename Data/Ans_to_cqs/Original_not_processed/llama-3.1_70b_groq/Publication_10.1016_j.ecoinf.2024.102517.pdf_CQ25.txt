Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is noise reduction, specifically bird sound noise reduction. The model is designed to remove noise from bird sound signals, and its performance is compared to other noise reduction algorithms such as SEGAN, WebRTC, wavelet transform, Wiener filter, and MMSE STSA. The model uses a deep feature loss-based approach, which involves training a network to minimize the difference between the features of the clean bird sound signal and the processed signal. The ultimate goal of the model is to enhance the quality of bird sound signals, which can be useful for applications such as bird species classification, ecological monitoring, and conservation.
