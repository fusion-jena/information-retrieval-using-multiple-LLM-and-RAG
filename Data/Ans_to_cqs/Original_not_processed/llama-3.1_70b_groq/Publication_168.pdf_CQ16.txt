Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. It only mentions that the stochastic gradient descent algorithm is used to optimize model weights, and the cross-entropy is selected as the cost function. However, it does not provide information on the stopping criteria or convergence conditions for the training process.
