Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification. Specifically, the models (ResNet-50, Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST), and HuBERT) are designed to classify audio segments into two categories: possum vocalisations and noise sources. The models are trained on a dataset of 5-second audio segments and evaluated on their ability to accurately classify new, unseen segments. The classification task is a key component of the computational bioacoustics field, which aims to analyze and understand the sounds produced by living organisms. In this case, the classification model is used to identify possum vocalisations, which is an important task in ecological monitoring and conservation efforts.
