Answer: I don't know. The provided context does not mention the specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. It mentions various biodiversity databases such as GBIF, OBIS, INaturalist, and AquaMaps, which were used to obtain presence records for model validation, but it does not provide information on the repository for the deep learning pipeline itself.
