Answer:::

The provided context does not specifically mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the study employed two common variable elimination techniques for random forests: Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Variable Selection Using Random Forests (VSURF). These techniques are used to prevent overfitting and improve model performance, but they are not specifically related to deep learning pipelines.

The context also mentions that the study used a mask to delineate the "area of applicability" for the trained model, which helps to filter out regions lacking training data and prevent performance degradation. However, this is not a regularization method used in a deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization.
