Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. Specifically, the model is designed to identify medicinal plants from similar poisonous plants. The model uses attention mechanisms to focus on relevant input elements and enhance its performance. The evaluation criteria used to assess the model's performance include accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1-score, which are commonly used metrics for classification tasks. The model is compared to other state-of-the-art models, such as VGG-11, VGG-19, Alex Net, GoogleNet, and Squeeze Net, and is found to have promising performance, achieving high accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1-score values.
