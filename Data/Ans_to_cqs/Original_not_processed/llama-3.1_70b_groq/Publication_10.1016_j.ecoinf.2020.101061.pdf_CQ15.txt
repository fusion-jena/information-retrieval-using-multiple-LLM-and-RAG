Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The text only mentions that the network was retrained using hand-annotated data for 40 epochs, but it does not provide details on the optimization algorithm used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
