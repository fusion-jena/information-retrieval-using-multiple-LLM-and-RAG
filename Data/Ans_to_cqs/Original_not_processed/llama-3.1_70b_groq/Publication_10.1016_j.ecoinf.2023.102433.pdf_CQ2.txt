Answer: The provided context does not specifically mention the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the NASA MODIS/VIIRS Land Products web service allows users to choose between text/csv (i.e., comma-separated values) or application/json format for downloading raster images. This suggests that CSV and JSON are two possible data formats that might be used in certain remote sensing applications, but it is not explicitly stated that they are used in a deep learning pipeline.
