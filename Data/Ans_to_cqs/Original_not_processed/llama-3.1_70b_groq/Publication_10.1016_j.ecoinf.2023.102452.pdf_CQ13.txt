Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate and optimizer. The context appears to be a collection of references and snippets from various papers and studies related to machine learning, signal processing, and water resources modeling. While some of the references may discuss deep learning models, they do not provide specific details on the hyperparameters used.

However, one of the references (Dehghani et al., 2023) mentions the use of LSTM, CNN, and ConvLSTM models for hourly short-term streamflow forecasting, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameters used in these models.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
