Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. It mentions that the YOLOv5 family of models are open-sourced and built on the PyTorch machine learning framework, but it does not provide information on where the code repository is hosted (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket).
