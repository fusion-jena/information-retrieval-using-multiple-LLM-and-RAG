Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the hyperparameter tuning process using randomized grid search methods and the selection of optimal hyperparameters for different machine learning models. It does not provide information on the postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

However, it does mention that the performance of the models was evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2). But it does not provide further details on how these metrics were calculated or if any other postprocessing steps were involved.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
