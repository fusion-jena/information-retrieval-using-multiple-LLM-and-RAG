Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be focused on metadata standards for image and data curation, as well as documentation and references for ecological monitoring and research. It does not delve into the specifics of deep learning pipelines or optimization techniques.

However, it does mention a research paper titled "Camera orientation to subject in satellite and aerial images with deep learning" (Sci. Rep. 9, 14259), which suggests that deep learning is being applied in the context of image analysis. Nevertheless, the context does not provide information on the specific optimization techniques used in this pipeline.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
