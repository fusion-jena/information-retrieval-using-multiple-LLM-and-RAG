Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. It discusses the performance of different deep learning architectures, including ResNet50, Inception, and VGG, and the evaluation metrics used to assess their performance. However, it does not provide information on the specific hyperparameters used in the model.
