Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, it does mention the evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance. 

The context mentions that the Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) and the Continuous Boyce Index (CBI) were used to evaluate the model's performance. The AUC-ROC value is reported to be 95.5%, and the average CBI index for the validation dataset is 82.6%. 

Additionally, the context mentions the use of the Akaike minimum information criterion (AICc) to determine the best tuning parameters for the model. The delta.AICc value is used to compare different models, and a model with delta.AICc < 2 is considered credible.

There is no mention of saliency maps or confusion matrices in the provided context. Therefore, I do not know if these postprocessing steps were involved in the analysis.
