Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the model architecture, training and prediction run-time, data augmentation, and dataset preparation. 

However, it does mention the calculation of model accuracy over plain data and encrypted data, as shown in Figures 7 and 8. This suggests that some form of metrics calculation is performed to evaluate the model's performance. 

Additionally, the context mentions the division of the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets, which is a common practice in machine learning. This implies that some form of evaluation or metrics calculation might be performed on the testing set, but the specific details are not provided.

As for saliency maps and confusion matrices, there is no mention of these in the provided context. Therefore, it is unclear whether these postprocessing steps are involved in the model training process.
