Answer:::

The methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, as mentioned in the provided context, include:

1. Surveys: The Indicator Bats Programme (iBats) used citizen scientists to conduct surveys along road-transects, collecting acoustic data between 2005-2011.
2. Sensors: Acoustic devices, specifically the Tranquility Transect, were used to record ultra-sonic acoustic data. These devices were set to record using a time-expansion factor of 10, a sampling time of 320ms, and sensitivity set on maximum.
3. Public datasets: Although not explicitly mentioned in the context, the references provided suggest the use of public datasets, such as those used in environmental sound classification and acoustic modeling in speech recognition.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of citizen science, where data is collected by non-experts, often through crowdsourcing or public participation. This approach can provide large quantities of data, but also raises concerns about data quality, as mentioned in reference 61.

It is worth noting that the context does not provide an exhaustive list of methods used for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines. Other methods, such as web scraping, data crawling, or purchasing datasets from third-party providers, are not mentioned.
