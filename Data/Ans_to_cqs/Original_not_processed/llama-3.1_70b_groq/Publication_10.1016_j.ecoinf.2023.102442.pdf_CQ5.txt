Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing and geospatial analysis, with a focus on detecting artisanal small-scale mining and land use/land cover classification using satellite imagery.

The context mentions the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) as a cloud processing platform for accessing and processing satellite imagery and geospatial datasets. It also mentions the use of Sentinel-2 multispectral data for detecting artisanal small-scale mining in Ghana. However, it does not provide information on the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
