Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses the use of artificial neural networks, specifically the NARX model, and a hybrid model combining wavelet analysis and the NARX ANN algorithm, but it does not provide information on the hardware resources used for training the model.
