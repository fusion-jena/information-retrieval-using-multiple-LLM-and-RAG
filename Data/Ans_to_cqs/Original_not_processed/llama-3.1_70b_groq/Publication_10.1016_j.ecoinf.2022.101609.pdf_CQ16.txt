Answer:::
The text does not explicitly state the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention that the validation loss took a slightly different pattern and dropped significantly after 2500 epochs but became steady for the remaining training epochs. This suggests that the training process may have been stopped when the validation loss stopped improving, but this is not explicitly stated. Additionally, the text mentions that the training loss gradually decreased as the number of epochs increased, but it does not provide a specific criteria for stopping the training process.
