Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is to use a validation set. For each training stage, an unbiased validation set is constructed, comprising 20% of the current dataset's images. This set is carefully designed to maintain a similar distribution of species and to ensure independence by keeping images from the same transect grouped together. This approach helps to avoid any performance bias related to the natural imbalance of species and any spatial bias related to the overlap of images. Additionally, the model's performance is evaluated on the validation set at each epoch, and the model relative to the epoch that gave the best performance on the validation set is selected to avoid overfitting.
