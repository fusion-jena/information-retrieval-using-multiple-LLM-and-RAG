Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context discusses the use of the HRNet model for semantic segmentation and the LSTM-CNN model for sentiment analysis, but it does not provide information on how these models were deployed.

The context mentions the use of PyCharm software for modeling social media image data and graphics processing software for proofreading, but it does not provide details on the deployment process. Additionally, the context mentions the use of Matlab for calculating certain indicators, but it does not provide information on how the trained models were deployed.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
