Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on fine-tuning a pre-trained CNN backbone for clustering tasks, but it does not discuss regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
