Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing and photogrammetry applications, with papers discussing the use of various datasets related to aerial imagery, LiDAR data, and SAR imagery for tasks such as wetlands classification, tree canopy segmentation, and mangrove crown diameter measurement.

The papers mentioned in the context use various datasets, including:

* Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) imagery for wetlands classification
* Airborne LiDAR data for mangrove crown diameter measurement
* Terrestrial LiDAR data for individual maize segmentation
* Aerial imagery for tree canopy segmentation in urban areas
* Polarimetric SAR imagery for semantic segmentation of complex land cover ecosystems

However, none of these datasets are among the commonly used deep learning datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
