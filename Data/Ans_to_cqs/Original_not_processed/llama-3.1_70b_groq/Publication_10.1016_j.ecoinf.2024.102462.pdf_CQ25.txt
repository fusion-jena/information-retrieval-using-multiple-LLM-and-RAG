Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is image classification. According to the text, "Image classification using deep learning" is a specific section that describes the methodology used to integrate DL models into the study. The text also mentions that the goal is to provide results that indicate how useful the trained networks would be in practical ecological applications, suggesting that the classification task is related to ecological applications, such as species classification.
