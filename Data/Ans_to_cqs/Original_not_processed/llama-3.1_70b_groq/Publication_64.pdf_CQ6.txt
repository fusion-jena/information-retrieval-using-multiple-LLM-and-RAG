Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization or scaling. However, it does mention that during training, standard data augmentation techniques are applied, including shear, translation, and mirroring. Additionally, the images are downscaled to the ResNet standard 224x224 input size. 

It is also mentioned that rotation or upside-down mirroring is not applied to images tagged as 'habit', as it does not make sense to have a tree or a landscape upside down. This suggests that some domain-specific preprocessing or data augmentation techniques are used, but the exact steps involved are not clearly specified.

Furthermore, the context mentions that the weights of the model are initialized with the pre-trained weights on the ImageNet dataset, which may involve some form of normalization or scaling, but this is not explicitly stated.

Therefore, while some data augmentation techniques are mentioned, the exact preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model are not fully specified in the provided context.
