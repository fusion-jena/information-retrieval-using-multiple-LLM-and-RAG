Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context primarily focuses on the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning models for processing wildlife camera trap images, and the evaluation of a specific model called MegaDetector. It mentions that MegaDetector has been trained using hundreds of thousands of images labeled by manual human review from a wide variety of ecosystems, but it does not provide information on the specific datasets used. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
