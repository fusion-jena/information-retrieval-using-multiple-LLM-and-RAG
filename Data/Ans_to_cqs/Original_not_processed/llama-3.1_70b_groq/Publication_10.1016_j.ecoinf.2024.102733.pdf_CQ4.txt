Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The text only discusses the exploration of various hyperparameters for training an autoencoder and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), including learning rates, batch sizes, weight decay, and dropout. It also mentions the use of Cross-Entropy and Focal Loss as loss functions, but does not provide any information on data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling.
