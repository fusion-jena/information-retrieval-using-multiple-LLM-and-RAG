Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be a collection of references and a snippet of a research paper discussing various topics, including underwater object classification, bird surveys, human activity detection, and aerial survey count data.

However, one of the references, Çalıs¸kan (2023), mentions the use of deep learning models for detecting human activity types from 3D posture data. While this reference does not explicitly mention data augmentation techniques, it is possible that data augmentation was used in the deep learning pipeline. Unfortunately, without more information, we cannot determine the specific data augmentation techniques applied.

Therefore, I must conclude that I don't know the answer to the query based on the provided context.
