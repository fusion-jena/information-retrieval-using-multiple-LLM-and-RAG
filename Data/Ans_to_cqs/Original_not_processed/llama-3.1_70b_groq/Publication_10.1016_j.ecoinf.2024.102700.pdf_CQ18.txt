Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention that some studies used internal validation strategies (n = 22) or external validation methods (n = 17) to measure model performance. Additionally, it notes that a considerable number of studies did not use an explicit validation method to measure model performance or did not clearly state this in the text (n = 94, 32%). 

It can be inferred that the strategies used to monitor model performance during training may include internal validation methods, such as cross-validation, and external validation methods, such as testing on a separate dataset. However, the specific strategies used are not explicitly stated in the provided context.
