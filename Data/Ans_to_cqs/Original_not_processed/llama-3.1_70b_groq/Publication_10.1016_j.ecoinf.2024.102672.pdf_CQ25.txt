Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the Artificial Neural Network (ANN), is classification. According to the text, "A classification model was designed in order to detect if there existed [stratification or not]". This suggests that the ANN is being used to classify the existence or non-existence of stratification in a reservoir, which is a binary classification problem.
