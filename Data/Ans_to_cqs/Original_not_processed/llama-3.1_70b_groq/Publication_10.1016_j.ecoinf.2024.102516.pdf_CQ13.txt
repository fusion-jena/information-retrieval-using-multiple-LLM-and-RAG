Answer: The text mentions the following hyperparameters used in the deep learning model:

* Batch size: 1
* Input image resolution: 1536 Ã— 768 pixels
* Learning rate: 10^-5
* Data augmentation: only horizontal flipping
* Loss function: mean scaled absolute error as regression loss

Additionally, the text mentions that the network is trained using a pre-training approach, where the network is first trained on a larger dataset (ImageNet) and then fine-tuned on the target task (plant cover estimation). However, the optimizer used is not explicitly mentioned in the text.
