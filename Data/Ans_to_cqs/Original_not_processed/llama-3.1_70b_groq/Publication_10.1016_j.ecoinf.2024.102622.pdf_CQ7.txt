Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be focused on crop classification, chlorophyll content estimation, and the use of machine learning models such as random forest, support vector machine, and multilayer perceptron. It does mention the use of training data and validation sets, but it does not provide information on how the data was split for these purposes. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
