Answer: The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model include the optimizer, learning rate, and dropout layer. Specifically, the optimizers used were RMSProp, Adam, and SGD, and the learning rates used were 0.001 and 0.01. The model was also trained with and without a dropout layer. Additionally, the model was trained using epochs and batch sizes of 10 and 32, respectively.
