Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be related to the evaluation of different software programs for bird song recognition and the analysis of their performance on a target dataset. However, it does not provide information on the data splitting criteria used for training a deep learning model.

That being said, the context does mention the use of a random forest model and the evaluation of its performance on a test set, but it does not provide details on how the data was split for training and testing.

Therefore, I must say that I don't know the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training based on the provided context.
