Answer:

To ensure the generalizability of the model, the researchers used the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) approach. This approach involves extracting one observation at a time from the dataset and estimating the model parameters using the remaining (n-1) observations. The model is then applied to the extracted observation. This process is repeated for all observations in the dataset.

Additionally, the researchers compared the GEDI L4A AGBD footprint values with AGBD estimated from the Sentinel-2 models, and also compared the relationship between tree height and AGBD for field data and GEDI data. This comparison was done to understand the relationship between GEDI AGBD and height with respect to the corresponding field-based values at the two study areas.

However, it is not mentioned in the provided context whether the dataset used was diverse or if stratified splitting was used. Therefore, I do not know if these measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.
