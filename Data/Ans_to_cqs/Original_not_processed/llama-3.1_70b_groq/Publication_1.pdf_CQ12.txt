Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It mentions that deep learning (DL) techniques are used to detect and classify events of interest, and that the models are completely trainable from data in a supervised fashion. However, it does not specify whether the models used are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Transformers, or some other type of deep learning model.
