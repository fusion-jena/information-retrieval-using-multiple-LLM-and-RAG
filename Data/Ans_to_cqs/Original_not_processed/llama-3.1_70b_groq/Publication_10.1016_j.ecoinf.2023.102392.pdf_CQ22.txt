Answer:

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in the provided context are:

1. Precision: It is defined as the ratio of true positives (TP) to the sum of true positives and false positives (FP). Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
2. Recall: It is defined as the ratio of true positives (TP) to the sum of true positives and false negatives (FN). Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
3. F1: It is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. F1 = 2(Precision Ã— Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
4. Overall Accuracy (OA): It is the ratio of the number of correctly classified points to the total number of points examined. OA = ncorrect / ntotal
5. Kappa: It is a measure of agreement between the predicted and actual classes. Kappa = (Po - Pe) / (1 - Pe), where Po is the observable consensus value and Pe is the presumptive consensus probability.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the XGBoost model in land use/land cover classification and forest types classification. The values of these metrics are provided in Tables 7, 8, and 9.
