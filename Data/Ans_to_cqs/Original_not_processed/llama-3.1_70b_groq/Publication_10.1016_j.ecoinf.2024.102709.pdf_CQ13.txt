Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The context only mentions the use of k-fold cross-validation with k=5, epochs=500, and image size=640 pixels. It also mentions the use of the YOLO loss function, which is divided into three parts, but it does not provide information on the specific hyperparameters used.

However, it is mentioned that the scikit-learn library was used to split the data and investigate the results of each trained model, but it does not provide information on the specific hyperparameters used.

Therefore, I do not know the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer.
