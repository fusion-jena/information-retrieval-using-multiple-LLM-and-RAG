Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. It only mentions that a U-Net model, a type of convolutional neural network (CNN), is used for classification, but it does not specify the framework used to implement the U-Net model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
