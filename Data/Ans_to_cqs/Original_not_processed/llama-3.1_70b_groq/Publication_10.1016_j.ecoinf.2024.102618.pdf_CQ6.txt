Answer:::
According to the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include:

1. Balancing the dataset using the class-weighted technique to address the bias of deep learning models towards classes with a large number of images.
2. A novel image pre-processing technique, which is not explicitly described in the provided context.

Additionally, the context mentions that the dataset is an augmented version of PlanVillage, which suggests that data augmentation techniques may have been applied to the dataset before preprocessing. However, the specific details of these techniques are not provided.

It is also mentioned that an image enhancement technique is used to provide crystal-clear images for further examination, but it is not clear if this is part of the preprocessing steps or a separate step.

There is no mention of normalization, scaling, or cleaning as preprocessing steps in the provided context.
