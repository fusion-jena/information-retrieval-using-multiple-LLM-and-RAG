Answer:

The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the context is semantic segmentation. Specifically, the model is designed to classify every pixel of an image into a specific class, with the goal of achieving a suitable biocrust coverage estimation. This is evident from the text, which states that "one needs to classify every pixel of an image at the highest possible accuracy" and that "this pixel-wise classification is called semantic segmentation". The model is trained on input and target image pairs, where the target image consists of a fully labeled image, with every single pixel assigned to a certain class. The model's purpose is to accurately segment the image into different classes, such as biocrust coverage, and ignore irrelevant parts of the image.
