Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention anything about a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. The context appears to be discussing geostatistical analysis, spatial autocorrelation, and model evaluation metrics such as MAE, MSE, and R2. There is no mention of deep learning or its associated hyperparameters.

Therefore, I must answer that I don't know what hyperparameters are used in the deep learning model, as there is no information provided about a deep learning model in the context.
