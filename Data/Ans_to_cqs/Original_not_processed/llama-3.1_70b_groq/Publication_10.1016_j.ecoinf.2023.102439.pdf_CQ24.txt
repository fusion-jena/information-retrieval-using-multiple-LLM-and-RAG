Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context appears to be focused on various research studies and papers related to ecological informatics, remote sensing, and artificial neural networks, but it does not provide information on handling randomness in deep learning pipelines.

However, I can suggest that in general, deep learning pipelines often employ techniques such as:

* Setting a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results
* Using techniques like dropout and regularization to reduce overfitting
* Employing ensemble methods to combine the predictions of multiple models trained on different random initializations
* Using batch normalization to reduce the effect of internal covariate shift

But these are general strategies and not specific to the provided context. If you're looking for specific information on handling randomness in deep learning pipelines, I would recommend consulting a more relevant source.
