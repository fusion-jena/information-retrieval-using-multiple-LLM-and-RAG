Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on the application of various techniques for reconstructing and analyzing NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) time-series data, rather than deep learning model training.

However, I can provide some general information on common preprocessing steps that are typically involved before training a deep learning model. These steps may include:

* Normalization: scaling the input data to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model.
* Scaling: transforming the data to have zero mean and unit variance, which can help improve the stability of the training process.
* Cleaning: handling missing or erroneous data, such as removing or imputing missing values, and handling outliers or noisy data.

It's worth noting that the specific preprocessing steps required may vary depending on the specific deep learning model and the characteristics of the data being used. Without more information on the specific model and data being used, it's difficult to provide more specific guidance on preprocessing steps.

In the context of the provided references, some papers mention the use of techniques such as the Savitzky-Golay filter (Chen et al., 2004) or the Harmonic ANalysis of Time Series (HANTS) method (Zhou et al., 2015) for reconstructing and analyzing NDVI time-series data. However, these techniques are not specifically related to preprocessing steps for deep learning model training.
