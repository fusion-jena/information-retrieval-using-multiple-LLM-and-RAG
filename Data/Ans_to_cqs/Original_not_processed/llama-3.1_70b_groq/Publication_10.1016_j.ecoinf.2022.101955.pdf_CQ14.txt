The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, it does mention that the "Control() function helped to evaluate these tuning parameters for model performance." This suggests that some form of tuning or optimization was performed, but the specific method used (e.g., grid search, random search) is not specified.
