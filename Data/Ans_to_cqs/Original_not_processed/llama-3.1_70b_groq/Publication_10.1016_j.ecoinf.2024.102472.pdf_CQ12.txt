Answer: 

The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network. This is a type of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that is commonly used for tasks such as regression and classification. The context mentions that the network features two hidden layers and an output layer with a single neuron, which is consistent with the architecture of an MLP. There is no mention of other types of deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or Transformers.
