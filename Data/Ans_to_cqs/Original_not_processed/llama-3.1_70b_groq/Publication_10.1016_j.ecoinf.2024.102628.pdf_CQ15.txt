Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context only mentions the use of the fast.ai framework and the ResNet-34 architecture, but it does not provide information on the optimization techniques employed. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
