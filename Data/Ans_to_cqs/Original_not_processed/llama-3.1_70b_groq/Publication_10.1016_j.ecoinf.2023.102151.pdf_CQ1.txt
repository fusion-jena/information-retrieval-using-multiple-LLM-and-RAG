Answer:::

The provided context does not specifically mention the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that technicians typically gather soil information through soil surveys and present it as raw data to professionals. Additionally, it mentions the utilization of resources such as Crop-CASMA (Zhang et al., 2022) for US soil moisture data, which suggests that public datasets may be used.

It also mentions that various research efforts have made strides in addressing concerns related to soil information, including the development of frameworks for the preliminary delineation of soil profile horizons (Yang et al., 2022), and the creation of data exchange schemas for soil and terrain data (Pourabdollah et al., 2012).

Furthermore, it mentions that web-based technologies are used for monitoring purposes and can be accessed within an internet browser (Cope et al., 2017; Jarray et al., 2022; Deval et al., 2022), which may involve the use of sensors or other data collection methods.

However, it does not provide a comprehensive list of methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, the answer to the query is that soil surveys, public datasets, and possibly sensors or web-based technologies may be used, but the exact methods are not specified in the provided context.
