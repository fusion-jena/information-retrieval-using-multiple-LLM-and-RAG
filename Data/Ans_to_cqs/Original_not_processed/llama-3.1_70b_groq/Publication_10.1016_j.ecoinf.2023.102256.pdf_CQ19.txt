Answer: TensorFlow. 

The text mentions that the deep learning model is built using TensorFlow, as evidenced by the reference to Abadi et al. (2015) "TensorFlow: Large-scale machine learning on heterogeneous systems." This suggests that the authors used TensorFlow as the framework for building their deep learning model. There is no mention of PyTorch or any other frameworks in the provided text.
