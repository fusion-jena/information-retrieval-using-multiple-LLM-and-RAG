Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as cross-validation or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the model was trained and evaluated on diverse datasets, which suggests that the authors attempted to ensure the model's generalizability by using a varied set of data.

Additionally, the context mentions that the performance of the model was averaged over 10 random seeds, which implies that the authors used some form of randomization to evaluate the model's performance. However, it is unclear whether this randomization was used for cross-validation or stratified splitting.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of techniques such as batch normalization, dropout, and learning rate scheduling, which can help improve the model's generalizability by reducing overfitting. However, these techniques are not directly related to ensuring generalizability through diverse datasets or cross-validation.

Overall, while the context suggests that the authors took some steps to ensure the model's generalizability, it does not provide a complete picture of the measures taken.
