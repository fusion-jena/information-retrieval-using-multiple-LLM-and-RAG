Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be focused on the assessment of UMAP as a binary classifier, species distribution models, and the calculation of distances between species-species and background-species. It does not provide information on the training process or the criteria used to determine its completion. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
