Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the importance of the quality and quantity of the sample dataset in the accuracy of ANN's training process (Yang et al., 2018). This suggests that ensuring a diverse and representative dataset is crucial for the performance of the model.

While the context does not provide specific techniques for addressing data bias, it does mention the use of trial and error to optimize the network's structure (Supplementary material 1). This implies that some level of experimentation and data manipulation may be involved in the preprocessing stage.

However, without further information, it is difficult to provide a more detailed answer to the query. The context does not mention specific techniques such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection. Therefore, I do not know the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline in this context.
