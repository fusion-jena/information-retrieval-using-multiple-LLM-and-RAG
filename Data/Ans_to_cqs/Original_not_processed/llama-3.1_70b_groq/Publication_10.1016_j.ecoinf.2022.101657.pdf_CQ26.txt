Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically address the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the use of neural networks for species identification, camera trap data analysis, and the application of machine learning techniques to reduce useless data collection.

However, it does mention the use of transfer learning, where a pre-trained model is further trained on a specific dataset (WCS dataset) to adapt to the new data. This technique can help to some extent in addressing data bias by leveraging the knowledge gained from the pre-trained model and fine-tuning it on the specific dataset.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a specific data split (recommended by the WCS dataset) for training and evaluation, which might imply some form of data preprocessing or splitting technique. However, it does not provide explicit information on techniques like Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
