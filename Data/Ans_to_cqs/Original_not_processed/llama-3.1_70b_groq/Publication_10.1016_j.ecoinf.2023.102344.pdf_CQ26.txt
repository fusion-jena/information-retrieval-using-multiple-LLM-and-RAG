Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the architecture and performance of various pre-trained networks, such as EfficientNet-B0, ResNet101, MobileNetV2, and InceptionV3, but does not discuss data preprocessing or bias mitigation techniques. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
