Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a passage about a research study that utilized certain tools and methods for analyzing data, but it does not provide information on how the raw data was collected. The passage mentions the use of certain software and tools, such as Shiny, but it does not discuss data collection methods. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
