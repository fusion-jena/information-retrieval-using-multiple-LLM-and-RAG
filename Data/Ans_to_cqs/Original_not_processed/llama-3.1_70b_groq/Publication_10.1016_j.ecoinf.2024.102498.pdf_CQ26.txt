Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the performance evaluation of different classification approaches, including pixel-based, object-based, and fusion approaches, as well as the use of algorithms such as GTB and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for land use and land cover (LULC) classification.

However, it does mention that collecting high-quality labels was initially challenging due to limited access to the study area, time constraints, and the complexity of different classes. To address this, 15 apprentices were trained, and high-resolution images from Google Earth were utilized to collect appropriate labels. Two experts further reviewed the collected labels to ensure quality and accuracy.

While this information does not directly answer the question about techniques used to address data bias, it suggests that the authors were concerned about data quality and took steps to ensure that the labels were accurate and reliable. Nevertheless, the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing are not mentioned in the provided context.
