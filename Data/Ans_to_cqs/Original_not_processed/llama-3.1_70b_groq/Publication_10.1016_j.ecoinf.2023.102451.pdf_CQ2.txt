Answer: The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image, specifically microscopic images of environmental microorganisms. The context mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and transformer-based networks for image classification, and the proposed framework EMViT-Net is designed to extract features from images. The dataset used is EMDS-6, which is a microscopic image dataset. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
