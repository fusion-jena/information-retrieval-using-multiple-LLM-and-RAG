Answer:::

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in the provided context are:

1. Sensitivity (TPR): It is the ratio of accurate prediction of the corals and can be given by Equation (4): Sensitivity (TPR) = TP / (TP + FN).

2. Specificity (Sy): It is the ratio of the prediction of unbleached corals and can be given by Equation (5): Specificity = TN / (TN + FP).

3. Accuracy: The ratio of correct prediction to the total number of instances can be given by Equation (6): Accuracy = (TN + TP) / (FP + TP + FN + TN).

4. F1-score: It is the weighted mean of sensitivity and specificity and can be given by Equation (7): F1-score = 2 * (TPR * Sy) / (TPR + Sy).

5. Cohen’s Kappa (κ): κ gives us the amount of data by the execution of classifier for the examination of its performance in case of some coincidence. It can be calculated by Equation (8): κ = 2 * (TP * TN - FP * FN) / ((TP + FP) * (FP + TN) + (TP + FN) * (FN + TN)).

Note that precision and recall are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, but F1-score is mentioned, which is a combination of precision and recall.
