Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the use of mAP (mean Average Precision) as a metric to evaluate the model's performance, and the use of F1 score and FÎ² score to find an optimal balance between precision and recall. However, it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
