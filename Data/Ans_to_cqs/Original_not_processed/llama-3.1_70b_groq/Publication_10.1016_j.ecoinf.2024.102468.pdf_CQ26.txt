Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the performance of the WT-HMM model using varying dataset sizes and the importance of selecting appropriate sample sizes for effective model training. It also mentions data denoising and data annotations, but does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. The techniques mentioned in the query, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and Diverse data collection, are not mentioned in the provided context.
