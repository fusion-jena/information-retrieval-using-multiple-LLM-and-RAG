Answer:::
Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, the models used are based on MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3 (Large and Small) architectures, which are variants of CNNs. These models are pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and are used as feature extractors, with additional layers added on top for classification.
