Answer:::

According to the provided context, the entire dataset was randomly divided into three sets: a training set (60%), a validation set (20%), and a testing set (20%). This is mentioned in the following sentence:

"The entire dataset was randomly divided into a training set (60%), a validation set (20%), and a testing set (20%)."

This suggests that the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are a simple random division of the data into three sets with a specific proportion: 60% for training, 20% for validation, and 20% for testing.
