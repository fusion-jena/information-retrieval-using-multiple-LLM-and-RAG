Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on a specific application of deep learning in ecology, particularly for bird species classification, and mentions a custom dataset with 8,836 species, but does not provide information on well-known datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
