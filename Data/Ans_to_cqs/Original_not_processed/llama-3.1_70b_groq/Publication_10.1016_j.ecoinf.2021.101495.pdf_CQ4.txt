Answer:::

The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline are:

1. Image rotation: Each individual fish was placed so that its longest axis was horizontal, and then three additional rotations were generated to cover all possible positions in which the model can find a fish.
2. Contrast alteration: The contrast of the image was altered by multiplying each pixel by a factor α, where α ∈ ℝ : 0.9 ≤ α ≤ 1.1.
3. Brightness alteration: The brightness of the image was altered by adding a value β to each pixel, where β ∈ ℕ : -4 ≤ β ≤ 4.

These techniques were applied to each of the original segments to generate 12 new segments, resulting in a total of 86,208 segments for the classification model.
