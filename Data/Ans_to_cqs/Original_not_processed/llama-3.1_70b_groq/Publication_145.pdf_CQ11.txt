I don't know. The provided context does not mention a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper or article discussing the use of a deep learning algorithm called U-net for mapping plant species in the Amazonian forest, but it does not provide information on where the data or pipeline can be accessed.
