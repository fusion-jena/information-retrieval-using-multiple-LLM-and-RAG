Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be related to a cellular automaton model for simulating wildfires, and discusses modifications to the update criterion, optimizing the scope, and strategies for variance reduction. However, it does not mention deep learning or regularization methods. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
