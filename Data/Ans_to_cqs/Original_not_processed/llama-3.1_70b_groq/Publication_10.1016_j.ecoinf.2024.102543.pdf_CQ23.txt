Answer:::

To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the dataset was preprocessed to standardize and enrich it. Techniques such as auto-orientation, resizing, tiling, and filtering were used to ensure that the images were consistently oriented and had a uniform size of 640 Ã— 640 pixels. Additionally, the dataset was augmented by introducing random saturation adjustments to each training example, which increased the number of outputs per example and contributed to a more comprehensive and robust training dataset.

Furthermore, the dataset was split into training, validation, and testing sets, with the training set comprising 82% of the data (4000 images), the validation set consisting of 13% (607 images), and the testing set making up 5% (260 images). This split allowed the model to learn from a diverse range of examples and patterns in the data, and the validation set was used to fine-tune hyperparameters and assess the model's performance on unseen data, helping to prevent overfitting and ensuring generalization.

It is also worth noting that the model's performance was evaluated using various metrics, including Precision, Recall, mAP0.5, and mAP0.5:0.95, which provided a comprehensive understanding of the model's performance on unseen data. Overall, these measures helped to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
