Answer:::

The provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that workflow can compensate for some biases through data classification and spatio-temporal aggregation, mainly when large input datasets are used.

It also mentions that a multi-resolution decision approach is usually effective in addressing biases. Additionally, the context highlights the importance of using statistically significant data and selecting the most appropriate spatial resolution for the analysis to improve the precision of the workflow's output.

Regarding specific techniques such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, the context does not provide any information. Therefore, I do not know if these techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.

It is worth noting that the context focuses on big data processing, FAIR data principles, and open science methodology, rather than deep learning pipelines specifically. Therefore, it may not provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
