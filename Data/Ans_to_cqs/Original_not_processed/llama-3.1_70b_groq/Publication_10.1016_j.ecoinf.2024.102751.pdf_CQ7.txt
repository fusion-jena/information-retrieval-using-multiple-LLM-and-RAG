Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The text discusses the potential use of machine learning and deep neural networks for estimating soil moisture, but it does not provide details on the data splitting process.

However, it is common practice in machine learning to split the data into training, testing, and validation sets using techniques such as random sampling, stratified sampling, or k-fold cross-validation. The specific criteria used to split the data can depend on the problem, dataset, and model architecture.

In general, the training set is used to train the model, the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance, and the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. A common split is 80% for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing, but this can vary depending on the specific use case.

Without more information, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to the query.
