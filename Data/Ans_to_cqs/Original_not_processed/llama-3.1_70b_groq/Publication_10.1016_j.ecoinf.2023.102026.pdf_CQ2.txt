Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. In fact, the context does not mention deep learning at all, but rather focuses on machine learning techniques such as Random Forest (RF) and Generalised Linear Model (GLM) for species distribution modelling. The data mentioned in the context appears to be camera trap data, but the format of this data is not specified. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
