Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are precision, recall, and F-measure. Additionally, the Intersection over Union (IoU) is used as a threshold to determine correct or incorrect detection results, with a threshold of 0.3. The IoU is defined as the intersection over the union of the two bounding boxes, which are the ground-truth bounding box and the predicted bounding box.
