Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, is to model the probability distribution of species occurrence, also known as species distribution modeling (SDM). The model is designed to predict the distribution of a species based on ecological and atmospheric variables. The CNN architecture is used to establish a nonlinear relationship between these variables and the species occurrence, which is a classification problem. The model outputs a probability map indicating the likelihood of the species occurrence at different locations.
