Answer: The pipeline uses a combination of different deep learning models, including CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), ViT (Vision Transformer), and a hybrid model called CA-Hybrid network, which is based on ResNet and ViT. Specifically, the CA-Hybrid network integrates CAM (Class Activation Map) into the residual structure of ResNet, and is used for Cervidae classification. Additionally, the pipeline also uses YOLOv7, which is an object detection network. There is no mention of RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) being used in the pipeline.
