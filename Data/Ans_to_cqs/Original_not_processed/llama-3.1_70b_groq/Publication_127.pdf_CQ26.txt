Answer:::

The provided context does not specifically discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention splitting a dataset into training and test sets. 

According to the context, a dataset was split into training and test sets after selecting 757,000 nonempty images and 757,000 empty images. This suggests that the dataset was split randomly, but it does not provide information on whether techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling were used to address data bias.

Stratified splitting is a technique used to ensure that the training and test sets have the same proportion of samples from each class as the original dataset. Oversampling involves creating additional copies of the minority class to balance the dataset, while undersampling involves reducing the number of samples from the majority class. Diverse data collection involves collecting data from a wide range of sources to reduce bias.

Since the provided context does not discuss these techniques specifically, it is not possible to determine which techniques were used to address data bias during preprocessing.
