Answer: 
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The text only mentions that the neural network was trained using the TensorFlow library and that the network architecture and training details can be found in the Supporting Information, which is not provided. Therefore, I do not have enough information to answer this question.
