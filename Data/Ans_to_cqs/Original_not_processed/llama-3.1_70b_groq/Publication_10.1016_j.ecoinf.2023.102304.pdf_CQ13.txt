Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer. The context appears to be discussing a different type of model, specifically the LandTrendr (LTR) model, which is used for analyzing temporal patterns in satellite data. The hyperparameters mentioned in the context are related to the LTR model, such as MS (maximum number of segments used for fitting) and RT (threshold of the fast recovery event). However, these hyperparameters are not related to deep learning models.
