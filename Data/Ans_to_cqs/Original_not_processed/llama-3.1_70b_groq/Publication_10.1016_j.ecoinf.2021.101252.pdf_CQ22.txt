Answer:::

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are accuracy and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC). 

Accuracy is measured using the proportion of correctly classified cases, and is reported as a percentage (% correct) for the candidate models. 

AUC is used to measure the performance of the selected models. It is reported as a value between 0 and 1, with higher values indicating better performance. 

There is no mention of precision or recall being used as evaluation metrics in the provided context.
