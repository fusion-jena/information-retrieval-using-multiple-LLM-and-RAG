Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on data augmentation techniques, attention mechanisms, and the proposed SCAM-Herb model for identifying medicinal plants. It does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

However, it does mention that data augmentation (DA) is used to artificially increase and diversify the training data, which can be considered a preprocessing step. The context also mentions that the proposed approach (SCAM-Herb model) uses a CNN-based method, which may involve some preprocessing steps, but it does not specify what those steps are.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query about preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model.
