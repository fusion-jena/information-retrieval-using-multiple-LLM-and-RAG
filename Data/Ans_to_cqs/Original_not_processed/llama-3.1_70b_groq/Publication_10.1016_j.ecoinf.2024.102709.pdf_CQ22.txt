Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are not explicitly stated as accuracy, precision, or recall. However, the text mentions that the model's performance is evaluated using the mean Average Precision (mAP50) value, which indicates the highest number of correctly predicted labels for the model trained on a specific split. Additionally, the text mentions that the model's performance is also evaluated using the YOLO training losses and the classification loss (cls loss), which measures the error in the predicted class probabilities for each object in the image compared with the ground truth.
