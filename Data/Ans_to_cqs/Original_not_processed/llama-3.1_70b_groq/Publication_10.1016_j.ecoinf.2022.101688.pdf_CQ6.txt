Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention that the software code was written in Python 3 for audio pre-processing. Additionally, it mentions that spectrograms were generated using the Librosa library.

It can be inferred that the audio data was pre-processed to generate spectrograms, which are a common representation of audio data in deep learning models. However, the specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning are not mentioned.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the context does not provide explicit information on the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, except for the generation of spectrograms using the Librosa library.
