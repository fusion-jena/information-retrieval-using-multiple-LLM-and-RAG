Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. It mentions Optuna, which is a hyperparameter optimization framework, but it does not mention the underlying deep learning framework used to build the model. The context mentions various machine learning models such as random forest, multilayer perceptron, long-short term memory, and support vector regression, but it does not provide information on the specific framework used to implement these models.
