Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily discusses the results of experiments (Exp.1, Exp.3) and the performance of different models (VR + SVR, LSTM, RF) on various metrics (RMSE, MAE, MRE, accuracy). It also mentions the training period for some experiments (e.g., four weeks for Exp.1), but it does not provide information on how the training process is stopped or what criteria are used to determine its completion. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
