Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deep learning model training or the criteria used to split data for such training. The context appears to be related to redescription mining, a technique that combines partitioning and modeling techniques to identify local patterns in data. It discusses the use of parameters such as MinSuppIn and MinSuppOut to control the size of the support of the output redescriptions, but does not mention anything about splitting data for deep learning model training.
