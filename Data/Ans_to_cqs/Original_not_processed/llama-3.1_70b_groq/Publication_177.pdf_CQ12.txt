Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, six popular deep learning models were adopted, including InceptionResNetV2 (IR), ResNet50 (R), Xception (X), InceptionV3 (I), MobileNetV2 (M), and GoogleNet (G). These models were pre-trained on ImageNet and then fine-tuned on the target task with a small dataset.
