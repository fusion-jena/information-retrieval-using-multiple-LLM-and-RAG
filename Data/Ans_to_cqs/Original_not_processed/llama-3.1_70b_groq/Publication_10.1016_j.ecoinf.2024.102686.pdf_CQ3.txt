Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to geospatial data, ecological informatics, and human activity-natural endowment coupled zoning, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
