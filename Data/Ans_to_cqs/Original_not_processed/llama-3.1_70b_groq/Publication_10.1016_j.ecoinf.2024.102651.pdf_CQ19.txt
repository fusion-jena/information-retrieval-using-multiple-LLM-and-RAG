Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The text mentions various architectures and techniques, such as CNN, ViT, ResNet, and CAM, but it does not provide information about the frameworks used to implement these models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
