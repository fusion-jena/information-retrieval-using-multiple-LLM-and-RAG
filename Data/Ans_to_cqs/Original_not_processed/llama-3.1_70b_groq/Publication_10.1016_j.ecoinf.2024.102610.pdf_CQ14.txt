Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the importance of selecting appropriate parameters for model tuning and the use of variable elimination methods, such as Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Variable Selection Using Random Forests (VSURF), to improve model performance. However, it does not provide information on the specific method used for hyperparameter optimization, such as grid search or random search.
