I don't know. The provided pieces of context do not mention a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text appears to be a research paper discussing the results of a study using deep learning architectures and XGBoost for land use (LU) detection tasks, but it does not provide information about where the data or pipeline can be accessed.
