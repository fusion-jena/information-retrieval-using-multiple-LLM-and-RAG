Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context discusses the use of 70% of the data for training and 30% for validation, but it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine the completion of training. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
