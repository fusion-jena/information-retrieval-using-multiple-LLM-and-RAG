I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data augmentation techniques or a deep learning pipeline. It appears to be discussing ensemble methods, specifically bagging and boosting, and their application in XGBoost, as well as classification and regression trees (CARTs). There is no mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling, which are commonly used in computer vision tasks.
