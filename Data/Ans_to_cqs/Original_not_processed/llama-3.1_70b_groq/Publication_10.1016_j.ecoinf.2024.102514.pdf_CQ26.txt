The provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention data splitting ratios and the selection of random sample locations for training and testing datasets.

Based on the context, it can be inferred that the study used a random sampling approach to split the data into training and testing datasets, with an 80% and 20% ratio, respectively. However, it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection.

Therefore, I do not know the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline in this study.
