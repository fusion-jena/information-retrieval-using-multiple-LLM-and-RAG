Answer: 
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of U-net, a type of convolutional neural network architecture, which is commonly implemented in frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Additionally, the context mentions the use of Deeplabv3+, which is also a type of convolutional neural network architecture that can be implemented in various frameworks. However, without more specific information, it is not possible to determine the exact framework used.
