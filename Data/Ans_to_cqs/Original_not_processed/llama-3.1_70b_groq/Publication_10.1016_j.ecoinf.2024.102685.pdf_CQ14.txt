Answer:

The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using repeated cross validations with a specific number of folds and repetitions. For the seagrass meadow models, 10 folds and 10 repetitions are used, while for the species meadow models, 5 folds and 5 repetitions are used. This process is used to automatically select the number of variables used for each node (mtry).
