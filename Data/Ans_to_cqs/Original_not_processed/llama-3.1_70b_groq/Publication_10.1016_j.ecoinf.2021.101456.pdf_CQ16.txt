Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the dynamic β-VAE formulation, its components, and the training process, but it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training.

However, it does mention that the dynamic control of β helps maintain a steady trade-off between the reconstruction and regularization losses, and that the β value stabilizes after a certain number of epochs (as shown in Fig. 1). This suggests that the training process may be monitored and stopped when the β value and the losses stabilize, but this is not explicitly stated.

Therefore, I do not know the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete, as it is not specified in the provided context.
