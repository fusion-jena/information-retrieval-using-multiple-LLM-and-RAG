Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the approach adopted is a "fully featured crowdsourced data-driven methodology" and that the data is obtained from Wikiloc posts. This suggests that the raw data is collected from online sources, specifically from user-generated content on the Wikiloc platform. 

Additionally, the context mentions that the data consists of text descriptions in five different languages, which are then translated into English using DeepL. This implies that the raw data is in the form of text, which is collected from online sources and then pre-processed for analysis. 

There is no mention of surveys, sensors, or public datasets as methods for collecting raw data. Therefore, based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data is collected from online sources, specifically from user-generated content on the Wikiloc platform.
