Answer: According to the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include normalizing the RGB channels by subtracting the ImageNet mean from each channel. This step is performed to align the unsupervised classifications with the ImageNet pretraining weights. Additionally, data augmentation techniques such as random flips and translations were tested, but found to have little effect on the final score. No other preprocessing steps, such as scaling or cleaning, are mentioned in the provided context.
