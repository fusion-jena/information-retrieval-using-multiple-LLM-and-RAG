Answer: The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using the Optuna algorithm, which employs complex optimization algorithms to automatically search the hyperparameter space for the greatest combination of hyperparameters that minimizes the mean squared error. This approach is used instead of traditional methods such as grid search or random search. The Optuna algorithm is used to optimize the hyperparameters for each model, and the results show that the distribution of the optimized hyperparameters can vary slightly between different modeling scenarios.
