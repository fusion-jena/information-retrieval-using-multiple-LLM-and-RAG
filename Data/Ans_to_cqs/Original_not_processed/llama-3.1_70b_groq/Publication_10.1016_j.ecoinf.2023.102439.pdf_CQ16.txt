Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. It only mentions that the model's performance was evaluated using several statistical metrics, including Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE), Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and correlation coefficient (R). Additionally, it mentions that the number of neurons in the hidden layer was incrementally increased to determine the optimal configuration that yields the best results. However, it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete.
