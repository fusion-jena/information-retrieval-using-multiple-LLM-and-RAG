Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on ecological informatics, species distribution modeling, and crowdsourcing data analysis, rather than deep learning or computer vision.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
