Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The text only mentions that manually labeling events can help create advanced recognizers and that supervised machine learning algorithms have been effective for ungulate detection. It also mentions the use of convolutional neural networks or deep learning methods for automated cattle detection, but it does not provide details on the data annotation techniques used. Therefore, I do not know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
