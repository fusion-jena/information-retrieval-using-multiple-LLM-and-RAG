Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. It mentions various deep learning architectures and models, such as Faster R-CNN, FCRN, and others, but it does not specify the frameworks used to implement these models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
