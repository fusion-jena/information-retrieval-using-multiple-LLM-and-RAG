Answer:::
The data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are image-based. Specifically, the pipeline involves the use of multi-band images, which are disassembled into single-band images using Python's Rasterio module to reduce memory capacity issues. The images are then converted into 256 × 256-pixel image units, with a 50% overlap rate, and rotated every 45° to generate new image units and enhance the data. The pipeline does not appear to involve audio, video, or CSV data formats.
