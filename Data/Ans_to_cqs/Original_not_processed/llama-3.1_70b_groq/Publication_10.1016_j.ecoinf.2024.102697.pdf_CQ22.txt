Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The text discusses model complexity, feature selection, and hyperparameter optimization, but it does not provide information on the evaluation metrics used.

However, it does mention that Bayesian Optimization was used to minimize a 5 k-fold cross-validation loss during model development. This suggests that the model's performance was evaluated using a loss function, but the specific metrics used to evaluate the model's performance (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) are not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
