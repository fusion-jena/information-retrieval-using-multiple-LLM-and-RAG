Answer: 

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the validation data (10% of the training data) was employed for tuning the key hyperparameters for each model. This suggests that the model performance was evaluated on the validation data during the hyperparameter tuning process. Additionally, the text mentions that precision, recall, and F1 score were used to evaluate the model's performance, but it does not specify how these metrics were used during training.
