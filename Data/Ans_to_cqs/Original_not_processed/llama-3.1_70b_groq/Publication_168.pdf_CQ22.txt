Answer: 
To evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, the metrics used are average accuracy (AA), overall accuracy (OA), and kappa coefficient (K). 

- Overall accuracy (OA) represents the proportion of correctly predicted samples in the total samples.
- Average accuracy (AA) represents the average of each category classification accuracies.
- Kappa coefficient is used to measure the consistency of classification accuracy. It is a consistency test metric.
