Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model EMViT-Net, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The text only mentions that the configuration of the optimizer and learning rate has been considered for the training of the framework, but it does not provide the actual values or settings used.

However, it does provide information on the system configuration used for training and experiments, including the kernel size, strides, and pooling methods used in the convolutional layer. Additionally, it mentions the use of batch normalization to ensure stable training and faster convergence.

If you are looking for specific information on the hyperparameters used in the EMViT-Net model, I would recommend checking the original research paper or publication for more detailed information.
