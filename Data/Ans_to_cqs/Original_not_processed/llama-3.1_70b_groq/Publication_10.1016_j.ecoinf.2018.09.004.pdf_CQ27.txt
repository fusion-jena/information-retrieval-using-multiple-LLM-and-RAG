Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a trained deep learning model. It discusses various machine learning algorithms such as K-nearest neighbors and Decision Trees, and their application to a dataset for 5-class classification. It also mentions the evaluation metrics used, such as Precision, Recall, and F-measure, and the importance of variable selection. However, it does not provide any information on the deployment process of a trained model.
