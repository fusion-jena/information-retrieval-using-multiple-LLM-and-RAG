Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of pre-trained models, specifically the Mask R-CNN model pre-trained on the COCO 2017 train dataset and the ResNets pre-trained on the Kinetics-400 dataset. This suggests that the models were trained on pre-processed data, but the specific preprocessing steps are not mentioned.

Additionally, the context mentions data augmentation for action recognition, but it does not provide details on the specific preprocessing steps involved. It only mentions the use of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as the optimization technique and the hyperparameters used for training.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot determine the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model.
