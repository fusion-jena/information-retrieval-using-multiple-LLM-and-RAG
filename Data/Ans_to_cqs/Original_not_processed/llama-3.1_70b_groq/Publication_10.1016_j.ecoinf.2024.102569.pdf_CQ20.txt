Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It appears to be a research paper discussing the use of penalized loss functions and shrinkage estimation for variable selection in a statistical model, but it does not provide information on the computational resources used for training the model.
