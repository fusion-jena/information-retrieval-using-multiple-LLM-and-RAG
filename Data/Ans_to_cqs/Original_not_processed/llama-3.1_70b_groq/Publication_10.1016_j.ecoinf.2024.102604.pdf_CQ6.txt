Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to environmental science and species distribution modeling, discussing topics such as sampling bias, environmental covariates, and model evaluation. It does not provide information on deep learning model preprocessing steps.

However, I can provide general information on common preprocessing steps involved in training deep learning models. These may include:

* Normalization: scaling numeric data to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model.
* Scaling: transforming data to have zero mean and unit variance, which can improve model stability and convergence.
* Cleaning: handling missing or erroneous data, such as removing or imputing missing values, and removing outliers or noisy data.
* Feature engineering: transforming or creating new features to improve model performance, such as encoding categorical variables or extracting relevant information from text data.

Please note that the specific preprocessing steps required may vary depending on the problem, dataset, and model architecture.
