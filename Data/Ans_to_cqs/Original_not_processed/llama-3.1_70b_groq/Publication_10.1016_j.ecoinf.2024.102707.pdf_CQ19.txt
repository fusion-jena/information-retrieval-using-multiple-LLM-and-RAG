Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The text mentions the use of a trained machine learning model and YOLOv6, but it does not provide information on the underlying frameworks used to build the model. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
