Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to a study on evapotranspiration prediction using various machine learning models, including Random Forest, Support Vector Regression, and Artificial Neural Networks. The datasets mentioned in the context are related to weather data, micro-meteorological data, and satellite imageries, but they are not the typical datasets used in deep learning pipelines.
