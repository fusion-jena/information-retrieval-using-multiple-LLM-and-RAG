Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it does mention that the analysis uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), particularly Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), which are fully connected feedforward neural networks.

While MLPs are a type of deep learning model, they are not typically classified as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or Transformers. MLPs are a more general type of neural network that can be used for a variety of tasks, including regression and classification.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), which is a type of Artificial Neural Network (ANN).
