Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The text discusses the challenges of processing high-resolution remote sensing data, the importance of training samples, and various classification methods, but it does not provide information on the hardware resources used for training the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
