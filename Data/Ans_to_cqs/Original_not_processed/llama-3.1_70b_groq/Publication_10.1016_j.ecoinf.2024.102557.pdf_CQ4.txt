Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided pieces of context do not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as Flipping, Rotating, or Scaling. The context appears to be focused on the application of machine learning and deep learning in ecology and environmental science, with references to various studies and papers on the topic.

However, I can suggest that data augmentation techniques are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to artificially increase the size of the training dataset and improve the model's robustness. These techniques can include:

* Flipping (horizontal or vertical)
* Rotating (by a certain angle)
* Scaling (up or down)
* Cropping
* Color jittering
* Noise injection

But, I couldn't find any specific information about the application of these techniques in the provided context. If you have any further information or clarification, I'd be happy to try and help.
