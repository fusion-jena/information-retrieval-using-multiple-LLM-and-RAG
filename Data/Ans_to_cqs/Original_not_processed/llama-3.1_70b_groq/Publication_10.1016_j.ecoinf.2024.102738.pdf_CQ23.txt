Answer:::

To ensure the generalizability of the model, the researchers employed several strategies. Firstly, they used a large number of datasets (31 datasets) to train and test the model, which suggests that they aimed to capture a diverse range of scenarios and conditions. This diverse dataset can help the model learn to generalize well across different situations.

Additionally, the researchers used a sampling strategy that involved selecting pure training areas with at least 50 pixels per thematic class. This approach, combined with simplified random sampling, allowed them to capture variability within each class and improve the model's ability to generalize.

However, there is no explicit mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting in the provided context. While the researchers do mention the use of training and testing samples, the specific techniques used for splitting the data are not described.

Overall, the use of a large and diverse dataset, combined with a thoughtful sampling strategy, suggests that the researchers took steps to ensure the generalizability of the model. However, without more information on the specific techniques used for data splitting, it is difficult to provide a more detailed answer.
