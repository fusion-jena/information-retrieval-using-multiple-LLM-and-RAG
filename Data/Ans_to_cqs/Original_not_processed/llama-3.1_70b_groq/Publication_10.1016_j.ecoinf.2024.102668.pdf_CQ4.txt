Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to focus on the comparison of audio recording devices, acoustic indices, and their applicability to broader comparative analyses, including machine learning and deep learning. It discusses the importance of reducing device bias and enhancing the consistency of feature spaces across studies.

While the context mentions the use of deep learning and machine learning, it does not provide information on the specific data augmentation techniques used in the pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query.

If you have any further questions or would like to provide more context, I'll be happy to try and assist you.
