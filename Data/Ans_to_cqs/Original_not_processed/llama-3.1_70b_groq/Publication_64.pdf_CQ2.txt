Answer:::
Answer: The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is primarily images. The dataset used for training consists of around 250K images belonging to more than 6K plant species of Western Europe, with most images having resolutions ranging from 200K to 600K pixels and aspect ratios ranging from 0.5 to 2. The images are labeled by experts and come with a tag specifying the focus of the image, such as 'habit', 'flower', 'leaf', 'bark', etc. The images are used for plant species classification using deep convolutional neural networks.
