Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about training a deep learning model or using specific hardware resources such as GPUs or TPUs. The context appears to be discussing a method for redescription mining, which involves generating redescriptions from a dataset and filtering them based on certain criteria. The only mention of computational resources is a mention of a "commodity laptop" being used to run the method, but it does not provide any information about the specific hardware resources used.
