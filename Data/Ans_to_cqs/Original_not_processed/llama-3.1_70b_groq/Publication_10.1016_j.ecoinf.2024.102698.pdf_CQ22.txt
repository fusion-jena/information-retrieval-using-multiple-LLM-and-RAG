Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, such as accuracy, precision, or recall. However, it does mention several data utility metrics used to evaluate the quality of the synthetic data generated by the model. These metrics include:

* Ï‡2 test
* Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
* Correlations scores
* Mean data quality score
* Mean data diagnostics scores

These metrics are used to evaluate the similarity between the original and synthetic data, but they do not provide information on the performance of the deep learning model itself. Therefore, I do not know what metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model.
