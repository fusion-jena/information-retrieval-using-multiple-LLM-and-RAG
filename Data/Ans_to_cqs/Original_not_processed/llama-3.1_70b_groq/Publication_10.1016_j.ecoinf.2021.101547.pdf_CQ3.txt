Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the deep learning process, including the use of a pre-trained ResNet-50 network, the importance of mini-batch size, and the challenges of optimizing deep learning approaches. It does not provide information on the data annotation techniques employed in the pipeline. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
