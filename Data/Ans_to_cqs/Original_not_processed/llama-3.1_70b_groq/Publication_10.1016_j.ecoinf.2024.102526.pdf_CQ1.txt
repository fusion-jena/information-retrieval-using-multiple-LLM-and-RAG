Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the methods utilized for collecting raw data are primarily related to image and video capture. The context mentions various fields related to image capture, such as "image-camera-orientation", "image-platform", "image-illumination", and "image-scale-reference". Additionally, it mentions "samplingProtocol" and "sampling" multiple times, suggesting that data collection involves some form of sampling.

Specific methods mentioned in the context include:

* Imaging by platform/camera
* Use of bait (type, quantity, position related to imagery, etc.)
* Mapping: planned path execution along 2-3 spatial axes
* Stationary: fixed spatial position
* Survey: planned path execution along free path
* Exploration: unplanned path execution
* Experiment: observation of manipulated environment
* Sampling: ex-situ imaging of samples taken by other method

It also mentions the use of various types of imagery, such as photo, video, and scan, as well as different locations for specimen photography, including seafloor, water column, sea surface, atmosphere, and laboratory.

However, it does not explicitly mention the use of sensors or public datasets as methods for collecting raw data. Therefore, based on the provided context, the answer to the query is that the methods utilized for collecting raw data appear to be primarily related to image and video capture, with various sampling protocols and methods employed.
