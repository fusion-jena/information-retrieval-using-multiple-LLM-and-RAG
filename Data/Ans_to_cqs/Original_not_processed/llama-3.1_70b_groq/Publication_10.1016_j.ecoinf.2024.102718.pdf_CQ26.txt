Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the class weights are computed to address class imbalance, denoted by 'wc' in Algorithm 1. This suggests that the authors may have used a technique such as class weighting to address class imbalance, but the specific technique used is not explicitly stated.

Additionally, the context mentions that data augmentation techniques are applied to boost the diversity of the dataset, which includes modifications in brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue, along with random horizontal and vertical flips, and random rotations up to thirty degrees. This suggests that the authors may have used diverse data collection and data augmentation techniques to address data bias, but the specific techniques used are not explicitly stated.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query. However, it can be inferred that the authors may have used techniques such as class weighting and data augmentation to address data bias, but the specific techniques used are not explicitly stated.
