Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the LaDeco module, its pre-trained models, and the process of loading and customizing these models. It also discusses the output format and provides references to various research papers related to deep learning and semantic segmentation.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions the use of a specific pre-trained model (deeplabv3 + resnet269) and the ability to switch to other pre-trained models as needed. This suggests that the LaDeco module may rely on the randomness handling strategies employed by these pre-trained models, but the specific details are not provided in the context.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to the query.
