Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be focused on explaining the parameters of a confusion matrix and their equations, as well as providing some results from a dataset. It does not provide information on the training process or the criteria used to determine when training is complete.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
