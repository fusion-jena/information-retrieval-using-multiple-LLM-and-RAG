Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to data analysis of song structures, specifically the tracking of vocalisations of different song patterns. There is no mention of a deep learning model, cross-validation, stratified splitting, or any other measures to ensure generalizability. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a meaningful answer to this query.
