Answer:::
The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not traditional computer vision datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the pipeline uses audio datasets for bioacoustic classification. The specific datasets used are:

* A training/validation dataset consisting of 6363 hours of audio from ten independent sites (five solar-powered bioacoustic recorders and five Audiomoth recorders).
* A test dataset consisting of 2735 hours of audio from nine independent sites (four solar-powered bioacoustic recorders and five Audiomoth recorders) that were different from the training/validation dataset.

These datasets contain unlabelled audio data, which were used to train and test a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for automated wildlife call recognition, specifically for the detection of Superb Lyrebird (Menura novaehollandiae) calls.
