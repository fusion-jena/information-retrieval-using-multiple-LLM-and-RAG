Answer:::

The provided context does not specifically discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the importance of pre-trained CNNs and the limitations of using pre-trained models on novel input data that may be distantly related or complex.

It mentions that pre-trained CNNs, such as those trained on ImageNet, can be used as a starting point for recognition tasks, but may not perform well if the input data is not relevant to the data the CNN was originally trained on. This suggests that data bias may be a concern when using pre-trained models, but it does not provide specific techniques for addressing this issue.

The context does mention the importance of having a diverse dataset, citing the example of ImageNet, which comprises over 14 million high-resolution images across nearly 22,000 categories. This suggests that collecting a diverse dataset may be one way to address data bias, but it does not provide further guidance on techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
