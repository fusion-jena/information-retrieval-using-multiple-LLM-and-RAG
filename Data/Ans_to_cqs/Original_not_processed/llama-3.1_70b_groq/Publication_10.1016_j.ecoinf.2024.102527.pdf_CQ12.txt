Answer:::
Answer: The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a DCNN (Deep Convolutional Neural Network) model, specifically the ResNext-101 model, which is a member of the ResNeXt family of models. This model combines the advantages of the ResNet and InceptionV3 models, and is widely used for image recognition tasks, including empty camera trap image recognition.
