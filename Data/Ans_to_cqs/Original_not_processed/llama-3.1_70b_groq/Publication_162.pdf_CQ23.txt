Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as D-Mask R-CNN. However, it does mention that the model uses weights pre-trained on the Microsoft COCO dataset, which is a large and diverse dataset. This suggests that the model may have been trained on a diverse dataset, which can help improve its generalizability.

Additionally, the context mentions that the evaluation of D-Mask R-CNN is restricted to instances of deers, which is the most common species in the RGB-D dataset. This suggests that the model may not have been evaluated on a diverse range of species, which could impact its generalizability to other species.

There is no mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting in the provided context. Therefore, it is unclear whether these techniques were used to ensure the generalizability of the model.

Overall, while the use of pre-trained weights on a diverse dataset may help improve the generalizability of the model, the lack of information on other techniques such as cross-validation and stratified splitting makes it difficult to fully assess the measures taken to ensure the model's generalizability.
