Answer:::
The text mentions that the resurgence of Neural Networks as a strong possibility for classification tasks was made possible by the "latest GPU" providing new computational power. However, it does not explicitly state that GPUs were used for training the deep learning model in this specific case. It only mentions that the latest GPU made Neural Networks a strong possibility for classification tasks in general.
