Answer: 
The text mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for predicting whether an image is empty (Tabak et al., 2019; Tabak et al., 2020). Additionally, it mentions the use of object detection models that localize target objects (animals) within an image, which can be used to filter empty images. However, it does not specify the type of deep learning model used for object detection. It only mentions that the object detection model can indicate the location of each target object within an image, which is often achieved through the use of bounding boxes.
