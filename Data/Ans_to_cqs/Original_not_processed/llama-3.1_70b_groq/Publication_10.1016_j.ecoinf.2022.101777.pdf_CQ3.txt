Answer: The provided context does not specifically mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the images were classified using Random Forest (RF), a machine learning technique that uses decision trees to classify pixels. The context also mentions that the number of training samples was 5000 and the number of trees was 500.

It does not provide information on specific data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context seems to focus more on the machine learning technique used for image classification rather than the data annotation techniques used in the pipeline.
