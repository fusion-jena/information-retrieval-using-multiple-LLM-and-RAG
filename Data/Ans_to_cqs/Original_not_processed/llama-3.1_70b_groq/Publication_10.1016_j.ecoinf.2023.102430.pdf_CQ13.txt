Answer:::
The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, specifically the AlexNet (AN) model, are as follows:

* Optimizer: Stochastic gradient descent with momentum
* Initial learning rate: 0.001
* Maximum number of epochs: 15

These hyperparameters were set after preliminary tests, and the default settings were used for all other hyperparameters.
