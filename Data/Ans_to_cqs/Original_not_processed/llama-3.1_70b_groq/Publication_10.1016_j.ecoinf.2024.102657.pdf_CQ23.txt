Answer:

To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the dataset was split into a training set, a validation set, and a testing set. The training set consisted of 70% of the songs in each dialect folder, the validation set consisted of 10%, and the testing set consisted of the remaining 20%. This split was done to reduce variability between tests.

Additionally, the use of a validation set allowed for the tuning of hyperparameters of the CNN. The k-NN model also used the training and validation sets, totaling 80% of the full dataset, to fit the model. The remaining 20% of the data set was reserved for testing the model's ability to classify songs correctly.

It is also mentioned that the dataset was not preprocessed excessively, with the goal of demonstrating the power of human-machine teaming with minimal preprocessing. This suggests that the model was trained on a relatively diverse dataset, with minimal manipulation of the data.

However, it is not explicitly mentioned whether cross-validation or stratified splitting were used. The splitting of the data into training, validation, and testing sets was done based on the order of the songs in each dialect folder, with the first 70% being used for training, the next 10% for validation, and the last 20% for testing.
