Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context mentions the use of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) as an optimization method for finding the coefficients W, but it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of a deep learning algorithm for early diagnosis of COVID-19-affected patients based on X-ray and computed tomography images, as mentioned in the paper by Castillo (2020). But it does not provide details about the optimization techniques used in this algorithm.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query, and I would like to say that I don't know the answer.
