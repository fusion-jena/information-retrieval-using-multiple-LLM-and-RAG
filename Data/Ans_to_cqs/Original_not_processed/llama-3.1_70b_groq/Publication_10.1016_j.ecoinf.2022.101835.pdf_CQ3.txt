Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on the optimization of machine learning models (RF, ANN, and GBDT) for predicting flowering dates, and the evaluation of their performance using metrics such as MSE, MAE, and R2. It does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
