Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the implementation details, such as the framework used (PyTorch), the training process, and the hyperparameters chosen. However, it does not provide information on model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related steps.

Therefore, I do not know the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
