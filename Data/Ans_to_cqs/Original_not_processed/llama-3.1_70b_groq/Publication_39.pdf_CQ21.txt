Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, it does mention the evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance.

The context mentions that a true positive detection (TP) is given if the confidence score is greater than a threshold (e.g., 0.5), the IoU (Intersection over Union) is greater than a threshold (e.g., 0.5), and the class prediction is correct. This suggests that the model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, and IoU.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model's performance is evaluated on a test set, which includes 20% of the video clips of each class. The remaining clips are used for training and validation.

However, the context does not mention the use of saliency maps or the calculation of a confusion matrix as postprocessing steps. It is possible that these steps are performed, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the context does not provide enough information to determine the postprocessing steps involved after model training, except for the evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance.
