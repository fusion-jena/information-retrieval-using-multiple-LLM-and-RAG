Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The text discusses the performance of the Microsoft AI for Earth MegaDetector model in detecting wildlife in camera trap images, but it does not provide information on the model's architecture or training parameters. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the given context.
