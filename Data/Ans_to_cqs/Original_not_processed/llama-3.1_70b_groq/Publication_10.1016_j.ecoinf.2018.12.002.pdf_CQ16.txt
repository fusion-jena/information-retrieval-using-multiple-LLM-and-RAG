Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily discusses the use of support vector machines and other supervised learning algorithms for automated interpretation of field data on free-living animals, as well as the accuracy of classifying behavioral modes using training data from captive surrogate individuals. It does not delve into the details of the training process or the criteria used to determine its completion.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
