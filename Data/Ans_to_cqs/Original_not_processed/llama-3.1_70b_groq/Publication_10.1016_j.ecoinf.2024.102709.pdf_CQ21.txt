Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the training process, including the use of k-fold cross-validation, YOLO training losses, and mAP50 values to determine the ideal training-test split for the model. It also discusses the comparison of different loss training values and the use of various datasets for training. However, it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps, such as the creation of saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
