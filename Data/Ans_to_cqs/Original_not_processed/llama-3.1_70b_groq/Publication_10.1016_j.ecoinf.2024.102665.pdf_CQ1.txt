Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the references provided, it can be inferred that some studies utilized underwater spectral images (Methods Ecol. Evol. 14 (2), 596â€“613) and coral reef monitoring nodes (Ecological Informatics 82(2024)10266513) for data collection.

Additionally, the study by Villon et al. (2021) mentions the use of underwater fish species classification with limited data, but it does not provide information on the data collection methods. Another study by Yee et al. (2014b) compares methods for quantifying reef ecosystem services, but it does not specifically mention the data collection methods used in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be said that underwater spectral images and coral reef monitoring nodes might be used for collecting raw data, but the exact methods used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned.
