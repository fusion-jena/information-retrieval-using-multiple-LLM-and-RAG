Answer: Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline uses image data formats. The text mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning methods, which are commonly used for image classification tasks. Additionally, the text mentions the use of pre-trained models such as AlexNet, DenseNet-201, GoogLeNet, ResNet-101, ResNet-18, VGG-16, and VGG-19, which are all primarily used for image classification tasks.

There is also a mention of audio data in the context of beehive monitoring, where the authors used deep learning-based approaches for bee sound identification. However, this seems to be a separate task from the image classification pipeline.

There is no mention of video or CSV data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, based on the provided context, it appears that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data.
