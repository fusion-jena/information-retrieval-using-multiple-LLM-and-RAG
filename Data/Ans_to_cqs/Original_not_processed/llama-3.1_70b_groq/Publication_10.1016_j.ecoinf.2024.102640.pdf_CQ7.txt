Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to focus on the architecture and performance of specific models, such as SegFormer and EPDNet, but does not provide information on data splitting.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to split data into training, validation, and testing sets to evaluate and improve the performance of a model. The typical split is 80% for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing, but this can vary depending on the specific problem and dataset.

In the context of the provided text, it is mentioned that the EPDNet model was trained using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function and the Adam optimizer, and its performance was evaluated using the R2 metric. However, the specific data splitting criteria used for this model are not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not know the exact criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training in this specific context.
