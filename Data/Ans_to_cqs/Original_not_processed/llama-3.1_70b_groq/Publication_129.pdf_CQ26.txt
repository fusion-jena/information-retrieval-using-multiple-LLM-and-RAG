Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the architecture and components of a deep learning model for agricultural pest recognition, as well as references to various research papers and studies.

However, it does mention the use of a large-scale benchmark dataset for insect pest recognition (IP102) and the importance of using diverse data collection methods. This suggests that the authors may have considered data bias and diversity during the data collection process, but the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing are not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to the query.
