Answer: The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using Bayesian optimization. According to the text, "This selection was made because it does not require to study every possible combination of the parameters in a grid search, it works by incorporating the information that was learned in previous function evaluations to choose an optimal set of coordinates of the search space for the next evaluation." This indicates that the authors chose Bayesian optimization over grid search or random search because it is more efficient and effective in finding the optimal hyperparameters.
