Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. It discusses the preprocessing steps, network design, and the architecture of the model, but it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. 

However, it does mention that the test dataset was used to assess the performance of the final optimized neural network, and it provides the mean IoU and accuracy values for each scenario in Table 1. This suggests that some metrics calculation was performed, but the specific details of the postprocessing steps are not provided.
