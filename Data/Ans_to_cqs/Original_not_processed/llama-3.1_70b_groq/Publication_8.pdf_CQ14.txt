Answer:::
The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the model's performance on the Herbarium Senckenbergianum annotated dataset, the average precision of each type of organ, and the model's re-training and testing on a different un-annotated dataset. However, it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process.
