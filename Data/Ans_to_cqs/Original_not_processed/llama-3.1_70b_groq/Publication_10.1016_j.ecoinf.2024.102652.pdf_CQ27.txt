Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not provide information on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only discusses the training process, including data normalization, batch size, optimizer, learning ratio, epochs, and loss function. It also mentions the experimental design flow chart and the proposed MU-Net model structure, but it does not provide information on model deployment.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
