Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or any measures taken to ensure its generalizability. The context appears to be discussing the use of an ensemble model, specifically a weighted-averaging approach, to predict habitat suitability for three species of ungulates. The context mentions the use of five component models (GLM, MaxEnt, RF, GBM, and MARS) and the evaluation of their performance using metrics such as AUC and TSS.

However, it does mention the use of a test data set to evaluate the predictive accuracy of individual models, which suggests some form of cross-validation or model evaluation. Additionally, the context mentions the use of a weighted-averaging approach to combine the predictions of individual models, which may help to improve the generalizability of the ensemble model.

But, there is no specific mention of measures such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of the model.
