Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the deployment process of the trained model. The text only discusses the performance of different machine learning methods (Random Forest, etc.) and the selection of the best method for building prediction models. It also mentions the training of models for each species using selected variables, but it does not provide information on how the trained models were deployed. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
