Answer: I don't know. The provided context does not mention any datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to a study on classifying animal population time series using machine learning techniques, specifically Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and hierarchical clustering. The study uses a dataset of 15 rabbit population time series from the state of Mississippi, USA, but it does not mention any deep learning pipeline or datasets commonly used in deep learning.
