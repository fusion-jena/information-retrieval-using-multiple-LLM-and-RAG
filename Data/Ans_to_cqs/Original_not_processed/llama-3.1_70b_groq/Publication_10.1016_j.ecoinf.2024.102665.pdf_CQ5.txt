Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on coral reef ecosystems, marine biology, and the application of machine learning techniques to analyze images and data related to these topics.

However, I can mention that some studies mentioned in the context, such as Villon et al. (2021) and Do and Tran (2023), use underwater images and data for fish species classification and habitat mapping, but the specific datasets used are not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline.
