Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the pipeline primarily deals with image data. The context mentions techniques such as auto-orientation, resizing, tiling, and filtering, which are commonly used for image preprocessing. Additionally, the mention of a uniform size of 640 Ã— 640 pixels and the use of convolutional neural network architectures further supports the idea that the pipeline is working with image data. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats in the provided context.
