Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context appears to be related to a research study involving image classification, but it primarily focuses on the methodology, data curation, and challenges faced during the study. It does mention the use of multiple classifiers working together to improve accuracy, but it does not delve into the specifics of postprocessing steps. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this query.
