Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the design and structure of the model, its application in ecology, and its performance in detecting water quality pollution. It does not provide information on model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related processes. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this query.
