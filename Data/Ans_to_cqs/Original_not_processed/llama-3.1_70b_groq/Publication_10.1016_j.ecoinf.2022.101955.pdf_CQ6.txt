Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the use of machine learning algorithms, specifically kNN, SVM, ANN, and RF, for land use and land cover (LULC) classification. It discusses the architecture of the ANN model, the use of the "nnet" package, and the tuning parameters for the model, but it does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

However, it is generally known that preprocessing steps are crucial in preparing data for training a deep learning model. Common preprocessing steps include data cleaning, handling missing values, normalization, scaling, and feature engineering. But without specific information from the context, I cannot provide a detailed answer to this query.

Therefore, I must say that I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model based on the provided context.
