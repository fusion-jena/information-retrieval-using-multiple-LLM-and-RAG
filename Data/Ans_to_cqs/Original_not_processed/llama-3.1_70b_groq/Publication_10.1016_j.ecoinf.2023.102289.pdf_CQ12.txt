Answer:

The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically a variant of the ResNet architecture. According to the provided context, LaDeco employs the deeplabv3 + resnet269 model, where deeplabv3 is a semantic segmentation algorithm developed by Google, and Resnet269 is a 269-layer Resnet neural network. This suggests that the model is a CNN-based architecture, which is commonly used for image recognition and segmentation tasks.
