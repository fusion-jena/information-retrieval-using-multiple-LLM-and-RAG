Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is a repeated nested k-fold cross-validation approach. This approach involves an outer 10 k-fold cross-validation that divides the data into holdout data and data for model development. An inner 5 k-fold cross-validation is then used to minimize the bias caused by tuning of hyperparameters on training results. The training performance is calculated based on the inner cross-validated ensemble, while the testing performance is determined by selecting the optimal set of hyperparameters from the entire training set to predict on the holdout data. This process is repeated 15 times for each unique model to reduce the potential bias and variance related to random sampling.
