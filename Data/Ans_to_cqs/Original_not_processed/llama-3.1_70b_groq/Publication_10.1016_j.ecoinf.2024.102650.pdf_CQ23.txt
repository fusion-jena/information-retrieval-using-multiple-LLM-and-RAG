Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not provide information on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context appears to be a snippet from a research paper discussing the use of the ERNIE model for text processing and emotional analysis tasks. It mentions the model's performance on various Chinese tasks and its comparison with other models, but it does not provide information on the dataset, cross-validation, or splitting strategies used to ensure the model's generalizability.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
