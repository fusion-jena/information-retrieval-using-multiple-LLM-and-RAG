Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on the application of machine learning, specifically Random Forest (RF), to classify the reproductive condition in fish, using data from Chilean hake. The context mentions that the data used is confidential and does not provide any information on the annotation techniques used.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query regarding the specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline.
