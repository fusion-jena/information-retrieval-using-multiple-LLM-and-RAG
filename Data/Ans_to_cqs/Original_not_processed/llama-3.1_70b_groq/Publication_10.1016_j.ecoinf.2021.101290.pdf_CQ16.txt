Unfortunately, the provided context does not provide a clear answer to the query. The context appears to be a collection of references and snippets from various papers and sources, mostly related to machine learning, computer vision, and event-stream processing. However, none of the provided text specifically addresses the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau.

Therefore, I must say that I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
