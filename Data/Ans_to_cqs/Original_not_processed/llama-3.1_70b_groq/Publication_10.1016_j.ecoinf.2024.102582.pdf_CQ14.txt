Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the optimization of hyperparameters or the use of techniques such as grid search or random search. The context appears to be related to a study on mangrove forest landscape evolution, and it discusses the use of a spatial variance indicator (q) to detect the influence of driving factors on mangrove forest area. However, it does not provide information on the optimization of hyperparameters for a model.
