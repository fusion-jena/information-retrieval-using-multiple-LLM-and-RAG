Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning methods, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification tasks. It discusses the design of a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1-D-CNN) and its performance on a UAV hyperspectral image dataset.

However, it does mention that the labeled pixels of the UAV hyperspectral image were split into a training set and a test set with a ratio of 1:9. This suggests that some form of data preparation or preprocessing was performed, but the specific steps involved are not detailed.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model.
