Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of image augmentation, which can help reduce overfitting and increase the robustness of the model to random variations in the data.

Specifically, the context mentions that image augmentation was applied in the form of horizontal flip, 0.2 degree counter-clockwise shear, and a random zoom between 0 and 0.2. This suggests that the model is designed to be robust to certain types of random variations in the data, but it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the broader deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I do not know the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value.
