Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses the data pre-processing, convolutional neural networks, and the training parameters (e.g., batch size, epochs, dropout rate, and learning rate), but it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training the model.
