Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context primarily focuses on the supervised learning workflow, data collection, and the use of the Random Forest classifier for woody cover classification. It does mention the creation of training and validation datasets, but it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to split the data.

However, it does mention that the training and validation points were collected from sampling plots within each vegetation type, ensuring that the points were representative of the diverse vegetation within each boundary. This suggests that the data splitting may have been done in a way that ensures the training and validation datasets are representative of the different vegetation types, but the exact criteria used are not specified.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to the query.
