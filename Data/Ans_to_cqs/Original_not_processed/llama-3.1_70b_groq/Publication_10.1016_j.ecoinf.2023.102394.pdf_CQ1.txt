Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of existing datasets, such as the SOCS (Soil Organic Carbon Stocks) database, which contains data from 2010 to 2014. This suggests that public datasets may be one source of raw data used in the deep learning pipeline.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of various studies and research papers that have utilized deep learning techniques for predicting soil carbon mapping, ecological analysis, and other related tasks. These studies may have used various methods for collecting raw data, such as surveys, sensors, or other data collection methods, but the specific methods are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that public datasets may be one source of raw data used in the deep learning pipeline, but the specific methods used for collecting raw data are not explicitly mentioned.
