Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, based on the context, it appears that the study focuses on model training and feature selection using techniques such as Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Variable Selection Using Random Forests (VSURF).

While the context does not provide a clear answer to the query, it does mention the use of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as a termination condition for model performance in the RFE algorithm. This suggests that the study may have involved the calculation of metrics such as RMSE to evaluate model performance.

Additionally, the study appears to have used spatial cross-validation to prevent overfitting and evaluate model performance on unseen regions. However, the context does not provide information on the calculation of confusion matrices or the creation of saliency maps.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I can only provide a partial answer to the query. It appears that the study may have involved the calculation of metrics such as RMSE to evaluate model performance, but the context does not provide information on other postprocessing steps such as the creation of saliency maps or confusion matrices.
