Answer:::

To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, cross-validation was used, with each model using a cross-validation of 5 folds. This helps to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data and reduces the risk of overfitting.

Additionally, data augmentation techniques were applied while training the models. This involves artificially increasing the size of the dataset by creating new samples from the existing ones, which helps to increase the model's ability to generalize and its accuracy on the test dataset. Data augmentation is particularly useful when dealing with a low amount of data, as it reduces the risk of overfitting by exposing the model to more variations.

Furthermore, the models were trained with the same parameters, including an initial learning rate, weight decay, and optimizer, which helps to ensure that any differences in performance are due to the model architecture rather than the training parameters.

It is also worth noting that the models were evaluated using the mean average precision (mAP) and average precision (AP) metrics, which provide a score for the whole model and for each species, respectively. This helps to ensure that the model is reliable enough to be used by experts in real-life conditions.

However, it is not mentioned whether a diverse dataset or stratified splitting were used to ensure the generalizability of the model.
