Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The text only discusses the architecture configurations, pre-trained models, and experimental setup, but does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
