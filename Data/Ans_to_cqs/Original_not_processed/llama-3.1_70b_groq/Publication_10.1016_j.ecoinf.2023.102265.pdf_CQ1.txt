Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the feature extraction process using ResNet-50 and the use of pre-trained models with the ImageNet database. It does not provide information on data collection methods such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
