Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention that the pipeline uses a large dataset to learn an embedding model, and then fine-tunes it on a target dataset. The context also mentions the eMammal dataset and the NACTI dataset, which are used for validation and testing purposes. It can be inferred that the pipeline uses camera trap images, but the specific datasets used for training the embedding model are not mentioned.
