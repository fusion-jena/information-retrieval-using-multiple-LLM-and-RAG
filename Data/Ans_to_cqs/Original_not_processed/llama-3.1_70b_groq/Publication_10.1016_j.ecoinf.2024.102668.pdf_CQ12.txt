Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific deep learning model used in a pipeline. It mentions the potential extension of acoustic indices to fields like machine learning and deep learning, but it does not provide information about a specific model. The context appears to be focused on the importance of reducing device bias in acoustic recordings and enhancing the applicability of acoustic indices, but it does not delve into the specifics of deep learning models.
