Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be related to evaluating the performance of machine learning models in predicting groundwater salinity hazard maps, but it does not provide information on data splitting criteria.

However, in general, common practices for splitting data for deep learning model training include:

* Random splitting: dividing the data into training, testing, and validation sets using random sampling.
* Stratified splitting: dividing the data into training, testing, and validation sets while maintaining the same proportion of class labels in each set.
* K-fold cross-validation: dividing the data into k subsets, using k-1 subsets for training and the remaining subset for testing, and repeating the process k times.

But without more specific information, I don't know the exact criteria used in this specific context.
