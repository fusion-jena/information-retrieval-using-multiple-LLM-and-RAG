Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is classification, specifically call recognition for the southern black-throated finch. The model is designed to identify and classify audio frames as either target (southern black-throated finch calls) or non-target (other sounds). The model development pipeline, as shown in Fig. 3, incorporates active learning iterations to improve the model's performance in recognizing the calls of this threatened species.
