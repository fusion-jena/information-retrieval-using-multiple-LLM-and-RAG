Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the model architecture, training phases, and the use of contrastive learning and weakly-supervised learning. It does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

However, it does mention that the model achieves a high accuracy of 94% and has a more than 22Ã— shorter turnaround time, indicating that the model's performance is evaluated using some metrics. But the specific details of the postprocessing steps are not provided.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
