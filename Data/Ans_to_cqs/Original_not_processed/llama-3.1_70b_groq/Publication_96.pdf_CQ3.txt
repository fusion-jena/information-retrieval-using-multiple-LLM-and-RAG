Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the researchers collected spectral training samples of burned and non-burned areas for the entire study area, which were "well distributed in space." This suggests that the researchers may have used some form of labeling or annotation to identify the burned and non-burned areas in the training data.

The context also mentions that the researchers used a semi-automatic methodological approach for mapping burned areas, which involved collecting spectral training samples, training the deep learning models, developing model prediction, and model assessment. However, it does not provide further details on the specific data annotation techniques used.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.
