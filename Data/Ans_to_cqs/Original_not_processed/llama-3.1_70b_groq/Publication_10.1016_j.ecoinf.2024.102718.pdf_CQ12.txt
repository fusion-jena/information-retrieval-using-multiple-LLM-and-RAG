Answer: The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a combination of a Vision Transformer (ViT) and other architectures, specifically Xception. The model is called BEiT, which leverages transformer capabilities and is designed for vision tasks. It uses a transformer architecture to process images, and its performance is enhanced by incorporating depthwise separable convolutions from the Xception model.
