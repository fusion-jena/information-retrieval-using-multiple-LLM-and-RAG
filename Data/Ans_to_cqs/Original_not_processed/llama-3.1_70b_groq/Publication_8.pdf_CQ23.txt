Answer:::

To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. 

Firstly, the model was trained on a dataset of 653 annotated images, which is a relatively small dataset. To overcome this limitation, transfer learning was implemented to initialize the model weights pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. This allowed the model to leverage the knowledge learned from a large and diverse dataset.

Secondly, the model was trained twice: once on a subset of 498 images and then on the entire dataset of 653 images. This allowed the model to learn from a larger dataset and adapt to new data.

Thirdly, the model was evaluated on a test subset of 155 images, which is separate from the training data. This helped to assess the model's performance on unseen data and ensured that it was not overfitting to the training data.

Lastly, the model was also evaluated on an independent dataset of 708 full-scale herbarium scans from the Herbarium Senckenbergianum (FR), which has a different set of species and geographical origins. This helped to assess the model's ability to generalize to new and unseen data.

However, it is not mentioned in the provided context whether cross-validation or stratified splitting were used to ensure the generalizability of the model.
