Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the research involves "aerial surveys" and "remotely sensed imagery" for wildlife conservation. It also mentions the use of "oblique imagery" and "high-definition oblique camera systems" in some of the referenced studies.

Additionally, the context mentions that the research is focused on "African savanna" and "wildlife population estimation", suggesting that the data collection methods may involve aerial surveys of wildlife populations in these regions.

However, without more specific information, it is not possible to provide a detailed answer to the query. The context does not mention the use of sensors or public datasets for collecting raw data, and it is unclear what other methods may be used in the deep learning pipeline.
