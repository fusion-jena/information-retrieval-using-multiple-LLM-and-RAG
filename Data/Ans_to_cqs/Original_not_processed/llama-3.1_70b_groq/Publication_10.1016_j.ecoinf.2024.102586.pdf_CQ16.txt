Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be related to a study on invasive plant species in the Kashmir Himalaya, using techniques such as spatial autocorrelation plots and random forest models. It discusses the importance of various environmental and anthropogenic predictors, but does not provide information on the training process or the criteria used to determine when training is complete.
