Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning and deep learning models in environmental research, specifically in predicting algal blooms and water temperature profiles.

However, it can be inferred that the researchers may have employed techniques to ensure reproducibility and consistency in their results, as they report specific performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, AUC, MAE) for their models. This might involve setting a fixed random seed value to ensure that the same sequence of random numbers is generated each time the model is run.

In the context of hyperparameter tuning (Table 1), the researchers seem to have explored different combinations of hyperparameters, which might involve random initialization of weights or other random processes. However, the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned.

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query based on the provided context.
