Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be an abstract and references for a research article on using convolutional neural networks for hydrothermal vents substratum classification, but it does not include information on where the data or code for the pipeline is stored or shared.
