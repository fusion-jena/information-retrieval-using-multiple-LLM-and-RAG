Answer:::
The provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that a 5 × 10-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate the performance of the models. This suggests that the data was split into 10 folds, and each fold was used as a test set once, while the remaining 9 folds were used as a training set. This process was repeated 5 times, resulting in 50 different training and test sets. 

However, it does not provide information on how the data was split for validation. It only mentions that the results of the validation of the trained models are shown in Table 5, but it does not provide the table or explain how the validation was performed. 

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the context does not provide enough information to determine the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, but it does mention the use of 5 × 10-fold cross-validation for model evaluation.
