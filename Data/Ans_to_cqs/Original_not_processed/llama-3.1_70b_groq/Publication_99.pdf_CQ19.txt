Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models. It only provides information about the architectures (PConv networks, Pix2Pix networks, and classification networks), their parameters, and training procedures. Therefore, I do not know which frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) are used to build the deep learning models.
