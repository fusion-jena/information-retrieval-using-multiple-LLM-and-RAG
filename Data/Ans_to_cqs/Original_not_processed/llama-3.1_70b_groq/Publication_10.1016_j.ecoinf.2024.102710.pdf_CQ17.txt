Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses various aspects of deep learning, such as transfer learning, active learning, and embedding layers, but it does not provide information on regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization.

However, it does mention the use of entropy loss or custom loss functions, which could be related to regularization, but it is not explicitly stated. Additionally, the text mentions the use of batch normalization in the context of BirdNet, which can also help with regularization, but it is not clear if it is used for this purpose in this specific pipeline.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to the question about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
