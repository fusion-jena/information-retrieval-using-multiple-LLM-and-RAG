Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is calculated, and its formula is provided as:

MAE = 1/n âˆ‘|X - Y|

where X is the GEDI CHM, Y is the local CHM, and n is the number of pixels.

Additionally, it is mentioned that R2, RMSE, and MAE are calculated when the HH (calculated with the GEDI CHMs using the 4 heterogeneity indices) is correlated by linear regression with the tree species diversity.

It is also mentioned that the Shannon's H index is used, which is a measure of diversity, but it is not a metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model.

Therefore, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are MAE, R2, and RMSE, but not accuracy, precision, or recall.
