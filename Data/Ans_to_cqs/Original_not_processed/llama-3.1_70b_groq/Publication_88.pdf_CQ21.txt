Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. However, it does mention the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the models.

According to the context, the performance of the evaluated methods was expressed in terms of Overall Accuracy (OA), F1-Score, and Alarm Area (AA). The Overall Accuracy (OA) is defined as the percentage of samples correctly classified in relation to the total samples. The F1-Score is also mentioned, but its definition is not provided in the context. The Alarm Area (AA) is defined as the proportion of the area flagged as potentially deforested.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of Recall, which is defined in Equation (4), but the equation itself is not provided. It also mentions the use of a validation set to stop training once the loss increases in 10 consecutive epochs (early stopping) for the EF and SN methods.

Therefore, while the context provides some information on the evaluation metrics used, it does not provide a comprehensive overview of the postprocessing steps involved after model training.
