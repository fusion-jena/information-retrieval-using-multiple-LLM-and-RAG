Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that deep neural networks can be used with very large input feature sets, such as complete pixel arrays for images or x/y values. In the context of the study, the data used appears to be GPS tracking data, which is typically stored in a format such as CSV or a similar tabular format. The study also mentions the use of dive data, but the format of this data is not specified. Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline may include CSV or similar tabular formats, as well as possibly other formats such as those used to store GPS tracking data.
