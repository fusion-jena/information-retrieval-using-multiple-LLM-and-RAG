Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is based on the Bayesian workflow described by Gelman et al. (Gelman et al., 2020). This is an iterative modeling process in which one systematically repeats the cycle of inspecting the outputs of a model, analyzing the effects of the model and its configurations, and adjusting the configurations or switching to another model type according to the observations. The cycle is repeated multiple times while recording the observations and results. This approach allows for continuous monitoring and evaluation of the model's performance during training, enabling adjustments to be made as needed to improve the model's performance.
