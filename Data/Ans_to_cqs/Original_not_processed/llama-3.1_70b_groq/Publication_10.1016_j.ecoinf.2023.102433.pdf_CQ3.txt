I don't know. The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a web service for accessing NASA data, specifically MODIS data, and discusses topics such as data management, handling, and licenses of use. It does not provide information on data annotation techniques or deep learning pipelines.
