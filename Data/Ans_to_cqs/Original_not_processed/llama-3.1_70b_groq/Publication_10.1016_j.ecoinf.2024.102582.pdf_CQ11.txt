Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing the use of remote sensing and machine learning for mangrove forest analysis, but it does not provide information on a specific data repository link. The references cited in the context are mostly academic papers and do not include a link to a data repository. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
