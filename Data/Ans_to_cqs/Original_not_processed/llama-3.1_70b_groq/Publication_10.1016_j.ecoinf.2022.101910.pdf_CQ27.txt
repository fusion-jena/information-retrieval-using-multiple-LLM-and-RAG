Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. The context primarily focuses on the development and application of BirdNET, a research project for automated bird species identification, and its use in passive acoustic monitoring. It does not provide details on the deployment process of the trained model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
