Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about model optimization or hyperparameter tuning. It appears to be a discussion about forest management and diversity indices, with a focus on estimators and their performance. There is no mention of machine learning models or hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
