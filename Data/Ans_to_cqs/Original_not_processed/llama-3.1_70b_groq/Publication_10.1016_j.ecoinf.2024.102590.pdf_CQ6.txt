Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The text primarily discusses the supervised learning workflow, data collection, and the use of aerial images for land cover classification. It also mentions the potential use of deep learning methods, such as CNN, for future analysis, but does not provide details on the preprocessing steps.

However, it does mention the creation of training and validation datasets, which suggests that some form of data preparation was involved. Additionally, the text mentions the division of training point features into two cover classes ('non-woody' and 'woody'), which could be considered a form of data preprocessing. Nevertheless, the specific preprocessing steps involved, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning, are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
