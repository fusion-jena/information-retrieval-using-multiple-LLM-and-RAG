Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model performance is monitored through the evaluation of the overall accuracy of the classifier. The text mentions that "After the first 30,000 active queries, the classifier achieves 93.2% overall accuracy," which suggests that the model's performance is being tracked and evaluated at certain intervals. Additionally, the text mentions a "termination condition" in the active learning pipeline, which implies that the model's performance is being monitored and the training process is stopped when a certain condition is met. However, the specific details of the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance are not provided.
