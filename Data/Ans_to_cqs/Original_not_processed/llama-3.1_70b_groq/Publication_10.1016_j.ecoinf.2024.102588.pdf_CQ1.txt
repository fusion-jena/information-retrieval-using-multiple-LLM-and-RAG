Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNN) and autoencoders, to estimate aquatic ecosystem health indices. It mentions the use of ecological monitoring data, but it does not provide information on how this data is collected.

However, it can be inferred that the data collection methods might include sensors, as the context mentions the use of time series and static data related to the aquatic ecosystem. Additionally, public datasets might be used, as the context references various studies and research papers that could potentially utilize publicly available data.

Surveys are not explicitly mentioned as a data collection method in the provided context. Therefore, it is unclear whether surveys are used to collect raw data for the deep learning pipeline.

In summary, while the context does not provide explicit information on the methods used for collecting raw data, it can be inferred that sensors and public datasets might be used. However, the use of surveys as a data collection method is unclear.
