Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the training process, including data normalization, batch size, optimizer, learning ratio, and loss function. It also discusses the experimental design flow chart and the advantages of the MU-NET model.

However, it can be inferred that the model was trained on a dataset that includes various salinity indices, which might contribute to the model's ability to generalize well. Additionally, the use of an early stopping function with a patience of 20 epochs might help prevent overfitting, which can improve the model's generalizability.

Unfortunately, without more information, it is impossible to provide a more detailed answer to this question.
