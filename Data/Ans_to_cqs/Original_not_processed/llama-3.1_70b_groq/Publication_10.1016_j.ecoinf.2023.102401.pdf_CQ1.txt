Answer:

According to the provided context, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline specifically for underwater target detection are:

1. Water downloading gear: This is used to collect data from the underwater environment.
2. Sensors: These are used in conjunction with the water downloading gear to collect data.

Additionally, the context mentions that the dataset needs to be labeled in order to train and evaluate underwater target detection models. However, it does not specify whether public datasets are used or not.

It is also worth noting that the context does not mention surveys as a method for collecting raw data. The focus is on collecting data from the underwater environment using specialized gear and sensors.
