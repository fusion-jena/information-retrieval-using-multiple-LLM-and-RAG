Answer:::

The provided context does not specifically mention the use of a deep learning model. However, it does discuss the evaluation of classification models using various metrics. 

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the classification models are:

1. Overall Accuracy (OA)
2. User's Accuracy (UA)
3. Producer's Accuracy (PA)

Additionally, the context mentions the use of 10-fold cross-validation with three repetitions to assess the accuracy of the models. This process helps to find the best models with the largest overall accuracy and also reflects the resulting distribution models with minimums, maximums, quartiles, and medians.

It is worth noting that the context does not mention the use of precision and recall as evaluation metrics.
