Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and improvements of the MSNet and Res2Net modules for multi-object tracking (MOT) scenarios, but does not discuss regularization techniques. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
