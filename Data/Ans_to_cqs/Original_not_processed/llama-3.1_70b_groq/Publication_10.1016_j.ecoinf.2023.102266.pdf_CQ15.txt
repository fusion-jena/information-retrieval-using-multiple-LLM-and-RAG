Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be focused on a different topic, discussing modifications to a model, variance reduction strategies, and application to a real-world wildfire scenario. It does mention the use of machine learning tools, but it does not provide details on the specific optimization techniques used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
