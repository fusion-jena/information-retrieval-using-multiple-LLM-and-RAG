Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of deep learning in the context of animal biodiversity monitoring using acoustic monitoring (Chalmers, Fergus, Wich, Longmore, 2021). It also mentions the use of birdsong identification software such as Bird Song Id Australia and Raven Lite.

Based on this information, it can be inferred that the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline might involve some form of audio or acoustic annotation, such as labeling bird calls or sounds. However, without more specific information, it is difficult to provide a more detailed answer.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are likely related to audio or acoustic annotation, but the specific techniques used (e.g., bounding box annotation, instance segmentation) are not specified in the provided context.
