Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the classifiers (including the deep learning models) are precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics are considered more informative than accuracy, which can be highly influenced by the balance of classes in the testing data. Precision refers to the proportion of texts identified as relevant that were actually relevant, while recall refers to the proportion of relevant texts correctly identified as relevant. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of recall and precision.
