Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the pre-trained models, such as MobileNet, EfficientNet, ResNet-50, InceptionV3, and InceptionResNetV2, have been trained on "large-scale datasets" and "extensive datasets". 

Although the context does not provide the exact names of the datasets, it can be inferred that the models have been pre-trained on popular large-scale image classification datasets, given the mention of image classification tasks and the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). 

It is likely that the datasets used are similar to ImageNet, which is a common large-scale image classification dataset used for pre-training many deep learning models. However, without more specific information, it is impossible to determine the exact datasets used in the pipeline.
