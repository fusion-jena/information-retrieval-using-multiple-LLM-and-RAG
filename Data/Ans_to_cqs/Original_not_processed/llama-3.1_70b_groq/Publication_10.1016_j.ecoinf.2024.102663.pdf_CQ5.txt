Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context only mentions that deep learning techniques can be used to preprocess datasets under extreme conditions and that datasets can be tailored to specific use cases. It also mentions that incorporating Bidirectional LSTM with GloVe embeddings could enhance the detection and classification of fish species within the dataset. However, it does not provide information on the specific datasets used.
