Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the dataset division, deep learning models, and their architectures. It mentions that the dataset was shared by Jiang et al. (2020) through a Github repository, but it does not provide information on how the data was collected.

However, it can be inferred that the dataset might have been collected through some form of image or video capture, as the context mentions the use of deep learning models for image classification tasks, such as weed detection and plant disease detection. But the exact methods used for collecting the raw data are not specified.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to the query.
