Answer:::
The provided context does not mention the location of the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper or a technical document discussing the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for plant species identification, but it does not provide information about the code repository. Therefore, I do not know where the code repository is available.
