Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on various applications of deep learning methods, such as image analysis, network data examination, and biological data processing. It discusses the challenges of obtaining enough ground truth data, the use of crowd-sourcing for manual annotation, and the development of new frameworks for vectorization and examination of network data.

However, it does mention the use of crowd-sourcing for obtaining manual annotation, which can be seen as a way to collect diverse data and potentially address data bias. Additionally, the context highlights the importance of developing more specific detectors and user interfaces for easily marking desired components, which could be related to addressing data bias, but it is not explicitly stated.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query. The context does not mention techniques such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection as methods to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
