Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention deep learning model training or the criteria used to split data for such training. The context appears to be related to species distribution models, covariate selection procedures, and statistical modeling techniques such as Generalized Linear Models, Generalized Additive Models, and Random Forest. It does not provide information on deep learning model training or data splitting criteria.
