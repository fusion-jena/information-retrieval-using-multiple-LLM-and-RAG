Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a research paper on a cellular automaton model for predicting real-world phenomena such as wildfire spreads or pest plant propagation. It discusses the model's development, its comparison to other models, and its application to a real-world scenario. However, it does not provide information on the deployment process of a trained deep learning model.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
