Answer: The text mentions that the pipeline uses a model-agnostic approach, but it specifically mentions that the PCÎ¸ module is constructed using the Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) architecture, which is a type of CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). Additionally, it mentions other approaches that use similar architectures, such as FCRN (Fully Convolutional Regression Network) and U-Net, which are also types of CNNs. There is no mention of RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks) or Transformers in the provided text.
