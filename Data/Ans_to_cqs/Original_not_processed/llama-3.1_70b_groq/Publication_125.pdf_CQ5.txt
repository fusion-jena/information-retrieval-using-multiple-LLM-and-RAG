Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of popular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the DenseNet121 model, which is a CNN-based architecture, was trained on the ImageNet dataset. 

Additionally, the context describes a custom dataset created by the authors, which consists of satellite images divided into four classes: urban, bare soil, vegetation, and road. This dataset is further divided into three subsets: a training set with 22,666 images, a validation set with 7554 images, and a testing set with 7554 images. 

Therefore, the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are the ImageNet dataset (for the DenseNet121 model) and a custom satellite image dataset created by the authors.
