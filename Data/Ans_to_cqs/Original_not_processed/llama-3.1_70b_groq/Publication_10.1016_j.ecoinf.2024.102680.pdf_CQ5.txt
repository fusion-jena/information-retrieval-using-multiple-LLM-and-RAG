Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The text appears to be discussing the challenges of underwater optical image processing and the development of a new module (CSMB) to improve feature extraction and analysis. It mentions the use of YOLOv8 and other techniques, but does not mention any specific datasets.

Therefore, I must answer that I don't know what datasets are used in the deep learning pipeline, as this information is not provided in the context.
