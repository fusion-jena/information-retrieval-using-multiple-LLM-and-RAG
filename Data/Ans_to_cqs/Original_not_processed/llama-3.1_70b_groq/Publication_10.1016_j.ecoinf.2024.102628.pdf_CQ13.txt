Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The text only mentions that the authors used the fast.ai platform to train and validate models, and that they utilized the pretrained ResNet-34 architecture. It also mentions that the authors used a Leave-One-Group-Out cross-validation approach, but it does not provide details on the hyperparameters used. Therefore, I do not know the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
