Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The text only discusses the methodologies, architectures, and datasets used for pest detection and counting, but it does not provide information about the computational resources employed for training the models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
