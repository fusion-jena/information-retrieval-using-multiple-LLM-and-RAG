Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about monitoring model performance during training. It appears to be discussing the analysis of metrics and distances in the context of ecological informatics, specifically using a Deeplabv3+ model with COCO classes and Conditional Random Fields. The text discusses the computation of metrics, the use of linear models for regression analysis, and the observation of linear trends in scatter plots. However, it does not provide any information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training.
