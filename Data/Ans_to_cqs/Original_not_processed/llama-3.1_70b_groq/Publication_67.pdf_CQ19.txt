Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the framework used to build the deep learning model. It mentions the use of Inception v.3, which is a deep learning architecture, but it does not specify the framework used to implement it. Inception v.3 can be implemented in various frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras, but the context does not provide enough information to determine which one was used.
