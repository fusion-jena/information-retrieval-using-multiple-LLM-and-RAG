Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the context is image classification, specifically for butterfly classification. The model is trained to classify images of butterflies, which is a task that falls under the broader category of image recognition. The use of the AlexNet architecture, a well-known convolutional neural network (CNN) model, further supports this conclusion. The model is designed to extract features from images and use them to classify the images into different categories, which in this case is likely different species of butterflies.
