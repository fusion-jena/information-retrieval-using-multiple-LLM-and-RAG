Answer:::
The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a hybrid model that combines a Transformer with a CNN backbone, specifically ResNet. The Transformer is used to model global attention using the features extracted by the ResNet backbone. This approach is used to improve performance while reducing computing costs. Additionally, the pipeline also utilizes a Vision Transformer (ViT) model, which is a pure Transformer model that can replace conventional convolution processes.
