Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about monitoring model performance during training. The context appears to be related to a study on land use/cover changes, climate change, and vegetation responses, with equations and formulas describing the calculation of certain metrics. There is no mention of a model or its training process, so I am unable to provide an answer to the query.
