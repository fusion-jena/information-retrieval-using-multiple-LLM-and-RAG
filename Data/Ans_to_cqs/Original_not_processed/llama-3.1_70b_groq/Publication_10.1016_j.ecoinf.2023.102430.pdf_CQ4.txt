Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context only discusses the training and testing process, algorithm implementation, and hyperparameter settings, but does not provide information on data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, I don't know what data augmentation techniques were applied in the deep learning pipeline.
