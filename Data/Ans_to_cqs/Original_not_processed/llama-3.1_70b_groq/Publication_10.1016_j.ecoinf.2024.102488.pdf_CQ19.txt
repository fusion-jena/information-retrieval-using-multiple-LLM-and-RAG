Answer: None of the provided context mentions the use of deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context appears to be focused on traditional machine learning models, specifically gradient boosting decision trees (LightGBM, XGBoost) and random forests, as well as feature selection techniques like Recursive Feature Elimination and Cross-Validation (RFECV). There is no mention of deep learning models or frameworks.
