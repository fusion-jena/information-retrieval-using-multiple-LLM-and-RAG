Answer:

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are not explicitly stated in the provided context, but we can infer some of them from the text.

From Table 2, we can see that the performance of the model is evaluated using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) metric, which is a common metric used to evaluate the performance of classification models.

Additionally, the text mentions that the validation accuracy of the model is reported, which suggests that accuracy is also used as a metric to evaluate the performance of the model.

However, precision and recall are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, we cannot confirm whether these metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model.

It is worth noting that the context provides a comparison of the performance of different models, including classical machine learning models, and the performance is evaluated using the AUC metric.
