Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the model, including the use of convolutional and depth-wise separable convolutional layers, maxpooling, dropout, and dense layers. It also discusses the experimental results and potential directions for future research, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameters used during training.
