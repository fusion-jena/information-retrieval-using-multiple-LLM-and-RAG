Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning models, such as learning rate, optimizer, batch size, etc. The context only discusses the performance metrics used to evaluate the models, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and presents a comparison of the performance of different deep learning models on a dataset. It also mentions the use of data augmentation techniques to increase the size of the dataset, but does not provide information on the hyperparameters used in the models.
