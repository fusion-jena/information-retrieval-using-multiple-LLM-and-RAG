Answer:::

The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are to ensure that the samples in each set (training, validation, and test) are independent and have similar class distributions. This is to prevent information leakage between the data sets, especially when the images are captured in close proximity and potentially have overlapping fields of view.

In the context provided, the data is split into clusters, images, and polygons of each species. A cluster consists of multiple images acquired from the same location, potentially across multiple dates. An image contains zero, one, or multiple annotations. The data is then split into training, validation, and test sets, with the number of images and polygons for each species in each set provided in Table 2.

The specific criteria for splitting the data are not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that the data is split in a way that ensures the independence of the samples and maintains similar class distributions across the sets. This is likely done to ensure a proper evaluation of the model's performance on both the validation and test sets.

It is also mentioned that the naive approach of randomly sampling images from the full data set may not be suitable due to the potential for information leakage between the data sets. However, the exact method used to split the data in this context is not provided.
