Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the context is land use/land cover classification of mining regions using fused multi-sensor satellite data. This is stated in the paper by Kumar and Gorai (2023), which compares the performance of a deep convolutional neural network and a deep neural network for this specific task.
