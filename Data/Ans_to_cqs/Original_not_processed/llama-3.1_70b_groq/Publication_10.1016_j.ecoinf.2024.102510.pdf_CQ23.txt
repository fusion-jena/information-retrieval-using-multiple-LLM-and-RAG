Answer:::

The text mentions that the dataset used may not fully capture the diverse range of bird populations present in the wild, which can result in a biased representation and impact the accuracy and generalization ability of the model. To address this, the authors acknowledge the importance of considering the limitations and potential biases of the training dataset when interpreting the results.

Specifically, the text mentions that efforts should be made to collect more comprehensive and diverse datasets that better reflect the true variability of bird species. However, it does not provide information on whether such efforts were made in this particular study.

Regarding cross-validation and stratified splitting, the text mentions that the models were evaluated using a 60:40 split of training and testing data. This suggests that some form of data splitting was used to evaluate the models, but it does not provide further details on whether stratified splitting or cross-validation were used.

Therefore, while the authors acknowledge the importance of ensuring the generalizability of the model, the text does not provide detailed information on the specific measures taken to achieve this.
