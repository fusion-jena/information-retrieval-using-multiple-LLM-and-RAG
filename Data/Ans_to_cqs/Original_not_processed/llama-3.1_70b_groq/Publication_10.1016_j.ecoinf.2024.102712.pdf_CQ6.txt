Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS), discussing topics such as data integration, modeling frameworks, and climate change initiatives.

However, it does mention a simple atmospheric correction using the Dark Object Subtraction 1 (DOS1) method, which is a preprocessing step for remote sensing data. But this is not directly related to deep learning model training.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model based on the provided context.
