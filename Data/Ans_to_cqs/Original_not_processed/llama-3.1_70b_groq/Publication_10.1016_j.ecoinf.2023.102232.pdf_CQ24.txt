Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention deep learning or strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a genetic algorithm and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for parameter estimation in a biological model, and discusses the use of random values and Gaussian distributions, but does not mention deep learning or random seed values.
