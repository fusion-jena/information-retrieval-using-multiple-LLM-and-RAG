Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, and Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the model architecture, training process, and performance evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC). It also discusses the use of callbacks for dynamic learning rate adjustment and model checkpointing.

However, it does mention the calculation of various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC, which are commonly used to evaluate the performance of a model. Additionally, the context provides a table (Table 6) that presents the performance of different models on the PlantVillage dataset, including the proposed BEiT model.

Regarding Saliency maps and Confusion matrix, there is no explicit mention of these in the provided context. Saliency maps are typically used to visualize the importance of input features in predicting the output, while Confusion matrices are used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. If these steps are part of the postprocessing pipeline, they are not discussed in the provided context.
