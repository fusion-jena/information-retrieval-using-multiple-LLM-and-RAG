Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of batch normalization layers in the network architecture of the Deep Neural Network (DNN) model. Batch normalization is a technique used to normalize the input data for each layer, which can help improve the stability and speed of training.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a pre-trained ResNet-50 backbone in the U-Net model, which was pre-trained on ImageNet. This suggests that the input data may have been pre-processed to match the format and normalization used in the ImageNet dataset.

However, the context does not provide information on other preprocessing steps such as scaling, cleaning, or data augmentation. It is likely that these steps were performed, but the specific details are not mentioned.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the only preprocessing step that can be confirmed is the use of batch normalization in the DNN model. Other preprocessing steps may have been performed, but they are not explicitly mentioned.
