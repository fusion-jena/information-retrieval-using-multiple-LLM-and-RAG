Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The context appears to focus on the definition and calculation of various loss functions, including IoU, EIoU, and LFocal, as well as their components and parameters. It also provides some numerical values and visualizations, but it does not discuss the stopping criteria for training.

Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, as this information is not provided in the given context.
