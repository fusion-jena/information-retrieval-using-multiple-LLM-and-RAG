Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline, except for images. It is mentioned that the input to the ResNet-50 network is an image of 224x224 pixels, and the model is used for extracting image background features for classification. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline. Therefore, based on the provided context, the only confirmed data format used is images.
