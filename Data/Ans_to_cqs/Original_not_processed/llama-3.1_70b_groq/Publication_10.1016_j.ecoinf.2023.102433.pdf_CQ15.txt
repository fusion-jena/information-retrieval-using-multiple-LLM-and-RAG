Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context only mentions that deep learning analysis can be performed using Tensorflow, a machine learning and artificial intelligence open-source framework developed by the Google Brain team. It does not provide information on the optimization techniques used in the pipeline.
