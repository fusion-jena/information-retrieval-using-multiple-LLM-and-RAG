Answer: The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a Hybrid Hyperparameter Optimization Scheme (HHOS), which combines manual and random search methods sequentially. The first step is manual search, which aims to identify optimal hyperparameter values and reduce the search space by selecting frequently used hyperparameter configurations that show effectiveness in related studies. Next, random search iteratively samples various combinations of hyperparameter values identified in the manual search, trains the models with each set, and identifies the hyperparameter configuration that yields the highest accuracy. This approach aims to leverage the benefits of both manual and random search methods, such as improving upon the limitations of individual methods and enhancing the chances of finding optimal hyperparameters.
