Answer: 
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically the Inception-ResNet-v2 architecture. This is mentioned in the text as "The Inception-ResNet-v2 model was trained using the mini-batch gradient descent algorithm..." Inception-ResNet-v2 is a variant of the ResNet architecture, which is a type of CNN.
