Answer: 
The platform used to deploy the deep learning model was not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the new method for calculating WUI (Wetland Use Intensity) is "fully automated in the cloud-based GEE processing environment". GEE stands for Google Earth Engine, which is a cloud-based platform for Earth observation data analysis. Therefore, it can be inferred that the Google Cloud platform was likely used to deploy the model, but it is not explicitly stated.
