Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the challenges and limitations of deep learning models in remote sensing, particularly in handling spatial heterogeneity and transfer learning.

However, it does mention that conducting large cross-validation (CV) experiments with deep learning-based models is often infeasible due to their high computational costs. It also mentions that simple data partitioning strategies, such as training, validation, and testing, are commonly employed, but may overlook the diversity of heterogeneous spatial information in remotely sensed data.

It does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of random seed values, data augmentation, or other techniques. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
