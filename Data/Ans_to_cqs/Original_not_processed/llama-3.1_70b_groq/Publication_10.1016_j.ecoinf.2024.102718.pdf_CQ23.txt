Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model was tested on two different datasets: PlantVillage and Dhan-Shomadhan. This suggests that the model was evaluated on diverse datasets, which can help to ensure its generalizability.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model was trained and tested under both noise-added and noise-free situations, which can help to evaluate its robustness and generalizability.

However, there is no mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting in the provided context. Therefore, it is unclear whether these measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions that the model was designed to address class imbalance, which can be a challenge in ensuring generalizability. The model uses class weights to address this issue, but it is unclear whether other measures such as oversampling or undersampling were taken.

Overall, while the context provides some information about the evaluation of the model on diverse datasets and under different conditions, it does not provide a complete picture of the measures taken to ensure its generalizability.
