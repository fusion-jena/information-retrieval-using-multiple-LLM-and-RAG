Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the description of the algorithms used, such as AlexNet, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, Histogram-based Gradient Boosting, and Linear Discriminant Model, as well as the assessment of their performance. It does mention that the database was split into training (80%) and testing sets (20%), but it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
