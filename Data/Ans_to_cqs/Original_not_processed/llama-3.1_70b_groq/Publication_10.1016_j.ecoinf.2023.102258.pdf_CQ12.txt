Answer: CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) is mentioned as a type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. Specifically, it is mentioned that some systems use CNN (ResNet) and CNN + CRNN + Perceiver. Additionally, some systems use a combination of CNN and other models, such as Proto + RPN (R-CRNN). However, it is not possible to determine the exact type of deep learning model used in all pipelines, as the information is not provided for all systems.
