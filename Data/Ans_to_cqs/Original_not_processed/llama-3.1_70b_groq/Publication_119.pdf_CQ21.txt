Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps. However, it does mention the calculation of metrics and the use of a confusion matrix for accuracy assessment.

According to the context, the confusion/error matrix and subsequent metrics are used to compare the accuracy of various models using independent testing data. This suggests that the models' performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, kappa, and possibly others, although the specific metrics are not listed.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of GridSearchCV (scikit-learn 0.24) for hyperparameter tuning, which may involve the calculation of various metrics to evaluate the models' performance. However, the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training are not detailed in the provided context.

Therefore, while we can infer that metrics calculation and confusion matrix are part of the postprocessing steps, we do not have information on other specific steps such as Saliency maps.
