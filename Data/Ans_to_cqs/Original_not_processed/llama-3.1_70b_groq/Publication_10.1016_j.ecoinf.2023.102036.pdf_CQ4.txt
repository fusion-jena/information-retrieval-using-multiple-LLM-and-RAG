Answer:::

The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline are:

1. Affine transformations, which include:
	* Scaling
	* Translation
	* Rotation
	* Shear
2. Pixel sum transformation
3. Hue, saturation, and contrast modifications
4. Adding Gaussian noise to images

These techniques are applied to increase the diversity of the images in the dataset and to prevent overfitting. The authors of the paper argue that applying these techniques before splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets can actually help the model learn and fine-tune its parameters, rather than leading to overfitting.

Note that mirror flipping is not used as a data augmentation technique in this pipeline, as it would change the pattern in the skin of individuals of the undulate skate, invalidating the generated image.
