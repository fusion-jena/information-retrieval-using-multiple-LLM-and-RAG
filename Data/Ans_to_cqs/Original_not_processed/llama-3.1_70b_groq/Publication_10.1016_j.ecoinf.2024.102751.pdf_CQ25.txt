Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the text, it appears that the model is intended to be used for estimating soil moisture at the spoil heap. The text mentions that "it would be worthwhile in this context to test various methods of machine learning or deep neural networks, which would perhaps allow to increase the accuracy of prediction." This suggests that the deep learning model is intended for predictive modeling, specifically for estimating soil moisture levels. However, the specific task (e.g., classification, regression, etc.) is not clearly stated.
