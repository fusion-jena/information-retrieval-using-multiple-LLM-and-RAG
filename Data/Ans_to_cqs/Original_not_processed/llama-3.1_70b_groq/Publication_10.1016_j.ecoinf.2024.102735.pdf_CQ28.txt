Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It mentions that the Clemson Computing and Information Technology (CCIT) provided advanced research computing capabilities through its Cyberinfrastructure Technology Integration (CITI) group, but it does not specify the cloud platform used for deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question.
