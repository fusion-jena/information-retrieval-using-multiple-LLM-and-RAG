Answer: I don't know.

The provided context appears to be a collection of academic papers and data related to environmental science, water pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. There is no mention of deep learning pipelines or data formats used in such pipelines. The context includes tables with numerical data, but it does not provide information on the specific data formats used in deep learning applications. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query.
