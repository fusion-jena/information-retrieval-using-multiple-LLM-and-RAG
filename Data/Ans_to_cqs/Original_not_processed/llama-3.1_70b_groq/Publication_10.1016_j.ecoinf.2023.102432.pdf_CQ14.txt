Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses the use of Random Forest and MTMI-SMF algorithms, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process. It only mentions that the confusion matrix was calculated on the 20% of the data not used for training the algorithm, but it does not elaborate on the hyperparameter tuning process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
