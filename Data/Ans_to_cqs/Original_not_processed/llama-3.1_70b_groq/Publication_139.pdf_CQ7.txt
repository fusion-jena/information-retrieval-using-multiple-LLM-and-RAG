Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly state the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that the training database was assembled by randomly selecting three days from each month of the calendar year, and then annotating a subset of the spectrograms from those days. 

It also mentions that the neural network training and validation were performed using five training folds, which suggests that the data was split into five folds for cross-validation. However, the exact criteria used to split the data into these folds is not specified. 

Additionally, the context mentions that the test confusion matrix is shown in Table 4, which implies that there is a separate test dataset, but the criteria used to split the data into training and test sets is not provided.
