Answer:

The context provided does not specifically mention the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does describe a satellite data collection tool developed as part of the SMARTLAGOON project. This tool collects water quality data from public Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) of major space agencies, including the European Space Agency (ESA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

The tool is designed to acquire satellite imagery for predefined geospatial coordinates over a determined period. The context mentions that the tool focuses on Sentinel-3-related products, which offer daily data from the same world region around the same hour. The data collected includes vital parameters such as reflectance, Aerosol Optical Thickness (Kd940), and Chl-a concentrations.

Additionally, the context mentions in situ monitoring data sources, including CSIC-IEO and CARM, which provide sampling data. However, it is unclear if this data is used in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the methods used for collecting raw data include:

* Public APIs from space agencies (ESA and NASA)
* Satellite imagery from Sentinel-3-related products
* In situ monitoring data sources (although it is unclear if this data is used in the deep learning pipeline)

It is essential to note that the context does not provide a comprehensive overview of the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
