Answer:

The provided context does not specifically discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention methods used for handling missing values, such as mean imputation and machine-learning-based methods like missForest, missRanger, or MICE RF. These methods are used for imputing missing values, but they do not directly address data bias.

The context also mentions the importance of collecting imperfect footprints during field surveys and using missing value imputation as part of the data preprocessing pipeline. This approach can help preserve valuable data and improve the accuracy of FIT predictions when sub-quality footprints are included.

Regarding data bias, the context does not provide specific techniques used to address it. However, it does mention the importance of using diverse data, as mentioned in the study using deep learning models to classify three sympatric otter species. The study found that a model trained on images of all qualities was only marginally outperformed by a model trained on high-quality prints, highlighting the potential of utilizing lower-quality data effectively.

In conclusion, while the context does not provide specific techniques used to address data bias, it emphasizes the importance of collecting diverse data and using machine-learning-based methods for handling missing values.
