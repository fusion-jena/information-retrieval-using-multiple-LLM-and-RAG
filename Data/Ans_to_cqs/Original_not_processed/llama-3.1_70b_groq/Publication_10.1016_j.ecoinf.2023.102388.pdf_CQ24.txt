Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily discusses the settings for training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in two scenarios: no-overfitting and overfitting, including hyperparameters like learning rate, weight decay, batch size, and the use of batch-norm and dropout. However, it does not address the topic of randomness or random seed values in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
