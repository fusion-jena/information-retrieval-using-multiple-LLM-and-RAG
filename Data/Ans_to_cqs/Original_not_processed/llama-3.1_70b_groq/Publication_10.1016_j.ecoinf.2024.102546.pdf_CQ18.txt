Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that "the performance metrics on the test set over three replications were averaged for eventual model assessment." This suggests that the model performance is evaluated on a test set after training, and the average performance over multiple replications is used for assessment. But the specific strategy or metrics used to monitor performance during training is not mentioned.
