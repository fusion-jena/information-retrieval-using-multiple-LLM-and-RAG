Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the development and evaluation of a Back-Propagation Artificial Neural Network (BP-ANN) model for predicting above-ground biomass (AGB) using various predictor variables. It discusses the model's architecture, performance evaluation metrics, and comparison with other regression methods. However, it does not delve into the optimization techniques used during the training process. Therefore, I do not know the specific optimization techniques applied in this deep learning pipeline.
