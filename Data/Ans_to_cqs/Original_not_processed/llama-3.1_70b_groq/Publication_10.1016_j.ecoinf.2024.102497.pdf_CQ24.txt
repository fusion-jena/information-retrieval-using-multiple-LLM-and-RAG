Answer:::
The provided context does not specifically discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or the use of random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the Random Forest Regression (RFR) model and the Classification and Regression Trees (CART) algorithm, both of which are ensemble learning techniques used for regression tasks.

However, it does mention that the RFR model constructs several independent decision trees by randomly sampling data and features, which introduces randomness into the model. To mitigate the effects of this randomness, the RFR model aggregates predictions from all trees in the forest to obtain the final regression result.

Additionally, the context mentions fine-tuning model parameters such as 'n_estimators' for RFR and 'max_depth', 'min_samples_leaf', and 'max_leaf_nodes' for CART to prevent overfitting and minimize cross-validation error. These hyperparameter tuning processes may help to reduce the impact of randomness in the models, but they are not specifically designed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query about strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
