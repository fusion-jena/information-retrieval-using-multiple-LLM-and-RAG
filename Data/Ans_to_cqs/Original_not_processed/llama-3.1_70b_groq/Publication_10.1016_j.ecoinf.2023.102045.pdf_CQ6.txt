Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or preprocessing steps involved in training such models. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, mapping, and scientific communication, with a focus on the limitations of maps as information resources and the potential impact of color blindness on interpreting maps. There is no mention of deep learning or preprocessing steps, so I cannot provide a relevant answer.
