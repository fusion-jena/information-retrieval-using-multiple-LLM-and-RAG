Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the model training procedure, the use of the VGG Image Annotator for manual annotation, and the construction of a website to serve as a repository for the fish segmentation model. However, it does not provide information on model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related processes. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
