Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. It mentions that deep learning strategies, such as neural networks, are being used, but it does not provide information on the data formats used as input for these models.

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the data used for species distribution modeling (SDMs) is mostly visual (84%), with some studies using satellite tracking (13%) or acoustic recordings (11%). But it is not clear if these data formats are used directly in the deep learning pipeline or if they are pre-processed into other formats such as CSV.

Therefore, I don't know the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline, and more information would be needed to provide a definitive answer.
