Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically DeepLabV3+, is semantic segmentation. According to the context, DeepLabV3+ is a CNN algorithm for semantic segmentation, which is used to predict the classification results of land cover classes. The model is also used in conjunction with MRS (Multi-Resolution Segmentation) to integrate the classification results with the segmentation results, and to assign the largest category to the current object. The model is trained on remote sensing images and is used to segment the images into different land cover classes.
