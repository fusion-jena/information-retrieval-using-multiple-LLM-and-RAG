Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention various data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of 'LabelImg' software for labelling datasets. According to the context, 'LabelImg' is a graphical image annotation tool written in Python, which was used to label the datasets under expert guidance. The labelled files were saved in PASCAL VOC format as .xml files.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of bounding boxes in the Faster R-CNN model, which suggests that bounding box annotation is one of the annotation techniques used. However, it does not provide information on other annotation techniques such as instance segmentation.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the answer to the query is that bounding box annotation is one of the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, and 'LabelImg' software is used for labelling datasets. However, the context does not provide information on other annotation techniques such as instance segmentation.
