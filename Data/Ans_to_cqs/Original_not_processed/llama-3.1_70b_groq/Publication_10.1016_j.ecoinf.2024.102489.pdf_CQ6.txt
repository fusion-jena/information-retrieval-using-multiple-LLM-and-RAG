Answer:::

The provided context does not specifically mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention some preprocessing steps related to the data used for training a Random Forest (RF) model.

According to the context, the following preprocessing steps were taken:

1. Elimination of cloud-contaminated and poor-quality pixels using MODIS products' pixel quality control metrics.
2. Removal of outliers from the training samples.
3. Saturation of pixels during the selection of LAI training samples to ensure a sufficient number of samples.

Additionally, the context mentions that the training samples were randomly divided into 80% for training and 20% for testing.

However, it does not provide information on normalization, scaling, or other preprocessing steps that are commonly used before training a deep learning model. Therefore, I do not know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model based on the provided context.
