Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to focus on the pre-processing hyper-parameters for each dataset, the use of transfer learning, and the comparison of different network architectures and dataset configurations. It does not provide information on the specific stopping criteria used during training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
