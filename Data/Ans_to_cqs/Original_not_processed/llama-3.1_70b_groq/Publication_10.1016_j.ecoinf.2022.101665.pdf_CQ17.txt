Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be focused on statistical modeling and cross-validation methods for assessing the accuracy of thematic maps, particularly in the context of environmental mapping and geostatistics. It discusses various cross-validation approaches, including leave-one-out cross-validation, k-fold cross-validation, and weighted cross-validation, but does not mention deep learning or regularization methods. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide an answer to the query.
