Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning and deep learning models for predicting the percent disease incidence of CLCuD in upland cotton, but it does not delve into the specifics of preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, I do not know the exact preprocessing steps involved in this particular study.
