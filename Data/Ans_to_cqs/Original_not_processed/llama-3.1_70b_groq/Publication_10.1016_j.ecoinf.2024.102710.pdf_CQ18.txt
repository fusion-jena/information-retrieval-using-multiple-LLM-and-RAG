Answer:::
The text does not explicitly mention a specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention that the classifier heads are identical to those from the transfer learning training process, and that the performance of the model is evaluated through the lens of the resulting learning curves. This suggests that the model performance is monitored by tracking the learning curves, but the exact strategy or metrics used to evaluate the performance are not specified.
