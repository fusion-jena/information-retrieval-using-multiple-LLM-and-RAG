Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper or article discussing the use of Vision Transformers (ViT) and DenseNet for image classification tasks, but it does not provide any information about a publicly available code repository. If you are looking for the code implementation of the pipeline, you may want to try searching for the authors' GitHub pages or contacting them directly to inquire about the availability of the code.
