Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model. The text only mentions that the labeled dataset was split into training and testing datasets, and that 50% of the training data were held-out for validation. It also mentions that the ResNet-50 model was pre-trained using millions of label images in over 1000 categories, but it does not provide information on any preprocessing steps that may have been applied to the data before training the model.

However, it can be inferred that the spectrogram images were likely normalized or scaled in some way before being input into the ResNet-50 model, as this is a common preprocessing step in deep learning. Additionally, the text mentions that the activations from the ResNet-50 model were used as input to a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, which may have involved some form of feature scaling or normalization. However, without more information, it is impossible to say for certain what preprocessing steps were involved.
