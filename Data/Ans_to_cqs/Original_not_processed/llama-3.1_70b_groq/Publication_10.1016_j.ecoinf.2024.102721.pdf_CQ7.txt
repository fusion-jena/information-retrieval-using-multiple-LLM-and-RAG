Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to focus on the model architecture, specifically the LSTM model, and its application to forecasting ecological water demand. It also discusses model interpretability analysis using SHAP values, but does not provide information on data splitting criteria. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
