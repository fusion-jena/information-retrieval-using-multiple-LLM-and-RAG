Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps. However, it does mention the calculation of metrics and the creation of a Confusion matrix.

According to the context, after training the model, the authors used it to automatise the classification of 500 more images from the unlabelled training dataset. They then manually fixed any mistakes and repeated this process until all 7362 downloaded images were labelled.

The context also mentions that a Confusion matrix for farm dam detection with the deep learning CNN is available as supplementary material (Figure S1). This suggests that the authors did calculate and visualize the Confusion matrix as part of their postprocessing steps.

Additionally, the context mentions that the authors achieved an error rate of 0.1538 (15.38%) and a validation loss of 0.4211 at epoch 5. This suggests that they calculated metrics such as error rate and validation loss during the training process.

However, the context does not provide information on other postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps.
