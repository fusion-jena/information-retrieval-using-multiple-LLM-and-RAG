Answer: The pipeline uses a combination of an Autoencoder and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). The Autoencoder is used for unsupervised pre-training to extract features from the data, and the MLP is used for classification. Specifically, the MLP consists of four fully connected layers with a size of 256, 128, 64, and 12, each comprising a linear layer followed by PReLU as non-linearity, except for the third layer which also includes Batch Normalization.
