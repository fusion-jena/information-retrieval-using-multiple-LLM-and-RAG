Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the network, including the encoder, decoder, and loss functions used. It does mention that the network takes images with dimensions of 256 Ã— 256 pixels and three color channels as input, but it does not provide information on any preprocessing steps that may have been applied to the images before feeding them into the network.

However, it does mention the use of Batch Normalization after each convolution layer, which is a technique used to normalize the input data for each layer. This can be considered a form of preprocessing, but it is applied within the network architecture rather than as a separate preprocessing step before training.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query about preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model.
