Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the analysis of urban acoustic environments, sound event classification, and psychoacoustics, but it does not provide information on the specific deep learning pipeline or regularization methods used.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
