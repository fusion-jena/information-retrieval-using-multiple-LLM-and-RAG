Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context primarily focuses on the application of the BirdNET-Analyzer deep learning model for bird species monitoring and mentions the model's reliance on deep learning techniques, but it does not delve into the specifics of the preprocessing steps.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to perform preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning to prepare the data for training. These steps can help improve the model's performance and prevent issues such as feature dominance or poor convergence.

If you're looking for information on preprocessing steps for deep learning models, I recommend consulting relevant literature or documentation on the specific model or framework being used. In this case, the BirdNET-Analyzer model is mentioned, but the context does not provide sufficient information on the preprocessing steps involved.
