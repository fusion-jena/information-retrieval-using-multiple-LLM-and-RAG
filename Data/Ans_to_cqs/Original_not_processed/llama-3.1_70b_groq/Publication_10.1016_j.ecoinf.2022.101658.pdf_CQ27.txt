Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only discusses the methodology for collecting field measurements, manual classification of fuel types, and training a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) for semantic segmentation. It does not provide information on model deployment, such as model serialization or platform selection.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
