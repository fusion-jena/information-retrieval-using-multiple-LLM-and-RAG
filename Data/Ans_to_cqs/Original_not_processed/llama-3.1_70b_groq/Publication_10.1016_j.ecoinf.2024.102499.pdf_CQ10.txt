Answer: I don't know. The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions that the parameters of the model can be found on the TensorFlow model zoo under the name "faster_rcnn_nas", but it does not provide a link to a code repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
