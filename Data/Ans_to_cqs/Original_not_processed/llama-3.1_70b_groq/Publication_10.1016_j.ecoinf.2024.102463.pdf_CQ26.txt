Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on hyperparameter optimization using the Hyperband algorithm and the architecture of a neural network, specifically the number of convolution layers, max-pooling size, and other hyperparameters. It does not discuss data preprocessing or techniques to address data bias.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. If you have any further questions or context, I would be happy to try and assist you.
