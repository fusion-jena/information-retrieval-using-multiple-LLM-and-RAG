Answer: The provided context mentions the use of dropout regularization in the forward pass during training to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. This suggests that the model employs a regularization technique to randomly drop out neurons during training to prevent overfitting. However, it does not mention the use of a random seed value to ensure reproducibility.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with momentum as an optimizer, but it was not chosen due to a 1%â€“2% decrease in accuracy compared to the Adam optimizer. The Adam optimizer is a stochastic gradient descent optimizer that adapts the learning rate for each parameter based on the magnitude of the gradient, which can help handle randomness in the optimization process.

It is also worth noting that the context does not provide information on how the randomness in the initialization of weights and biases is handled. Typically, deep learning models use random initialization of weights and biases, and a fixed random seed value can be used to ensure reproducibility. However, this is not mentioned in the provided context.
