Answer:

According to the provided context, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are as follows:

* The first 4 years (2018-2021) are used as the training set, while the last year (2022) is used as the test set. This results in a proportion of approximately 80-20%, which is a common rule in machine learning.
* For k-fold cross-validation, the training set is split into k fractions, each one being used iteratively as a validation set, while the remaining k-1 fractions are used as the training set. In this case, k is chosen to be 4, so that each validation fraction corresponds approximately to one year.

This approach is used to avoid over-fitting the models and to evaluate the performance of the models on unseen data.
