Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that recursive validation of the BA classification algorithm was performed over independent wildfires to determine the optimal number of trees for the Random Forest (RF) model. This suggests that some form of validation or testing was used to evaluate the model's performance during training, but the specific details of the strategy are not provided.
