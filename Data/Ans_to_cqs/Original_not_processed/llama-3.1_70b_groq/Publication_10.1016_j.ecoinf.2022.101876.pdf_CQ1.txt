Answer:

Based on the provided context, one method utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is the use of camera traps (i.e., remotely triggered cameras) to non-invasively survey wildlife in ecology. This method generates a large volume of raw data in the form of images that need to be reviewed and analyzed.

Additionally, the context mentions that advancements in tools and technology have led to the collection and storage of massive expanses of data, often referred to as "Big Data". However, it does not specifically mention other methods such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets as being utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, the answer is limited to the use of camera traps as a method for collecting raw data, but it is not exhaustive, and other methods might be utilized in different contexts or fields.
