Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model is image classification. The model is a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that is used to classify images into different categories. Specifically, there are two CNN models mentioned in the context: one for classifying images as unstained or stained, and another for classifying images as clubmoss or spikemoss. The models are trained on digitized natural history collections and are designed to process images in their raw form. The output of the models is a class label, indicating the category to which the input image belongs.
