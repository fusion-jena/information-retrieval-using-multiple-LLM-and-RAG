Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The references provided are mostly academic papers and articles related to machine learning, river health, and ecological modeling, but none of them mention a specific code repository or provide a link to one. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
