Answer:

According to the provided context, one technique used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline is stratified splitting. The dataset was randomly divided into three parts: training (60%), validation (20%), and testing (20%) in a stratified manner to maintain class proportions across all of the parts. This suggests that the researchers attempted to ensure that the class balance was preserved during the splitting process to mitigate potential biases in the data. However, it is not mentioned whether other techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection were used.
