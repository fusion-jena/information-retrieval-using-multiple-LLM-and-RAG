Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the data collection process, audio data preprocessing, and the application of transfer learning using YAMNet for goat vocalization detection.

However, it does mention that the dataset was divided into 70% for training, 10% for validation, and 20% for testing purposes, which is a common practice to ensure that the model is trained and evaluated on separate datasets. But it does not provide information on whether any techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection were used to address data bias.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
