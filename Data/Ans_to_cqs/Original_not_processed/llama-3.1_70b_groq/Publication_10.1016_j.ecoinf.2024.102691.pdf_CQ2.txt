Answer: 

The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is primarily image data, specifically RGB images and depth images. The input images are scaled down to a fixed size of 512 Ã— 512 and normalized using self-adaptive image scaling. The images are then processed using various data augmentation techniques such as scaling, panning, rotation, color transformation, and mosaic to increase the number of training samples and improve model generalization ability. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
