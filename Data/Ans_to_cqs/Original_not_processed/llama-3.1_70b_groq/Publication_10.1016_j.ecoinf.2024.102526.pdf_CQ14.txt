Answer:::
I don't know.

The provided context appears to be related to a study involving image capture and analysis, possibly in the field of ecology or biology. The tables and text describe various attributes and fields related to the study, such as spatial and temporal extent, image capture settings, and target organisms. However, there is no mention of a model or hyperparameter optimization. The context does not provide any information about machine learning or model optimization techniques, such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to the query.
