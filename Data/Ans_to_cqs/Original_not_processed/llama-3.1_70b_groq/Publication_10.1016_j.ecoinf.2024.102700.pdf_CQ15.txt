Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The text only mentions that deep learning strategies, including neural networks, are used in some studies (e.g., Cazau et al., 2023), but it does not provide further details on the optimization techniques employed.
