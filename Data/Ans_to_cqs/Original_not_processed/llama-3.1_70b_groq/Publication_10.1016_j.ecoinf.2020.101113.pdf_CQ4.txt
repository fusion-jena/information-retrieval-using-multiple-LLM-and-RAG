Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. However, it does mention that data augmentation was found to significantly improve performance in previous studies, particularly in the form of noise addition. It also suggests that future efforts should investigate optimal data augmentation methods for bioacoustic recognition, implying that the current study may not have explored various data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I do not know the specific data augmentation techniques applied in this study beyond noise addition.
