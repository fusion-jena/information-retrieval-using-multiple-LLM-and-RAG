Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or a pipeline. It appears to be a collection of references and data related to environmental covariates, species distribution models, and ecological informatics. There is no mention of a specific deep learning model such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
