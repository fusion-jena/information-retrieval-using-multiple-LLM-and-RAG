Answer:::

The provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some techniques used in deep learning and machine learning applications.

One technique mentioned is dropout, which is used to prevent neural networks from overfitting (Srivastava et al., 2014). However, dropout is not directly related to addressing data bias.

Another technique mentioned is grid search, which is used to determine the best values of hyperparameters in a random forest (RF) regression model (Bhatnagar et al., 2020). Grid search can be used to optimize hyperparameters, but it is not specifically used to address data bias.

The context also mentions data fusion as a novel approach to overcome data limitations (Bhatnagar et al., 2020). Data fusion can potentially help address data bias by combining multiple datasets, but the context does not provide further details on how this is done.

In general, techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection are commonly used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, these techniques are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot determine the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
