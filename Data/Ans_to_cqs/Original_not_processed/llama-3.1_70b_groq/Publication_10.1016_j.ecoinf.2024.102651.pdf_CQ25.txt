Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. Specifically, the model is designed to classify Cervidae (deer) objects that have been localized by YOLOv7, a object detection network. The CA-Hybrid network, which combines CNN and ViT modules, is constructed as the classification network to precisely categorize the localized Cervidae objects. The model aims to improve the classification accuracy by extracting richer semantic features and focusing on critical features using the CAM (Class Activation Map) module.
