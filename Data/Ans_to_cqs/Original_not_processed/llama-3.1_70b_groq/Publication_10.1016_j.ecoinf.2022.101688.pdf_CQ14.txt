Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It mentions that the creation and utilization of CNNs to solve bioacoustics research questions is challenging due to three problems: (1) the need for a large amount of labeled data, (2) the difficulty of selecting the most suitable network architecture, and (3) the time-consuming step of exploring various neural network hyperparameters to obtain the most optimal model. However, it does not provide information on the specific method used for hyperparameter optimization, such as grid search or random search.
