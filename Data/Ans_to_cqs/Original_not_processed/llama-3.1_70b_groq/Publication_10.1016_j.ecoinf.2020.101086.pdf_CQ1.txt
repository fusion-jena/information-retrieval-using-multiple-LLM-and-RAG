Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on species distribution modeling, specifically addressing the issue of sampling bias and data scarcity in the context of species distribution models.

However, it does mention the use of presence data, which implies that the data may be collected through surveys or observations of species presence. Additionally, the context mentions the use of environmental data, which could potentially be collected through sensors or other sources.

But, without more specific information, it is difficult to provide a more detailed answer to the question of what methods are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
