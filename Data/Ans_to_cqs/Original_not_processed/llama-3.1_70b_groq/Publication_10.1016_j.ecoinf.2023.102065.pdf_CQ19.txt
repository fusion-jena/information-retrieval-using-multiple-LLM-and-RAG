Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context primarily focuses on the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in ecoacoustics, particularly for bird species classification, and discusses various approaches to representing sound data in CNN architectures. However, it does not provide information on the specific frameworks or tools used to implement these models.
