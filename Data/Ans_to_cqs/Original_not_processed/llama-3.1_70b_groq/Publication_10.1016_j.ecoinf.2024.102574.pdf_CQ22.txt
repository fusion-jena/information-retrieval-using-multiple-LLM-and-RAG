Answer: 

The provided context does not specifically mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. However, it does mention some metrics used to evaluate the performance of models or equations in the context of estimating Above-Ground Biomass (AGB) and creating Digital Terrain Models (DTMs). 

For AGB estimation, the context mentions the use of R2 (coefficient of determination) and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error). For example, it mentions that the R2 of AGB estimation is close to 0.731, and the RMSE is 2.46 kg. 

In the context of DTM creation, the context mentions the use of R2, but does not provide specific values. 

It does not mention precision, recall, or other metrics that are commonly used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models.
