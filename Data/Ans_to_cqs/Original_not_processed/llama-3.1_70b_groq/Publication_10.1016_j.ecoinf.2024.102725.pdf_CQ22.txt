Answer: The study utilizes four evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the model: 

1. Coefficient of determination (R2): reflects the goodness-of-fit of the predicted images to the reference images, with values ranging from -âˆž to 1.
2. Root mean squared error (RMSE): evaluates the discrepancy between the fused results and observed values, with a higher value indicating a larger deviation.
3. Mean absolute error (MAE): not explicitly defined in the provided context, but commonly used to evaluate the average difference between predicted and actual values.
4. Error relative global accuracy (ERGAS): not explicitly defined in the provided context, but used to assess the accuracy of the model.

Note that the study does not mention the use of accuracy, precision, or recall as evaluation metrics.
