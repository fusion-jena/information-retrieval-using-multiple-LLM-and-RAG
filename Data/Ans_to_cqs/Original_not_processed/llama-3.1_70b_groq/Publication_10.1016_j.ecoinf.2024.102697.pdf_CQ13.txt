Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer. The context only discusses the use of random forest models, a type of machine learning model, and mentions that hyperparameter optimization was performed using Bayesian Optimization to minimize a 5 k-fold cross-validation loss during model development. However, it does not provide specific details on the hyperparameters used in the model.
