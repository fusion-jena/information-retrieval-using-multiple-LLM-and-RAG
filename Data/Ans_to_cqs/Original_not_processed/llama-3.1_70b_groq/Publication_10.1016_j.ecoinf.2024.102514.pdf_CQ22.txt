Answer:

The provided context does not specifically mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. However, it does mention various metrics used to evaluate the performance of machine learning (ML) models in the context of water quality prediction. These metrics include:

1. R2 (coefficient of determination): measures goodness of fit
2. NSE (Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency): assesses performance relative to benchmarks
3. MEF (Modified Efficiency Factor): assesses performance relative to benchmarks
4. Z-statistics: determines statistical significance
5. RMSE (Root Mean Square Error): measures prediction accuracy
6. MAE (Mean Absolute Error): measures prediction accuracy

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of various ML models, including EN, GPR, LR, NN, SLR, SVM, TR, and XGB. However, it is not explicitly stated which of these metrics are used to evaluate deep learning models specifically.
