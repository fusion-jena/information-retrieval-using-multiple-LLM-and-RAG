Answer: The specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the ERNIE model, which is an enhanced representation through knowledge integration model, is used for text classification and emotional analysis tasks. Additionally, it is mentioned that the ERNIE model outperformed the bidirectional encoder representations from the transformer model proposed by Google AI in certain tasks. This suggests that the pipeline may be using a transformer-based model or a variant of it, but the exact architecture is not specified.
