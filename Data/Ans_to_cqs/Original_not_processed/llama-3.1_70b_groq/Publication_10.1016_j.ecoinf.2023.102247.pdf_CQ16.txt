Answer: The provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be related to a study on species distribution modeling, and it discusses the use of an ensemble modeling approach and the evaluation of model performance using cross-validation and the Area Under the Receiving Operator Characteristics Curve (AUC). However, it does not provide information on the training process or the criteria used to determine when training is complete.
