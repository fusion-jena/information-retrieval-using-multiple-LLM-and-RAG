Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of a validation loss metric. The learning rate is reduced by a factor of 0.1 in a step-wise manner whenever the validation loss remains constant for five epochs. This indicates that the model's performance on the validation set is being monitored during training, and the learning rate is adjusted accordingly to prevent overfitting and improve convergence.
