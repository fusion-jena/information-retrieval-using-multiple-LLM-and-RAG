Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the post-processing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. However, it does describe the post-classification steps, which include morphological operations to refine the classification results.

According to the context, the post-classification steps involve:

1. Morphological opening: an erosion followed by dilation using a structural element to remove small misclassified pixels or speckles.
2. Morphological closing: a dilation followed by erosion using a structural element to close gaps and holes in the classified map.

These operations are performed iteratively to increase spatial coherency. However, the context does not provide information on other post-processing steps like saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.
