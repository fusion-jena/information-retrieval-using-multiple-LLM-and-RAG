Answer:::

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows:

- Optimizer: Stochastic gradient descent algorithm
- Loss function: Softmax cross-entropy loss
- Number of epochs: 300
- Batch size: 10
- Learning rate: 0.01 (fixed)
- Number of units in the fully connected (FC) layers: 512 (first FC layer) and 256 (second FC layer)
- Dropout rate: Determined by five-fold cross-validation

Note that the specific hyperparameters used for the adversarial training procedure, such as the learning rate and number of epochs, are not mentioned in the provided context.
