Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. According to the provided context, the deep learning algorithm is used to discern patterns within the data, enabling it to make predictions based on these learned patterns. The context also mentions that the classification process occurs from the data processed in the feature extraction section of the convolutional neural network (CNN). Additionally, the context mentions the use of a SoftMax activation function layer, which is commonly used in classification problems. Therefore, it can be inferred that the purpose of the deep learning model is classification.
