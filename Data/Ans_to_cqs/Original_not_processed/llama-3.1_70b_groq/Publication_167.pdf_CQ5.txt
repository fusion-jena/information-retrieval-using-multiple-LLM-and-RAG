Answer:::
The provided context does not mention the use of specific datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet in the deep learning pipeline. Instead, it describes a custom dataset used for land use and land cover change (LUCC) analysis, which includes features such as land use type, soil, topography, elevation, slope, aspect, and distance-based variables. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and testing sets using a 10-fold cross-validation method, with a ratio of 5.4:0.6:1 for training, validation, and testing sets, respectively.
