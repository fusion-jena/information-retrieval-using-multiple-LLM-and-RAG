Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the model's architecture, hyperparameters, and performance metrics. It does not provide information on data preprocessing techniques such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

However, it does mention that the model's weights were randomly initialized using a specific integer seed to guarantee consistent reproducibility of results, and that the dataset was partitioned into training and validation sets. But it does not provide details on any preprocessing steps that may have been applied to the data before training the model.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
