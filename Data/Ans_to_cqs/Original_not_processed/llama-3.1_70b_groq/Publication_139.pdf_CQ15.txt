Answer: 
The optimization technique applied in the deep learning pipeline is Adam. According to the provided context, "The optimizer Adam was selected with an initial learning rate of 0.0007 and early stopping was used to prevent overfitting." This indicates that the Adam optimizer is used in conjunction with early stopping to prevent overfitting and improve the model's performance.
