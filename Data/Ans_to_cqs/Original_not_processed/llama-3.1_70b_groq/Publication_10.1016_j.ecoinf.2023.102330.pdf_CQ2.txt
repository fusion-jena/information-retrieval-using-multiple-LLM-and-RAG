Answer:::
The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is audio, specifically spectrogram data collected from Automatic Recording Units (ARUs). The CNN model is trained on covey call spectrogram data to detect and localize all covey calls per ARU during the recording period and note their associated time and peak power (dB).
