Answer: I don't know.

The provided context appears to be a collection of research papers and articles related to remote sensing, ecology, and environmental science. However, none of the papers seem to discuss the criteria used to determine when training is complete in the context of machine learning or neural networks. The papers focus on topics such as forest management, carbon sequestration, biodiversity, and remote sensing-based biomass estimation, but do not provide information on training completion criteria.

The only paper that mentions neural networks is Liu et al. (2022), which uses a neural network for interpolating canopy height data. However, the paper does not discuss the specific criteria used to determine when the training is complete.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
