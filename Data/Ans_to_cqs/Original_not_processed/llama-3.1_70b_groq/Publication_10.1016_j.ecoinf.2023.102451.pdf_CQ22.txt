Answer:

The performance of the deep learning model, specifically EMViT-Net, is evaluated using several metrics, including:

1. Precision: defined as the ratio of true positive to all positive predicted samples (TP / (TP + FP)).
2. Recall (Sensitivity): defined as the number of positive samples predicted correctly to all positive samples (TP / (TP + FN)).
3. F1-score: a general indicator of precision and recall, calculated as 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall).
4. Accuracy: measured by calculating the ratio of true positive and true negative to the overall collected samples (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN).

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of EMViT-Net on both the validation set and test set of the EMDS-6 dataset. The average values of precision, recall, and F1-score for all categories are also calculated and referred to as Avg_Precision, Avg_Recall, and Avg_F1-score, respectively.
