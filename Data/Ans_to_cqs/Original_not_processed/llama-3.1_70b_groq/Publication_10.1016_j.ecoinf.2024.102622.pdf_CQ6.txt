Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, I can try to provide some general information on common preprocessing steps that are typically involved in machine learning and deep learning pipelines.

In general, preprocessing steps may include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and feature engineering. Normalization involves scaling numeric data to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model. Scaling involves transforming data to have a specific mean and standard deviation, often to improve model performance. Cleaning involves handling missing values, outliers, and noisy data. Feature engineering involves selecting and transforming raw data into features that are more suitable for modeling.

However, without specific information on the preprocessing steps used in the context of the provided papers, I cannot provide a more detailed answer. The papers seem to focus on remote sensing, hyperspectral imaging, and machine learning applications in agriculture, but they do not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps used in their deep learning models.

Therefore, I must conclude that I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model in this context.
