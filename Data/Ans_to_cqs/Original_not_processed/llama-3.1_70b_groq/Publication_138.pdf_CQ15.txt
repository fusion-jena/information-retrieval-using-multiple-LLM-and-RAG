Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the architecture of the ICSNet model, its comparison with other models such as LeNet, AlexNet, GoogLeNet, VGG, and ResNet, and the experimental results. However, it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used for training the models.

The context does mention the learning rate drop factor (0.0004) and the learning rate drop period (0.6), which suggests that a learning rate schedule is used, but it does not specify the optimization algorithm used. Therefore, I do not know the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
