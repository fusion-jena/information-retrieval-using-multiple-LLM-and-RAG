Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of semantic segmentation, which is a technique used to annotate data at the pixel level. 

Semantic segmentation is mentioned in several references, including the use of U-Net for semantic segmentation of Brazilian savanna vegetation (Reference 26) and the use of DeepLabv3+ variants for semantic segmentation of endangered tree species in Brazilian savanna (Reference 24). 

Additionally, the context mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for end-to-end classification, which often requires annotated data. However, the specific annotation techniques used, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, are not mentioned.

Therefore, while we can infer that semantic segmentation is used in the deep learning pipeline, we do not have enough information to determine the specific data annotation techniques used.
