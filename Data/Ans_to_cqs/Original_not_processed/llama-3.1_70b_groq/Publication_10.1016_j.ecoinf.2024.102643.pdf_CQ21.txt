Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, it does mention the evaluation and comparison of the performance and accuracy of each model using AUC (area under the receiver operating curve) and TSS (true skill statistic). 

It can be inferred that metrics calculation is one of the postprocessing steps, as AUC and TSS values are calculated to evaluate the model's performance. However, there is no mention of saliency maps or confusion matrices as postprocessing steps.

Therefore, the only postprocessing step that can be confirmed from the provided context is metrics calculation, specifically the calculation of AUC and TSS values.
