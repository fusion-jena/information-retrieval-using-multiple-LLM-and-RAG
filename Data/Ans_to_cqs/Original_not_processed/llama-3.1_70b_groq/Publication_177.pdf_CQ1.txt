Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the dataset used in one of the studies was "collected online" (referring to the study by [20]). Additionally, it mentions that the dataset used in another study consisted of images of plants from the natural environment (referring to the study by Krause et al. [21]).

It can be inferred that the datasets used in the studies mentioned in the context were likely collected through a combination of online sources and field observations. However, the exact methods used for collecting raw data are not specified.

In the context of the UBD_45 dataset, it is mentioned that example plants from the dataset are shown in Fig. 3, which includes images of plants such as Agathis Bomeensis, Bauhinia coccinea, Clitoria Ternatea, and Shorea Albida. This suggests that the dataset may have been collected through field observations or photography of plants in their natural environment. However, the exact methods used for collecting the data are not specified.

In summary, while the context provides some hints about the possible methods used for collecting raw data, it does not provide explicit information on the methods used.
