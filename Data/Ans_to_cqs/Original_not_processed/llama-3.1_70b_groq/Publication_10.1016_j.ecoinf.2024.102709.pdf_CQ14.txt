Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, it does mention that k-fold cross-validation (k = 5, epochs = 500, imagesize = 640) was used to determine the ideal training-test split for the model. This suggests that some form of experimentation or tuning was performed to find the optimal hyperparameters, but the specific method used (e.g., grid search, random search) is not mentioned.
