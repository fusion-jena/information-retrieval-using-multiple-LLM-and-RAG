Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the experiments were performed on a small-size dataset without data augmentation. 

The context also mentions that the models were validated on their own validation set, which suggests that some form of splitting was used to evaluate the model's performance. However, the specific details of the splitting method (e.g., stratified splitting) are not provided.

Additionally, the context mentions that the butterfly specimen data sets were standardized, which could be a step towards ensuring the generalizability of the model. However, it is unclear if this standardization was sufficient to ensure the model's performance on diverse datasets.

Overall, while some measures were likely taken to ensure the generalizability of the model, the specific details are not provided in the context.
