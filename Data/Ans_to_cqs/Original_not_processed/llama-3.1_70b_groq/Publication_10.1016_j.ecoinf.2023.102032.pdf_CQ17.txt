Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a research article about improving cloud detection with machine learning, specifically in the context of wetlands and ecosystem health in East Africa. It mentions keywords such as wetlands, ecosystem health, and Sentinel-2, but does not provide information about the specific deep learning pipeline or regularization methods used.
