Answer: 
The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows: 
- The learning rate is set to 10^−3 initially and then decreased by a factor of 10 when the validation set accuracy stops improving.
- The momentum is set to 0.9.
- The weight decay is set to 10^−4.
- A fixed learning policy is employed for parameter setting in training.

However, the optimizer used in the model is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
