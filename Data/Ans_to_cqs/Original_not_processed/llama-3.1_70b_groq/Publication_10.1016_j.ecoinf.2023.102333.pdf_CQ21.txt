Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the model training process, including data preparation, hyperparameter optimization using Hyperband and Bayesian optimization, and the evaluation of model performance using learning and loss curves.

However, it does mention the calculation of indexes (Section 2.4), but it does not provide further details on what these indexes are or how they are used in the postprocessing steps.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
