Answer:

The provided context does not specifically mention preprocessing steps for deep learning models, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does describe a procedure for building models, which includes the following steps:

1. Obtaining presences (red circles) and generating background points (black triangles).
2. Separating data into folds.
3. Setting aside one fold for external evaluation and keeping the remaining folds as training data.
4. Performing scale optimization for environmental covariates using focal statistics and t-tests.
5. Subsampling background points in the training data to create three datasets with different numbers of background points.

The context also mentions that the number of background points used to train individual models can influence the performance of ensemble models. However, it does not provide information on preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know what specific preprocessing steps are involved before training a deep learning model.
