Answer:::
The text does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline, but based on the architectures mentioned (AlexNet and GoogLeNet), it can be inferred that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used. Both AlexNet and GoogLeNet are well-known CNN architectures, which are commonly used for image recognition tasks.
