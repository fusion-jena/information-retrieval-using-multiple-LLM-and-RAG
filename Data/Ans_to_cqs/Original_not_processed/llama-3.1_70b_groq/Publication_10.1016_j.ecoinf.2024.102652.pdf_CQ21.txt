Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the training process, including data normalization, batch size, optimizer, learning ratio, and loss function. It also discusses the experimental design flow chart and the performance of the model. However, it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps that are typically performed after training a model.

Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training, as this information is not provided in the given context.
