Answer:::
The provided context does not specifically discuss strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of a "training-and-test approach with stratification splitting" in one of the studies, where "100 different splits to the training-and-test set were given" and "tuning of the hyperparameter on the training set was done for each set." This suggests that the study employed a form of randomization in the data splitting process, but it does not provide information on how randomness was handled in the deep learning pipeline.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of different machine learning methods, including AdaBoost, random decision forest, multilayer neural network, and Bayesian ridge regression, but it does not provide information on how randomness was handled in these methods.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know what specific strategies are employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
