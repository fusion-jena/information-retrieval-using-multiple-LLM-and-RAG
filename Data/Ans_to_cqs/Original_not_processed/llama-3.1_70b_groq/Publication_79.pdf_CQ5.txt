Answer:::
The provided context does not specifically mention the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention that the authors used satellite imagery, specifically Google Earth imagery, and high spatial resolution satellite data. It also mentions that the authors used datasets containing four and eight bands of the WorldView-2 and WorldView-3 images.

Additionally, the context mentions that the authors used a dataset of Brazilian savanna (Cerrado) physiognomies, and that they employed a deep learning-based method to identify vegetation patterns, including different tree heights. However, it does not provide information on whether these datasets are publicly available or widely used in the deep learning community.

It is worth noting that the context does mention some specific datasets and papers related to deep learning, such as the work of LeCun et al. on handwritten digit recognition, and the work of Krizhevsky et al. on ImageNet classification. However, these datasets are not directly related to the specific deep learning pipeline mentioned in the query.
