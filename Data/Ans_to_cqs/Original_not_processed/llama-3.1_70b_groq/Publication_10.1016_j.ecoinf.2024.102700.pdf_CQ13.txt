Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. It only mentions that deep learning strategies, including neural networks, were used in some studies (e.g., Cazau et al., 2023), but it does not provide further details on the model's architecture or hyperparameters.
