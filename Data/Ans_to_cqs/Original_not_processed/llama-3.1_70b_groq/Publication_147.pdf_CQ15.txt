Answer:::
The deep learning pipeline in the provided context uses the Keras Nadam optimizer, which is a combination of the Nesterov Adam optimizer. This is mentioned in the text as the optimizer used to train the CNN model. The Nadam optimizer is a variant of the Adam optimizer that incorporates Nesterov acceleration, which helps to improve the convergence rate of the optimizer. 

No other optimization techniques, such as SGD, are mentioned in the provided context as being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that the model was trained using a combination of binary cross-entropy and dice coefficient loss as the objective loss function.
