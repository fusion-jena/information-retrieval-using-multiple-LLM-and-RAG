Answer: 

The provided context does not specifically mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of remote sensing data, such as satellite imagery, in various studies related to mangrove forests and land cover change. 

For example, the context mentions the use of Landsat imagery, Sentinel-2 images, and SPOT satellite imagery in different studies. It also mentions the use of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, which provides access to a large catalog of satellite imagery and other geospatial data. 

Additionally, the context mentions the use of very-high-resolution satellite imagery in a study on individual tree crown delineation in mangrove forests. However, it does not provide information on the specific methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. 

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive answer to the query. However, it can be inferred that remote sensing data, particularly satellite imagery, is a common source of data used in studies related to land cover change and mangrove forests.
