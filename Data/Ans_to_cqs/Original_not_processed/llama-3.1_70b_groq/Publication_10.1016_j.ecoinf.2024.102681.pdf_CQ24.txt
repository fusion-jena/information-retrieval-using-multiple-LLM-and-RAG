Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models, particularly CNN and LSTM, for drought assessment and prediction. It discusses the architecture of the hybrid CNN-LSTM model, the dataset used, and the methodology employed for drought propagation time series analysis. However, it does not delve into the details of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
