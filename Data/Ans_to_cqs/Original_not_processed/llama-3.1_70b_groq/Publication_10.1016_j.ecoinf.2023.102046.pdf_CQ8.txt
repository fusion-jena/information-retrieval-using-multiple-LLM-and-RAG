Answer: I don't know. The provided context does not mention the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. It mentions the use of HuggingFace implementations for ViT and ResNet, and a Keras implementation for Inception-V3, but it does not provide information on where the code for the pipeline is hosted.
