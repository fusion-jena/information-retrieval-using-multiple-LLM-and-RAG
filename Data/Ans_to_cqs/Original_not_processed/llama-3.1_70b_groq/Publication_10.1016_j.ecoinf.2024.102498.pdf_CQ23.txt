Answer:::
The provided context does not specifically mention the use of deep learning models, but rather traditional machine learning techniques such as CART, RF, GTB, and SVM. However, it does mention the use of validation data to tune hyperparameters and avoid overfitting, which is a measure to ensure the generalizability of the models.

According to the text, the validation data were employed to tune the key hyperparameters for each model, and the performance of the models was evaluated using the validation data. This suggests that some form of validation or testing was used to assess the models' performance and prevent overfitting.

However, there is no mention of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the use of a diverse dataset to ensure generalizability. The text only mentions the use of validation data, but it does not provide details on how the data were split or whether any techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting were used.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the models beyond the use of validation data.
