Answer: 

The text does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the overall proportion of the complete dataset is described as representative of land use classes in the study area, as shown in Table 3. This suggests that the dataset may have been designed to be representative of the study area, which could help with generalizability. Additionally, the text mentions that an overview of the plot locations is presented in Fig. 4, which could indicate that the data was collected from a variety of locations, potentially increasing the model's generalizability. However, without more information, it is unclear what specific measures were taken to ensure generalizability, such as cross-validation or stratified splitting.
