Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be related to text mining, topic modeling, and social network analysis, but it does not discuss deep learning or optimization techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
