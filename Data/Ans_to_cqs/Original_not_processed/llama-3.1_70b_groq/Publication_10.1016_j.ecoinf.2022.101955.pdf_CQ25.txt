Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the context is classification, specifically for land use and land cover (LULC) classification. The context describes the use of various machine learning models, including artificial neural networks (ANN), for classifying LULC types. The ANN model is described as a mathematical model that mimics the human brain's functionality for knowledge acquisition, recall, synthesis, and problem-solving. In the context of LULC classification, the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) type of ANN is used to accurately classify LULC types. The model is trained using a backpropagation learning algorithm and is used to classify LULC classes based on input features such as Landsat bands. The purpose of the model is to assign a class label to each input sample, indicating the type of land use or land cover present in the corresponding area.
