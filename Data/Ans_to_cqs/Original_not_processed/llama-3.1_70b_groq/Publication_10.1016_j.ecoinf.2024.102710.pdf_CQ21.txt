Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the active learning experiments, transfer learning, and the use of different pre-trained models for species-level sound event detection. It discusses the performance metrics, computational time, and the embedding space of the selected transfer learning model, but it does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

However, it does mention that "All performance metrics are evaluated on focal and citizen-science datasets" (Section 3.1), which suggests that some form of evaluation or metrics calculation is performed, but the details are not provided.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
