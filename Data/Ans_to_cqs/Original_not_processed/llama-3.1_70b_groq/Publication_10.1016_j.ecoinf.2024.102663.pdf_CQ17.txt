Answer:::
Lasso and Ridge models are mentioned in the provided context as being used in the deep learning pipeline. These are regularization methods used to prevent overfitting. Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) uses L1 regularization, while Ridge uses L2 regularization. However, it is not explicitly stated whether dropout is used in the pipeline.
