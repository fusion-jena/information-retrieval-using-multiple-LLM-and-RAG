Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters, such as learning rate or optimizer. The context appears to be related to a different type of model, specifically the ppmlasso package and the ppmlassoMixEngine function, which is used for point process modeling. The context discusses various parameters and options for this function, but does not mention deep learning or its associated hyperparameters.
