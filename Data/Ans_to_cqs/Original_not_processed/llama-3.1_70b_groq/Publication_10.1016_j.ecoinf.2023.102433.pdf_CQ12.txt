Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not specify the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It only mentions that deep learning analysis can be performed using Tensorflow, a machine learning and artificial intelligence open-source framework developed by the Google Brain team. However, it does not provide information on the specific type of deep learning model used, such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer.
