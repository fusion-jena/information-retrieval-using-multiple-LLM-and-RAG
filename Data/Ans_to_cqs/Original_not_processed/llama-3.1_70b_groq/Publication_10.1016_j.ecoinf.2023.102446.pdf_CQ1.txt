Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the study used "half-hour temporal resolution flux tower data" which suggests that sensors or flux towers were used to collect data. Additionally, the context mentions that the data is available with Dr. Sandipan Mukherjee and the authorities of G. B. Pant National Institute of Himalayan Environment, which implies that the data may have been collected through some sort of environmental monitoring or research institution.

It does not mention surveys or public datasets as a source of data collection. Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that sensors or flux towers were likely used to collect the raw data, but the exact methods used are not explicitly stated.
