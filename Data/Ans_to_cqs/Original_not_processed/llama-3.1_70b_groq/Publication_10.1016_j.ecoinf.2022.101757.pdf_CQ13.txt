Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context discusses the use of a pre-trained DeeplabV3+ model with the COCO dataset, but it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used during training. It only mentions that the weights were obtained from an already trained implementation of DeeplabV3+, but it does not provide further details about the training process.
