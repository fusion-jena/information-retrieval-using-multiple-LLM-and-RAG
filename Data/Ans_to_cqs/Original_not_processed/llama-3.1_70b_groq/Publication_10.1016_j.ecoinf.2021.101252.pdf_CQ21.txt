Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the model training process, including the selection of the optimal number of training epochs, and the evaluation of the model's performance using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).

However, it does mention that the performance of the selected model is evaluated using the AUC metric on a test data set (T). This suggests that some form of metrics calculation is involved, but the specific details are not provided.

Therefore, I can only confirm that metrics calculation (specifically AUC) is involved in the postprocessing steps, but I do not have information on other potential postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps or Confusion matrix.
