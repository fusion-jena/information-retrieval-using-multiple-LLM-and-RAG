Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text does discuss the use of a combination of binary cross-entropy and dice coefficient loss as the objective loss function for training the CNN model, but it does not provide information on regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization.
