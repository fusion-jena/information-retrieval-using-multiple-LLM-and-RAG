Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model are:

1. AUC (Area Under the Curve)
2. TPR (True Positive Rate)
3. TSS (True Skill Statistic)
4. Omission (lower is better)
5. Kappa (Kappa value)

These metrics are presented to allow for comparison, as there is no consensus on the best measure.
