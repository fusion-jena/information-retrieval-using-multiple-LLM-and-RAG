Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily discusses the challenges of model validation in species distribution modeling, the importance of considering all available data, and the limitations of traditional validation methods. It also touches on the use of specific metrics, such as True Skill Statistics (TSS), and thresholding methods for evaluating model performance. However, it does not provide information on the criteria used to determine when training is complete. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
