Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on data preparation, image processing, and the use of deep learning algorithms for forest type classification. It discusses techniques such as data augmentation through rotation and overlap to increase the number of training samples, but it does not address randomness or the use of random seed values in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
