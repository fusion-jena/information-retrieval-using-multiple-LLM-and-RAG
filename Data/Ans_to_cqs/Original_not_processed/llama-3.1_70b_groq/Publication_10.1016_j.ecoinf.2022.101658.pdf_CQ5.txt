Answer: The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned as popular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, based on the provided context, it appears that the study used a custom dataset collected from three field sites: Pelican Mountain (PM), Calling Lake (CL), and Conklin (CK). The dataset consists of field measurements and raw photos from these sites, which were used for training and testing a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) for semantic segmentation.
