Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is to predict Soil Organic Carbon Stocks (SOCS) based on environmental covariates. Specifically, the model is designed to establish a relationship between SOCS and various environmental factors such as topography, parent material, soil variables, climate, and biota. The model uses a multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithm, a type of feedforward artificial neural network, to make predictions. The input layer receives features (environmental covariates) that are used for prediction, and the output layer yields the prediction results (SOCS). The model is not used for classification, segmentation, or detection, but rather for regression, as it aims to predict a continuous value (SOCS) based on the input features.
