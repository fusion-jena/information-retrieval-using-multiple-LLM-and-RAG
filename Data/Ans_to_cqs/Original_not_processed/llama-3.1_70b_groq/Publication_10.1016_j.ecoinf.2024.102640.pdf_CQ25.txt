Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically SegFormer, is semantic segmentation. It is used to measure photo GVI (Green View Index) by segmenting images into different categories, such as urban green areas. The model follows an encoder-decoder structure, combining a Transformer-based encoder with a lightweight decoder composed of multilayer perceptron (MLP) blocks. The goal is to accurately identify and extract green areas from images, which is essential for assessing visual green effects and urban tree cover.
