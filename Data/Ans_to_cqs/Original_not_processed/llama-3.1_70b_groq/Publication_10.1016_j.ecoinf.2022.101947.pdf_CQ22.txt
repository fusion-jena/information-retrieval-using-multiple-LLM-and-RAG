Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, except for accuracy. It is mentioned that the final classification model correctly predicted 44 tigers giving 100% accuracy. However, it does not provide information on other metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, etc.

It is also mentioned that the process was iterated multiple times by altering elements within the model to generate the fewest misclassifications, which suggests that the model's performance was evaluated based on the number of misclassifications, but the exact metrics used are not specified.

Therefore, the only metric that can be confirmed from the provided context is accuracy. Other metrics may have been used, but they are not mentioned in the provided text.
