Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention anything about handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline or the use of random seed values. The context appears to be related to wildfire events, vegetation recovery, and remote sensing, with tables and text discussing the use of the Random Forest (RF) classifier in Google Earth Engine (GEE) for burned area mapping. However, this is not related to deep learning or handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
