Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The text discusses the methodology, data gathering, and data augmentation techniques used to improve the results of the U-Net model in identifying Hedychium Coronarium, an invasive vegetation species. However, it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine the completion of the training process.

The text does mention that the U-Net model was trained using different approaches, such as creating the training dataset using only one epoch images or mixing images from autumn, winter, and spring. It also mentions that data augmentation techniques, such as brightness changes and small zoom, were used to improve the results. However, it does not provide information on how the training process was stopped or what criteria were used to determine when the model was fully trained.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete.
