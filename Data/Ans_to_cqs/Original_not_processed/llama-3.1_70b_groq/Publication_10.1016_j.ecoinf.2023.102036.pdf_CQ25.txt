Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the mention of "extract high levels of representation of image content" and "sorting fish", it can be inferred that the deep learning model is likely used for classification tasks, such as identifying and categorizing images of fish. Additionally, the mention of "detecting certain hidden characteristics in the data" suggests that the model may also be used for detection tasks. However, without more specific information, it is difficult to determine the exact purpose of the deep learning model.
