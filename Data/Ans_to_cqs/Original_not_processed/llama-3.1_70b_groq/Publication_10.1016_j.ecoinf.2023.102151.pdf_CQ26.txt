Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on soil science, soil surveys, and node-based programming, with some references to machine learning and data-driven approaches. However, it does not specifically discuss techniques for addressing data bias in deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to this question. If you have any further context or clarification, I would be happy to try and assist you further.
