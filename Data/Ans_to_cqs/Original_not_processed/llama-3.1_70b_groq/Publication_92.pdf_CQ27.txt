Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context mainly focuses on the architecture of the network, the training phase, and the post-processing steps, but it does not provide information on how the model was deployed.

However, it does mention that the network was trained on a list of cropped thumbnails and their labels, and that the trained model was used to classify new images. But the specifics of model serialization, platform selection, and deployment are not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this query.
