Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, except for a mention of a dataset shared by Jiang et al. (2020) through a Github repository: https://github.com/zhangchuanyin/weed-datasets. This dataset is referred to as the "DeepWeeds" dataset. Additionally, the context mentions that the dataset has inter-class similarity and intra-class dissimilarity issues, which affected the classification accuracy. However, it does not provide information about other datasets used in the pipeline.
