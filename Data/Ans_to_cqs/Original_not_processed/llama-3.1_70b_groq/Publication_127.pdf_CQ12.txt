Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the context, which mentions the use of the VGG model, which is a type of CNN, in the first stage of the pipeline to classify whether an image contains an animal. Additionally, the context mentions other CNN architectures such as AlexNet, NiN, GoogLeNet, and ResNet, which suggests that the pipeline is using CNNs for image classification tasks. There is no mention of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers in the context, which further supports the conclusion that the pipeline is using CNNs.
