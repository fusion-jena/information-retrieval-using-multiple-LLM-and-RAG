Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on a systematic review of ecological informatics studies, discussing methodologies, screening processes, and data synthesis. 

However, it does mention the use of "regularisation multiplier" in the context of Maxent modeling, which is a technique used to prevent overfitting. But this is not directly related to addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.

The context also mentions the use of deep learning strategies, such as neural networks, but it does not provide information on the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
