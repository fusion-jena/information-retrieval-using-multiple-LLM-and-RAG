Answer:::
The hyperparameters of the Random Forest (RF) model are optimized using a combination of methods. The parameter M, which is the number of variables to try at each split, is found through the internal RF function TuneRF. This function calculates the optimal number of variables starting from the default value and finds the value with the minimum Out-of-Bag (OOB) error rate below and above the threshold value (i.e., one-third of the total number of variables for regression).

Additionally, the study uses an alternate method of successive screening to determine the optimal parameter M. This method attempts to take all possible values of M into account, rather than relying solely on empirical formulas.

There is no mention of grid search or random search being used for hyperparameter optimization in the provided context.
