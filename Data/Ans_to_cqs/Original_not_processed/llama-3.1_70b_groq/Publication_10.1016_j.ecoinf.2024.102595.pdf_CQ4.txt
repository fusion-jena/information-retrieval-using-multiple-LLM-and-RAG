Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on data transformation techniques, specifically MinMaxScaler and LabelEncoder, which are used to preprocess the data before feeding it into machine learning algorithms. It also discusses the division of preprocessed data into training, validation, and test sets, as well as the use of hyper-parameter tuning via GridSearchCV with cross-validation. However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
