Answer: I don't know. The provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on a research study related to predicting marine chemical data, specifically dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations, and discusses various machine learning and deep learning models, but does not mention the datasets used in the pipeline.
