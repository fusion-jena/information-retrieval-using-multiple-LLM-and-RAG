Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context only mentions that the network is fed with annotated data, usually referred to as a "supervised approach", but it does not provide details on the annotation techniques used.

However, it is mentioned that the data is annotated by experts, and the annotations are carefully generated. This suggests that the annotation process is done manually by humans, but the specific techniques used are not specified.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query. If more context or information is provided, I may be able to give a more specific answer.
