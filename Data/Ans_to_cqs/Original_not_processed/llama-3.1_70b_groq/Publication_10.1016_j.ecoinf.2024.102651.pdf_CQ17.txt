Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily discusses the experimental results and the performance of the proposed CA-Hybrid network, which combines CNN and ViT modules, and the use of CAM to improve classification accuracy. It does not provide information on the specific regularization techniques used in the pipeline.
