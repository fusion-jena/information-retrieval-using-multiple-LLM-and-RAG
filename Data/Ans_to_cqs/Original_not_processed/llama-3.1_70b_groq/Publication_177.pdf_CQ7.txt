The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training is based on a percentage distribution. According to the provided context, the original dataset was split into training (60%), validation (20%), and testing (20%) sets. This distribution was achieved by initially splitting the data into training (60%) and testing (40%) sets, and then further dividing the testing set into validation (20%) and testing (20%) sets.
