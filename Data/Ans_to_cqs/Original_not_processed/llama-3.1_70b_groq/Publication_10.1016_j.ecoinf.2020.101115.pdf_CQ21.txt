Answer:::

I don't know. The provided context does not mention anything about model training, postprocessing steps, saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, data management, and fish scale and otolith archives, but it does not provide any information about machine learning or model training.
