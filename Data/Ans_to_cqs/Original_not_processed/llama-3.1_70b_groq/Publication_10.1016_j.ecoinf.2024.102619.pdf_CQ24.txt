Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The text primarily focuses on the CNN architecture, hyperparameter settings, and training procedures, but does not discuss randomness or reproducibility measures.

However, it is worth noting that the use of the Adam learning rate optimizer, which is mentioned in the context, can help reduce the impact of randomness in the training process. Adam is an adaptive learning rate optimizer that adjusts the learning rate based on the magnitude of the gradient, which can help stabilize the training process and reduce the effect of random fluctuations.

Other than this, the context does not provide any information on strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a more detailed answer to this question based on the provided context.
