Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. It appears to be related to a study on land use modeling, specifically the PLUS model, and mentions data sources such as NDVI, vegetation type data, DEM, temperature, precipitation, radiation, road data, GDP data, and population data. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline.
