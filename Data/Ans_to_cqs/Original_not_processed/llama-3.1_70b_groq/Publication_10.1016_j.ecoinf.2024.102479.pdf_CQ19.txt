Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a study that compares the performance of different machine learning algorithms, including artificial neural networks, but it does not provide information on the specific frameworks used to implement these algorithms.

The context does mention the "neuralnet" package, which is a package for training neural networks in R, as mentioned in the reference "Fritsch, S., Guenther, F., Guenther, M.F., 2019. Package ‘neuralnet’. In: Training of Neural Networks, 2, p. 30." However, this is not a deep learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to answer the query about the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model.
