Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it does mention "CPU" (Central Processing Unit) and "GPU" (Graphics Processing Unit) in the list of abbreviations, suggesting that these hardware resources might be relevant to the topic. Nevertheless, it does not provide a clear answer to the question. Therefore, I can only say that the context mentions CPU and GPU as related terms, but it does not explicitly state which one is used for training the deep learning model.
