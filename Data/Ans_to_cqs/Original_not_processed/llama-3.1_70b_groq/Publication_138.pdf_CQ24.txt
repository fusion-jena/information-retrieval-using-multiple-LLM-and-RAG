Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context appears to be focused on the results of various deep learning algorithms, including ICSNet, LeNet, AlexNet, VGG-19, GoogLeNet, ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and ResNet152, and their performance on a specific task, likely image classification.

However, it can be inferred that the experiments were conducted with a fixed random seed value, as the results are reported with a high degree of precision and consistency across different algorithms and configurations. This suggests that the authors may have used a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility of the results.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of mini-batch sizes and the number of epochs, which can affect the randomness in the training process. However, it does not provide explicit information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query.
