Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the model training process, including the dataset, model architecture, and training parameters. It also discusses the results and performance of the model on the test sets.

However, it does mention the calculation of test accuracy, which suggests that some form of metrics calculation was performed. Additionally, the context includes a table (Table 2) that shows the validation performance of different models, which may imply that some form of evaluation or metrics calculation was performed.

But, there is no mention of saliency maps or confusion matrices, which are common postprocessing steps in deep learning model evaluation. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
