Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning in ecological research, camera trap technology, and the use of R programming language for image classification tasks.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions the use of the Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014) in training a deep neural network. The Adam optimizer is a stochastic optimization algorithm that can help mitigate the effects of randomness in the training process. Nevertheless, this is not a direct answer to the query, and I couldn't find any information on random seed values or other strategies for handling randomness in the provided context.

Therefore, I must conclude that I don't know the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
