Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context appears to be related to a study on estimating forest biomass using machine learning methods and remote sensing imagery, but it does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps used.

The context mentions the importance of high-quality training samples and the layout of sampling points for constructing accurate and reliable models for biomass estimation. It also references several studies related to forest biomass estimation, but it does not provide details on the postprocessing steps involved in the study.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. If you have any additional context or information, I would be happy to try and help further.
