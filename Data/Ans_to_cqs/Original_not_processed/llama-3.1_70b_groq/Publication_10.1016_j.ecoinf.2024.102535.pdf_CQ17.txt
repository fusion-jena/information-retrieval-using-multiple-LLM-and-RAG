Answer:::

The provided context mentions one regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline: dropout. According to the text, "Dropout refers to the number of neurons randomly turned off during each training inference." This suggests that dropout is used as a regularization technique to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping out neurons during training.

However, the context does not mention L2 regularization as a method used to prevent overfitting. Additionally, the text mentions early stopping as a method used to avoid overfitting, but it is not explicitly stated as a regularization method.

It is also worth noting that the text mentions that the network architecture was modified to use only one fully connected layer instead of two, which could potentially help reduce the risk of overfitting by reducing the number of parameters in the model.

Overall, the only regularization method explicitly mentioned in the context as a method to prevent overfitting is dropout.
