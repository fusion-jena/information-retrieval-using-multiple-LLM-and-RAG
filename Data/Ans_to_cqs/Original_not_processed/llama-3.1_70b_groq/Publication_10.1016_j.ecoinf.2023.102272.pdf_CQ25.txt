Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly state the purpose of the deep learning model. However, based on the information provided, it appears that the model is being used for classification tasks. The context mentions that the accuracy of the candidate models is being evaluated using a validation dataset, and the performance is being measured in terms of the proportion of cases correctly classified. This suggests that the model is being used to classify data into different categories, but the specific classification task is not specified.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model is being used to predict the number of eggs, with different models representing different decreases or increases in the number of eggs (e.g., 1 to 25% and > 25 to 50%). This suggests that the model may be being used for a regression task, but the primary focus appears to be on classification.

Overall, while the exact purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated, the context suggests that it is being used for classification tasks, possibly with a focus on predicting the number of eggs in a regression-like task.
