Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the application of deep learning models, specifically Faster R-CNN, for object detection in drone thermal imagery, particularly for deer surveys. It discusses the architecture of the models, the challenges of detecting small objects, and the advantages of using certain models over others.

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the raw data is likely collected through drone thermal imagery, as mentioned in the title of the article "Deer survey from drone thermal imagery using enhanced faster R-CNN based on ResNets and FPN". This suggests that the data collection method involves using drones equipped with thermal imaging sensors to capture images of deer in their natural habitats.

Other than this, the context does not provide information on the specific methods used for collecting raw data, such as surveys, public datasets, or other types of sensors. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a more detailed answer to this question based on the provided context.
