Answer: The provided context does not mention a deep learning model. However, it does discuss segmentation and classification strategies in eCognition, a software used for image analysis. According to the text, machine learning techniques are being used to automatically classify images, and segmentation is used to divide images into different regions or objects. The purpose of these techniques is to improve the classification of images, which can help capture the process of interest. Specifically, the text mentions that segmentation and classification are used to analyze aerial images, including historical imagery. 

It can be inferred that the purpose of the modeling approach, which includes machine learning techniques, is to improve the classification and segmentation of images, but the text does not explicitly mention a deep learning model.
