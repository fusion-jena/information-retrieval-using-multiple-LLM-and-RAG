Answer: The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned as a well-known dataset like MNIST, CIFAR, or CIFAR-100. However, it is mentioned that the data was normalised to ImageNet mean values, suggesting that the model was pre-trained on ImageNet or that the ImageNet mean values were used for normalization. The actual dataset used for training and testing the model appears to be a custom dataset of images of red kites, with a total of 24,675 images in the training set and 32,986 images in the validation set. Additionally, an independent test set of 2060 images was used to evaluate the model's performance.
