Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not contain any information about the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. The context appears to be a jumbled collection of characters and symbols, possibly from a corrupted or encoded text file. It does not provide any meaningful information about deep learning models or their evaluation metrics.

However, in general, common metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, mean squared error, mean absolute error, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). The choice of metric depends on the specific problem, such as classification, regression, or object detection.

Since the provided context does not contain any relevant information, I cannot provide a more specific answer to the query.
