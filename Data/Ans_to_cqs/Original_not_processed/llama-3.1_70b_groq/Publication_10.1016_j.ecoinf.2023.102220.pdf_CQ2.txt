Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the references to image processing and time series data, it can be inferred that the pipeline may involve image and time series data formats.

The context mentions "color image retrieval" and "Distance measures for color image retrieval", which suggests that image data is being used. Additionally, the mention of "time series" data and "LSTM" (Long Short-Term Memory) method, which is commonly used for time series forecasting, implies that time series data is also being used.

However, the specific data formats (e.g., CSV, JPEG, etc.) are not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query.
