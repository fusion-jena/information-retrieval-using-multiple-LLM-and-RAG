Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention deep learning or optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines. The context appears to be related to urbanism, ecology, and habitat suitability models, with no apparent connection to deep learning or optimization techniques.

However, I can provide some general information on optimization techniques commonly used in deep learning pipelines. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam are indeed popular optimization algorithms used in deep learning. SGD is a widely used optimization algorithm that iteratively updates the model parameters to minimize the loss function. Adam is another popular optimization algorithm that adapts the learning rate for each parameter based on the magnitude of the gradient.

Other optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines include RMSProp, Adagrad, and Momentum. These algorithms are designed to improve the convergence rate and stability of the optimization process.

It's worth noting that the provided context does not mention any of these optimization techniques, and it's unclear how they relate to the context. If you have any further questions or clarification regarding the context, I'd be happy to try and assist you.
