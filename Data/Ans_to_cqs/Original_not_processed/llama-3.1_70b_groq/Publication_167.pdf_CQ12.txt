Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), which is also known as an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). This is mentioned in the provided context, specifically in Figure 4, which describes the deep learning module. The MLP has full connections between the layers, with an input layer, one or multiple hidden layers, and an output layer. The simplest MLP contains only one hidden layer, resulting in a total of three layers.
