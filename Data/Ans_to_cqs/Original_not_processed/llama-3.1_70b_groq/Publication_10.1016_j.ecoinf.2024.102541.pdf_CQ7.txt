Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be focused on various aspects of deep learning models, such as communication-efficient parallelization strategies, object detection algorithms, and loss functions, but it does not discuss data splitting criteria.

However, in general, common practices for splitting data for deep learning model training include:

* Random splitting: dividing the data into training, validation, and testing sets using random sampling.
* Stratified splitting: dividing the data into training, validation, and testing sets while maintaining the same class distribution in each set.
* K-fold cross-validation: dividing the data into k folds, using k-1 folds for training and 1 fold for testing, and repeating the process k times.

It's worth noting that the context does mention the use of ground-truth annotations and class distribution, which suggests that the data may be split in a way that maintains class balance, but the specific criteria used are not mentioned.
