Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model was trained using both training and validation data, which suggests that some form of cross-validation or splitting of the data was performed.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model was trained based on the results of previous steps, which included data preparation and labeling. This implies that the dataset used for training the model was carefully prepared and curated, which could have included measures to ensure diversity and representation of different classes.

However, without more specific information, it is difficult to say for certain what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model. The context does not mention stratified splitting, diverse dataset, or other specific techniques that are commonly used to ensure generalizability.

It is worth noting that the context does mention that the model was used for land-cover classification in North Korea, where there is no official land-cover map based on national-scale field surveys. This suggests that the model may have been trained on a limited or biased dataset, which could impact its generalizability.
