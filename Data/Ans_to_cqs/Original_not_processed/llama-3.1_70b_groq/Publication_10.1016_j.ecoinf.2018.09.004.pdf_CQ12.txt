Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. It discusses various machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Decision Trees, and K-nearest neighbors, but does not mention deep learning models. Therefore, I cannot determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
