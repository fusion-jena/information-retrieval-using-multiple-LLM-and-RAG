Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the active learning approach, hyperparameter tuning, and the application of deep learning models for bird call recognition.

However, it does mention the use of a grid search technique to tune hyperparameters, including the number of epochs, batch size, and learning rate. This suggests that the authors may have employed some form of randomization or sampling in the hyperparameter tuning process, but the specific strategies used to handle randomness are not explicitly stated.

Additionally, the context references a paper by HÃ¼llermeier and Waegeman (2021) on aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in machine learning, which may imply that the authors are aware of the importance of handling randomness and uncertainty in deep learning pipelines. Nevertheless, without further information, it is unclear what specific strategies were employed to handle randomness in this particular study.
