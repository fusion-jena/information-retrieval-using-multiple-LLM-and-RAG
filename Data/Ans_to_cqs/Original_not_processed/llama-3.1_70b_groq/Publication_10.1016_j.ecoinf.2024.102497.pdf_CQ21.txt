Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the Random Forest Regression (RFR) model, its advantages, and its application in nearshore bathymetry studies. It also mentions other studies that have used different models for bathymetry retrieval, but it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, as this information is not provided in the given context.
