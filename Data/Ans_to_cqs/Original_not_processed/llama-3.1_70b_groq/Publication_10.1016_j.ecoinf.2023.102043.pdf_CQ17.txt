Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text only describes the architecture and processing steps of the YAMNet model, as well as the experimental setup and results, but does not provide information on regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
