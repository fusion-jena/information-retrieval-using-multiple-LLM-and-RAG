Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of bounding box images of detected moths, which suggests that bounding box annotation is used. Additionally, the context mentions the use of a region proposal network (RPN) classifier and mask head, which are typically used in instance segmentation tasks. 

Furthermore, the context mentions the use of a feature fusion module to combine the extracted features from both backbones, which is a common technique used in instance segmentation tasks. The context also mentions the use of a D-Mask R-CNN architecture, which is a type of instance segmentation model.

However, the context does not provide a comprehensive list of data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. It only provides hints about the use of bounding box annotation and instance segmentation. 

Therefore, based on the provided context, the data annotation techniques that can be inferred are:

* Bounding box annotation
* Instance segmentation (using a D-Mask R-CNN architecture)

Note that this is not an exhaustive list, and other data annotation techniques might be used in the pipeline that are not mentioned in the provided context.
