Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention deep learning pipelines or strategies for handling randomness in such pipelines. The context appears to be related to soil science, climate, and permafrost, with no apparent connection to deep learning or artificial intelligence. Therefore, I am unable to provide a relevant answer to the query.
