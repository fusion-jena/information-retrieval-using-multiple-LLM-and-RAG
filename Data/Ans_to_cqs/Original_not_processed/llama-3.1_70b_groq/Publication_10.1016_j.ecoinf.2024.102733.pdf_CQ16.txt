Answer: The text mentions that a scheduler is used to adjust the learning rate when the network reaches a plateau. This suggests that the training process is monitored for a plateau in the validation loss, and the learning rate is adjusted accordingly. However, the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete are not explicitly stated. It can be inferred that the training process may be stopped when the validation loss stops improving or reaches a certain threshold, but the exact criteria are not provided.
