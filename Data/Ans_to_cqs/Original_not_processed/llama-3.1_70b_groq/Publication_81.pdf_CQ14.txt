Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the use of Elastic Net to solve the overfitting problem and improve the generalization ability of the ESK model, as well as the structure of the EN-SAE model. However, it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process.

Therefore, I do not know how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, as this information is not provided in the given context.
