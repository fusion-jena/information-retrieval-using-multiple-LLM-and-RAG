Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the models were trained and evaluated on two separate datasets, UBD_45 and VP_200. This suggests that the models were tested on different datasets, which can help to ensure their generalizability.

Additionally, the context mentions that the models were initialized with pre-trained ImageNet weights and then fine-tuned to the specific datasets. This is a common technique used to adapt pre-trained models to new datasets and tasks, which can help to improve their generalizability.

However, there is no mention of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or other techniques that are commonly used to ensure the generalizability of machine learning models. Therefore, it is unclear whether these techniques were used in this study.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of Bayesian optimization to find the optimal hyperparameters for each model. This technique can help to improve the performance of the models, but it does not directly address the issue of generalizability.

In summary, while the study appears to have taken some steps to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning models, such as using pre-trained weights and testing on multiple datasets, it is unclear whether other techniques such as cross-validation and stratified splitting were used.
