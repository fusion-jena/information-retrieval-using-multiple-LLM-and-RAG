Answer: I don't know.

The provided context appears to be a collection of research papers and equations related to ecological informatics, vegetation change, and climate change. However, there is no mention of a model or its hyperparameters, let alone how they are optimized. The context seems to focus on the analysis of vegetation changes and the impact of climate change, but it does not provide information on machine learning models or hyperparameter optimization techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
