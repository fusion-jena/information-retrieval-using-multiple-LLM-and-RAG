Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention the deployment of a trained deep learning model, nor does it discuss model serialization or platform selection. The text appears to focus on species distribution modeling using random forest and generalized linear models, and discusses techniques such as bootstrapping and bagging for improving model accuracy. There is no mention of deep learning models or their deployment.
