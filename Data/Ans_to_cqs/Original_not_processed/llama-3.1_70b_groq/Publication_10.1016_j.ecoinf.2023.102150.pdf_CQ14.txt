Answer: The text does not explicitly state how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that "We explored different hyper-parameters and choose the ones that gave the best results for training the final model." This suggests that some form of hyperparameter tuning was performed, but the specific method used (e.g., grid search, random search) is not specified.
