Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context appears to be a research paper about a fully automatic system for fish biomass estimation based on a deep neural network, and it provides various tables and figures with results, but it does not provide information on the training process or the strategy used to monitor model performance. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
