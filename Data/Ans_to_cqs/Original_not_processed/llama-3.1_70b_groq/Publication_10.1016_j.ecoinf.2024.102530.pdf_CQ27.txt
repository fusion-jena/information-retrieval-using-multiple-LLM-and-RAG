Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. It appears to be discussing the development and validation of a fuzzy inference system (FIS) model, specifically the Apis-FIS model, using Matlab 2023b. The context mentions the use of the fuzzy logic toolbox in Matlab, but it does not provide information on the deployment process of a deep learning model.
