Answer: 

The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the provided context is classification. Specifically, it is used to construct a pest hazard class classification model. The model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm to classify the degree of damage to forest trees by pests. The model achieves an overall accuracy (OA) of 89.50% and a kappa coefficient of 0.8666, indicating its effectiveness in identifying the degree of damage. The model is trained on sensitive spectral vegetation indices, which perform well in the 1D-CNN model. The results of the model are used to identify the distribution of pest damage to forest trees in the study area.
