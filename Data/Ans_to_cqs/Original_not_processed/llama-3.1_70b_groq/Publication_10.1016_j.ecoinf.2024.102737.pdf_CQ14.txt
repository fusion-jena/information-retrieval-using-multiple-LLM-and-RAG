Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the evaluation of the model's performance using different measures (P1, P3, P5, and P6) and provides results for different experiments (E1 and E2) with varying training and test set sizes. However, it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process.
