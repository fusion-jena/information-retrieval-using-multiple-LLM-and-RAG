Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does provide information on the dataset composition and the challenges of dealing with an unbalanced dataset.

The context mentions that the dataset was split into a training set and a test set, with a total of 3817 points in the training set (541 + 802 + 825 + 769 + 880) and 1625 points in the test set (222 + 344 + 353 + 324 + 382). However, it does not provide information on how the data was split or what criteria were used to determine the proportion of points in each set.

Additionally, the context mentions that the dataset was balanced to have 38% iceplant points and 62% other vegetation points, but it does not provide information on how this balancing was achieved or what criteria were used to determine the optimal balance.

Therefore, I do not know the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, and I cannot provide a more detailed answer.
