Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a collection of research papers and references related to environmental science, machine learning, and ENSO (El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation) forecasting. While it mentions various studies and models, it does not provide information on data repositories or specific datasets used in the research. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
