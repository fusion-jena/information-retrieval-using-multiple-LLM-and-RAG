Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and training of the models, such as Deeplabv3+ and Unet, but does not provide information on model deployment.

The context does mention the training process, including the learning rate, number of iterations, batch size, and optimizer used, but it does not discuss model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related topics.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
