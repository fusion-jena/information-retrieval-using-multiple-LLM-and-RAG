Answer:

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline utilizes a fungal database resulting from the sampling of more than 100 permanent sampling plots over 20 years. This suggests that the raw data is collected through field sampling and observation methods, specifically through the use of permanent sample plots in Mediterranean forest ecosystems.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of predictive models based on machine learning algorithms, which implies that the collected data is likely to be in the form of spatially and temporally referenced observations of fungal productivity. However, the exact methods used for collecting raw data, such as surveys or sensors, are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of a database, which could potentially be supplemented with public datasets or other external data sources. However, this is not explicitly stated, and the primary source of data appears to be the field sampling efforts.

Therefore, while we can infer that field sampling and observation methods are used to collect raw data, the exact methods and sources used are not fully specified in the provided context.
