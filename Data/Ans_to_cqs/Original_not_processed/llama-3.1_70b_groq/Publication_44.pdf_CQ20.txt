Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model was implemented using Keras with a TensorFlow backend. This suggests that the training process could have been performed on a variety of hardware platforms that support TensorFlow, including GPUs and TPUs. Unfortunately, without further information, it is not possible to determine the exact hardware resources used for training the model.
