Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, I can provide some insights based on the information available.

In the paper "Predicting air quality with deep learning LSTM: Towards comprehensive models" by Navares and Aznarte (2020), the authors mention that they used a dataset from the Yangtze River Delta, which suggests that they may have used a diverse dataset. However, there is no explicit mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting.

In another paper, "Spatio-temporal learning in predicting ambient particulate matter concentration by multi-layer perceptron" by Chianese et al. (2019), the authors mention that they used a 10-fold cross-validation technique to evaluate the performance of their model. However, this paper is not specifically about deep learning models, and it's not clear if the same technique was used in the deep learning model mentioned in the query.

In general, cross-validation and stratified splitting are common techniques used to ensure the generalizability of machine learning models. However, without more specific information, I cannot confirm whether these techniques were used in the deep learning model mentioned in the query.

Therefore, I can only provide a partial answer, and I would like to clarify that I don't know the exact measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
