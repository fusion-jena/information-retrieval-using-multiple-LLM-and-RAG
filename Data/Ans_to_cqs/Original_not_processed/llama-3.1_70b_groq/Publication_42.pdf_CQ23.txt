Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the model was trained and validated using a dataset, and the performance was evaluated using the F1-score.

It is mentioned that the model was prone to overfitting when using a large number of parameters, and that using pre-trained weights and only training the output layers helped to improve the performance. This suggests that the model was sensitive to the amount of training data, and that using pre-trained weights may have helped to improve generalizability.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model was trained using a dropout probability of 0.3 after the second to last hidden layer, which is a regularization technique that can help to prevent overfitting and improve generalizability.

However, without more information, it is not possible to determine the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.
