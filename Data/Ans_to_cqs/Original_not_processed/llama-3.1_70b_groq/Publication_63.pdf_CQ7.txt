Answer:::

The data was split into three parts for deep learning model training: training dataset, validation dataset, and test dataset. 

The test dataset was created by extracting a random sample of 10% of the dataset of each trait before model training. This test dataset was not involved in the training process and was used exclusively for the independent evaluation of the trained models.

The remaining data was split into training dataset and validation dataset by a ratio of 4:1. The training dataset was employed to train the weights of the CNN model, whereas the validation dataset indicated the training progress after each full training cycle (epoch). 

Additionally, a 3-fold cross-validation was used to assess the final model performance, with three different training, validation, and test splits.
