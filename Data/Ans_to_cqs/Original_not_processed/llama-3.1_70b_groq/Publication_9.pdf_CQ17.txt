Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention stochastic gradient descent with backpropagation as an algorithm used to adjust model weights and minimize error.

Although not explicitly mentioned, one of the references provided, "He, K., Zhang, X., Ren, S., & Sun, J. (2015). Delving deep into rectifiers: Surpassing human-level performance on ImageNet classification," might be related to the topic of regularization methods. The paper "Delving deep into rectifiers" is a well-known paper in the field of deep learning, and it discusses the use of rectified linear units (ReLUs) as an activation function, which can help with reducing overfitting.

However, without more information or context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the question about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
