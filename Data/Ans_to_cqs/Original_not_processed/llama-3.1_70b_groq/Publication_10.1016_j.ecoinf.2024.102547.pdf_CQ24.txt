Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention deep learning or strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on functional data analysis (FDA) and its application to ecological studies, particularly in marine environments. It discusses the use of statistical methods for functional data and reviews recent advances in FDA, but it does not touch on deep learning or randomness in a deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
