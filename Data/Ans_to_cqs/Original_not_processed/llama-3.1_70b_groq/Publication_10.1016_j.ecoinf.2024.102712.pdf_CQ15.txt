Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any deep learning pipeline or optimization techniques such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be related to remote sensing and forestry, discussing the use of LiDAR data and machine learning algorithms for estimating aboveground biomass density. It does not provide any information about the specific optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline.
