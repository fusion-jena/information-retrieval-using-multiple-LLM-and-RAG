Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses the performance of fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and traditional classification methods for image classification tasks, such as fish species classification and bluespotted ribbontail ray recognition. However, it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training the models.
