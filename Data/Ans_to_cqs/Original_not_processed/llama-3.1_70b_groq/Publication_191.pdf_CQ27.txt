Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the importance of deep learning in plant identification, the limitations of existing datasets, and the performance of various classifiers. However, it does not provide information on model deployment, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I do not have enough information to answer this question.
