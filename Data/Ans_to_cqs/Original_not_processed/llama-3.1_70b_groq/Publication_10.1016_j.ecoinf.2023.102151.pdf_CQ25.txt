Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the purpose of a deep learning model. However, based on the context, it appears that the focus is on digital soil mapping, soil moisture estimation, and visualization of subsurface soil properties. 

In the context of digital soil mapping, machine learning techniques are used for classification purposes (Geoderma 265, 62â€“77). This suggests that classification might be one of the purposes of the deep learning model. However, without more specific information, it is difficult to determine the exact purpose of the deep learning model.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of computational algorithms for visualization, which might imply that the deep learning model is used for tasks such as image segmentation or object detection. However, this is speculative, and more information is needed to provide a definitive answer.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model is likely related to classification, but the exact purpose is unclear.
