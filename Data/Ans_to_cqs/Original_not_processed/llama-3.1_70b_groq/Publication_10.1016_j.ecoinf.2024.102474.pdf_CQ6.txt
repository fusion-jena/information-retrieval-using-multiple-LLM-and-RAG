Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The text only mentions that the model was trained using the L2 loss determined on the predicted and observed RGBI channels, "ignoring the cloud-contaminated pixels". This suggests that some form of data cleaning or filtering was performed to exclude cloud-contaminated pixels, but the exact preprocessing steps are not specified.

Additionally, the text mentions that the EarthNet2021 dataset was used, but it does not provide information on any preprocessing steps that may have been applied to the data before training the model. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this question.
