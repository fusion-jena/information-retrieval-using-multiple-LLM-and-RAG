Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention anything about handling randomness in deep learning pipelines or the use of random seed values. The context appears to be focused on bird research, ecology, and conservation, with mentions of specific bird species, research papers, and tools like eBird and Xeno-canto. There is no mention of deep learning or machine learning pipelines, except for a brief mention of the BirdNET app, which is a machine learning-powered app for bird research, but it does not provide information on handling randomness in the pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
