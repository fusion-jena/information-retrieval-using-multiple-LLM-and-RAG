Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, specifically the Kaleidoscope recognizer, are recall rate and precision. 

The recall rate is estimated by dividing the number of cow calls detected by Kaleidoscope by the number of cow calls present in the sound recordings. This metric is interpreted as an index of the percentage of calls that the recognizer is able to detect.

The precision is estimated by dividing the number of cow calls detected by the software by the total number of Regions of Interest (ROIs) within the “Cow” cluster. This metric can be interpreted as an index of the percentage of ROIs correctly labeled by Kaleidoscope.

Note that accuracy is not mentioned as a metric used to evaluate the performance of the model in the provided context.
