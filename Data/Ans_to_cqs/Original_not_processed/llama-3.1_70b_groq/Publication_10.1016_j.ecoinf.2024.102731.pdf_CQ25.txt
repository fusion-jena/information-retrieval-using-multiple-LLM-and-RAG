Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its purpose. The context appears to be related to land cover classification, urban areas, and vegetation, with some references to research papers on topics such as habitat suitability models and urban heat-prone areas. However, there is no mention of a deep learning model or its intended use. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
