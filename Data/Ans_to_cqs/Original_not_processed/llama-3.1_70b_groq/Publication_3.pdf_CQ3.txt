Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the model architecture, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and the results of the classification challenges. However, it does not provide information on the data annotation techniques used, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, I do not know the specific data annotation techniques used in this pipeline.
