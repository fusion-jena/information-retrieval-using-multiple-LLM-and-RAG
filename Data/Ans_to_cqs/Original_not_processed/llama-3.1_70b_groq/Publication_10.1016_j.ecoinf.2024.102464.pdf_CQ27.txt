Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on species distribution modeling using machine learning models, and it discusses the research process, study sites, and model performance evaluation. However, it does not provide information on model deployment, serialization, or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
