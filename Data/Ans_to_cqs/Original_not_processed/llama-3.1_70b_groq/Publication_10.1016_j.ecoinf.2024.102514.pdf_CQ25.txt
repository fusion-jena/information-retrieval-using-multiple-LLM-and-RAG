The provided context does not mention the specific purpose of a deep learning model. However, based on the context, it appears that the study is focused on assessing water quality using machine learning approaches. The study uses various machine learning models, including Neural Networks (NN), to predict water quality indicators.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the purpose of the machine learning models, including the Neural Networks, is likely to be regression or prediction, as they are being used to predict continuous values of water quality indicators.

However, without more specific information, it is difficult to determine the exact purpose of the deep learning model.
