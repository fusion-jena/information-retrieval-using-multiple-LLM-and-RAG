Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to focus on the use of different audio features, such as mel-filterbanks, spectrograms, and waveforms, as inputs to neural networks for bird species recognition tasks. It discusses the performance of different features and neural network architectures, but does not provide information on data annotation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
