Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The code snippet provided only shows the model architecture (resnet18) and the number of epochs (2) used for training, but it does not specify the hyperparameters. Therefore, I do not know the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
