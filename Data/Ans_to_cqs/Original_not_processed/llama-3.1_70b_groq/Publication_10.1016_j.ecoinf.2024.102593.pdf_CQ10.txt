Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention a GitHub link related to a specific project: https://github.com/googlecreativelab/aiexperiments-bird-sounds. This link is mentioned in the context as a reference to a project by McDonald, Kyle, Tan, Manny, and Mann, Yotam, 2016, but it is not explicitly stated as the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline.
