Answer: The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for GreenCam, specifically for GVI learning, are not traditional datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the authors propose a new dataset called UGE-D (Urban Green Extraction Dataset) to train the GVI-learning model. Additionally, they mention other datasets that have been used for semantic segmentation tasks in urban scenarios, such as COCO-Stuff, Cityscapes, and AED20K. These datasets are used for training and benchmarking the SegFormer model, a state-of-the-art Transformer-based model for semantic segmentation.
