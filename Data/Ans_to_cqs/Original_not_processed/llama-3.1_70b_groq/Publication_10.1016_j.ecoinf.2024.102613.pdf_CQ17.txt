Answer::: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses data preprocessing, data analytics, and data processing in the context of smart farming systems, but it does not delve into the specifics of deep learning techniques or regularization methods.

However, it does mention that deep learning techniques are applied to analyze the generated data, but it does not provide further details on the specific methods used.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
