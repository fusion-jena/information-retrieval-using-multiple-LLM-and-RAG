Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on reviewing existing solutions for image enhancement using classical and deep learning-based approaches, highlighting various architectures and techniques used for underwater image enhancement. It does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, as this information is not provided in the given context.
