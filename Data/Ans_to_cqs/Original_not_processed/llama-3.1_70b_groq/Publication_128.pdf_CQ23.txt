Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention some techniques that can help improve the model's performance and reduce overfitting.

For example, the context mentions that the models with less than 100 layers were trained for 60 epochs, while the deeper models were trained for 80 epochs. This suggests that the authors were aware of the risk of overfitting and took steps to mitigate it by adjusting the training epochs based on the model's depth.

Additionally, the context mentions that the models use techniques such as batch normalization, dropout, and Leaky ReLU activation, which can help improve the model's performance and reduce overfitting.

However, without more information, it is not possible to determine whether the authors used techniques such as cross-validation, stratified splitting, or a diverse dataset to ensure the generalizability of the model.
