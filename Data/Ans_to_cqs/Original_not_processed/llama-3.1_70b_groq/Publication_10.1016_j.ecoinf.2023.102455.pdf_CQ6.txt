Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be a collection of hyperparameter settings and performance metrics for various deep learning models, including CNN-BiRNN, CNN-BiGRU, RVFL, and KELM. However, it does not provide information on the preprocessing steps that were applied to the data before training these models.

Therefore, I do not know the specific preprocessing steps that were involved before training these deep learning models. If you have any additional context or information, I may be able to provide a more helpful answer.
