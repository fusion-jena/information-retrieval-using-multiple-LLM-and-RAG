Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on the training process of the AODEGRU model, including the initialization of the model, definition of the loss function and optimizer, and the training loop. It also provides some references to related research papers, but it does not provide information on the deployment process.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
