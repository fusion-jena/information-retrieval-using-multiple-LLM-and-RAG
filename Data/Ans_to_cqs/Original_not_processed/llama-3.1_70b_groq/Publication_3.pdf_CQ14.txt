Answer: 
The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It mentions that the authors calibrated models for classification challenges using different numbers of training steps and considered two factors to find optima for training TensorFlow: correct identification rate and processing time. However, it does not provide information on the specific method used for hyperparameter optimization, such as grid search or random search.
