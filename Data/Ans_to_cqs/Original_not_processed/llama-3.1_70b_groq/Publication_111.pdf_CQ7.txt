Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that the training data is separated into training and validation groups to track the generalisation performance and apply the early stopping strategy. This suggests that the data is split into at least two groups: training and validation. 

It is common practice in machine learning to split the data into three groups: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to evaluate the model's performance during training and tune hyperparameters, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final model's performance. However, the specific criteria used to split the data (e.g., 80% for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing) are not mentioned in the provided context.
