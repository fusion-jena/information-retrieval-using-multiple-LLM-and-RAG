Answer: 
The context does not explicitly mention the deployment platform of the deep learning model. However, it does mention "Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform" as a platform that can process real-time satellite imagery with machine learning algorithms, which might be related to the research. But it does not confirm the deployment of the specific deep learning model mentioned in the query. Therefore, the answer to the query is that it is not specified in the provided context.
