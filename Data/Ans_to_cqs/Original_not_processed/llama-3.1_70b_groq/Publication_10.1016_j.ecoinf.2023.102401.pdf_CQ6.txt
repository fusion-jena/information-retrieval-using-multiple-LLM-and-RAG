Answer: According to the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include:

1. Denoising: This involves removing noise from the acquired data to improve its quality.
2. Image enhancement: This step enhances the quality of the images to make them more suitable for training the model.
3. Correction: This step involves correcting any errors or inaccuracies in the data.
4. Labeling the dataset: This involves assigning labels to the data to prepare it for training and evaluation.
5. Separating data into training and test images: This step involves dividing the collected underwater images into two sets, one for training and one for testing.

Additionally, the context mentions that the convolutional layer, batch normalization (BN) layer, and SiLU activation function are combined to form the CBS block, which is used in the model. However, it does not provide information on normalization or scaling as preprocessing steps.
