Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the use of machine learning models, such as random forest and support vector regression, for predicting algal-related parameters and identifying drivers of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs). It also discusses the importance of dataset size and quality, as well as the tuning of model parameters to improve performance.

However, it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
