Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the LaDeco framework, its architecture, and its application in landscape element classification. It discusses the use of pre-trained models, setting thresholds, and output formats, but does not delve into the preprocessing steps.

However, it is mentioned that the ADE20K dataset, which is used in this study, contributes significantly to the semantic segmentation field. This dataset is a large-scale dataset that contains 150 indoor and outdoor objects, and it is likely that some preprocessing steps were involved in preparing this dataset. But the specific preprocessing steps are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I do not know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model in this context.
