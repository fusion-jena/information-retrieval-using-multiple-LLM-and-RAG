Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that the available data is frequently split into a training data set (used for training) and a test data set, in order to gauge the accuracy of predictions for new input data. 

It does not provide information on the criteria used for splitting the data, such as the proportion of data allocated to each set, or whether a validation set is used in addition to the training and test sets. Therefore, the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training cannot be determined from the provided context.
