Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the hyperparameter optimization process using the TPEBO algorithm for the LSTM neural network, and the structure of the ACE forecasting model. It does not provide information on the postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
