Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The context only mentions the training procedure, including the number of epochs, the use of positive and hard negative patches, and the process of fine-tuning the model. However, it does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
