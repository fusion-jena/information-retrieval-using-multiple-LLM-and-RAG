Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be discussing the detection of ungulate vocalizations using machine learning algorithms, but it does not provide information on the specific preprocessing steps used.

However, it does mention that the authors opted for a larger FFT window size to improve the resolution at lower frequencies, which suggests that some form of signal processing or feature extraction may have been performed on the audio data. Additionally, the context mentions that the authors fitted cow-specific parameters in the model, which could imply that some form of data normalization or scaling may have been performed. However, this is purely speculative, and without further information, it is impossible to determine the exact preprocessing steps involved.

Therefore, I must conclude that I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model, as this information is not provided in the context.
