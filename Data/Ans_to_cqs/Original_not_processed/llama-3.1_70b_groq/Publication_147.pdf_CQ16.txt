Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly state the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the CNN model. However, it does mention that the model was trained for 110 epochs, where each epoch was composed of 4800 training samples. Additionally, it mentions that a geometrically decaying learning rate was used during training.

There is no mention of validation loss plateau or any other specific criteria being used to determine when training is complete. It appears that the training was stopped after a fixed number of epochs, rather than being based on a specific stopping criterion such as validation loss plateau.
