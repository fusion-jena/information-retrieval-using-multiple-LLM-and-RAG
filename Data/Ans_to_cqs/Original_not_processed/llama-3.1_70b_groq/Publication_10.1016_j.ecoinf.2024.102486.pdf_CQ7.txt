Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split data for deep learning model training. The context appears to focus on the use of GPUs in various applications, including machine learning and ecology, and mentions various software tools and programming languages used for these purposes.

However, I can provide some general information on common practices for splitting data in deep learning model training. Typically, data is split into three sets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to evaluate the model's performance during training and tune hyperparameters, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final model's performance.

The criteria for splitting data can vary depending on the specific problem and dataset, but common practices include:

* Random splitting: dividing the data into random subsets for training, validation, and testing
* Stratified splitting: dividing the data into subsets based on class labels or other relevant factors to ensure that each subset has a similar distribution of labels
* K-fold cross-validation: dividing the data into k subsets and using each subset as a validation set once, while the remaining subsets are used for training

It's worth noting that the specific criteria used for splitting data can have a significant impact on the performance and generalizability of the model, and should be carefully considered based on the characteristics of the dataset and the goals of the project.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split data for deep learning model training, common practices include random splitting, stratified splitting, and k-fold cross-validation.
