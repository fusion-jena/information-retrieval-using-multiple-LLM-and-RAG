Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context appears to focus on the performance of different embedding models, active learning strategies, and the results of experiments on various datasets. It does not provide information on the specific hyperparameters used in the model. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
