Answer: The provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention data redundancy management and handling, which could be related to preprocessing techniques.

Based on general knowledge of data preprocessing techniques, some common methods used to address data bias include:

* Stratified splitting: This involves splitting the data into subsets based on the class labels, ensuring that each subset has a similar proportion of each class as the original dataset.
* Oversampling: This involves creating additional copies of the minority class to balance the dataset.
* Undersampling: This involves reducing the number of samples in the majority class to balance the dataset.
* Diverse data collection: This involves collecting data from a variety of sources to ensure that the dataset is representative of the population.

However, without more specific information from the provided context, it is difficult to provide a more detailed answer.
