Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided pieces of context do not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, we can infer some information from the context.

In the context, it is mentioned that the images were taken using a conventional stereoscope NIKON SMZ1270i equipped with a NIKON DS-Fi3 Microscope Camera. The images were then used to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. However, the context does not provide information on how the images were preprocessed before training the model.

In the context of deep learning, common preprocessing steps include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. However, without explicit information, we cannot confirm if these steps were involved in the specific study.

One relevant piece of information is that the study used a domain adaptation algorithm, specifically domain adversarial training of neural networks (DANN), to improve the prediction performance of models trained on non-standardized, low-quality images. This suggests that the images may have undergone some form of preprocessing to adapt to the domain, but the specific steps are not mentioned.

In summary, while we can infer that some form of preprocessing may have been involved, the specific steps are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
