Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be related to the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for acoustic detection, particularly in the context of bird species detection. However, it does not provide information on data splitting criteria.

Typically, data splitting criteria for deep learning model training involve dividing the available data into training, validation, and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to evaluate the model's performance during training and adjust hyperparameters, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final model's performance. Common practices for data splitting include random splitting, stratified splitting, and k-fold cross-validation. However, without more specific information, it is unclear what criteria were used in this particular context.

If you're looking for information on data splitting criteria, I recommend consulting a general resource on deep learning or machine learning, as this information is not provided in the given context.
