Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context only discusses the model architecture, training process, and loss function used for bird sound denoising. It does not provide information on what happens after the model is trained.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
