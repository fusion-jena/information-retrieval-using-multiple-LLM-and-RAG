Answer: The pipeline uses a combination of different deep learning models, including:

1. ResNet-50, which is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture.
2. Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST), which is a Transformer-based model.
3. HuBERT, which is also a Transformer-based model.

These models are used for feature extraction and classification tasks in the pipeline.
