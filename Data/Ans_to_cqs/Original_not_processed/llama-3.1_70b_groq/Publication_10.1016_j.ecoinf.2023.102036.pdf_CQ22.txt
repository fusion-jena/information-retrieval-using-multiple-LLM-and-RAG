Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The text mentions that TensorBoard, a set of visualization tools, was used to study the performance of the runs, but it does not specify which metrics were used. Additionally, the text describes the model's training process and the optimization of parameters, but it does not provide information on the evaluation metrics. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
