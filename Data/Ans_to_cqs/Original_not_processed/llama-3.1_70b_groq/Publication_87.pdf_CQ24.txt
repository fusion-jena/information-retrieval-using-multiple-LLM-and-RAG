Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided pieces of context do not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning in ecology, particularly in image analysis and species identification, and provides a case study using R. It also mentions the use of PyTorch, a deep learning library, but does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this query.
