Answer: 
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the primary data format used is images, as the text mentions "images", "camera trap", "trail camera", and "object detection models that localize target objects (animals) within an image". There is no mention of audio or video data formats. Additionally, CSV is mentioned as a possible format for data labeling, but it is not clear if it is used as an input format for the deep learning pipeline.
