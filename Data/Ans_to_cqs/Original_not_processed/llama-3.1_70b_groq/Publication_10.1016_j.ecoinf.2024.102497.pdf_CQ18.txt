Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on the implementation of the Random Forest Regression (RFR) model and the CART model for nearshore bathymetry studies, including the fine-tuning of model parameters and the selection of optimal parameters. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training.
