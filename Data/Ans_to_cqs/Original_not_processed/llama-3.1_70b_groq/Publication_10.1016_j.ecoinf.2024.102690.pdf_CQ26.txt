Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the use of Self-Organizing Feature Maps (SOFM) for dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis in the context of ecosystem services and biodiversity. It does not discuss deep learning pipelines or techniques for addressing data bias.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. If you have any further context or clarification, I would be happy to try and assist you further.
