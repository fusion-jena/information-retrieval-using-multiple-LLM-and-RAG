Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the dataset was created by selecting images of different individual insects from captured sequences of images in the period of observation. This suggests that the raw data was collected through some form of image capture, possibly using cameras or other imaging devices.

Additionally, the context mentions that the dataset was created by collecting images of moths over a period of time, specifically from 22:30 to 05:00, over three survey nights. This implies that the data collection process involved some form of observation or monitoring of the moths in their natural habitat.

It is also mentioned that fewer than 1% of the images from this period of survey were used to train the CNN model, which suggests that the dataset was relatively large and diverse. However, the exact methods used for collecting the raw data are not specified in the provided context.
