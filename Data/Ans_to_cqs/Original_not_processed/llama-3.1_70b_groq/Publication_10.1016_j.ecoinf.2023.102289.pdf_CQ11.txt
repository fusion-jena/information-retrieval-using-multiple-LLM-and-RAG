Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It mentions various references to research papers and datasets, such as the ADE20K dataset, but does not provide a direct link to a data repository. It also mentions a link to the GluonCV model zoo (https://cv.gluon.ai/api/model_zoo.html#), but this is not a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline itself.
