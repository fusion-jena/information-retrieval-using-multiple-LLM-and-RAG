Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be related to hyperparameter tuning for machine learning models, specifically for predicting chlorophyll-a, Secchi depth, and total suspended solids using Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat-8 OLI data.

However, it does mention the use of various hyperparameters, such as the number of decision trees, maximum depth of the decision tree, and learning rate, which are tuned to optimize the performance of the machine learning models. Additionally, the context mentions the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the models, including R2, MAE, and RMSE.

But, it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
