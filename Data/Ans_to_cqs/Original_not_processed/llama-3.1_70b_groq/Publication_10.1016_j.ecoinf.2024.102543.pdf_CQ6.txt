Answer:::
The preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, as mentioned in the context, include:

1. Auto-orientation: This step ensures that the images are consistently oriented.
2. Resizing: The images are resized to a uniform size of 640 Ã— 640 pixels.
3. Tiling: This step is mentioned, but the context does not provide further details on what tiling entails.
4. Filtering: This step is also mentioned, but the context does not provide further details on what filtering entails.
5. Augmentation: Random saturation adjustments are introduced to each training example to increase the number of outputs per example and diversify the dataset.

Additionally, the context mentions that the images are annotated, and a 90% annotation threshold is met. However, it does not provide further details on the annotation process.

It is worth noting that the context does not mention normalization or scaling, which are common preprocessing steps in deep learning. It also does not mention cleaning, which is often involved in preprocessing datasets.
