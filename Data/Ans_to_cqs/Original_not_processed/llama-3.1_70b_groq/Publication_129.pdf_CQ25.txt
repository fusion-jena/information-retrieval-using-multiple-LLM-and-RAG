Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the Faster R-CNN approach, is object detection. It is designed to detect and classify target objects in images, particularly in the context of agricultural pests recognition. The model uses a Region Proposal Network (RPN) to propose object locations, and then a regressor and classifier are trained to adjust these proposed locations and predict the corresponding bounding box area and object class. The model's output includes the probability of each region proposal containing an object and the bounding box coordinates for the detected objects.
