Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context appears to be a research paper on ecological informatics, specifically on training models to detect fish presence in underwater videos. It provides details on the dataset, training data, and model architecture, but does not discuss postprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
