Answer:::
I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific deep learning pipeline or its code repository link. The context appears to be a collection of research papers and data descriptions related to machine learning, ecology, and environmental science. There is no mention of a specific code repository or link to GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to the code repository of a deep learning pipeline.
