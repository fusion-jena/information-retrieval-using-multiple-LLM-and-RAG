Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be related to land use and land cover classification, and it discusses various topics such as nested classification, spectral classes, and information classes. However, it does not provide information on data splitting criteria for deep learning model training.

The only mention of deep learning is in the reference to the paper "Object retrieval with deep convolutional" by Mohedano et al. (2017), but this paper is not directly related to the query, and the context does not provide any further information on data splitting criteria.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query based on the provided context.
