Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context discusses the optimization of parameters, such as MS and RT, to improve the model's accuracy and kappa, as well as the use of feature importance measures like Gini impurity and gain in Random Forest and XGBoost, respectively. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance is monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
