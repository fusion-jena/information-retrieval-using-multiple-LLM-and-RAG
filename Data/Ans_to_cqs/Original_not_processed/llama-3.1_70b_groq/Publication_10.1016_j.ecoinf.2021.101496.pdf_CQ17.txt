Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The text only mentions that the addition of any hidden layers in the artificial neural network (ANN) resulted in less accuracy of the prediction on the test data due to overfitting, but it does not provide information on how overfitting was addressed or prevented.
