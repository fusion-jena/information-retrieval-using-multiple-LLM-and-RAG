Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. However, it does mention that the authors used a "Hyperparameter-tuned batch-updated stochastic gradient descent" in one of the references (Barhate et al., 2023). This suggests that the authors may have performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize the performance of their model, but the specific hyperparameters used are not provided in the given context.
