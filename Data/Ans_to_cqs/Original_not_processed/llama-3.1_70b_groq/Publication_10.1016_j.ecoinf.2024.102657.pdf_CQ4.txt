Answer: None of the provided context mentions specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling being applied in the deep learning pipeline. In fact, the text states that "No additional preprocessing was applied to the spectrograms as the goal was to do the least amount of preprocessing possible in order to demonstrate the power of human-machine teaming." This suggests that minimal to no data augmentation techniques were applied in this specific pipeline.
