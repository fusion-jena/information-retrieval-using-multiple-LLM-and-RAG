Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific frameworks used to build deep learning models such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context appears to be focused on the application of machine learning and deep learning approaches in predicting infectious disease and disease vector abundance, rather than the specific frameworks used to build these models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
