Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context appears to be focused on the mathematical theory of epidemics, Lotka-Volterra population models, and the use of the Gumbel-Softmax function in deep neural networks. It also discusses the introduction to mathematical oncology and the use of cellular automata for forest fire detection.

However, one of the papers mentioned in the context, "A surrogate loss function for optimization of FÎ² score in binary classification with imbalanced data" by Lee et al. (2021), suggests that the authors are working on optimizing the model's performance using a surrogate loss function. But it does not provide information on how the hyperparameters are optimized.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
