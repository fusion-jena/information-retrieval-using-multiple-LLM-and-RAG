Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that a publicly available dataset of environmental microorganisms called EMDS-6 is used to assess the effectiveness of the proposed architecture. This suggests that the dataset is obtained from a public source, but the context does not provide information on how the data was originally collected. Therefore, I do not know the specific methods used for collecting raw data in this case.
