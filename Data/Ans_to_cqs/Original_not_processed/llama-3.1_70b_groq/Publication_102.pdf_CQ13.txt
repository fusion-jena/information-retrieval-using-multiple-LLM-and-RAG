Answer:::
The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows:

- Learning rate: 0.001
- Optimizer: Adam optimizer for Model-2, and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer for Model-K.

Additionally, the batch size used for training was 8. The model was trained on an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 GPU. The early stopping technique was applied to avoid over-fitting, based on the model's performance on the validation set.
