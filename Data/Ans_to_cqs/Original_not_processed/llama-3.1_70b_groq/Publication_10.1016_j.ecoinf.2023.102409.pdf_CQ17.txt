Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the Deeplabv3+ model, the use of Mobilenetv2 as the backbone network, and the incorporation of the ASPP module. It also mentions the use of the SGD optimizer, ReLu activation function, and Dice loss function, but does not provide information on regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization.

Therefore, I do not know the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
