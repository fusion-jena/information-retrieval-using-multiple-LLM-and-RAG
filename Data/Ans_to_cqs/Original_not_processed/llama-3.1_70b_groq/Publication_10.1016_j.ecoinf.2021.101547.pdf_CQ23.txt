Answer:::

To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, a large and diverse dataset was used for training. Specifically, 6092 photos (~10% of the full set) were randomly selected from the aerial survey imagery to train the CNN on the diversity of background features. This was done to minimize misclassification of background features as polar bears.

Additionally, the training images were cropped to 224 Ã— 224 pixels at a random location in the photo to match the CNN's input size. This random cropping can be seen as a form of data augmentation, which helps to increase the diversity of the training data and reduce overfitting.

Furthermore, another 1000 photos were randomly selected and cropped from the full set to serve as background validation images. These validation images were used to assess the network's classification accuracy throughout training, which helps to ensure that the model is generalizing well to unseen data.

However, it is not mentioned in the provided context whether cross-validation or stratified splitting were used to further ensure the generalizability of the model. Therefore, I do not know if these specific measures were taken.
