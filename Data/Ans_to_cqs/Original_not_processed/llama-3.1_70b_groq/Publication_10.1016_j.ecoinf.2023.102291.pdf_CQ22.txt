Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are accuracy, precision, sensitivity (or recall), specificity, and F1 score. 

According to the text, the ResNet152V2 model achieved 83.9% accuracy, with precision of 56.1%, sensitivity of 37.2%, and specificity of 93.8%. The best CNN1 model showed a higher F1 score than the one built using 90 dpi, indicating a better balance between precision and recall. 

Additionally, the text mentions that the model's performance was evaluated based on the proportion of all correct predictions (validation accuracy) and the number of true positives divided by true positives and false positives (precision) during training.
