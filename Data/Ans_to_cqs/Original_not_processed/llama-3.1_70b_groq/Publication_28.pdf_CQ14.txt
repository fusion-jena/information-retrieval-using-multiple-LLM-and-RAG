Answer:::
The hyperparameters of the EfficientNet model are optimized using the IKHO algorithm, which is a combination of the Krill Herd (KH) algorithm and a free search (FS) operator. The KH algorithm is a swarm intelligence-based approach that mimics the swarming behavior of krills in a particular environmental and biological process. The IKHO algorithm is designed to avoid the local optimal problem of the KH algorithm. The KH algorithm modifies the Lagrangian approach in a d-dimensional decision space using a specific equation, and the movement of krills is influenced by other krills, foraging action, and arbitrary diffusion. The use of the IKHO algorithm helps to enhance the prediction outcome of the PTDLEN-VAE model for unseen data.
