Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text only mentions that an ensemble modeling approach is employed using the BIOMOD2 package in R, and that four different models (including regression-based, MaxEnt, RF, and SVM) are weighted averaged to generate a final ensembled model. However, it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
