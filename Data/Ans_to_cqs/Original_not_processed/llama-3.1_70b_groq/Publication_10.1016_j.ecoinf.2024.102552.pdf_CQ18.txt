Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about monitoring model performance during training. It appears to be a discussion about historical ecology, remote sensing, and land use patterns, with no mention of machine learning model training or performance monitoring. The text does mention the potential use of machine learning tools for classification, but it does not provide any information about the specific strategies used to monitor model performance during training.
