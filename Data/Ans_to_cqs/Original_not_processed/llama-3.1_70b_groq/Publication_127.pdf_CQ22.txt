Answer: 
The provided context only mentions one metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models, which is the "Top-1 accuracy" percentage. This metric is used to compare the performance of different architectures, such as AlexNet, NiN, VGG, GoogLeNet, and ResNet, on the task of detecting images that contain animals. The Top-1 accuracy percentage represents the proportion of correctly classified images out of the total number of images tested. No other metrics, such as precision or recall, are mentioned in the provided context.
