Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model (CNN). However, it does mention that the study used two independent validation data sets (ABMI plots and CCMEO) to evaluate the performance of the CNN and XGB models. This suggests that some form of validation was used to assess the model's performance on unseen data.

Additionally, the study mentions that the models were trained on a large-scale dataset, which may have helped to improve the model's generalizability. However, the context does not provide information on whether techniques such as cross-validation, stratified splitting, or data augmentation were used to further ensure the model's generalizability.

It is also worth noting that the study mentions that the models were compared to photo-interpreted validation data sets, which may have helped to evaluate the model's performance on a diverse range of data. However, without more information, it is difficult to say for certain what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
