Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The text only mentions that the U-Net model, a type of convolutional neural network (CNN), was used for classification, but it does not provide details on the hyperparameters used for training the model. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
