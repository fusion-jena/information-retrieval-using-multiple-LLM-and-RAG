Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention a few techniques that can help mitigate the effects of randomness:

1. Oversampling: In the case of the zebra finch with only 1,197 images, oversampling was used by creating duplicates of 403 randomly sampled images. This can help increase the size of the dataset and reduce the impact of randomness.
2. Random sampling: The context mentions that 403 images were randomly sampled from the zebra finch dataset, and 250 random images were selected from the pool of birds that were included in the training data for the great tits. This random sampling can help reduce the impact of randomness in the dataset.
3. Using a large number of images: The context mentions that all birds had at least 1,600 images, except for one that had 1,197. Using a large number of images can help reduce the impact of randomness in the dataset.
4. Using a small batch size: The context mentions that small batch sizes improve models' generalization capability. Using a small batch size can help reduce the impact of randomness in the training process.

However, the context does not mention the use of a random seed value or other strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a more detailed answer to this question based on the provided context.
