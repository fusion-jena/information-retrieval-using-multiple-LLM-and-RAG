Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on the DeepLabV3+ model, its architecture, and the training process, including data augmentation techniques and the use of ReduceLROnPlateau for learning rate scheduling. However, it does not provide information on regularization methods used to prevent overfitting.

Therefore, I do not know the specific regularization methods used in this deep learning pipeline.
