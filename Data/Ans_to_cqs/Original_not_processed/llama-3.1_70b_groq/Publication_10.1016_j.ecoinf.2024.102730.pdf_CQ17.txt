Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of dropout as a regularization method. However, it does mention the use of L2 regularization. According to Table 2, the strength of the L2 regularization term is one of the hyperparameters that was tuned during the Optuna grid search, with a range of 1e-4 to 1e-1 on a log scale. The optimal values for the L2 regularization term are listed as 0.0290, 0.0010, and 0.0606 for the three different regression tasks (SOS, POS, and PEAK, respectively). This suggests that L2 regularization was used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
