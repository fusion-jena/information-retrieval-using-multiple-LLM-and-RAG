Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the comparison of different machine learning models, including CNN, CNN with autoencoder, ANN, SVM, and RF, for estimating aquatic ecosystem health indices. It discusses the performance of these models, their architectures, and the results of the experiments. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
