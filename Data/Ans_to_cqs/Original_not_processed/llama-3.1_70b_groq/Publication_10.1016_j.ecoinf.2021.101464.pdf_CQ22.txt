Answer: The provided context does not mention a deep learning model, but rather a random forest (RF) model. However, I can provide information on the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the RF model.

According to the context, the performance of the RF model is evaluated using the following metrics:

1. Explained variance: The proportion of explained variance is between 91% and 92% (Table 4).
2. Correlation coefficient: The correlation coefficients between the measured and predicted values of all samples are above 0.95 (Table 4).
3. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): The average RMSE is 141.124 ion/cm3 (Table 5).
4. Coefficient of determination (R2): The average R2 is 0.931 (Table 5).

These metrics suggest that the RF model has high prediction accuracy and good stability. However, I do not have information on the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model, as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
