Answer:

The provided context does not mention the use of deep learning models such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer in the pipeline. Instead, it mentions the use of XGBoost and LightGBM, which are both types of gradient boosting frameworks, specifically designed for handling tabular data. They are not considered deep learning models in the classical sense, but rather ensemble learning methods that combine multiple weak models to create a strong predictive model. Therefore, the answer to the query is that no deep learning model is mentioned in the provided context.
