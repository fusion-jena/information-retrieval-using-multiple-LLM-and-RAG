Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning and machine learning techniques for detecting artisanal small-scale mining, Amazonian rainforest phenology, and large-scale degradation of Amazonian freshwater ecosystems. It also discusses the use of Google Earth Engine for planetary-scale geospatial analysis and the development of a multispectral convolutional neural network for detecting artisanal small-scale mining. However, it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
