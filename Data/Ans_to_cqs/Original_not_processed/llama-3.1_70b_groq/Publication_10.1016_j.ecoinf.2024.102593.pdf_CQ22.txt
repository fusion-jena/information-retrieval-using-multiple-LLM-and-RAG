Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. However, it does mention the use of certain metrics for evaluating the dimensionality reduction and clustering of embeddings.

According to Table 2, the metrics used for evaluating the dimensionality reduction and clustering of embeddings are:

* Trustworthiness
* Silhouette coefficient
* Hopkins statistic

Additionally, the context mentions the use of the silhouette coefficient to evaluate the performance of different models (VGGish, BirdNET, and a ResNet152-architecture model) on the Brazil extract of the BirdCLEF 2020 dataset.

It is worth noting that the context does not provide information on the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
