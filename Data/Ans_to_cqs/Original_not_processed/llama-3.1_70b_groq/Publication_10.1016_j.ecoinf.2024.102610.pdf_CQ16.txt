Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily discusses the importance of spatial cross-validation techniques to bolster model robustness, the separation of training and test data, and the potential introduction of bias when dealing with data containing many zero values.

However, it does mention that spatial cross-validation operates by randomly selecting blocks of data for training while reserving others for testing, and this process is repeated multiple times based on the number of specified folds. This iterative approach refines the model's estimation of prediction errors, consequently enhancing overall model performance.

While this information provides insight into the training process, it does not specifically address the criteria used to determine when training is complete. Therefore, I do not know the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau, based on the provided context.
