Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as Flipping, Rotating, or Scaling. The context appears to focus on methods for reconstructing and improving the accuracy of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) time-series data, particularly in the presence of missing or weather-related occlusions.

The mentioned techniques include the use of the Savitzky-Golay filter, Harmonic ANalysis of Time Series (HANTS), and adaptive spatial-temporal tensor completion methods (ST Sensor). However, these techniques are not related to data augmentation in a deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query regarding specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline.
