Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be related to a research article or study that uses machine learning ensemble predictions to model the ecological niche of Short-billed Gulls. It mentions various data sources, including US Census 2000 data, GIS data, and field work data, but does not provide information on how the data was split for model training.

The context does mention "machine learning ensemble predictions" and "model diagnostics," which suggests that the study used some form of data splitting to train and evaluate the models. However, the specific criteria used to split the data (e.g., train, test, validation) are not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
