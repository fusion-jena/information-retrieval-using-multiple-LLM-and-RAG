Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be focused on node-based programming, digital soil mapping, and various research papers related to environmental modeling and soil science. It does not provide information on deep learning pipelines or optimization techniques used in machine learning. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
