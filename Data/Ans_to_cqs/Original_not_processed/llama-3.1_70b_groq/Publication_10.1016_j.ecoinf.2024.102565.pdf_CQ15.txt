Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the structure and functionality of Neural Networks (NN) and Regression Trees (RT), as well as the application of these models in predicting Total Suspended Matter (TSM) concentration based on wind speed data. It does not delve into the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
