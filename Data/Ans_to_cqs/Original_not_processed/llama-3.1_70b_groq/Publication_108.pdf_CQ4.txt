Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided text does not explicitly mention the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that an in-depth investigation of the performance of the proposed architecture on further datasets would be an interesting future project, especially with respect to the power of generalization, which can be increased by different data augmentation techniques. This suggests that data augmentation techniques are considered important for improving the model's performance, but the specific techniques used are not specified in the provided text.
