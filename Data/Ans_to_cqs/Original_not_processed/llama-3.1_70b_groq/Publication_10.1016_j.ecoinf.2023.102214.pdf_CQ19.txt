Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. It mentions that the model was trained and tested by tuning the number of required epochs and inspecting the model outputs and error outcomes for signs of overfitting, but it does not specify the framework used. However, it does mention that Azure-based development and model deployment in Whiskerbook.org were supported by a Microsoft Sponsorship, which might suggest that the model could be built using Microsoft's Azure Machine Learning or other related frameworks, but this is not explicitly stated.
