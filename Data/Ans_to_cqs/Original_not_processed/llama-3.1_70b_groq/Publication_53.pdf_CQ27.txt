Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly describe the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It mentions the development of the model using Python and fastai, and the use of R for statistical analyses and designing a website (AusDams.org) using Shiny, Leaﬂet, Plotly, and other packages. However, it does not provide information on model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related steps.

The context only mentions the training process, where a random subsample of 400 images was used to train a classification model, and the model was trained with a learning rate of 10−3 for ten epochs. It also mentions the use of data augmentation and the achievement of an error rate of 0.1538 (15.38%) at epoch 5. However, the deployment process is not described.

Therefore, I do not know the exact process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
