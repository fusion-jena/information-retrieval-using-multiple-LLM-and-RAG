Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model was trained on a dataset of labelled images and later used for prediction on a new dataset of unlabelled images. This suggests that the model was evaluated on unseen data, which is a common approach to assess the generalizability of a model.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model was trained on a reduced dataset for the sake of illustration, but the full results were obtained using a larger dataset with all pictures and a more complex model (resnet50). This implies that the model was trained on a larger and possibly more diverse dataset, which can help improve its generalizability.

However, there is no mention of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or other techniques that are commonly used to ensure the generalizability of deep learning models. Therefore, it is unclear whether these measures were taken, and the answer to this question is incomplete based on the provided context.
