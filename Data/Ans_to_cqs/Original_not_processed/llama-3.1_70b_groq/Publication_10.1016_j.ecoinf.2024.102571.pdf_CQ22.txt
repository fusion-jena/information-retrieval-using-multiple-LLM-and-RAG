Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the model's performance is evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R2) value, which is a measure of the model's goodness of fit. Specifically, it is mentioned that the GHGdwts predictions showed the ANN model was accurate with R2 = 0.94. Additionally, the context provides a table with r2 values ranging from 0.07 to 0.94, which suggests that R2 is used as a performance metric. However, other common metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall are not mentioned.
