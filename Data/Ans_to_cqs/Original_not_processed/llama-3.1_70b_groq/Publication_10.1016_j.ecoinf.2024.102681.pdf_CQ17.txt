Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the hybrid CNN-LSTM model, its performance, and the dataset used for drought propagation time series analysis. It does not provide information on the specific regularization techniques employed, such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
