Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it does mention the use of the Akaike minimum information criterion (AICc) to determine the best tuning parameters for the MaxEnt model. Specifically, it states that the optimal model is the one with the minimum delta.AICc value (delta.AICc = 0), and a model with delta.AICc < 2 is considered credible. This suggests that the training process may be considered complete when the delta.AICc value reaches a certain threshold or plateau, but this is not explicitly stated.
