Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily discusses the comparison between shallow learning methods (XGBoost) and deep learning techniques (convolutional neural networks) for wetland mapping, but it does not delve into the details of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
