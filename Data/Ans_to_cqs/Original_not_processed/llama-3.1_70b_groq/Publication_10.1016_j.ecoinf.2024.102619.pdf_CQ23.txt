Answer:::

To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. 

Firstly, the dataset was split into training and testing sets, and a k-fold cross-validation approach was used to evaluate the model's performance. Specifically, a 5-fold cross-validated fine grid-search was performed on the training data to optimize the hyperparameters of the Support Vector Machines (SVMs). This approach helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the model is not biased towards a particular subset of the data.

Secondly, the use of a diverse dataset is implied, although not explicitly stated. The dataset consists of 6682 images, which suggests a relatively large and diverse dataset. However, the exact diversity of the dataset is not specified.

Lastly, the use of stratified splitting is not explicitly mentioned. However, the fact that the dataset was split into training and testing sets suggests that some form of splitting was performed. It is unclear whether the splitting was stratified or not.

Overall, the use of cross-validation and a relatively large dataset suggests that measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, more information would be needed to confirm the exact measures taken.
