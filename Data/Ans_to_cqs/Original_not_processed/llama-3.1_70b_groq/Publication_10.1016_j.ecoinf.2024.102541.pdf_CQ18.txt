Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on the model architecture, loss functions, and performance evaluation metrics such as mAP, GFLOPs, and FPS. It also discusses various optimization techniques and modifications made to the YOLOv5 model, but it does not provide information on how the model performance is monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
