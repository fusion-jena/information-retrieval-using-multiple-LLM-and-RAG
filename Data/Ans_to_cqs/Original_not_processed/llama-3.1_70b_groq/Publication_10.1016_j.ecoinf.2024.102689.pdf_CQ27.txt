Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the development and optimization of the model, including the use of PyTorch, CUDA, and the Adam optimizer. It also discusses the dataset, object detection, and segmentation, as well as the potential for model compression and knowledge distillation.

However, it does mention the use of PyTorch version 1.8.0 and Anaconda3, which suggests that the model was developed and trained in a Python environment. Additionally, the context mentions the use of CUDA version 11.4, which implies that the model was trained on a GPU.

While this information provides some insight into the development and training of the model, it does not provide explicit details on the deployment process. Therefore, I do not know the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
