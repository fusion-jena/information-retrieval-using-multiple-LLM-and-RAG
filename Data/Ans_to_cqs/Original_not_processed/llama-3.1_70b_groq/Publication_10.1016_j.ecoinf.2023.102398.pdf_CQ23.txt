Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the size of the dataset used for custom training is sufficiently large, which could be an indication that the dataset is diverse and representative of the problem being tackled. Additionally, the model is trained with different epoch values (100, 150, 200, and 250) and the results are compared, which could be seen as a form of cross-validation. However, this is not explicitly stated as a measure to ensure generalizability. Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to this question.
