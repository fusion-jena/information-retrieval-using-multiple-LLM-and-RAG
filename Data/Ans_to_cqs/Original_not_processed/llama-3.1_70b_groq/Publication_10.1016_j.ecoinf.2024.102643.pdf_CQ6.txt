Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to environmental modeling and species distribution, and it discusses various machine learning models and their performance evaluation metrics. However, it does not provide information on the preprocessing steps for training a deep learning model.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model based on the provided context.
