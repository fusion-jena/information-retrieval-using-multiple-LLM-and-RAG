Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the model architecture, dataset, and training procedure, but it does not provide information on data preprocessing.

However, it does mention that the predictive features include various environmental context data, such as WorldClim2 bioclimatic variables, Soilgrids pedological variables, human footprint rasters, terrestrial ecoregions of the world, and observation location (longitude and latitude). It also mentions that the input data is in the form of 64 Ã— 64 2D tensors sampled at the kilometre-scale resolution.

Additionally, the context mentions that the species assemblage predictions are post-processed, which includes removing predictions outside the continents where species are known to occur and normalizing conditional probabilities associated with orchids. However, this is not related to preprocessing steps before training the model.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
