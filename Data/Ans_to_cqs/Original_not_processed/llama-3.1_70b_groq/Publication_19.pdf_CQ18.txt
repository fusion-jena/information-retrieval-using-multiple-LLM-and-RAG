The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is based on the concept of early stopping. Early stopping is a technique used to prevent overfitting by stopping the training process when the model's performance on the validation set is good enough. This is done by monitoring the model's performance on the validation set and stopping the training process when the model's performance reaches't reached a certain threshold.
