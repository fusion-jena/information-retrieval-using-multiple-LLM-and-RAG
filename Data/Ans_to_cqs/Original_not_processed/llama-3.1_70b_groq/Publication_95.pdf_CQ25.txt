Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. The text mentions that the final classification layer was adapted to match the seven classes (six IAPS and "no species"), indicating that the model is designed to classify images into one of these categories. Additionally, the text mentions that the model is trained on images and evaluated on a validation set, which is consistent with a classification task. The text also mentions that the model is trained using cross-entropy loss, which is a common loss function used in classification problems.
