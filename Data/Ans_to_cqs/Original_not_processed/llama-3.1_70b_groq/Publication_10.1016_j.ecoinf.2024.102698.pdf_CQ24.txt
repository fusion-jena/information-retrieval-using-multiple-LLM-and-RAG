Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the use of synthetic data, coral reef modeling, and the application of deep learning methods, including convolutional neural networks, autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks. It also discusses the use of a Variational Autoencoder (TVAE) model for generating synthetic data. However, it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
