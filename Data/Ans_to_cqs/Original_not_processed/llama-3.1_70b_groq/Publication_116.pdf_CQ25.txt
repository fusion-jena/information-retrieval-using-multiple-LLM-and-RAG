Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. This is evident from the context, which mentions "classification challenges such as ImageNet" and "plant classification using probabilistic neural network." Additionally, the text discusses the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for classification tasks, highlighting their ability to learn discriminant visual features directly from raw pixels. The model's architecture, which includes multiple convolutional layers, max pooling, and batch normalization, is also consistent with a classification model. Furthermore, the text mentions the use of a softmax output layer, which is typically used for multi-class classification problems.
