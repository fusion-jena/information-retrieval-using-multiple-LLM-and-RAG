Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention that the dataset was automatically generated by an annotator and that each segment was manually reviewed by a human. Additionally, it mentions that the dataset was split into training and validation sets (80/20%) and that the distribution of target features to non-target features is representative of the true distribution post-segmentation.

It also mentions that the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) model was fine-tuned on a subset of 500 training samples, but it does not provide information on the preprocessing steps involved. 

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
