Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. The text appears to be discussing Ecological Niche Models (ENMs) and the use of statistical analysis, machine learning, or expert-defined rules to estimate the species' ecological niche. It also mentions the use of MaxEnt, a specific type of ENM, but does not provide information on the hyperparameters used in the model.
