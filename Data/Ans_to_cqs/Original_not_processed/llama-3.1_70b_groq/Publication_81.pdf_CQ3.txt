Answer:::

The provided context does not specifically mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does mention that the DNA barcode sequences are converted into numerical data using one-hot encoding. This is a data preprocessing technique used to transform categorical data into numerical data that can be processed by the deep learning model.

One-hot encoding is a common technique used in deep learning to represent categorical data, such as DNA sequences, as numerical vectors. This allows the model to learn patterns and relationships in the data. However, it does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used in the pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the only data annotation technique mentioned is one-hot encoding, which is used to convert DNA barcode sequences into numerical data.
