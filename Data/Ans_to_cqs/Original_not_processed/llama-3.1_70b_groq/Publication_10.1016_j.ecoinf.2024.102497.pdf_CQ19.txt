Answer:::
The provided context does not mention the use of deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. However, it does mention the use of the Python programming language and the 'sklearn' library to build a CART model. This suggests that the implementation is based on scikit-learn, a machine learning library for Python, rather than a deep learning framework.
