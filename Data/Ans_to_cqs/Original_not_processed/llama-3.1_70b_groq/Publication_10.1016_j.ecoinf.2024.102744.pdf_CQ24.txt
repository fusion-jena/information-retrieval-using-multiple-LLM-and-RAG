Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of a Dropout layer with a probability of 0.5, which is a technique used to mitigate overfitting by randomly dropping out neurons during training. This can help reduce the impact of randomness in the model. Additionally, the context mentions the use of a fixed input size and output size, which may help reduce the impact of randomness in the data. However, it does not provide information on whether a random seed value is set to ensure reproducibility of the results.
