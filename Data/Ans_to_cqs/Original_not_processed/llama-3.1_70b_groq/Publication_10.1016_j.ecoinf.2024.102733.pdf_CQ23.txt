Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. There is no mention of using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to evaluate the model's performance.

However, the context does mention that various parameter values and different regularization techniques were explored during the training of the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model. This suggests that some form of hyperparameter tuning was performed, which can help improve the model's generalizability.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of techniques such as Batch Normalization, dropout, and weight decay, which can help prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.

Overall, while the context does not provide explicit information on the measures taken to ensure generalizability, it suggests that some techniques were used to improve the model's robustness and ability to generalize. However, without more information, it is difficult to say for certain what measures were taken.
