Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models discussed in the text. The text mentions various models such as 3DCNN-LSTM, CRNN, Soundception, and PPNN, but it does not provide information on the frameworks used to implement these models. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
