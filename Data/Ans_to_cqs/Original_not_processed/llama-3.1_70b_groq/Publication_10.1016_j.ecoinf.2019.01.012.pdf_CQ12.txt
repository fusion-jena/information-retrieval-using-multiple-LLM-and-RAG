Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is explicitly stated in the text: "Among the deep learning architectures, convolutional neural networks (CNN) are particularly suitable for image analysis due to their ability to extract spatial features." Additionally, the text provides details about the CNN architecture and training process, such as the use of ReLU activation for convolutional layers and ELU activation for the fully connected layer, and the optimizer used (adaptive ADAM).
