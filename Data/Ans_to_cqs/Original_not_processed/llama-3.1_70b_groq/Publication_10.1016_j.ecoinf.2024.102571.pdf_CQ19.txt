Answer: None of the provided context mentions the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context only mentions the development of a three-layer feedforward back-propagation neural network with a 30â€“20-10 architecture, but it does not specify the framework used to implement this model.
