Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically address techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on data preprocessing features, data analytics types, and data processing in the context of agricultural systems and IoT devices.

However, I can provide some general information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. Common techniques include:

* Stratified splitting: dividing the data into subsets based on the target variable to ensure that each subset has a similar proportion of classes.
* Oversampling: creating additional instances of the minority class to balance the dataset.
* Undersampling: reducing the number of instances of the majority class to balance the dataset.
* Diverse data collection: collecting data from diverse sources to reduce bias.

These techniques are commonly used in machine learning and deep learning pipelines to address data bias and ensure that the model is trained on a representative dataset. However, the specific techniques used may vary depending on the problem and dataset.

It's worth noting that the provided context does mention data preprocessing features such as data cleansing, data transformation, and data compression, but it does not specifically address techniques used to address data bias.
