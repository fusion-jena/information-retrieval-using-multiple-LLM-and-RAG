Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to focus on a specific application of deep learning, namely, identifying medicinal plants from images, and discusses techniques such as data augmentation, attention mechanisms, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, it does not provide information about the datasets used in the pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
