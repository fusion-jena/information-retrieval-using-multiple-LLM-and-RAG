Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the optimization of machine learning models, specifically Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and LightGBM models, for tasks such as predicting flowering dates and maize yield. It discusses the hyperparameters and performance metrics of these models, but does not provide information on data collection methods. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
