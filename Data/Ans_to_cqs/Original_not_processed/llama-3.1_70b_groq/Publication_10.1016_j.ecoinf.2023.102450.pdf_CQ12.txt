Answer:::
The pipeline uses a deep residual neural network (ResNet-50) as its backbone, which is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Additionally, the Siamese relation network employs a cascade structure of a region-based convolutional neural network for classification. There is no mention of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers in the provided context.
