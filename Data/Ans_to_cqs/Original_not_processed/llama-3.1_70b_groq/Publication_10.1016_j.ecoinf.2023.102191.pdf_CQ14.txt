Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about hyperparameter optimization or model training. It appears to be a research article discussing the development and testing of a monitoring program for the dive community, specifically an app that collects data on marine taxa. The context mentions data collection, statistical analysis, and user feedback, but does not touch on machine learning or model optimization. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to the query.
