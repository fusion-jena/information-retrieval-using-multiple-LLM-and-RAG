Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only discusses the training and comparison of different ResNet models (ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and ResNet-101) for feature extraction, as well as the visualization of extracted features using a pre-trained ResNet-50 CNN model. It does not provide information on model deployment, model serialization, or platform selection. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
