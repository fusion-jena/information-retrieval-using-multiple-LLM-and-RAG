Answer: The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a grid search approach. This involves defining a range of potential values for each parameter based on prior knowledge and literature review, and then exhaustively testing all possible combinations of these values. The model's performance is evaluated using cross-validation techniques, and the combination of parameters that results in the lowest RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) is selected as the optimal set of hyperparameters. This approach allows for a systematic and thorough exploration of the hyperparameter space, and helps to ensure that the model is optimized for accurate predictions.
