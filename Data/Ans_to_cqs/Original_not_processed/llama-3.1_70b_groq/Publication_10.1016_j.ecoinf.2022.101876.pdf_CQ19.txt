Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. It mentions the use of machine learning models and artificial intelligence (AI) to automate tasks such as detecting and classifying wildlife in images, but it does not provide information on the frameworks used to build these models. The context does mention the use of a state-of-the-art computer vision model called Faster R-CNN, but it does not specify the framework used to implement this model.
