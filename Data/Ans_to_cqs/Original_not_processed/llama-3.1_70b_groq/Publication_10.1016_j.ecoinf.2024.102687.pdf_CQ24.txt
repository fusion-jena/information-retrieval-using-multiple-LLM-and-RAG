Answer::: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The text appears to focus on the performance of different algorithms (DenseNet, Matching Networks, Prototypical Networks, and Relation Networks) on a specific task (clustering of unknown or rare bird sounds) and the importance of fine-tuning a pre-trained model for improving clustering quality. It does not discuss the management of randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
