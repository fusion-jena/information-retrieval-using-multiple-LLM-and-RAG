Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the information given, it appears that the model is used for regression tasks, specifically for predicting species richness. The text mentions that the model is compared to a Random Forest regression model and that it is able to learn complex mappings from inputs to outputs, which is consistent with a regression task. Additionally, the text mentions that the model is used to predict vascular plant species richness using LiDAR data, which further supports the idea that the model is used for regression.
