Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily discusses the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision models, specifically the MegaDetector model, for automating data processing tasks in wildlife camera trap studies. It mentions the model's architecture, performance, and limitations, but does not delve into the details of regularization methods used to prevent overfitting. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the provided context.
