Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the title of the first reference "Verification of novel integrations of swarm intelligence algorithms into deep learning neural network for flood susceptibility mapping", it can be inferred that the deep learning model is used for flood susceptibility mapping, which is a type of classification problem. The model is likely used to classify areas as susceptible or not susceptible to flooding.
