Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is classification, specifically birdsong classification. The model is designed to classify 397 different bird species from audio recordings. The model architectures used, including DenseNet-161, ResNet-50, and vision transformers (ViT), are tailored for sound event detection and classification tasks. The goal is to accurately identify and classify birdsong in various environmental contexts, which can be useful for monitoring avian biodiversity.
