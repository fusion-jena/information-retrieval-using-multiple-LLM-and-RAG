Answer::: 

I don't know. The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. The context appears to be focused on introducing the concept of weakly supervised learning, specifically in the context of regression tasks with structurally incomplete target labels, and discussing a case study on predictive modeling of global vegetation cover. It does not provide information on the specific implementation details of a deep learning model.
