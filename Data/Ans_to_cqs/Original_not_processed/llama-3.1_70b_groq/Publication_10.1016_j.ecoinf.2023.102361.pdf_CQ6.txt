Answer: According to the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include resizing the patches of images to a uniform size of 256 × 256 pixels. This is mentioned in Section 2.6.4, "Model training with selected patches", where it is stated that "For training, we resized all the patches of images to a resolution of 256 × 256 pixels." Although some images had lower resolutions, such as 64 × 64 and 128 × 128 pixels, they were converted to the uniform size.

There is no mention of other preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. It is possible that these steps were performed, but they are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
