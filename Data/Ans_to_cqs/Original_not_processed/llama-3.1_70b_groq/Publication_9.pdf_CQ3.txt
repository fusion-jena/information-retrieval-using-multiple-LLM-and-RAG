Answer:::
The data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline is instance segmentation. According to the provided context, the authors used the VGG Image Annotator Version 1.0.6 to manually annotate pixel coordinates and create precise polygonal mask contours directly around the fish body boundary. This is an example of instance segmentation, where the goal is to assign a class label to each pixel in an image and identify the specific instance of an object (in this case, a fish). The authors intentionally assigned all segmentation masks to isolate the foreground pixels of the target fish body from the background pixels.
