Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the model training parameters, architecture, and computational resources used. It does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this query.
