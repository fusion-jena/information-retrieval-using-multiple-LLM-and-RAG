Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be related to ecological and environmental modeling, species distribution, and climate change, with mentions of various statistical and machine learning techniques, including Maximum Entropy, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and Generalized Linear Models. However, it does not provide information on optimization techniques used in deep learning.
