Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific deep learning model used in a pipeline. The context appears to be a list of references and citations related to biodiversity, ecology, and conservation, with some mentions of data integration, spatial analysis, and R packages. However, there is no mention of a specific deep learning model or pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
