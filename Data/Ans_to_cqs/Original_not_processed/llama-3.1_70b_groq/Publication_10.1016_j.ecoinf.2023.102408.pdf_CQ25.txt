Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is nonlinear regression, specifically for modelling complex phenomena. The model is used to predict Above Ground Biomass (AGB) based on data from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2. The model is evaluated based on its accuracy, and the optimum combination of parameters is selected to achieve the best model fit. 

The specific deep learning models used in this study are Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The ANN is used to develop a nonlinear regression model, while the RF algorithm is used to handle extensive datasets and provide accurate information regarding critical factors. The SVM is also used for regression, but its specific purpose is not explicitly stated in the provided context. 

Overall, the purpose of the deep learning models in this study is to predict AGB values based on satellite data, and to evaluate the performance of different models in achieving this task.
