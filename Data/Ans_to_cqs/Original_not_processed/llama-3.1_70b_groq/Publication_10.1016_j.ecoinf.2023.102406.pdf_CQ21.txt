Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. However, it does mention some evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the model.

According to the context, accuracy metrics were calculated on separate testing data to determine how well the classifier assigned classes using predictor variables. Specifically, the true positive rate (sensitivity) and true negative rate (specificity) were measured. These metrics provide insight into the model's performance, but they do not encompass the full range of postprocessing steps mentioned in the query.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I can only confirm that accuracy metrics, including true positive rate and true negative rate, were calculated as part of the model evaluation process. I do not know if Saliency maps, Confusion matrix, or other postprocessing steps were involved.
