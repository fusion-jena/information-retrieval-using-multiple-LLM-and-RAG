Answer:::

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, specifically the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) algorithm, are listed in Table 7. The hyperparameters include:

* Input layer neurons: 8
* Hidden layer nodes: 10
* Output layer neurons: 8
* Requested samples per class: 1688
* Start learning rate: 0.0008
* End learning rate: 0.0001
* Momentum factor: 0.5
* Sigmoid constant: 1.0
* Iterations: 10,000
* Acceptable RMS: 0.01

The optimizer used is not explicitly mentioned, but the model uses backpropagation (BP) or the reverse method of automatic differentiation. The learning rate schedule is also not explicitly mentioned, but the start and end learning rates are provided.

Note that the MLPnn-MC model integrates the MLP algorithm with a Markov chain, but the hyperparameters listed above are specific to the MLP component of the model.
