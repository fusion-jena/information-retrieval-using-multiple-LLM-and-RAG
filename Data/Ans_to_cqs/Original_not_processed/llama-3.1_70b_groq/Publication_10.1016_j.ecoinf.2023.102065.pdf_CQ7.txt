Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that the recordings for each ROI (Region of Interest) were cut using start/stop times and sequentially appended to create a single merged .wav file for each species and set (i.e., train, validation) combination.

This suggests that the data was split into training and validation sets based on the species and possibly the recording sessions or locations. However, the exact criteria used to split the data, such as the proportion of data allocated to each set or the method used to randomize the split, are not specified in the provided context.

Therefore, I can only provide a partial answer, and the exact criteria used to split the data remain unclear.
