Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. However, it does mention the use of "data augmentation techniques, which reduced the issue of overfitting, and strengthened the algorithms capacity to match individuals based on pelt patterns rather than the background." This suggests that some form of regularization or optimization technique is being used, but the specific type is not specified.
