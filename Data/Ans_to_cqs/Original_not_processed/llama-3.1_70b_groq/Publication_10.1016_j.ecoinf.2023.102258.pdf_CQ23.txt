Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning models. However, it can be inferred that the challenge involved evaluating the models on multiple datasets, as mentioned in the sentence: "Our aim to generalise over a range of loosely-related datasets/tasks is of current interest in machine learning."

Additionally, the context mentions that the challenge involved evaluating the models on an evaluation set, which suggests that some form of splitting or validation was used. However, the specific details of the splitting or validation procedure are not provided.

The context also mentions that the challenge involved using a range of loosely-related datasets/tasks, which suggests that the models were evaluated on diverse data. However, it is not clear if the datasets were stratified or if cross-validation was used.

Overall, while the context suggests that some measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the models, the specific details are not provided.
