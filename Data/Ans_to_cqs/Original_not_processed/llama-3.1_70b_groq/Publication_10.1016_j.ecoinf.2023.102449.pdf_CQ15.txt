Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. It does mention the use of batch normalization, which can help with training stability and speed, but it does not provide information on the specific optimizer used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
