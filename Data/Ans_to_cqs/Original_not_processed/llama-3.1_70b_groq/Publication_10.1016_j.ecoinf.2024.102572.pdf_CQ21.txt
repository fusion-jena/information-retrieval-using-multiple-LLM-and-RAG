Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention anything about model training or postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context appears to be related to data acquisition and processing for a forest fire study, specifically using Google Earth Engine (GEE) to process data. It mentions filtering feature collections, extracting land cover types, calculating Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), and above-ground biomass data, but it does not discuss model training or postprocessing steps. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
