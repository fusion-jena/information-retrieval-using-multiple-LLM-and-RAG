Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily discusses the problem of unbalanced training data and the exploration of various sampling techniques to address it. It also presents the structure of the SSA-TPRF model and discusses the effect of tile size on accuracy.

However, it does mention the use of multiple probabilistic classification models and the SSA-TPRF model, which might be related to ensuring generalizability. Additionally, the context presents an experimental group design with varying tile sizes, which could be a form of cross-validation. Nevertheless, without more explicit information, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer.

Therefore, I can only speculate that the measures taken to ensure generalizability might include cross-validation through the experimental group design and the use of multiple probabilistic classification models. However, I do not have enough information to confirm this or provide more details.
