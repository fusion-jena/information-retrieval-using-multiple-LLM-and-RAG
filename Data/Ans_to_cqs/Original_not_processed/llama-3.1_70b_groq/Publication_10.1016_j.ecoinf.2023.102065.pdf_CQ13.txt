Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The text only mentions that "Tuning of the network hyperparameters and convolutional filters provides automated feature learning", but it does not provide further details on the hyperparameters used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
