Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It mentions the use of neural networks, convolutional networks, and learnable frontends such as LEAF-P and SincNet-P, but it does not specify whether the model is a CNN, RNN, Transformer, or another type of architecture.

However, it does mention the use of convolutional networks in some of the cited works, such as Xie et al. (2019) and Zhang et al. (2019), which suggests that CNNs may be used in some of the pipelines. Additionally, the context mentions the use of learnable frontends with 80 filters of length 512, which is consistent with some CNN architectures.

Overall, while the context provides some hints about the type of deep learning model used, it does not provide a clear answer to the question. Therefore, I must say that I don't know the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
