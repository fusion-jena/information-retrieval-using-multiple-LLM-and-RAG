Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. The text only mentions that the data conversion method used (disassembling multi-band images into single-band images) can "considerably reduce" the hardware resources and computing time required for deep learning, but it does not provide details on the actual hardware used.
