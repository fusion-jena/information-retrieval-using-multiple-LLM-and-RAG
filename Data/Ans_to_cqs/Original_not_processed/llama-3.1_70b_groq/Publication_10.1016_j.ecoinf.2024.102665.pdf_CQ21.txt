The provided context does not mention any postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context appears to be related to a research article about exploring coral reef communities in Puerto Rico using Bayesian networks, and it discusses the methodology and techniques used in the study, but it does not provide information on postprocessing steps.
