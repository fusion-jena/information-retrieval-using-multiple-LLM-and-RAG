Answer:::
The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, the authors have used several pre-trained CNN models such as AlexNet, ResNet-50, VGG-19, GoogleNet, and Inceptionv3. Additionally, they have also proposed a custom CNN model named CoralNet, which is designed for the extraction of spatial features from coral images. The CoralNet model consists of thirteen layers, including convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, dense layers, and activation layers.
