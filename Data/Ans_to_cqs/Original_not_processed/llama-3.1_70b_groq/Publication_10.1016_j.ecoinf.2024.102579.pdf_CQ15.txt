Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning pipelines or optimization techniques such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be related to forestry and ecological informatics, discussing estimators and diversity indices in the context of forest management. There is no mention of deep learning or optimization techniques, so I am unable to provide a relevant answer.
