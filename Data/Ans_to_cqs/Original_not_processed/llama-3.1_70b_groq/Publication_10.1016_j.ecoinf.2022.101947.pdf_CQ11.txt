Answer: I don't know.

The provided context appears to be a collection of academic references and citations related to ecological informatics, conservation biology, and wildlife research. There is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. The context seems to be focused on research articles and studies related to Amur tigers, leopards, and other wildlife species, as well as methods for estimating animal abundance and conservation planning. Without further information or context, I am unable to provide a link to a data repository or any other relevant information.
