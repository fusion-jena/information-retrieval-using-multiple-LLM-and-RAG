Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the architecture and training of a deep learning model, as well as some references to computer vision and machine learning papers. It does not provide information on data collection methods such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
