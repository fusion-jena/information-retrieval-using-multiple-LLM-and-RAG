Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model was trained on a dataset that was augmented through techniques such as horizontal flip, 0.2 degree counter-clockwise shear, and random zoom between 0 and 0.2. This suggests that the dataset was artificially expanded to increase its diversity.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model was trained on a batch size of 64 and that the best model was selected based on minimal validation loss. This implies that some form of validation was used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

However, there is no mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting, which are common techniques used to ensure the generalizability of a model. Therefore, it is unclear whether these measures were taken.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions that the model was trained on a specific dataset of images of red kites, and that the model's performance was evaluated on an independent test set of 2060 images. This suggests that the model may not be generalizable to other datasets or tasks.
