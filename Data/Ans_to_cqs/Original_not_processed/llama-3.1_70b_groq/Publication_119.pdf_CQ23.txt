Answer:::
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. 

Firstly, dropout and batch normalization layers were added to the model. These additional layers helped reduce the over-fitting of the model on the training data and increased generalization on testing data.

Secondly, the hyperparameters in the network, including the learning rate, number of epochs, and batch size, were further tuned to optimize the testing accuracy and kappa. The optimized hyperparameter values for learning rate and batch size were 0.007 and 48, respectively.

Thirdly, independent testing data was used for model evaluation to compare the accuracy of various models. This ensured that the model's performance was evaluated on unseen data, which is essential for generalizability.

Lastly, for the U-Net model, a pre-trained ResNet-50 backbone was used, which was pre-trained on ImageNet. This pre-trained network can reduce the amount of training data needed and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.

However, there is no mention of using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure generalizability.
