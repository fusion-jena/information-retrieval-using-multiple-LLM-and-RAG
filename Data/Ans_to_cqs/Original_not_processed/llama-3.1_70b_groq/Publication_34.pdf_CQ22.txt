Answer: 

The performance of the deep learning models is evaluated using the following metrics: 

1. Mean Loss (Loss): This is an important metric as it is the objective function that is minimized during model training. It is calculated as the average loss of the model on a set of sites.

2. Test Rmse (Root Mean Square Error): This metric measures the difference between the predicted and actual values.

3. Test A10%DQ: This metric is not explicitly defined in the provided context, but it is mentioned as one of the evaluation metrics.

Note that accuracy, precision, and recall are not mentioned as evaluation metrics in the provided context.
