Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model has a faster model loading time, which is critical for deployment in remote areas, and that it enables real-time species recognition on basic hardware.

It can be inferred that the model was designed to be efficient and lightweight, which would facilitate its deployment on various platforms. However, the specific process followed for deployment, such as model serialization or platform selection, is not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this question.
