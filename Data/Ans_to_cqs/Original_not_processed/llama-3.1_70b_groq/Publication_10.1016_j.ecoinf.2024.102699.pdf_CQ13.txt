Answer: The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows:

* Optimizer: Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2015)
* Initial learning rate: 0.0001
* Learning rate decay: decaying by a factor of 0.001â‹…learning rate
* Batch size: 32
* Number of epochs: 50 (without mixing up augmentations) and 100 (with mixing up augmentations)
* Scheduler: concatenating cosine-annealing linear scheduler

Note that these hyperparameters are used for training the ViT models, specifically ViT-B/16, which is the best-performing model in the study.
