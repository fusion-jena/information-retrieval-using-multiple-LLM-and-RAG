Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions that "Raw field data are segmented into 5-s spectrograms" (Fig. 2), suggesting that the data is collected from field recordings, but it does not provide further details on the methods used for data collection, such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets. Therefore, I don't know the specific methods used for collecting raw data in this context.
