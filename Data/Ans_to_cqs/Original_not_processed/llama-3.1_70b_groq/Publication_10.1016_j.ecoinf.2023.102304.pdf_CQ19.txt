Answer: I don't know. The provided context does not mention any deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. It appears to be discussing remote sensing and land cover classification using various indices (e.g., NDVI, EVI, NBR) and algorithms (e.g., BFAST, CCDC, VCT), but it does not provide information on the specific frameworks used to build a deep learning model.
