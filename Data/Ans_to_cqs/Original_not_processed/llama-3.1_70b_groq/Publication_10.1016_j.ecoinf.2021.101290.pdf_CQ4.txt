Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a collection of references and snippets from research papers and articles on various topics, including deep learning, computer vision, and event-stream processing.

However, I can provide some general information on common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. Data augmentation is a technique used to artificially increase the size of a training dataset by applying transformations to the existing data. Some common data augmentation techniques include:

* Flipping (horizontal and vertical)
* Rotating (by a certain angle)
* Scaling (resizing the image)
* Color jittering (changing the brightness, contrast, and saturation of the image)
* Cropping (randomly cropping a portion of the image)
* Translation (shifting the image by a certain number of pixels)

These techniques can be applied to images, audio, or other types of data to increase the diversity of the training dataset and improve the robustness of the model.

Please note that this information is not specific to the provided context, but rather general knowledge on data augmentation techniques. If you're looking for specific information on data augmentation techniques used in a particular deep learning pipeline, I would recommend checking the specific research paper or article that describes the pipeline.
