Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context appears to be discussing modifications to a cellular automaton model and strategies for improving its accuracy and efficiency, but it does not delve into the specifics of a deep learning model. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide an answer to this question.
