Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context appears to be focused on the architecture and functionality of a mobile application for agricultural pests recognition, as well as some references to machine learning and computer vision concepts.

However, it does mention that the classiÔ¨Åcation layer calculates the probability of the region proposal containing an object using a softmax function, and the regions with the top score of 300 Pi in the total rankings present the detected target object. Additionally, the regressor provides the IoU index.

While this information provides some insight into the model's output and evaluation, it does not specifically address the postprocessing steps mentioned in the query. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this question.
