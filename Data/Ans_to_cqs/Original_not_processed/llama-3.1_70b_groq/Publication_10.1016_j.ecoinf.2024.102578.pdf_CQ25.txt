Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification and detection. Specifically, the model is used to classify images into two categories: empty images and images with animals, humans, or vehicles. Additionally, the model is used to detect and crop out objects from images and classify them by object type (rock, bait, empty, and species). The model is also used to identify high-quality images and separate them from low-quality ones. The overall goal of the model is to aid in Arctic wildlife monitoring by automating the process of image classification and object detection, thereby reducing the manual reviewing time and increasing the efficiency of the monitoring process.
