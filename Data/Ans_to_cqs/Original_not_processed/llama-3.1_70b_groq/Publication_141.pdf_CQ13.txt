Answer: 
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. However, it does mention that the model was trained in a two-stage process, with the second stage involving fine-tuning the network using smaller learning rates. This suggests that the learning rate was adjusted during the training process, but the exact values are not specified.
