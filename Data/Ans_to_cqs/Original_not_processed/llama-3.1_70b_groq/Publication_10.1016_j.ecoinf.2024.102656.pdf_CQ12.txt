Answer: None of the mentioned deep learning models (CNN, RNN, Transformer) are mentioned in the provided context. The context mentions the use of various statistical models such as generalized linear models (GLM), maximum entropy (MaxEnt), random forest (RF), generalized boosting model (GBM), and multivariate adaptive regression lines (MARS) in an ensemble framework, but it does not mention any deep learning models.
