Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses various aspects of the model, such as the use of Atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) and the combination of spatial pyramid pooling with Atrous convolutions, but does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization.

However, it does mention that the best-performing model based on the validation loss was saved and used as the Faster R-CNN model with a NMS threshold of 0.7 during testing. This suggests that some form of optimization or tuning was performed, but the specific method used is not specified.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to the query.
