Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the data preprocessing, model training, and hyperparameter tuning stages. It discusses the division of data into training, validation, and test sets, the use of GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning, and the importance of hyperparameter tuning in model performance.

The context also mentions the analysis workflow, which includes data acquisition, preprocessing, and model training, but it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps. Therefore, I do not know the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix.
