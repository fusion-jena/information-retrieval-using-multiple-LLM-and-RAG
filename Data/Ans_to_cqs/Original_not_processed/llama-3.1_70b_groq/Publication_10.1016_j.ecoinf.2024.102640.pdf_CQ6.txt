Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and training details of the SegFormer model for photo GVI measurement and the EPDNet model for learning eye-phone distance.

However, it can be inferred that the models were trained on existing datasets (ImageNet-1K and UGE-D), which likely underwent some form of preprocessing before being used for training. Common preprocessing steps in deep learning include normalization, scaling, and data cleaning, but the specific steps taken in this case are not mentioned.

The context does mention that the weights pretrained on the ImageNet-1K dataset were used to initialize the encoder and decoder, which suggests that the models were fine-tuned on the target dataset (UGE-D) rather than trained from scratch. This implies that some form of preprocessing may have been performed on the UGE-D dataset before training, but the details are not provided.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved, it is likely that some form of preprocessing was performed on the datasets before training the models.
