Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention "data augmentation techniques" such as "left-right mirroring" which is a preprocessing step used to reduce overfitting and strengthen the algorithm's capacity to match individuals based on pelt patterns rather than the background. Additionally, the context mentions that the model was trained and tested by tuning the number of required epochs and then inspecting the model outputs and error outcomes for signs of overfitting. This suggests that some form of error analysis and model evaluation was performed as part of the preprocessing or training process. However, specific details on normalization, scaling, or cleaning are not provided.
