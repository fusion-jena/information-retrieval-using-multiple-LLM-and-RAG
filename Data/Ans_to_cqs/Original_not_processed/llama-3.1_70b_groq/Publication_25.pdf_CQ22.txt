Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The context primarily discusses the use of self-supervised and semi-supervised learning approaches, the importance of high-quality annotations, and the potential benefits of combining labeled and unlabeled data for training. It also references several research papers and studies related to deep learning and image classification, but it does not provide information on the specific evaluation metrics used.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
