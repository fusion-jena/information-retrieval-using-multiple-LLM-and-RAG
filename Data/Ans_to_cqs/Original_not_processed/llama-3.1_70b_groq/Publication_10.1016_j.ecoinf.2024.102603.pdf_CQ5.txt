Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context primarily discusses the differences between XGBoost and deep learning models, their architectures, and their applications, particularly in the context of estimating the Fv/Fm parameter. It mentions that deep learning models generally require substantial datasets to achieve optimal results, but it does not specify which datasets are used.
