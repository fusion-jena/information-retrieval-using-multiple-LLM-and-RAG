Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the researchers used an online platform called Zooniverse to collect multiple non-expert counts by citizen scientists. Additionally, it mentions that the researchers used aerial wildlife images, but it does not specify how these images were collected.

It can be inferred that the images were likely collected through aerial surveys, possibly using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or other aerial imaging technologies. However, this is not explicitly stated in the provided context.

The context also mentions that the raw count data is available from Enlighten: Research Data, which suggests that the data may have been collected through a research project or initiative. However, the specific methods used for collecting the data are not provided.

Therefore, while we can make some educated guesses about the methods used for collecting raw data, we cannot provide a definitive answer based on the provided context.
