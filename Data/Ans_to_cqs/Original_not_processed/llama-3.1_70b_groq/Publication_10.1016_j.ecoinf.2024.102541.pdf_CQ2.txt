Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the following data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline:

* Image: The context mentions the use of images in various applications such as object detection (e.g., Microsoft COCO, YOLOv5), animal detection, and plant leaf disease classification. It is likely that image data is used in these applications.
* Video: The context mentions the use of wildlife videos in the paper "Identification of animals and recognition of their actions in wildlife videos using deep learning techniques" by Schindler and Steinhage (2021).
* Satellite imagery: The context mentions the use of satellite imagery in the paper "An automated deep learning based satellite imagery analysis for ecology management" by A.Y. (2021).

There is no mention of audio data or CSV files being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that acoustic chimpanzee detection is done using convolutional recurrent neural networks in the paper "Compensating class imbalance for acoustic chimpanzee detection with convolutional recurrent neural networks" by Anders et al. (2021), which suggests that audio data might be used in this specific application.

It is worth noting that the context is limited to a specific set of papers and applications, and it is possible that other data formats are used in other deep learning pipelines.
