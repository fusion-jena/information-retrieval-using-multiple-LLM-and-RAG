Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context appears to be discussing the use of a process network approach, specifically TPINet, to analyze data from a pine-dominated ecosystem, but it does not provide information on model training or performance monitoring. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
