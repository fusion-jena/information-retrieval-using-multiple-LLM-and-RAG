Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The text only discusses the model architecture (ResNet50), the pre-training dataset (ImageNet), and some general considerations for future work, such as data augmentation and increasing prediction efficiency. Therefore, I do not know the specific hyperparameters used in the model.
