Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to soil moisture modeling, land reclamation, and statistical analysis, but it does not discuss deep learning pipelines or techniques for addressing data bias.

However, I can provide some general information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. These techniques include:

* Stratified splitting: dividing the data into subsets based on the class labels to ensure that each subset has a similar proportion of each class.
* Oversampling: creating additional copies of the minority class to balance the data.
* Undersampling: reducing the number of samples from the majority class to balance the data.
* Diverse data collection: collecting data from a variety of sources to reduce bias and increase diversity.

But please note that this information is not derived from the provided context, and I'm just providing general knowledge on the topic.
