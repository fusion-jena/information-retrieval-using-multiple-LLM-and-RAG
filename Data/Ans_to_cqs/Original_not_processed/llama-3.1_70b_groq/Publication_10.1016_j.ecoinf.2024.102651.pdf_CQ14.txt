Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text only discusses the performance of the proposed classification network on a dataset, comparing its accuracy to other models such as ResNet50 and ViT. It also mentions the improvement in classification accuracy for "medium" and "small" objects, but does not provide any information on hyperparameter optimization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
