Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context appears to be focused on the description of the model, its parameters, and the optimization results for land use demand in 2030. It does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process.

However, it does mention the use of a multitype random patch seed mechanism (CARS) and a cellular automaton (CA) model, which may involve some form of optimization or search process. Additionally, the context mentions the use of random values and a decay factor, which could be related to hyperparameter optimization. Nevertheless, without further information, it is not possible to determine the specific method used for hyperparameter optimization.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the provided context does not provide enough information to determine how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.
