Answer: 
The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the information given, it appears that the model is being used for prediction or regression tasks, rather than classification, segmentation, or detection. The context mentions the use of a trial-and-error method to determine the optimal number of neurons and learning rate, and the calculation of mean square error (MSE) between the model output and measured data. This suggests that the model is being used to make continuous predictions, rather than classify inputs into discrete categories. Additionally, the context mentions the use of an artificial neural network (ANN) to model mosquito abundances, which further supports the idea that the model is being used for prediction or regression tasks.
