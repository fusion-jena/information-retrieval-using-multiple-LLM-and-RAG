Answer: 

The data formats used in the deep learning pipeline, specifically in the context of the LaDeco study, include images and CSV (Comma-Separated Values). The study processes image data, analyzing a total of 8301 images, and the output is provided in CSV format for easier integration with other datasets or further statistical analysis. The CSV file contains the percentages of various landscape elements categorized into different levels, as well as the NFI (Normalized Feature Importance). 

There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the pipeline. The primary focus is on image data, which is processed using a semantic segmentation model to assign specific objects to each pixel of an image. The results are then exported in CSV format for further analysis.
