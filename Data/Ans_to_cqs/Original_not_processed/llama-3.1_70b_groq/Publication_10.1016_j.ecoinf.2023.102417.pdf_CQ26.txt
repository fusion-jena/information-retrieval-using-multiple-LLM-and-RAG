Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the concept of data drift or domain drift, which refers to the discrepancy between the training data distribution and the data distribution of the dataset the model is applied to. This can be caused by various factors such as different recording conditions or devices.

The context also mentions the importance of creating specific datasets tailored to the desired application and the field of domain adaptation, which aims to increase the transferability of models to datasets with similar statistical properties.

While the context does not provide a direct answer to the query, it can be inferred that techniques such as diverse data collection might be relevant in addressing data bias. The context mentions the importance of creating specific datasets tailored to the desired application, which implies the need for diverse and representative data.

However, the context does not provide information on techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling. Therefore, I do not know if these techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline in this specific context.
