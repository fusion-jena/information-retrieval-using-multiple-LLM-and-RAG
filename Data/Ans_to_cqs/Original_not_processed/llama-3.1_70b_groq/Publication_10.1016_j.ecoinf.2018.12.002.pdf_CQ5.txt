I don't know. The provided context does not mention any datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, movement ecology, and machine learning applications in animal behavior research, but it does not provide information on deep learning pipelines or specific datasets used in such pipelines.
