Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on machine learning models, such as LightGBM, and their applications in predicting forest canopy cover using satellite remote sensing data. It discusses the advantages of LightGBM, its hyperparameters, and comparisons with other machine learning models.

However, it does mention the use of satellite remote sensing data, specifically Planet data, as the input for the machine learning models. This suggests that the raw data is collected through satellite imaging, but the exact methods or processes involved in collecting this data are not specified.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
