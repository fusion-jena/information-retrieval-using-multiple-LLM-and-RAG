Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does mention that the CNN model requires equally sized input images, and a time-frequency input window size of 2 s was chosen for preprocessing the training data. 

Additionally, the context mentions that the ResNet50 model was pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, which contains over one million photo images across 1000 classes. It is likely that the ImageNet dataset was preprocessed before training the ResNet50 model, but the specific preprocessing steps are not mentioned.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we can only confirm that the input data was resized to a fixed window size of 2 s, but other preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning are not explicitly mentioned.
