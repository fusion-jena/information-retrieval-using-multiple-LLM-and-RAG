Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, it does mention that the Root Trimmed Mean Squared Prediction Error (RTMSPE) is utilized to select the appropriate values for the tuning parameters τ and ϕ. Additionally, it mentions that cross-validation may be recommended to obtain the RTMSPE, but due to computational cost, the RTMSPE is calculated using the training data in this paper. 

It can be inferred that the hyperparameters might be optimized using a method that involves calculating the RTMSPE for different values of τ and ϕ, but the exact method (e.g., grid search, random search) is not specified.
