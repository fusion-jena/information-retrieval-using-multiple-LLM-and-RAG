Answer:::

Based on the provided context, one technique used to address data bias during preprocessing of the machine learning pipeline is Stratified Random Sampling. According to the text, "a randomly selected half of the pixels for the training and testing split" was used to "capture the full distribution of AGB values within the LiDAR-derived AGB maps accurately." This approach is specifically mentioned as a "stratified random sampling" technique, which suggests that the data was split in a way that maintains the same distribution of Above-Ground Biomass (AGB) values in both the training and testing datasets.

There is no mention of oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection as techniques used to address data bias in the provided context. However, it is worth noting that the use of stratified random sampling is a common technique used to address data bias and ensure that the training and testing datasets are representative of the population.

It is also worth noting that the context provided is focused on machine learning and remote sensing applications, and the techniques used to address data bias may vary depending on the specific application and dataset.
