Answer:::
None of the provided context mentions the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The text only mentions that deep learning techniques are used, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and that they are integrated with the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform through the Google Cloud platform. However, it does not provide information on the specific frameworks used to build these models.
