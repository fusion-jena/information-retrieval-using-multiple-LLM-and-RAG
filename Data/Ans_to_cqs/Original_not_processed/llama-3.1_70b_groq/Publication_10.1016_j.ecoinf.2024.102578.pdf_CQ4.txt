Answer: The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include:

* Rotation: 0-40 degrees
* Width and height shift range: 20%
* Shear range: 0-0.2 radians
* Zoom range: 0-0.2 scalar range
* Horizontal flip
* Fill mode: nearest pixel

These techniques were applied using the Keras image_data_generator function to augment the image data and increase the diversity of the training set.
