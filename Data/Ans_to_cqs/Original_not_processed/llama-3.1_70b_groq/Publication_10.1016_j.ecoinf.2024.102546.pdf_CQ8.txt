Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific code repository of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention a Python library called "scholarly" which is used to automatically retrieve publication records from Google Scholar, and its repository is available on GitHub (https://github.com/scholarly-python-package/scholarly). But this is not related to the deep learning pipeline.

The context also mentions several research papers and their authors, but it does not provide information about the code repository of the deep learning pipeline used in these papers. Therefore, I couldn't find the answer to the query in the provided context.
