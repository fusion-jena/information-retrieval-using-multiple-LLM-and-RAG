Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention ImageNet in the context of a reference paper by Krizhevsky et al. (2012) titled "ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks." This suggests that ImageNet might be related to the topic, but it is not explicitly stated as a dataset used in the pipeline.

Additionally, the context mentions a dataset called "CVIP100" in section 6.1.2, but it does not provide further information about this dataset.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I can only confirm that ImageNet is mentioned as a related reference, and CVIP100 is mentioned as a dataset, but I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
