Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for image classification, and mentions the division of the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets, as well as the hyperparameters used for training (learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs). However, it does not provide information on regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization.
