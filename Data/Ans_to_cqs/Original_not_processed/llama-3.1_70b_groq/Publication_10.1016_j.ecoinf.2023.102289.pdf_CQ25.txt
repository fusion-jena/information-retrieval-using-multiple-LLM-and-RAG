Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model in LaDeco is semantic segmentation. According to the provided context, semantic segmentation is a technology used in image recognition that assigns specific objects to each pixel of an image. The model, specifically the deeplabv3 part, is a semantic segmentation algorithm developed by Google. The primary function of LaDeco is to calculate the pixel percentage of each landscape element in the image, which is achieved through semantic segmentation.
