Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the experimental setup, model architecture, and training process, but it does not provide information on model deployment.

The context mentions that the tests were run on a Windows 11 operating system using Python 3.8, but it does not specify how the trained model was deployed or if any model serialization or platform selection was involved. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this query.
