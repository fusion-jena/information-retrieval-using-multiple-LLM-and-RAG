Answer: The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model, specifically a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network. This is stated in the text: "Fig. 3. Model architecture for predicting pesticide presence in bees using a Recurrent Neural Network. This framework integrates two Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) layers."
