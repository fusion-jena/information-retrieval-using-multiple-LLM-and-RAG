Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the experiment design, data collection, and analysis of the tagging efficiency experiment, but does not provide information on the model's generalizability. Therefore, I do not know what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
