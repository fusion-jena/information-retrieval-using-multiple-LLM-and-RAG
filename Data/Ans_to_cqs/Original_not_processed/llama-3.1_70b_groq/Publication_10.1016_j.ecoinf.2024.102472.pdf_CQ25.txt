Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the provided context is classification, specifically hyperspectral image classification. According to the paper by De Lucia et al. (2022), the model is designed for explainable AI in edge computing environments, and its primary goal is to classify hyperspectral images. Additionally, the paper by Domingues et al. (2020) uses artificial neural networks for the prediction of eucalyptus biomass, which can also be considered a classification problem. However, the primary focus of the model is on classification rather than segmentation or detection.
