Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions the specific hyperparameter settings used in the training process, such as the learning rate, momentum, weight decay, and batch size. 

However, it does mention that the learning rate is decreased by a factor of 10 when the validation set accuracy stops improving in one experiment, and decreased by a factor of 10 every 20K iteration in another experiment. This suggests that the hyperparameters may have been tuned manually or through a simple schedule, but the exact optimization method used is not specified.
