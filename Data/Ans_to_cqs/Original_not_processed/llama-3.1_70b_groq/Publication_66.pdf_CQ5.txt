Answer:::
The provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention that the deep learning models were trained on GPS track data, which is available at http://seabirdtracking.org/mapper/contributor.php?contributor_id=950. The context also mentions that the models were used to predict diving locations of seabirds monitored with only GPS devices, suggesting that the dataset used is specific to seabird tracking and behavior.
