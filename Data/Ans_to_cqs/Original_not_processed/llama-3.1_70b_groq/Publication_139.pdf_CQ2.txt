Answer:::
The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is primarily image data, specifically spectrogram images. These spectrograms are pictorial representations of raw audio data, conveying the temporal dimension on the horizontal axis, frequency on the vertical axis, and sound power level represented by color. The use of spectrogram images allows for the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are typically designed for image classification, to classify audio data.
