Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training are not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that the following steps are involved:

1. Map accuracy metrics calculation: The context mentions that "map accuracy metrics were computed" after the simulated fields were generated. This suggests that the model's performance is evaluated using various metrics.
2. Computation of means from sampling distributions: The context states that "the means were computed from the sampling distributions" after the map accuracy metrics were calculated. This implies that the model's performance is summarized using statistical measures such as means.

There is no mention of saliency maps or confusion matrices in the provided context. Therefore, it is unclear if these specific postprocessing steps are involved.

It is worth noting that the context primarily focuses on evaluating the accuracy of thematic maps produced by a calibrated statistical prediction method, rather than providing a comprehensive overview of postprocessing steps involved in model training.
