Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to research papers on machine learning, pollution patterns, and water quality monitoring, but it does not provide information on preprocessing steps for deep learning models.

However, I can suggest that common preprocessing steps for deep learning models may include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and feature engineering, but this is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

If you're looking for information on preprocessing steps for deep learning models, I recommend consulting a reliable source or a textbook on deep learning, as the provided context does not provide a clear answer to this question.
