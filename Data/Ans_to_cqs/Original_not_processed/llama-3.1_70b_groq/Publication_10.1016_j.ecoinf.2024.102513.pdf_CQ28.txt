Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It only discusses the architecture of the convolutional neural network, the process of analyzing landscape and land surface changes, and the use of remote sensing Earth observation data, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform.
