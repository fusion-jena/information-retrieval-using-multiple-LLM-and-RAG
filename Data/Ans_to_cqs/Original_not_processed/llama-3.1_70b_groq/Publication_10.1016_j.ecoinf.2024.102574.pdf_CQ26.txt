Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing, ecology, and forestry, with discussions on topics such as grassland conservation, canopy height mapping, and biomass estimation. It does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias in deep learning pipelines.

However, it does mention the use of machine learning techniques such as random forests, support vector machines, feature fusion techniques, and neural networks for tasks like tree species classification and above-ground biomass estimation. But it does not provide information on how data bias is addressed in these techniques.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
