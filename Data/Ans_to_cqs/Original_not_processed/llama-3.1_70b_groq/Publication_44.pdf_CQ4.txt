Answer:::
The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, as mentioned in the provided context, are:

1. Rotation
2. Flipping
3. Brightness adjustments

These techniques were applied to the input images to improve the network's generalization capabilities. The images were also resized to a 512 Ã— 512 resolution to reduce the computational cost during training. However, scaling is not explicitly mentioned as a data augmentation technique in the provided context.
