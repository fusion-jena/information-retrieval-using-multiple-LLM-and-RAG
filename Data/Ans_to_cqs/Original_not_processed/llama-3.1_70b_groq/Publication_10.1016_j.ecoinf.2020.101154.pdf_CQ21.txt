Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the hyperparameter tuning and model training process for the RI and RY models.

However, it does mention the use of early stopping to avoid overfitting and the calculation of VI scores to determine the most influential variables in the GBRT models. Additionally, it mentions the inclusion of these variables in a series of generalized additive models.

Therefore, I can only provide a partial answer to the query. The postprocessing steps that can be inferred from the context are:

* Calculation of VI scores to determine the most influential variables
* Inclusion of these variables in a series of generalized additive models

However, I do not have information on saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix as part of the postprocessing steps.
