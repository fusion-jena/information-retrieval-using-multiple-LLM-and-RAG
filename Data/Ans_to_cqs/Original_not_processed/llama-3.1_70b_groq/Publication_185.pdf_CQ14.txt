Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It does provide some information about the hyperparameters used in the model, such as the batch size (69), momentum (0.9), L2 weight decay penalty multiplier (5 Ã— 10-4), and dropout ratio (0.5). However, it does not mention the method used to optimize these hyperparameters, such as grid search or random search.
