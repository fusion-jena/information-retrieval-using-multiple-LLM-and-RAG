Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses various machine learning models, such as boosted tree and neural networks, and techniques like early stopping to prevent overfitting. However, it does not provide information on data preprocessing techniques like Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. If you have any further context or clarification, I would be happy to try and assist you.
