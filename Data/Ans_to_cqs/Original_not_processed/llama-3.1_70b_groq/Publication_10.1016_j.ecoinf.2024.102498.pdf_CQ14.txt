Answer: The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using the validation data. According to the text, "To fill this gap and avoid overfitting, the validation data were employed for tuning the key hyperparameters for each model." This suggests that the hyperparameters are tuned manually using the validation data, rather than using an automated method such as grid search or random search. The specific hyperparameters used for each model are listed in Table 3.
