Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context appears to be a collection of references and data statistics, but it does not provide information on the specific steps taken after model training.

However, I can provide some general information on common postprocessing steps that are often involved after model training. These may include:

* Saliency maps: These are visualizations that highlight the most important features or inputs that contribute to the model's predictions.
* Metrics calculation: This involves calculating various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, mean squared error, etc. to evaluate the performance of the model.
* Confusion matrix: This is a table that summarizes the predictions against the actual outcomes, providing a clear picture of the model's performance.

Other postprocessing steps may include:

* Model interpretation: This involves analyzing the model's predictions and understanding how the model is making predictions.
* Model evaluation: This involves evaluating the model's performance on a test dataset and comparing it to other models.
* Model refinement: This involves refining the model by adjusting hyperparameters, feature engineering, or using different algorithms.

Please note that these are general postprocessing steps, and the specific steps involved may vary depending on the specific problem, model, and dataset.
