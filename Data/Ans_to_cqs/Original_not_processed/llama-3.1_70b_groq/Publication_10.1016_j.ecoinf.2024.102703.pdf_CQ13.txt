Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context only mentions the architecture of the neural network (a three-layer back propagation network), the maximum training times (10,000), and the training error (0.001). It does not provide information on the learning rate or optimizer used in the model.
