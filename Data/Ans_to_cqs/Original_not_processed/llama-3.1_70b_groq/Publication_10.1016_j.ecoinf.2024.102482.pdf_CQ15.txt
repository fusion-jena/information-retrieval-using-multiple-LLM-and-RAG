Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the applications of deep learning techniques in ecology, feature extraction methods, and the potential of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in biomonitoring systems. It does not delve into the details of optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of various deep learning models, such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), and ConvLSTM, in different ecological applications. These models often employ optimization techniques like SGD or Adam to update the model parameters during training. Nevertheless, the specific optimization techniques used in these models are not mentioned in the provided context.
