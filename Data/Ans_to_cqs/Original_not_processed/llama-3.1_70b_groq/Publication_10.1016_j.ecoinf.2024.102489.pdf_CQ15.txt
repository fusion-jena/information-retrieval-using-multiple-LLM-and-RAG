Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention deep learning or any optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam. The context appears to be focused on a Random Forest (RF) model, which is a type of machine learning algorithm, but it does not discuss deep learning or optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines.
