Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the effectiveness of a comprehensive processing pipeline in mitigating device biases in site comparisons using ecoacoustic indices (EAI) and its potential extension to machine learning and deep learning fields. It does not delve into the details of the deep learning pipeline or the optimization techniques used. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
