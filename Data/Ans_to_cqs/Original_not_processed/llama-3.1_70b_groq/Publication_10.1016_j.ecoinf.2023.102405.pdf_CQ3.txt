Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to focus on the application of deep learning models for water contamination classification in aquaculture, and the challenges associated with it. It discusses the use of IoT-based data collection, data segregation, and the development of a novel attention-based AODEGRU model. However, it does not provide information on the data annotation techniques employed in the pipeline. Therefore, I do not know the specific data annotation techniques used in this context.
