Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily discusses the performance of different modeling approaches, including Random Forest (RF), Generalized Linear Model (GLM), and MaxEnt, and how they are affected by the number of background points used in training. It also mentions the use of internal cross-validation during model training, but it does not provide information on the stopping criteria used to determine when training is complete. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
