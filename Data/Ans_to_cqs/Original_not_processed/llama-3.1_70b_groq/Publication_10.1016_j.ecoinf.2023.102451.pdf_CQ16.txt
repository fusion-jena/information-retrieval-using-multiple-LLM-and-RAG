Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that the proposed model EMViT-Net is trained for 100 epochs. This suggests that the training process is stopped after a fixed number of epochs, rather than being based on a specific stopping criterion like validation loss plateau.
