Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention any strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the comparison of different deep learning models (Inception-V3, MobileNet-V2, ResNet-18, and DenseNet-121) for animal classification using camera trap images, and their deployment on IoT edge devices.

However, it does mention the use of grid search for hyperparameter tuning, which may involve random search or random sampling of hyperparameters. But it does not provide any information on how randomness is handled in the pipeline.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
