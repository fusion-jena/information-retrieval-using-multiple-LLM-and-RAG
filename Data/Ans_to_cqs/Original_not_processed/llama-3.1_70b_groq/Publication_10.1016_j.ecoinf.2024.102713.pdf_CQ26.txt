Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on data integration, enrichment, and organization within a data platform, rather than deep learning or data preprocessing techniques.

The context discusses the architecture of the data platform, including the Raw, Harbor, and Access tiers, and mentions data sources, providers, and frequencies. It also touches on the relational schema of the integrated data and the CASE database. However, it does not mention any techniques for addressing data bias, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
