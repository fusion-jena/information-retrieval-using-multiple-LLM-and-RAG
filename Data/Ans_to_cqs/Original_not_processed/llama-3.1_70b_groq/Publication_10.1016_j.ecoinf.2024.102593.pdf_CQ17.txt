Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on the use of dimensionality reduction techniques, analysis of embeddings, and active learning to improve the performance of deep neural networks (DNNs). It also discusses the complexity of DNNs and the challenges of interpreting their inner workings.

While the context mentions the use of techniques to improve model performance and reduce manual annotation, it does not explicitly mention regularization methods to prevent overfitting. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
