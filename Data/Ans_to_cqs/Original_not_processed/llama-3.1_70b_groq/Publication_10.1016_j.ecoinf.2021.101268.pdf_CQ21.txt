Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the post-processing steps involved after model training. However, it does mention some techniques that are typically used for qualitative evaluation and visualization of the model's performance.

According to the context, the authors use Integrated Gradients (Sundararajan et al.) and SmoothGrad (Smilkov et al.) methods to plot a point cloud, where the density denotes the input space relevance. This suggests that the authors use these techniques to generate saliency maps, which help to visualize the features that the model is focusing on.

Additionally, the context mentions the calculation of accuracy metrics, including train, validation, and test accuracy, which are typically calculated after model training.

The context also mentions the creation of confusion matrices, as shown in Fig. 5 for the VGG-19 architecture. Confusion matrices are a common technique used to evaluate the performance of a classification model.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the post-processing steps involved after model training appear to include:

* Generation of saliency maps using Integrated Gradients and SmoothGrad methods
* Calculation of accuracy metrics (train, validation, test)
* Creation of confusion matrices

However, it is possible that there are other post-processing steps involved that are not mentioned in the provided context.
