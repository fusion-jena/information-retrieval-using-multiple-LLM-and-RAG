Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is age estimation, specifically to estimate the age of pandas from their facial images. The model is trained on the PAD Full and PAD Lite datasets, and its performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The model is fine-tuned on these datasets after being pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, and various architectures such as VGG and ResNet are compared to determine the most accurate and efficient model for this task.
