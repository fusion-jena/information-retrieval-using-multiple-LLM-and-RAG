Answer:

Based on the provided context, it appears that sensors are utilized for collecting raw data. The context mentions various sensor models, including temperature and humidity sensors (HMP155), wind speed sensors (WindSonic anemometer), atmospheric pressure sensors (AV-410BP), photosynthetically active radiation sensors (LI-190SB), direct radiation sensors (LI-200Ã—), ultraviolet radiation sensors (CUV5), net radiation sensors (CNR4), and particulate matter 2.5 sensors (RR-9421). These sensors are used to collect data on various environmental parameters, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, radiation, and air quality.

The context also mentions that the data collected by these sensors are stored by a CR1000 collector, which samples the data at a frequency of 15 seconds and stores it for a period of 10 minutes. The data is then transmitted in real-time to a server through a DTU900C GPRS remote transmission module.

There is no mention of surveys or public datasets being used for collecting raw data in the provided context. Therefore, it appears that sensors are the primary method used for collecting raw data in this pipeline.
