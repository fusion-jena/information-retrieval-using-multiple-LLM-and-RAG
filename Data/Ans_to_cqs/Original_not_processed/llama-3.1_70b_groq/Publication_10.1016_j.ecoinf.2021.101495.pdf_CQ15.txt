Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context only provides information about the computing infrastructure, hyperparameters, and training duration for the neural networks, but it does not specify the optimization techniques used, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam.

However, it does mention the learning rate, which is a hyperparameter that is often used in conjunction with optimization techniques. The learning rate is specified as [0.0001â€“0.01] for both segmentation and classification tasks, and the best assignment is 0.008 for segmentation and 0.0001 for classification. But without further information, it is not possible to determine the specific optimization technique used.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
