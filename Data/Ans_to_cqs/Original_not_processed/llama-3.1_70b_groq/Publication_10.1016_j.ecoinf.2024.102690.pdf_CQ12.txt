Answer: 
The text does not mention a deep learning model such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. Instead, it mentions that the SOFM (Self-Organizing Feature Map) is used, which is an unsupervised learning neural network approach. SOFM is not typically classified as a deep learning model, but rather as a type of artificial neural network.
