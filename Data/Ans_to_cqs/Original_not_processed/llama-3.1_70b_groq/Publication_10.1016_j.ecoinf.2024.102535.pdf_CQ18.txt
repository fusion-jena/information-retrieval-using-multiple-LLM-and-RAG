Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of early stopping and validation loss. The patience parameter, which controls the number of epochs without improvements in the validation loss, was set to 10. This means that if the model's performance on the validation set does not improve for 10 consecutive epochs, the training process is stopped to avoid overfitting. Additionally, the model's performance is evaluated on the validation set during training, and the results are used to adjust the learning rate using a learning rate decay procedure.
