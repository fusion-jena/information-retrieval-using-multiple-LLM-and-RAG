Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for hyperspectral image classification. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning methods, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for hyperspectral image classification tasks. It discusses various architectures and techniques, such as 1-D-CNN, spectral-spatial unified networks, and 3-D deep learning frameworks, but does not provide information on data annotation techniques.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
