Answer:::
The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the provided context are:

1. Microsoft COCO dataset: This dataset is used for pre-training the region proposal network (RPN) classifier and mask head. It is also used as a reference for defining the average precision (AP), AP50, and AP75 metrics.

No other datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet are mentioned in the provided context. However, the context does mention a custom RGB-D dataset used for evaluating the D-Mask R-CNN architecture, specifically for detecting instances of deer.
