Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be a collection of research papers and academic articles related to ecological informatics, environmental science, and data analysis, but it does not provide specific information on deep learning preprocessing steps.

However, I can suggest that typical preprocessing steps for deep learning models may include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and feature engineering, but this information is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. If you're looking for specific information on preprocessing steps for deep learning models, I recommend consulting a relevant textbook or research article on the topic.
