Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the purpose of the deep learning model. The context appears to be related to remote sensing and machine learning applications, but it does not specify the purpose of the deep learning model. It mentions various studies and papers on remote sensing and machine learning, but it does not provide enough information to determine the purpose of the deep learning model.

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the deep learning model might be used for tasks such as classification, regression, or estimation of variables related to remote sensing, such as forest biomass estimation, crop growth monitoring, or canopy height mapping. But without more specific information, it is impossible to determine the exact purpose of the deep learning model.
