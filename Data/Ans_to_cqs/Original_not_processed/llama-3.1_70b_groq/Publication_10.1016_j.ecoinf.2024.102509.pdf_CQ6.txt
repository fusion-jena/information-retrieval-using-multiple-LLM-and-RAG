Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, based on general knowledge of deep learning and the context provided, some preprocessing steps can be inferred.

Typically, before training a deep learning model, the following preprocessing steps are involved:

1. Data cleaning: This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting errors in the dataset.

2. Normalization or scaling: This involves scaling the data to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model.

3. Feature engineering: This involves selecting the most relevant features and transforming them into a suitable format for the model.

4. Data transformation: This involves converting the data into a suitable format for the model, such as converting categorical variables into numerical variables.

However, the provided context does not provide specific details about the preprocessing steps involved in the specific deep learning model being discussed. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a more detailed answer.

It is worth noting that the context mentions the use of the 'neuralnet' package in R for training a multi-layer perceptron in regression analyses, but it does not provide details about the preprocessing steps involved.
