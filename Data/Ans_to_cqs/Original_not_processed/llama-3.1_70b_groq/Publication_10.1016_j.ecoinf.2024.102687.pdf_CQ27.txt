Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the training and fine-tuning of the models, including the experimental setup, hyperparameters, and energy consumption estimation. It does not provide information on model deployment, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
