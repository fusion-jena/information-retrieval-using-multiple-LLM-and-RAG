Answer: 

The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using four basic classification metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 

1. Accuracy: It is calculated by summing the true positives (TP) and true negatives (TN) and dividing by all possible outcomes of the classification process. The formula for accuracy is: Accuracy (%) = (TP + TN) / (TP + FP + FN + TN) * 100%.

2. Precision: It represents the relationship between the true positive predicted values and all positive predicted values. The formula for precision is: Precision = TP / (TP + FP).

3. Recall (or Sensitivity): It presents the ratio between the true predictive positive values and the summation of both predicted true positive and predicted false values. The formula for recall is: Recall = TP / (TP + FN).

4. F1-score: It demonstrates the overall accuracy measure of the developed classifier by combining the double ratio of both the precision and recall metrics. The formula for F1-score is: F1-score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall).

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the Faster R-CNN model for automatic identification of crop pests.
