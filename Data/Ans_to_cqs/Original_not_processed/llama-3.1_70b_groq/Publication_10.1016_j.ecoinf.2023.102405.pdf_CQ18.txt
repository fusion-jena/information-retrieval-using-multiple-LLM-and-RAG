Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is to track the training loss and accuracy for each epoch. This is evident from the provided context, specifically in the training loop (steps 4-27), where the total loss and total correct predictions are initialized to 0 at the beginning of each epoch (step 6). The model's performance is evaluated after processing each mini-batch, and the total loss and total correct predictions are updated accordingly (steps 24-27). Additionally, the context mentions that empty lists are initialized to store the training loss and accuracy for each epoch (step 3), indicating that the model's performance is being monitored and recorded throughout the training process.
