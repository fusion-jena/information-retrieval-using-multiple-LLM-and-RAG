Answer:

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the machine learning models in this context are:

1. Mean Absolute Error (MAE): measures the average difference between predicted and actual values.
2. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
3. Coefficient of Determination (R2): measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s).

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the machine learning models in predicting water quality parameters such as CHL-a, SD, and TSS. The models with lower MAE and RMSE values and higher R2 values are considered to be more accurate.

Note that the context does not specifically mention a deep learning model, but rather machine learning models in general. The metrics mentioned above are used to evaluate the performance of the machine learning models, which include Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), AdaBoost, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN).
