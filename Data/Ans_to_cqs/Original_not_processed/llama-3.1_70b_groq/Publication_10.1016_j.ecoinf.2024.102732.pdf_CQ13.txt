Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. The context appears to focus on traditional machine learning models, including Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, and Support Vector Regression (SVR), and discusses their respective hyperparameters, such as "ntree", "mtry", "nrounds", "max depth", and "C" parameter. However, it does not provide information on deep learning models or their hyperparameters. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
