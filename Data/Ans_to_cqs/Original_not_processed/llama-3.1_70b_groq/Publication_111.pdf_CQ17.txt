Answer:::

The provided context mentions one regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, which is dropout. According to the text, dropout is a regularization strategy that allows training neural networks with alternative topologies in parallel by randomly dropping out a certain proportion of layer neurons. This is indicated by the black neurons in the fully connected layers.

However, the context does not mention L2 regularization as a method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. It does mention early stopping as a strategy to prevent overfitting, but this is not a regularization method in the classical sense.

Additionally, the context mentions that the proposed model uses the Mean Square Error (MSE) loss function, but it does not mention any other regularization methods such as L1 regularization or weight decay.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the only regularization method mentioned to prevent overfitting is dropout.
