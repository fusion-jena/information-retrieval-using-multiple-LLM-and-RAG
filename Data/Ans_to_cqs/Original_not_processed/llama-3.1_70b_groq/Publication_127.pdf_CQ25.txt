Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model in this context appears to be classification. The text mentions that the final layer of a deep neural network (DNN) is usually a softmax function, which is commonly used for classification tasks. Additionally, the text states that the outputs of the DNN are often interpreted as the model's estimated probability of the image belonging to a certain class, which is consistent with a classification task. The text also mentions that the model is being used to analyze camera-trap images for wildlife ecology, which suggests that the model is being used to classify images into different categories (e.g., different species of animals).
