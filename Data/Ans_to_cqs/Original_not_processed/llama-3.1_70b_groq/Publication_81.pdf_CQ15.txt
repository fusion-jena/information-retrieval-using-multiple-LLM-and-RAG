Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The text only mentions the use of Elastic Net to solve the overfitting problem and improve the generalization ability of the ESK model, as well as the use of Backpropagation Artificial Neural Network in a referenced paper. However, it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
