Answer: Unfortunately, the provided text does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text describes the architecture of the model (NASnet with a Faster-rcnn backbone), the training parameters (learning rate, batch size, number of iterations), and the evaluation metrics (recall, precision, F-measure), but it does not provide information on regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
