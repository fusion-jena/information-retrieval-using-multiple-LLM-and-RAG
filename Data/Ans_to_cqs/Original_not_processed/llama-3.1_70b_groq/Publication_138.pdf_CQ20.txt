Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. It only discusses the architectures and performance of various deep learning models, such as LeNet, AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and ResNet, but does not provide information on the hardware used for training these models. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
