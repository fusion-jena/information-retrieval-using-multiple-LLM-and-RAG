Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The text primarily focuses on the challenges of training DNN models, the use of dimensionality reduction techniques, and the application of active learning for selecting samples for manual annotation.

However, it does mention the use of embeddings and dimensionality reduction techniques, such as t-SNE, which implies that some form of preprocessing or feature extraction may be involved. Additionally, the text references various research papers and studies on deep learning models for audio classification, but it does not provide specific details on the preprocessing steps used in those studies.

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query, and I would recommend consulting additional resources or the original research papers mentioned in the context for more information on the preprocessing steps involved in training deep learning models for audio classification.
