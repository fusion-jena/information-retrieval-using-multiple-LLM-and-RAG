Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. The context appears to be related to environmental studies, specifically focusing on topics such as soil erosion, lake drying, drought forecasting, and soil salinization. There is no mention of deep learning models or their deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide a relevant answer to the query.
