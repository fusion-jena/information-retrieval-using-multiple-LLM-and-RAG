Answer:::
The provided context mentions some hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. The learning rate is mentioned as 1e-3 for most networks, except for ResNet_v2, which was set to 1e-5. The batch size was set to 128 for the modified BatNet model, but it was initially set to 64 for the original BatNet. 

However, the optimizer used in the model is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. It only mentions that the network is key to optimizing the parameters in the model using the reference dataset, but it does not specify the optimization algorithm used.
