Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the model's performance is evaluated using four performance metrics: accuracy, recall, precision, and the F1 score. Additionally, the context mentions that the model's performance is analyzed using the test data set that was not employed during the learning stage. This suggests that the model's performance is evaluated on a separate test set after training, but the specific strategy or criteria used to monitor performance during training is not provided.
