Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context appears to be a collection of research papers and references related to machine learning, remote sensing, and land use classification, but it does not provide information on the deployment process of a trained model.

However, it does mention the use of various libraries and tools such as scikit-learn, scikit-image, and Google Earth Engine Python API, which could be used for model development and deployment. But the specific steps followed for model deployment are not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this query.
