Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The text only mentions that the model is trained by minimizing the loss function of Eq. (2) using a cross-entropy loss function, but it does not specify the optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
