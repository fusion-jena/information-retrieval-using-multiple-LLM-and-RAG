Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the sources of the data, which include:

* AEMET (Agencia Estatal de Meteorolog√≠a) for weather-related data such as pressure, precipitation, air temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed.
* Soil Moisture Probe for soil moisture data.
* Radiation Station for radiation-related data such as global radiation, reflected radiation, and atmospheric radiation.
* Eddy Covariance Station for flux-related data such as sensible heat flux, latent heat flux, and carbon dioxide flux.

It can be inferred that the data is collected through a combination of sensor-based measurements and possibly public datasets from weather and environmental monitoring agencies. However, the exact methods used for collecting raw data, such as surveys or other means, are not specified in the provided context.
