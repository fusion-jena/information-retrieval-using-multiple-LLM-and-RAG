Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It only discusses the pretraining, fine-tuning, and training of the models, including the use of ImageNet-based weights for pretraining and the deployment of these weights for fine-tuning the ViT models. However, it does not provide information on model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related processes. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
