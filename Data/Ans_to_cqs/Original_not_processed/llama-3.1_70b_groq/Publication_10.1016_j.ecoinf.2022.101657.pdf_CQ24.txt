Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning techniques for species identification in camera trap data, discussing topics like neural network architectures, transfer learning, and evaluation metrics.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to use techniques like:

* Fixing the random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results
* Using techniques like data augmentation to increase the size of the training dataset and reduce overfitting
* Employing regularization techniques, such as dropout, to prevent overfitting
* Averaging the results of multiple models trained with different random seeds to reduce the impact of randomness

But these strategies are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide a more specific answer to this question based on the given information.
