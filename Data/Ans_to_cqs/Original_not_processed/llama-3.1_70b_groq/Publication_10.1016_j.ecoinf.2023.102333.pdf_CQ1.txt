Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the application of deep learning techniques in remote sensing and land-use and land-cover classification, particularly in the context of optimizing hyperparameters for deep neural networks.

However, based on the references to remote sensing and Google Earth Engine, it can be inferred that satellite or aerial imagery data might be used as a source of raw data. Additionally, the mention of Sentinel-1 SAR time series suggests that satellite-based sensors might be used for collecting data.

Other than that, the context does not provide specific information on the methods used for collecting raw data. It is possible that surveys, public datasets, or other types of sensors might be used, but this cannot be confirmed based on the provided context.

Therefore, a definitive answer to the query cannot be provided, and further information would be needed to determine the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
