Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is object detection. This is evident from the mention of YOLOv5, which is a popular real-time object detection system. The context also mentions hyperparameters and training results, which suggests that the model is being fine-tuned for object detection tasks. Additionally, the mention of mean Average Precision (mAP) values and the use of a dataset for custom training further supports this conclusion.
