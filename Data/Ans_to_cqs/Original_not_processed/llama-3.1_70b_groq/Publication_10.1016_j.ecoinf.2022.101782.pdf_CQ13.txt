Answer:::
The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows:

* Optimizer: ADAM
* Learning rate: 10^-5
* Batch size: 64

These hyperparameters were used to train the model on the dataset, and the model was trained for approximately 4 days. The best model was selected based on minimal validation loss, which occurred at epoch 448.
