Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does describe the development of a three-layer feedforward back-propagation neural network with a 30-20-10 architecture, where the input factors were population size and GDP, and the predicted output was GHGdwts.

The context mentions that 70% of the data were used for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for model testing, but it does not provide information on any preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning that may have been performed on the data before training the model.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
