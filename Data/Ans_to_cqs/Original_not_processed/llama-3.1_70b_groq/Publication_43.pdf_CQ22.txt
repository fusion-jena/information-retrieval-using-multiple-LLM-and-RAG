Answer:::

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in the provided context are:

1. Precision: It is calculated as the ratio of True Positives (TP) to the sum of True Positives and False Positives (FP). Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
2. Recall: It is calculated as the ratio of True Positives (TP) to the sum of True Positives and False Negatives (FN). Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
3. F1-measure: It is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. F1-measure = 2 × (precision × recall) / (precision + recall)

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the CNN-based detector in the context of object detection. The results are presented in Table 3, which shows the accuracy of the model in terms of true positives, false positives, false negatives, precision, recall, F1-measure, and execution time of the detection process.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model is trained using the prediction loss minimization, where the objective is to iteratively minimize the average loss defined as J(w) = (1/N) * ∑[L(f(w; xi), yi) + λR(w)]. However, this is not a metric used to evaluate the performance of the model, but rather a loss function used during training.
