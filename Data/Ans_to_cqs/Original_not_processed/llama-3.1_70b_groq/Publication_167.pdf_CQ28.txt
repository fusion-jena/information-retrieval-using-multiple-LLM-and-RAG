Answer: 
I don't know. The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the use of deep learning models in the remote sensing domain, the drivers and mechanisms of land use and cover change (LUCC), and the potential for future studies, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform.
