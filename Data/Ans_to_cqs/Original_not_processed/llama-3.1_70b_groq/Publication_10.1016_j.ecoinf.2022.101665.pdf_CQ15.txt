Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to machine learning, specifically discussing the division of a dataset into training, validation, and test sets, as well as the use of resampling methods. It also mentions the use of random forest models for predicting Above Ground Biomass (AGB) values. However, it does not mention deep learning or optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
