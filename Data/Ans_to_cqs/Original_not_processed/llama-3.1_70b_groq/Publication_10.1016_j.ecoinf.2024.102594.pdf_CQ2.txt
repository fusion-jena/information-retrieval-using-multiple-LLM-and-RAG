Answer:::
The data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are image formats, specifically TIF (Tagged Image File Format) and SHP (Shapefile) formats. According to the context, the classification results predicted by the DeepLabV3+ algorithm are in TIF format, while the segmentation results obtained from MRS are in SHP format. These formats are used for image data, specifically remote sensing images and semantic labels of land cover classes. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV formats being used in the pipeline.
