Answer: 
The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, except for accuracy. It is mentioned that the proposed CNN-LSTM model achieves an accuracy of 95.06%, which is higher than the accuracy reported in the literature (91%). However, it does not provide information on other metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, etc. Therefore, based on the provided context, the only metric that can be confirmed is accuracy.
