Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be discussing a method for generating redescriptions from existing data, specifically in the context of dental traits and climate variables. It mentions parameters for controlling the complexity of queries and filtering results, but does not provide information on data collection methods. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
