Answer:::

To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. 

Firstly, the data was split into three mutually exclusive parts: a learning set, a validation set, and a test set. This is a common practice in machine learning to prevent overfitting and ensure that the model is not biased towards the training data.

Secondly, four out of the five study areas were used for learning and validation, while the last isolated scene was used as the test set. This isolated scene contained all the classes for the two nomenclatures, including the five land cover (LC) classes and the 12 land use (LU) classes, as well as various environments representing the New Caledonian landscape. This suggests that the test set was diverse and representative of the population, which helps to ensure the generalizability of the model.

However, there is no mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting in the provided context. Cross-validation is a technique where the model is trained and evaluated on multiple subsets of the data to ensure that the results are not biased towards a particular subset. Stratified splitting is a technique where the data is split into subsets based on the class labels to ensure that each subset has a representative proportion of each class. 

Therefore, while some measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model, it is not clear if cross-validation or stratified splitting were used.
