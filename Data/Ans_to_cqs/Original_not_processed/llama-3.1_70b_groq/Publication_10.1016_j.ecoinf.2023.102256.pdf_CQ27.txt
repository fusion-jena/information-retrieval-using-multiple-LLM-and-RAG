Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the baseline model, the incorporation of contextual information, and the training process. It does not provide information on model deployment, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
