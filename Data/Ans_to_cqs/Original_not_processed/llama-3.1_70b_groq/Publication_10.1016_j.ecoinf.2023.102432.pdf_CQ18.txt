Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of a 5 K-Folds approach. This is evident from the text, which mentions that "Each row is an iteration of the 5 K-Folds used with values only being used on the bags excluded from training" in the context of the confusion matrices for RapidEye and Landsat imagery using Random Forest. This suggests that the model is trained on 4 out of 5 folds and tested on the remaining fold, and this process is repeated 5 times, with each fold being used as the test set once. This allows for the evaluation of the model's performance on unseen data during training.
