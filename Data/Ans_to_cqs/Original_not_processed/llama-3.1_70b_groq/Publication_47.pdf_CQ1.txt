Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of herbarium specimens and occurrence records from biological collection databases, which suggests that the data may be collected from existing sources such as museums, herbaria, and online databases like GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility). 

Additionally, the context mentions the use of CoordinateCleaner, a tool for standardized cleaning of occurrence records from biological collection databases, which implies that the data may be collected from these databases and then cleaned and processed for use in the deep learning pipeline. 

It does not provide information on the use of surveys or sensors for collecting raw data.
