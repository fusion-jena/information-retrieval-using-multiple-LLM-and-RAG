Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention the use of performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC score to evaluate the model's performance. Additionally, it mentions the use of a confusion matrix and scatter plots to visualize the model's performance.

It can be inferred that the model's performance is monitored through the use of these metrics and visualizations, but the exact strategy or methodology used to monitor the performance during training is not specified in the provided context.
