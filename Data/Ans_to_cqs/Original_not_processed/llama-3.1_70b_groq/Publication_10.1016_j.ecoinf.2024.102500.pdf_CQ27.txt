Answer:::
I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. It discusses the use of the Lazy Predict algorithm for automated machine learning, the evaluation of models using R2 and RMSE, and the tuning of hyperparameters for specific models such as LGBM and GB. However, it does not provide information on the deployment process of the trained models.
