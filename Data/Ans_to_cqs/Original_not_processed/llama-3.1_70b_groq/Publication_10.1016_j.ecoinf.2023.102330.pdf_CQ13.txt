Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context mentions the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for acoustic detection of Northern Bobwhite calls, but it does not provide details on the model's architecture or hyperparameters. The context only mentions that the model was trained on spectrogram data and uses a score threshold of 0.95 for classification.
