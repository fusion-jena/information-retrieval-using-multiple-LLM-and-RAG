Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to redescription mining, a method that combines partitioning and modeling techniques to identify local patterns in data. It does not discuss deep learning pipelines or techniques for addressing data bias.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. If you have any further questions or context related to redescription mining, I would be happy to try and assist you.
