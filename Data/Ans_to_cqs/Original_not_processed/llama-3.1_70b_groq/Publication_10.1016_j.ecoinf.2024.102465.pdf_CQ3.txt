Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the study employs the HRNet model for semantic segmentation, which involves identifying and categorizing pixels in an image into different classes (e.g., green spaces, sky). 

The context also mentions that the study uses a pre-trained "ERNIE" model for sentiment analysis, but it does not provide information on the data annotation techniques used for this task.

Additionally, the context mentions that the study uses a combined LSTM-CNN-based sentiment analysis framework, but again, it does not provide information on the data annotation techniques used.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.
