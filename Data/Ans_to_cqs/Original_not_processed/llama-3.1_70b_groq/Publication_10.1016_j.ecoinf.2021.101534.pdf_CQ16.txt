Answer: According to the provided context, the criteria used to determine when training is complete is when the validation loss of the model reaches a plateau. Specifically, it is stated that "The validation loss of the model reached a plateau at the 42nd epoch, and the parameters were saved for inference." This suggests that the training process is stopped when the model's performance on the validation set stops improving, as indicated by the plateau in validation loss.
