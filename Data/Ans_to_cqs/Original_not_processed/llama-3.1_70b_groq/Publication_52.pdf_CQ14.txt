Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the ELM model are optimized. However, it does mention that unlike other sequential learning algorithms, OSELM only requires the number of hidden nodes to be specified. This suggests that the model may not require extensive hyperparameter tuning, but it does not provide information on the specific optimization method used.

It is mentioned that ELMs do not require fine manipulations to determine their operating parameters, which implies that the model may be relatively robust to hyperparameter choices. However, the context does not provide enough information to determine the specific optimization method used, such as grid search or random search.
