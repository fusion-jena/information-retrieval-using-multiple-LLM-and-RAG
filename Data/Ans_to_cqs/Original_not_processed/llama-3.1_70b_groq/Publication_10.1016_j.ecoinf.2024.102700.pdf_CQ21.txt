Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the model development process, including calibration and validation phases, and discusses various modeling approaches used in the examined articles.

However, it does mention that model processing involves both calibration and validation phases, where presence sites are divided into two independent samples: the "training" dataset, used to build the model, and the "testing" dataset, used to assess the model's efficiency with a subset of data not employed for calibration.

Additionally, the context mentions that the majority of model results consisted of species spatial predictions, and some studies conducted modeling solely for descriptive purposes. But it does not provide information on specific postprocessing steps involved after model training.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
