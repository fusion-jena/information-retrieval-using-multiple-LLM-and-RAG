Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be focused on machine learning models, particularly LightGBM, and their application to predicting canopy cover from planet data. It discusses the model's architecture, hyperparameters, and performance metrics, but does not delve into optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
