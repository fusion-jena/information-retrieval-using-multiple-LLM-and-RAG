Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does describe the Random Forest Regressor algorithm, which involves randomness in its process.

According to the context, the Random Forest Regressor algorithm involves drawing a bootstrap sample of the dataset and growing a decision tree from this sample. At each node, a random subset of features is selected, and the best split is determined based on these features. This process is repeated for each new node until a stopping criterion is met.

While this process involves randomness, the context does not provide information on how this randomness is handled or controlled, such as through the use of a random seed value. Therefore, I do not know the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
