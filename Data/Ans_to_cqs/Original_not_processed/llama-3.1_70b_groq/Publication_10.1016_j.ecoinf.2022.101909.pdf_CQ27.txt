Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and training of the model, including the use of transfer learning and fine-tuning with ResNet50, but it does not provide information on the deployment process.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question, as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
