Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the training process was performed for a number of iterations until the loss function reached its minimum value. This suggests that the model's performance was monitored through the loss function, and the training process was stopped when the loss function converged.

Additionally, it is mentioned that the model score reached its maximum after approximately 5000 iterations. This implies that the model's performance was also monitored through the model score, which is likely a measure of the model's accuracy or goodness of fit.

However, the specific strategy or metric used to monitor the model's performance during training is not clearly stated. It is only mentioned that the model's performance was compared to a random forest regression model using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), bias, and correlation.
