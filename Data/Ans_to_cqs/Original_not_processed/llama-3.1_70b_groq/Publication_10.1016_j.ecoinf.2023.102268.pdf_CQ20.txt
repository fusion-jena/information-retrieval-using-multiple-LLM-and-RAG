Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It only mentions the use of a ResNet-50 deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, but does not provide information on the computational resources or hardware used for training the model.
