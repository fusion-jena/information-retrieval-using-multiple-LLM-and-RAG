Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper or article discussing the optimization of a convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning model for a specific task, but it does not provide information about the datasets used. The context mentions feature extraction parameters, model optimization, and performance metrics, but it does not mention any specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
