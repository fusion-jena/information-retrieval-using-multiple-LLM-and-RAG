Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context primarily focuses on the model architecture, training parameters, and evaluation metrics used for object detection tasks. It does not provide information on data splitting or partitioning.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to split the data into training, validation, and testing sets. A typical split is 80% for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing. But without explicit information, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.

If you're looking for general information on data splitting, I can provide some general guidelines. But if you're looking for specific information related to the context provided, I would say that the information is not available.
