Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context appears to be focused on the performance of the model, including its accuracy and improvement rate, but does not provide information on the methods used to ensure generalizability. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
