Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, it does mention the use of a confusion matrix to evaluate the performance of the models. Specifically, it mentions that "Figs. 4 and 5 show the confusion matrix of classification of plant diseases by the ensemble model and by EfficientNetB3 respectively." This suggests that the confusion matrix is one of the postprocessing steps used to evaluate the performance of the models.

Additionally, the context mentions the calculation of performance metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall. This implies that these metrics are calculated as part of the postprocessing steps to evaluate the performance of the models.

There is no mention of saliency maps or any other postprocessing steps in the provided context. Therefore, the answer to the query is that the postprocessing steps involved after model training include the calculation of performance metrics (accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall) and the creation of a confusion matrix.
