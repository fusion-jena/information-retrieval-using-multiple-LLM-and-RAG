Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the architecture and components of a deep learning model, such as the SPPF module, neck network, and detection head, but does not discuss data preprocessing or bias mitigation techniques.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. If you have any additional context or information, I would be happy to try and assist you further.
