Answer: The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer. The context actually discusses a Random Forest (RF) regression algorithm and its hyperparameters, which are 'numberOfTrees', 'minLeafPopulation', 'bagFraction', and 'seed'. The optimal values for these hyperparameters were determined through a grid search approach, and the winning parameters are: numberOfTrees: 150, minLeafPopulation: 3, bagFraction: 1, and seed: 123.
