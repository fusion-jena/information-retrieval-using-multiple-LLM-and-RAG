Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as the proportion of explained variance, correlation coefficients, and the root mean square error (RMSE).

Additionally, the context mentions that the model was trained using a random forest (RF) algorithm, and the performance was evaluated using a 10-fold cross-validation approach. The results of the cross-validation are presented in Table 5, which shows the RMSE and R2 values for each fold, as well as the mean values.

It can also be noted that the model's performance was evaluated using an independent test dataset, which is mentioned in the context as "independent test data were used in the RF model for 10-fold cross-validation". This suggests that the model's performance was evaluated on unseen data to assess its generalization ability.

However, the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model's performance during training, such as early stopping or learning rate scheduling, is not mentioned in the provided context.
