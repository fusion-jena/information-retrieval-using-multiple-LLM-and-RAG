Answer: 
The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification, specifically species identification of pollen. The model is trained on a large dataset of microscopic images of pollen grains to classify them into different species. The model uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, specifically an inception network architecture, to analyze the images and make predictions about the species of the pollen grain.
