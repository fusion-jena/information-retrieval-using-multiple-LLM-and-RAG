Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the purpose of a deep learning model. However, based on the references provided, it can be inferred that some of the papers discuss the application of deep learning models for classification tasks. For example, the paper by Zhong et al. (2019) discusses the use of deep learning for multi-temporal crop classification, and the paper by Zhu et al. (2022) discusses the identification of soybean based on Sentinel-1/2 SAR and MSI imagery.

Additionally, the context mentions other machine learning models such as MLC (Bayesian classification), SVM, ANN, and RF, which are used for classification tasks. However, it does not provide information on the specific purpose of a deep learning model.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that deep learning models are likely used for classification tasks, but the exact purpose is not explicitly stated.
