Answer: CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). According to the provided context, the researchers used pre-trained CNNs, specifically the BirdNET model, which is a CNN trained on audio data of bird vocalizations. They also compared its performance with other models such as VGGish and Wav2Vec 2.0, but the specific architecture of the pipeline used is a CNN.
