Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context primarily discusses the workflow, data processing, and FAIR data principles, but it does not delve into the details of deep learning model training. Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this case.
