Answer:::
The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is RGB images. According to the text, pre-trained CNNs, such as VGG16, expect images in a certain format before feature extraction or classification. Specifically, RGB images must be 224 Ã— 224 pixels, and the RGB values are normalized (centered and scaled) to the training dataset (ImageNet). The images are resized to 224 pixels along the x-axis, preserving their aspect ratio, and then cropped to be square. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
