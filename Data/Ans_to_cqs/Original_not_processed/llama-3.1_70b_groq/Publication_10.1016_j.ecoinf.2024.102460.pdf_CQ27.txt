Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context mainly discusses the use of a deep learning time series forecasting model (LSTM) in conjunction with other models (PLUS and FMOP) for land use/cover change analysis, but it does not provide information on the deployment process of the trained model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
