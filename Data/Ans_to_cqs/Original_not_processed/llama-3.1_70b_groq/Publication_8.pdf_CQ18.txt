Answer: 
The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention that the model was trained again on all the annotated scans earlier and tested on a different un-annotated dataset. The model's performance was evaluated based on visual inspection and later using an average precision metric after annotating around 200 scans by hand. This suggests that the model's performance was evaluated after training, but the specific strategy used to monitor its performance during training is not mentioned.
