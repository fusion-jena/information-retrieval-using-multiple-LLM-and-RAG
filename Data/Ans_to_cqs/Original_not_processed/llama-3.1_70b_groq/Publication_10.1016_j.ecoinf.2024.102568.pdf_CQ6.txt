Answer: According to the provided context, before training a deep learning model, specifically an LSTM model, the training set is pre-processed using a MinMaxScaler. This scaler transforms each feature by scaling it to a [0â€“1] range. This is the only preprocessing step mentioned in the context. There is no mention of normalization, cleaning, or other preprocessing steps.
