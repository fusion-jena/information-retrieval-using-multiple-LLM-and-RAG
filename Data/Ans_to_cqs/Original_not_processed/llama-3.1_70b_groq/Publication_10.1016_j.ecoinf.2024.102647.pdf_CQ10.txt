Answer: I don't know.

The provided context appears to be a research paper or article related to ecological informatics, and it does not contain any information about a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. The text includes citations, references, and tables with data, but it does not mention a specific code repository or provide a link to one. Therefore, I am unable to provide a link to a code repository.
