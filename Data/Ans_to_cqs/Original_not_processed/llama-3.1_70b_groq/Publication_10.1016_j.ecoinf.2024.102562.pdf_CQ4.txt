Answer:::

The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include:

* Flipping: flipping in horizontal and vertical directions
* Rotating: rotations
* Affine transformation: affine transformation
* Multiply: multiply
* Linear contrast: linear contrast
* Sharpen: sharpen
* Emboss: emboss

These techniques were used for heavy augmentation in the ResNet-101 network, which was trained for 500 epochs. The selection of image augmentations is crucial for improving training performance.
