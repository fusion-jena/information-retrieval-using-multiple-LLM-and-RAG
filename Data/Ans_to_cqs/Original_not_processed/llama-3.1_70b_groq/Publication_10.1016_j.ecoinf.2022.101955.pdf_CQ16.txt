Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be focused on the accuracy assessment of kNN and RF classification models for land use and land cover (LULC) classification, and it discusses the overall accuracy, producer's accuracy, and Kappa statistics for different LULC classes. However, it does not provide information on the training process or the criteria used to determine when training is complete. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
