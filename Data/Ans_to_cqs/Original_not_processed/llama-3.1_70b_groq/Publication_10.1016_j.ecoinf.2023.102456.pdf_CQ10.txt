Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper discussing a model for simulating forest fires using cellular automata and machine learning. The text mentions various references and citations, but does not provide a link to a code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
