Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the convolutional neural network (CNN), is to perform the automatic task of detection and identification of 18 classes, which in this context refers to bird species. The model is designed to analyze recordings and identify the species present in the recordings. This is an example of classification, where the model is trained to assign a label (species) to a given input (recording).
