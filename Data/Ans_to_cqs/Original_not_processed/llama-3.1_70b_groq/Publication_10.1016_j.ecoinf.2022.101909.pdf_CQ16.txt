Answer: The criteria used to determine when training is complete is the early stopping method with a patience equal to 5, which is used to avoid overfitting. This means that the training process stops when the model's performance on the validation subset does not improve for 5 consecutive epochs. Additionally, the model was trained for a maximum of 50 epochs, but it achieved optimal training at the end of the 9th epoch, reaching a maximum loss of 3 for the training subset and 4.5Ã—10^(-4) for the validation subset.
