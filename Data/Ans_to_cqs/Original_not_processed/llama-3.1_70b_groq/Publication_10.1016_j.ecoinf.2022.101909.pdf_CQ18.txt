Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the early stopping method with a patience of 5. This means that the training process is stopped when the model's performance on the validation subset does not improve for 5 consecutive epochs, in order to avoid overfitting. Additionally, the model's performance is evaluated using the loss function, with a maximum loss of 3 for the training subset and 4.5Ã—10^(-4) for the validation subset. The model is trained for a maximum of 50 epochs, but the optimal training is achieved at the end of the 9th epoch.
