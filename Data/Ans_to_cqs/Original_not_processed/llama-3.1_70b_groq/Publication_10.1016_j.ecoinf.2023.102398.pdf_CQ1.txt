Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the training and testing of a deep learning model, specifically a YOLOv5 model with an attention mechanism, and provides information on the model's architecture, hyperparameters, and performance metrics. However, it does not discuss data collection methods.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
