Answer:::

I don't know. The provided context does not mention deep learning pipelines or strategies for handling randomness in such pipelines. The text appears to be focused on data filtering, ecological research, and remote sensing, with a specific mention of using a Random Forests variant (Boruta) for feature selection. However, this is not related to handling randomness in deep learning pipelines.
