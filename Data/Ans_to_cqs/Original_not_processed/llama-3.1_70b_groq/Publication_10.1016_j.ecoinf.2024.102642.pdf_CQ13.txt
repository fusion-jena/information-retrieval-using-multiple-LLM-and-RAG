Answer:::

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows:

* Batch sizes: 5 for SEIO PBW vocalization training and 4 for blue whale Dcall training
* Learning rates: 1e-4 for SEIO PBW vocalization training and 1e-3 for blue whale Dcall training
* Number of epochs: 40 for SEIO PBW vocalization training and 25 for blue whale Dcall training
* Early stopping method: used to prevent overfitting, with a patience parameter set at 10 epochs for all training phases

Note that the optimizer used is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
