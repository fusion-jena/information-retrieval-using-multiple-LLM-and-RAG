Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deep learning pipelines, regularization methods, or techniques to prevent overfitting such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be related to a different topic, possibly involving thaw depth and moisture modeling. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide an answer to the query.
