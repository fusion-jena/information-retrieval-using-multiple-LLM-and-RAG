Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does mention the importance of developing automated classification routines that are accurate, efficient, and cost-effective.

In the context of acoustic data analysis, particularly in the field of bioacoustics, common metrics used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics are often used to assess the model's ability to correctly classify acoustic signals, such as echolocation clicks or whale calls.

For example, in the paper "Classification of Rissoâ€™s and Pacific white-sided dolphins using spectral properties of echolocation clicks" (Soldevilla et al., 2008), the authors use accuracy and classification rates to evaluate the performance of their model. Similarly, in the paper "Computational bioacoustics with deep learning: a review and roadmap" (Stowell, 2022), the author mentions the use of metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the performance of deep learning models in bioacoustic classification tasks.

However, without more specific information, it is difficult to determine which metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in the provided context.
