Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context primarily discusses the hyperparameters and configurations used for Random Forest (RF) and other machine learning models, but it does not provide information on data splitting criteria for deep learning model training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
