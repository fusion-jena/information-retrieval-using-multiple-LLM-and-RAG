Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for bioacoustics applications. However, it does mention some challenges related to collecting clean data, such as the infeasibility of collecting clean recordings in many cases or the need to record captive animals, which may not be representative of the wider population.

It also mentions that collecting clean data is a challenge, and noise profiles are often superimposed on clean data to provide both the input data and a "denoised" ground truth. However, it does not provide information on the specific methods used for collecting the clean data or the noise profiles.

Therefore, I don't know the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for bioacoustics applications, and I cannot provide a more detailed answer.
