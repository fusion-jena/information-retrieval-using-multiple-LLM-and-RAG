Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about training a deep learning model or the hardware resources used for it. The context appears to be related to remote sensing, forestry, and biomass estimation using Sentinel-2 data and GEDI lidar mission. It discusses the use of spectral values from Sentinel-2 bands, bilinear interpolation, and regression models for estimating above-ground biomass density, but it does not mention deep learning models or hardware resources.
