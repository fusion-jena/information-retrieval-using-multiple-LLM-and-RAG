Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided pieces of context do not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context appears to focus on various applications of deep learning and machine learning, including time-series prediction, intrusion detection, and air pollution forecasting.

However, I can provide some general information on handling randomness in deep learning pipelines. In deep learning, randomness can arise from various sources, including weight initialization, dropout, and data shuffling. To handle this randomness, researchers and practitioners often employ techniques such as:

1. Setting a random seed value: This ensures that the random number generator produces the same sequence of numbers, allowing for reproducibility of results.
2. Using deterministic algorithms: Some deep learning algorithms, such as those using recurrent neural networks, can be designed to be deterministic, eliminating the need for random number generation.
3. Averaging multiple runs: Running the same experiment multiple times with different random seeds and averaging the results can help reduce the impact of randomness.

It is essential to note that these strategies are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. If you are looking for specific information on handling randomness in deep learning pipelines, I recommend consulting additional resources or research papers on the topic.
