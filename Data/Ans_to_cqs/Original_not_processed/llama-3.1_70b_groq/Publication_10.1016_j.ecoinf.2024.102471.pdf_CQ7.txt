Answer:

The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, specifically for the Wav2Vec model, are based on various ratios of training and testing data. According to the provided context, the dataset is split into training and testing sets in the following ratios: 70:30, 80:20, and 90:10. These ratios indicate the proportion of data used for training and testing, respectively.

For example, a 70:30 split means that 70% of the data is used for training, and the remaining 30% is used for testing. Similarly, an 80:20 split means that 80% of the data is used for training, and 20% is used for testing. The 90:10 split is also used, where 90% of the data is used for training, and 10% is used for testing.

The context does not mention a separate validation set, which is often used in deep learning to evaluate the model's performance during training and adjust hyperparameters. However, it does mention that the model is fine-tuned on the labelled dataset, which suggests that the testing set may be used for evaluation purposes.

It's worth noting that the choice of split ratio may depend on the specific problem, dataset, and model architecture. The context suggests that the 90:10 split ratio yields the best results for the Wav2Vec model, but this may not be the case for other models or datasets.
