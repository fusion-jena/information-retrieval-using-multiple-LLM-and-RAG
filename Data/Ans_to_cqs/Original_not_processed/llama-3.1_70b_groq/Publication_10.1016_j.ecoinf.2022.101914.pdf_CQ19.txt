Answer: I don't know. The provided context does not mention the use of deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. It mentions the use of the biomod2 package in R to build models, but it does not provide information on the specific frameworks used for deep learning. The context only mentions the use of machine learning models such as Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Maximum Entropy software (MaxEnt), but it does not provide details on the frameworks used to implement these models.
