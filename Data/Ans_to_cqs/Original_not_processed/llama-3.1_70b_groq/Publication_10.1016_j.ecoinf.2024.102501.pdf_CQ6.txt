Answer: According to the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include normalization. The normalization formula is expressed in Eq. (1), which is used to reduce the impact of large differences in dimension and magnitude values of various parameters. The formula is:

′ =

Yi

Yi (cid:0) Ymin
Ymax (cid:0) Ymin

where Yi is the i-th sample value, Ymax is the maximum value, Ymin is the minimum value, and Yi′ is the normalized value of the i-th sample.

Additionally, a standardization formula is also mentioned, which is expressed in Eq. (2):

Xi

* =

Xi (cid:0) X
Xs

However, the context does not provide further details on the specific standardization technique used.

It is also mentioned that the data does not exhibit regularity and has large differences in dimension and magnitude values of various parameters, which would lead to problems such as substantial noise interference, large fluctuations, strong concealment, and difficulty in data handling. Therefore, normalization is used to address these issues.

There is no mention of other preprocessing steps such as scaling or cleaning in the provided context.
