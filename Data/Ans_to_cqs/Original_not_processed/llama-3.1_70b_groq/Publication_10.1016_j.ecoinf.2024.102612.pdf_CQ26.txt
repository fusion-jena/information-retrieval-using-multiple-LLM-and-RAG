Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the deep learning model, the training process, and the application of the model to retrieve fuel models from multispectral LiDAR data.

However, it does mention that the mean counterparts of the evaluation metrics (MA and MIoU) are used to consider the individual values for each class within the dataset and compute their average, which enhances the reliability of the classification results for imbalanced data. This suggests that the authors are aware of the potential issue of imbalanced data, but the specific techniques used to address it are not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not know the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection.
