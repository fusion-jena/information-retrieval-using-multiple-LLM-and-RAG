Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be related to remote sensing and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data analysis, but it does not discuss deep learning model training or data splitting criteria.

However, I can provide some general information on common practices for splitting data for deep learning model training. Typically, the data is split into three parts: training, validation, and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to evaluate the model's performance during training and tune hyperparameters, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final model's performance.

The criteria for splitting the data can vary depending on the specific problem and dataset, but common practices include:

* Random splitting: splitting the data randomly into training, validation, and testing sets
* Stratified splitting: splitting the data into training, validation, and testing sets while maintaining the same class distribution as the original dataset
* Time-based splitting: splitting the data into training, validation, and testing sets based on time, such as using historical data for training and more recent data for testing

However, without more specific information, I cannot provide a more detailed answer to the query.
