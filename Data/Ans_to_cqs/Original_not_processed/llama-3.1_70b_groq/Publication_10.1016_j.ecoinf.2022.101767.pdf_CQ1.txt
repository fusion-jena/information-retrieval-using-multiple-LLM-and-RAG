Answer:

Based on the provided context, it appears that online shared videos are utilized as a method for collecting raw data, specifically for analyzing species richness and ecosystem services. The context mentions "online shared videos that contain a wide range of species richness" and "videos used in this study" which suggests that videos are being used as a data source. 

Additionally, the context mentions that this method can "reflect more of the benefit from ecosystems than those based on questionnaires, surveys, or interviews", implying that traditional survey-based methods are not being used in this particular study. 

However, it does not provide information on the use of sensors or public datasets as methods for collecting raw data. Therefore, the answer is limited to online shared videos as a method for collecting raw data.
