Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention "data augmentation" in the context of environmental sound classification (Salamon J, Bello JP. Deep convolutional neural networks and data augmentation for environmental sound classification. arXiv preprint arXiv:160804363. 2016.). Data augmentation is a technique used to artificially increase the size of a training dataset by applying transformations to the existing data, which can help to reduce data bias.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of citizen science data, which can be prone to bias. The paper by Kosmala M, Wiggins A, Swanson A, Simmons B (Assessing data quality in citizen science. Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment. 2016; 14(10):551â€“60.) discusses the importance of assessing data quality in citizen science, but it does not provide specific techniques for addressing data bias.

The other techniques mentioned in the query, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling, are not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, it is not possible to confirm whether these techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline based on the provided information.

In summary, the only technique mentioned in the context that could potentially be used to address data bias is data augmentation. However, the context does not provide a comprehensive overview of techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
