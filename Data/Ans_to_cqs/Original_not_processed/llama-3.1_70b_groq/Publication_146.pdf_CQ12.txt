Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically YoloV3, which is a real-time object detection system. This is evident from the text, which mentions "YoloV3" and "convolutional neural networks" as the model used for object detection. Additionally, the text mentions the use of hyperparameters similar to those used in the Yolo model, further confirming the use of a YoloV3 CNN.
