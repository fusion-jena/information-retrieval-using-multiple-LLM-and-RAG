Answer:

The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training is based on the sticky plate level. According to the context, individual insects that belonged to the same sticky plate image were kept together in the same dataset (training, validation, or testing). This means that the data is split in a way that ensures that all images from the same sticky plate are either in the training, validation, or testing set, but not distributed across multiple sets. This approach allows for a more practice-oriented validation of the model's performance, as it emulates the way the model will be used in real-world applications, where it will be predicting classes for objects on unseen sticky plate images.
