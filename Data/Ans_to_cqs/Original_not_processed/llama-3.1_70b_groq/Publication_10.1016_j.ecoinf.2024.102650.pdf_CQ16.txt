Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be related to topic modeling and social network analysis, specifically using the pyLDAvis library for clustering and visualizing topics in tweets. It provides equations for calculating perplexity and topic intensity, but does not discuss training completion criteria.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
