Answer: Unfortunately, the provided pieces of context do not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and training of deep neural networks, such as VGG and ResNet, and their application to image classification tasks. It also discusses the use of data augmentation techniques, such as horizontal flipping, to avoid overfitting and imbalanced problems. However, it does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
