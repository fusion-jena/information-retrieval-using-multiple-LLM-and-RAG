Answer: 
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. It only mentions that a deep learning approach (convolutional neural networks) was used to derive the high-resolution CHM of the Earth (Lang10m) at 10 m resolution using Sentinel-2 optical images. The context does not provide information on the specific framework used, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
