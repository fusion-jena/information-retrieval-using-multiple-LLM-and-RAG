Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. However, it does mention the use of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as the training method, which has a certain randomness and results in a slight difference in training time.

It can be inferred that the randomness in the SGD method might lead to variations in the training process, but the context does not provide information on how this randomness is handled or controlled. The use of random initialization parameters in the zero-start training mode is also mentioned, but no specific strategies for handling randomness are discussed.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a detailed answer to the query.
