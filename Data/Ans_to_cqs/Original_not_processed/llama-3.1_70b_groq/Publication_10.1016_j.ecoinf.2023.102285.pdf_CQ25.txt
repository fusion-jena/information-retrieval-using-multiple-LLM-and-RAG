Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the context is detection and classification of man-made underwater objects (MMOs) and surface marine MMOs. Specifically, the model proposed by Abu et al. (2022) uses a contour-based features analysis method to discern underwater MMOs from natural environment. Another model, LCSE-ResNet, proposed by Han et al. (2022), is used to detect, classify, and locate vessels and oil platforms based on remote optical imagery. Additionally, the context mentions a model that can detect human activity types from 3D posture data using deep learning models (Çalıs¸kan, 2023). However, the specific purpose of the model mentioned in the query is not explicitly stated, but based on the context, it can be inferred that it is likely used for detection and classification tasks.
