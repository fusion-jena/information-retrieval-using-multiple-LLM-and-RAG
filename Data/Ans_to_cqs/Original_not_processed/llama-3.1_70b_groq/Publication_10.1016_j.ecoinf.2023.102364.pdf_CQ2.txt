Answer: 
The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it appears that the study utilizes a combination of geographic information system (GIS) data, socio-economic U.S. Census data, and field-based data collection. The context mentions the use of "open-access predictor layers" and "68 open-access predictor layers", which suggests that the data may be in a format compatible with GIS systems, such as shapefiles or GeoTIFFs. Additionally, the mention of "U.S. Census data" implies that the data may be in a tabular format, such as CSV. However, without further information, it is unclear what specific data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline.
