Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on fine-tuning a pre-trained CNN backbone, comparative analysis of CNN backbones, and the importance of fine-tuning for improving clustering quality. It does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
