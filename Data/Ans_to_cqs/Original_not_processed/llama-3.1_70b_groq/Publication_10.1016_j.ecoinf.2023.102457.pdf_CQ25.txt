Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification, specifically for individual acoustic discrimination of animal populations, such as bird species and gibbons. The models, including BirdNET, VGGish, and Wav2Vec 2.0, are used to extract embeddings from audio recordings and classify them into specific species or individuals. The goal is to overcome the current challenges in using Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) for individual acoustic discrimination and achieve sustained and non-invasive monitoring of animal populations.
