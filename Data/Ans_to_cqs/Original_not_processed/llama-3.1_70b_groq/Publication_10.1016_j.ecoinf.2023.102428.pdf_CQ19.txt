Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The text only mentions the use of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) algorithm and Markov chain in the MLPnn-MC modeling approach, but it does not provide information on the frameworks used to implement this approach. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
