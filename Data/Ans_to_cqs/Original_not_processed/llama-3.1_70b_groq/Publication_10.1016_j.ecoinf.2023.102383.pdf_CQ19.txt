Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models. The context discusses various deep learning models, such as ResNet, FPN, and YOLOv4, but it does not provide information about the frameworks used to implement these models. Therefore, I do not know which frameworks are used to build the deep learning models mentioned in the context.
