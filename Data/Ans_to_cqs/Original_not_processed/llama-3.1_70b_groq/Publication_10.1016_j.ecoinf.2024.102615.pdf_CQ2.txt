Answer: 
The provided context does not explicitly mention the data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the mention of "spectral reflectance data" and "4200 dimensions of the spectral reflectance data" in the input layer, it can be inferred that the data format is likely a numerical or spectral data format, possibly in a CSV or similar format. There is no indication of image, audio, or video data being used in the pipeline.
