Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be related to a recording campaign for goat vocalizations, data collection, and annotation, as well as a system for detecting and classifying events. However, it does not provide information on the training process or the criteria used to determine its completion. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
