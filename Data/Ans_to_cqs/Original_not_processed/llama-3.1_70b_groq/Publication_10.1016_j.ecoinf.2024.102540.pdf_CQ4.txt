Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The text only discusses the dataset splitting ratio, characteristics of deep learning models, hyperparameters, and training aspects, but does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
