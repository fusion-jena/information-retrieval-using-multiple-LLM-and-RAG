Answer: Mask R-CNN and ResNet-101. According to the text, the researchers demonstrated the applicability of an interdisciplinary approach combining microfluidics and AI in microbial ecology research using a widely used model, Mask R-CNN. Additionally, they also trained the same dataset with ResNet-101 network with heavier augmentation for 500 epochs.
