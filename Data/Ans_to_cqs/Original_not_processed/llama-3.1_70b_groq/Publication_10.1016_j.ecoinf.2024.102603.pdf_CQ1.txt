Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the differences between deep learning models and XGBoost, as well as the challenges and limitations of each approach. It also touches on the topic of vegetation index extraction and the use of satellite instruments for collecting data.

However, it can be inferred that satellite instruments such as TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (SENTINEL-5P TROPOMI), SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartog-raphY (ENVISAT SCIAMACHY), Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment 2 (GOME-2), Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT), and Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) are used for collecting data. These instruments are mentioned in the context of collecting data for SIF retrievals, but it is not explicitly stated whether this data is used for deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, while we can infer that satellite instruments are used for collecting data, we cannot provide a definitive answer to the query without more information.
