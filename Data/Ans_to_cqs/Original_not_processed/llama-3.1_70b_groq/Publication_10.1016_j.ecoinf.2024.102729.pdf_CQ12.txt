Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It mentions the use of machine learning algorithms and models, such as Random Forest and Generalized Additive models, but it does not provide information about the specific type of deep learning model used. The context also mentions the use of maximal information coefficient (MIC) analysis and clustering algorithms, but it does not provide information about the specific type of deep learning model used. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
