Answer:::

The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline are:

* Adding Gaussian noise in the range 0 (cid:0) 255*0.2: This technique was used to create more low-resolution resembling images that users might upload. Two augmentations of this type were performed with different choices in the specified range.
* Sea waves distortion with alpha = 50 and sigma = 9: This technique was used to create more images where sea waves effect is reflected.
* Blurring effect in the range (0.75, 1.5): This technique was used to create more unclear images, as some of the original images were. Two augmentations of this type were performed with different choices in the specified range.

Note that rotations were examined for handling different poses, but they are not included in the list of data augmentation techniques mentioned above. Also, flipping and scaling are not mentioned as data augmentation techniques used in the pipeline.
