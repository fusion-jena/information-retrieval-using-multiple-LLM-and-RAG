Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the use of embeddings, dimensionality reduction, and active learning for improving model performance, particularly in the context of bird species classification.

However, it does mention the use of "rich labels" associated with the NIPS4Bplus dataset and "automatic detailed labels" generated with a noise filtering algorithm for the BirdCLEF 2020 dataset. This suggests that some form of annotation is being used, but the specific techniques are not specified.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
