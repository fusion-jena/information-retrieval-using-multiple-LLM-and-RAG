Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the dataset used by R. Mohanty et al. (Mohanty et al., 2020) contains vocalizations of 14 different bird species, recorded by the Central Poultry Development Organization (CPDO) in Bhubaneswar, India, using a digital recorder and a unidirectional microphone. This suggests that audio recordings can be one method of collecting raw data for deep learning models, particularly those related to audio classification tasks such as bird species identification.

Additionally, the context mentions that Wav2vec, a state-of-the-art model for Automatic Speech Recognition, can be pre-trained on unlabelled data, which is more accessible. This implies that public datasets or large collections of audio data can be used for collecting raw data for deep learning models.

However, the context does not provide information on other methods such as surveys or sensors being used for collecting raw data. Therefore, based on the provided context, the answer to the query is limited to audio recordings and public datasets.
