Answer:

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows:

* Learning rate: The model uses a one-cycle learning rate policy with a minimum learning rate of 0.000001 and a maximum learning rate of 0.001 (Smith, 2018).
* Optimizer: The model uses the Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014).
* Architecture: The model uses the ResNet50 architecture (He et al., 2016).
* Epochs: The model was trained for 55 epochs.

Note that the text also mentions that the authors explored different hyperparameters and chose the ones that gave the best results for training the final model, but it does not provide further details on the specific hyperparameters that were explored.
