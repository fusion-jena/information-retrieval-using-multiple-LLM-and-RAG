Answer: 
The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of popular deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention the use of a dataset from iNaturalist, which is a citizen science project that provides a large collection of plant photographs. The context also mentions the use of bioclimatic data from Worldclim. 

It appears that the authors have used a custom dataset, possibly created from the iNaturalist plant photograph database, and combined it with bioclimatic data to train their deep learning models. The specific details of the dataset, such as its size and composition, are not provided in the given context.
