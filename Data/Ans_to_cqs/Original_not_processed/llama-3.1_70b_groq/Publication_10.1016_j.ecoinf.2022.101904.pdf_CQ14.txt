Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the architecture of the model, the cost of computation in terms of time, and the impact of data split on the final accuracy of wetland mapping, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
