Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of a pre-trained ResNet-50 convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify spectrogram images, and the use of a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to identify the optimal decision boundary. It does not provide information on the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
