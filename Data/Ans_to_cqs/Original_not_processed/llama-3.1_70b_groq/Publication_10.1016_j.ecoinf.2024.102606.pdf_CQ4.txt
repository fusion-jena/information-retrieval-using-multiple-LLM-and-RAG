Answer:::

The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline are:

1. Random crop
2. Mosaic
3. Color distortions, including:
	* Brightness
	* Contrast
	* Saturation
	* Hue
	* Gaussian blur
4. Random scaling
5. Random rotation
6. Random horizontal flipping

These techniques are used to artificially increase the size of the dataset by creating new samples from the existing ones, which helps to improve the model's ability to generalize and its accuracy on the test dataset.
