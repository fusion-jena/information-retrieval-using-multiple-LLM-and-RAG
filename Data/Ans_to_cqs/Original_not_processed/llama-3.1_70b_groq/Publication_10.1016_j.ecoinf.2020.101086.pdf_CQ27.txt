Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a trained deep learning model, nor does it discuss model serialization or platform selection. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling (SDM) and the effects of sampling bias and sample size on the performance of SDMs. It includes references to research papers and authors, but does not provide information on the deployment of deep learning models.
