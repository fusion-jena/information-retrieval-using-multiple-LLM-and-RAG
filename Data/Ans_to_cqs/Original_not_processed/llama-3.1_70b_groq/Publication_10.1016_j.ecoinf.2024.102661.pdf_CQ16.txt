Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that the model undergoes a training process comprising 10,000 iterations, during which the model logs the chosen hyperparameter combinations, associated training times, and loss values. This suggests that the training process is completed after a fixed number of iterations, rather than being based on a specific stopping criterion such as a validation loss plateau.
