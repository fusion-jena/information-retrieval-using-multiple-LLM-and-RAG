Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the analysis and modeling of drought propagation using a CNN-LSTM hybrid model, rather than data collection. It mentions the use of a comprehensive dataset, but does not provide information on how the data was collected. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
