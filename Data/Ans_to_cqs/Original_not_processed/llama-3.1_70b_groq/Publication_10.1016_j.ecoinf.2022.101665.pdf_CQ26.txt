Answer:

The provided context does not specifically discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some sampling methods that can be used to collect data or split existing data into training and testing sets.

The context mentions stratified sampling as a method used to produce a moderately clustered sample. This involves dividing the study area into compact geo-strata and randomly selecting a subset of these strata to form a sample. This method can help ensure that the sample is representative of the population and reduce bias.

The context also mentions simple random sampling, which involves randomly selecting samples from the population. However, it notes that this method is not always feasible, especially when data availability is limited.

Additionally, the context mentions that the sample datasets used for mapping environmental variables are often amalgamations of several datasets, each with its own formal or opportunistic sampling design. This can make it difficult to use design-based inference methods to address bias.

The context does not mention oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection as techniques used to address data bias. It also does not specifically discuss deep learning pipelines or preprocessing techniques.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the only technique mentioned that can be used to address data bias is stratified sampling. However, it is likely that other techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection may be used in other contexts to address data bias, but these are not discussed in the provided context.
