Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the methods utilized for collecting raw data in this study involve a combination of field sampling and remote sensing image data. 

For field sampling, a Phoenix receiver was used to determine sample locations, and three five-cm-diameter cores of 15-cm length were taken at each location. These cores were then blended to obtain a representative sample of the soil at that site. A total of 300 representative soil samples were collected.

For remote sensing image data, the Landsat 8 OLI and TIRS bands (Band 4, 3, and 2) of 30-m resolution were used, which were accessed on April 21, 2023, from Google Earth Engine (GEE). The remote sensing image data were pre-processed, including geometric, radiometric, and image mosaicking, and cropping. 

There is no mention of surveys or public datasets being used for collecting raw data in this study.
