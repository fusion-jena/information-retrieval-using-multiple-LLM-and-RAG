Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily discusses the use of deep learning methods, including convolutional neural networks (CNN), autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks (GAN), for generating synthetic data and modeling complex patterns. It also mentions the use of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model for developing an initial coral cover model.

However, it does not provide information on the specific regularization techniques used to prevent overfitting in these models. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to this question.
