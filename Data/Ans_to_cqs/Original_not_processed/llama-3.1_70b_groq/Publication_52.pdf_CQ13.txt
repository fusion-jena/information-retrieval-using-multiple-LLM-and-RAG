Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate and optimizer. However, it does mention that Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) do not require fine manipulations to determine their operating parameters and do not address known neural network problems such as stopping criterion, learning rate, and learning epochs. This suggests that ELMs may not use traditional hyperparameters like learning rate in the same way as other deep learning models. Unfortunately, the specific hyperparameters used in the model are not mentioned in the provided context.
