Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it does mention the use of various machine learning models such as random forest (RF), Multilayer perceptron (MLP), long-short term memory (LSTM), and support vector regression (SVR) for predicting algal-related parameters. 

Among these, LSTM is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), which is a deep learning model. Additionally, the context mentions the use of deep learning with Bayesian approximation for uncertainty assessment in predicting chlorophyll-a as an indicator of harmful algal blooms. 

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline, it does suggest the use of RNN (specifically LSTM) and possibly other deep learning models.
