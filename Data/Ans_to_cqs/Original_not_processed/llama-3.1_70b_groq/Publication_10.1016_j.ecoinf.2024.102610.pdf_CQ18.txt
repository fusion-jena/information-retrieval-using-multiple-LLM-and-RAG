Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as a termination condition in the Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) technique. This approach allows the algorithm to iteratively remove variables while evaluating their impact on the model's performance, stopping when the best predefined level of model performance is reached.
