Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to focus on hyperparameter tuning and optimization for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using a proposed approach, but it does not discuss data splitting or provide information on the train-test-validation split ratios or criteria. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
