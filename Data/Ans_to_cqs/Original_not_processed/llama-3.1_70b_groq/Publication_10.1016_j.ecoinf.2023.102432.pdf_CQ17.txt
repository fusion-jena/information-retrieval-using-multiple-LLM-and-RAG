Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be focused on the challenges of using machine learning algorithms for ecology and conservation applications, particularly in the context of invasive species detection using remote sensing imagery. It discusses the limitations of traditional machine learning approaches and the potential benefits of using a multiple-instance learning algorithm, such as MTMI-SMF, to handle imperfect or variable training data. However, it does not provide information on regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines.
