Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the MegaDetector model, is object detection. It produces bounding boxes around animals, people, and vehicles in remote camera imagery. The model is used to automate or accelerate the labor-intensive process of labeling (i.e., tagging) photos in wildlife monitoring. The goal is to evaluate the effects of the model's performance on tagging efficiency and assess its overall utility in accelerating the data labeling process.
