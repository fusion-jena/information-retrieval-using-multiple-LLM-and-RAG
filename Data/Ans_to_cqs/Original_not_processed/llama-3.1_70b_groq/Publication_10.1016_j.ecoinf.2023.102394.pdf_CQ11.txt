Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The references listed appear to be academic papers and software packages related to deep learning, ecology, and soil science, but none of them seem to point to a specific data repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other data repository.
