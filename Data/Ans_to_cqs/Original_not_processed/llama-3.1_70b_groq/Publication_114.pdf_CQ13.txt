Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context only discusses the performance of different deep learning algorithms (VGG16, ResNet50, and AlexNet) and their classification accuracies, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameters used to train these models.
