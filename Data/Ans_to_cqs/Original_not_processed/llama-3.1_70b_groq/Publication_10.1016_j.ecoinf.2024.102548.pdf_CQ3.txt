Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the deep learning techniques used, including RNNs, transfer learning, and various pre-trained models like ResNet-50, InceptionV3, and InceptionResNetV2. It also mentions data augmentation as a technique used to enhance the performance and generalization capability of the deep learning models, but it does not provide details on the annotation techniques employed. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
