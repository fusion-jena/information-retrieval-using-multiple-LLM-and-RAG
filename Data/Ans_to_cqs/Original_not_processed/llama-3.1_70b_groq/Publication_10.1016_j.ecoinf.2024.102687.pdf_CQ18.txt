Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The text discusses the training process, including the use of the Adam optimizer, the number of epochs, and the episodic tasks, but it does not provide information on how the model's performance was monitored or evaluated during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
