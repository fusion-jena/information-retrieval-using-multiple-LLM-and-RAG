Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention that the best model (with the smallest RMSE) is selected to estimate AGB for the entire study area, and that this model is also interpreted to understand better what operates inside the ‘black box’ (Section 2, Data and methods). Additionally, Section 3.2 mentions "Model explainability", but the details of the postprocessing steps are not provided.

Therefore, I can only confirm that model interpretation and explainability are part of the workflow, but I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix.
