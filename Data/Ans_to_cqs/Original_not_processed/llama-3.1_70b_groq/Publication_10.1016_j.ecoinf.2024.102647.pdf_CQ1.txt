Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to groundwater resources, land use, and environmental studies, with various tables and references to research papers. However, it does not provide information on the specific methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline.

That being said, based on general knowledge, common methods for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline may include:

* Surveys: Collecting data through questionnaires, interviews, or other forms of human feedback.
* Sensors: Using physical sensors to collect data from the environment, such as temperature, humidity, or image data.
* Public datasets: Utilizing existing datasets that are publicly available, such as government datasets, open-source datasets, or datasets shared by other researchers.

However, without more specific information, it is impossible to determine the exact methods used in this particular context. Therefore, I must conclude that I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
