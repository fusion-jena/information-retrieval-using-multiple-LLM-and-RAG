Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that 70% of the data was used for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for model testing. This suggests that the model's performance was likely evaluated using metrics such as R2 (coefficient of determination) on the validation set during training, but the specific strategy or metrics used for monitoring performance are not provided.
