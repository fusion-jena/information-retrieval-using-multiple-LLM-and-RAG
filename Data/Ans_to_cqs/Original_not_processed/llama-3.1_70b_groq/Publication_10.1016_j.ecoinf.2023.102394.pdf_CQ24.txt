Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning techniques in ecological informatics, soil organic carbon prediction, and agriculture-related elements. It discusses the use of deep learning models, their performance, and the potential of deep learning in ecological analysis.

However, it does mention the use of specific deep learning frameworks and tools, such as Keras (Allaire & Chollet, 2018) and TensorFlow (Abadi et al., 2016), which are commonly used in deep learning pipelines. These frameworks often provide mechanisms to handle randomness, such as setting a random seed value, but the context does not explicitly discuss these strategies.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. If you have any further questions or would like to know more about deep learning in general, I'll be happy to help.
