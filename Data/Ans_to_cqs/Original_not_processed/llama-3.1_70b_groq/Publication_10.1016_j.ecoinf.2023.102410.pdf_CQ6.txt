Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to data analysis, specifically the analysis of song structures and vocalizations, but it does not provide any information about deep learning models or preprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know what preprocessing steps are involved before training a deep learning model based on the provided context.
