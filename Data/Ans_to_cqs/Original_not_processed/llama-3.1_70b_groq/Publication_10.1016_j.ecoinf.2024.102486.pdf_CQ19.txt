Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the frameworks used to build the deep learning model, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. However, it does mention the Deep Learning Toolbox by MathWorks, cuDNN, and Darknet as other programming languages and tools used. Additionally, it mentions Keras, but only provides a reference to the Keras website without specifying its use in the context. Therefore, I can only confirm that Keras is mentioned, but I do not know if it is used to build the deep learning model or if other frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch are used.
