Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly state the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention that the model improved swiftly in terms of precision, recall, and mean average precision before plateauing after about 1000 iterations. Additionally, it is mentioned that the loss showed a rapid decline around 1000 iterations. 

It can be inferred that the training process was run for a fixed number of iterations (4000) rather than being stopped based on a specific validation loss plateau or other criteria. The context does mention that the model starts to overfit when the number of epochs exceeds 200, but it does not provide information on how this was used to determine the completion of training.
