Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be an abstract and introduction to a research study on using machine learning to aid sustainable Indian Ocean tuna purse seine fishery. It mentions the use of "combined catches and environmental datasets" but does not provide details on how these datasets were collected. Therefore, I do not know the specific methods used for collecting raw data in this study.
