Answer: TensorFlow. The provided context mentions the use of TensorFlow-specific modules and functions, such as `tensorflow.keras.applications.vgg16.VGG16` and `tensorflow.keras.applications.resnet_v2.ResNet152V2`. Additionally, the context references TensorFlow Hub models, such as `tfhub.dev/google/vggish/1` and `tfhub.dev/google/yamnet/1`. This suggests that the deep learning model is built using the TensorFlow framework. There is no mention of PyTorch or any other deep learning framework in the provided context.
