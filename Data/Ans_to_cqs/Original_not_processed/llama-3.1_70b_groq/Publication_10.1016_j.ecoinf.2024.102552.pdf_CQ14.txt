Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about hyperparameter optimization, grid search, random search, or any other machine learning-related concepts. The text appears to be discussing ecological analysis, land use mapping, and classification schemes, but it does not provide any information about model optimization or hyperparameter tuning. Therefore, I cannot provide a meaningful answer to this question based on the given context.
