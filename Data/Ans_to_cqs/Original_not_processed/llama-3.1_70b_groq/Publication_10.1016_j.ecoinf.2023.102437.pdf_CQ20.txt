Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context discusses various topics such as land cover/land use classification, El Ni√±o southern oscillation, and recurrent neural networks, but it does not provide information on the hardware resources used for training the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
