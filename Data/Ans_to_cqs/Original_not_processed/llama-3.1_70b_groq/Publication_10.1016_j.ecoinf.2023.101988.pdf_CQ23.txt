Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context only mentions that the model was used for "Modelling animal biodiversity using acoustic monitoring and deep learning" (Chalmers et al., 2021), but it does not provide details on the dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.

However, it is possible to infer that the model was trained on a diverse dataset, as the context mentions that the model was used to identify species in different habitats (Table 3). Additionally, the context mentions that the model was compared to observer-based methods, which suggests that the model was evaluated on a separate test set.

Despite these inferences, the context does not provide explicit information on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
