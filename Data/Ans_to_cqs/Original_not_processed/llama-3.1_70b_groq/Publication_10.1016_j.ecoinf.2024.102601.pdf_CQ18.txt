Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the model's performance is evaluated using a validation dataset, which is randomly split from the original dataset in a 60/40 ratio (3000 for training and 2000 for validation). The model's performance is measured in terms of accuracy, and it is reported that the model achieves a flawless training accuracy of 1.0 and a commendable accuracy of 0.924 on the validation dataset. This suggests that the model's performance is monitored using a validation set, but the specific strategy or metrics used to monitor performance during training are not provided.
