Answer: 
The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is segmentation. Specifically, a segmentation convolutional neural network (CNN) was implemented to perform image segmentation tasks. The CNN model used was a U-Net architecture, which is commonly used for biomedical image segmentation but was applied in this case to wetland classification. The model was trained on various inputs, including satellite imagery data from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, as well as other indices such as NDVI and NDWI, to segment wetland areas in a large region of Alberta, Canada.
