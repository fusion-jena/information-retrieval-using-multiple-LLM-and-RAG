Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It only mentions the software used, which is R 4.1.2, specifically the 'neuralnet' package, for developing a BP-ANN model. There is no information about the hardware resources, such as GPUs or TPUs, used for training the model.
