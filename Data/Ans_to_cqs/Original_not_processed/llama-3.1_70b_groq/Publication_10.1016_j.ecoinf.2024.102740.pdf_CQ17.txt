Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be related to a study on grasslands, remote sensing, and machine learning, but it does not discuss deep learning or regularization methods. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
