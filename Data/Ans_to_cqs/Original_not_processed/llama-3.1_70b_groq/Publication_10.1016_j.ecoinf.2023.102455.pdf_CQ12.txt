Answer:::
The primary model used in the pipeline is a CNN-BiGRU model, which is a combination of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU). Additionally, three comparative machine learning methods are used, including KELM (Kernel Extreme Learning Machine), RVFL (Random Vector Functional Link), and CNN-BiRNN (Convolutional Neural Network with Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network). These models are used to create a multi-temporal forecasting model of daily streamflow (Qflow).
