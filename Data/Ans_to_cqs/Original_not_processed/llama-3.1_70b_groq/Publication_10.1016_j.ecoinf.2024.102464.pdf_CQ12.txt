Answer: None of the mentioned models (CNN, RNN, Transformer) are used in the pipeline. The text mentions the use of seven different machine learning models, including Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Random Forest (RF), and Classification and Regression Tree (CART), but none of these are deep learning models. The models used in the pipeline are traditional machine learning models, not deep learning models.
