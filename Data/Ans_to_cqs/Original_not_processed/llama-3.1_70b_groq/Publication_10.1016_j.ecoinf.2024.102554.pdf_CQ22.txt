Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of a deep learning model. It discusses the use of satellite data and machine learning methodologies for aquatic environmental monitoring, specifically for estimating Chl-a concentrations. It also mentions the development of algorithms for atmospheric correction and the analysis of Chl-a concentrations in shallow lakes. However, it does not provide information on the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model, such as accuracy, precision, or recall.
