Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, statistical modeling, and estimation methods, but it does not mention deep learning or data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling.

Therefore, I must answer that I don't know what data augmentation techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
