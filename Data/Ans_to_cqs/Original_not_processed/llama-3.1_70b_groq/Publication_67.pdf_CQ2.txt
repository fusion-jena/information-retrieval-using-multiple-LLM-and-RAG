Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information given, it can be inferred that the primary data format used is images. The context mentions the use of satellite and aerial RGB images, and the training datasets are built with examples of images with different levels of tree cover. Additionally, the supplementary materials include figures and archives that contain image data.

There is also a mention of a CSV file in Archive S1, which contains metadata of FAO's GDA photointerpreted very high resolution plots. However, this appears to be a secondary data format used for storing metadata, rather than a primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline.

There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the pipeline.
