Answer: The text does not explicitly state the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it mentions that "Each network, with a particular architecture and considering a specific substratum characterization, was trained and executed three times, each time with a different (random) initialization of the trainable parameters and with a different data fold." This suggests that the data was split into folds, and each fold was used for training and testing the model with different initializations. The text also mentions that the results shown are averages of those three executions, implying that the data was split into multiple folds for cross-validation. However, the exact criteria for splitting the data (e.g., train-test-validation split ratio) are not specified.
