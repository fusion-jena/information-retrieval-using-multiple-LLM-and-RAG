Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is based on a k-fold cross-validation approach. Specifically, the dataset is split into k-1 folds for training (tuning set) and 1 fold for validation. The model is trained on the tuning set and its performance is evaluated on the validation set using the out-of-sample R2 metric. This process is repeated for each number of iterations, and the median of the k-1 out-of-sample R2 values is calculated to determine the best number of iterations. This approach allows for the evaluation of the model's performance on unseen data during training, helping to prevent overfitting and select the optimal number of iterations.
