Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that Tan, Langenk√§mper, and Nattkemper (2022) studied the impact of data augmentations on deep learning-based marine object classification in benthic image transects.

Although the specific techniques are not mentioned, it is common in deep learning pipelines to apply techniques such as flipping, rotating, scaling, and cropping to augment the training data. These techniques help increase the diversity of the training data, which can improve the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

If you're looking for specific information on the data augmentation techniques used in the study by Tan et al. (2022), I recommend checking the original paper or searching for more information on the study.
