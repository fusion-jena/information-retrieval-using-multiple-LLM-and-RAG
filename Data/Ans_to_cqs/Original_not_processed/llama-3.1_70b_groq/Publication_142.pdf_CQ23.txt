Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the Pl@ntNet model was pre-trained on the commonly used ImageNet dataset and fine-tuned on Pl@ntNet data. This suggests that the model was trained on a large and diverse dataset, which can help improve its generalizability.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model covers 30,261 species illustrated by more than 2.9 million images, which is one to three orders of magnitude larger than previously published studies. This large dataset size and diversity of species may have helped improve the model's generalizability.

However, there is no explicit mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting in the provided context. Therefore, it is unclear whether these measures were taken to ensure the model's generalizability.
