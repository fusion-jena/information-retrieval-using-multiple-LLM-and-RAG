Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on data augmentation techniques, attention mechanisms, and the proposed SCAM-Herb model for identifying medicinal plants. It discusses the importance of data augmentation, the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and the implementation of attention mechanisms to improve the performance of deep learning models.

However, it does mention that the data are divided into five equal folds in the proposed FAA-based approach, suggesting that the data is already available and being processed. It also mentions the use of images of plants, but it does not provide information on how these images were collected.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
