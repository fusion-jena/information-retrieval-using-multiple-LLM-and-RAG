Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is a 5-fold cross-validation. This is mentioned in the text as: "A five-fold cross-validation is used and the negative mean square error is set as the target measure." This means that the dataset is divided into 5 subsets, and the model is trained on 4 subsets while being evaluated on the remaining subset. This process is repeated 5 times, with each subset being used as the evaluation set once. This helps to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data and prevents overfitting.
