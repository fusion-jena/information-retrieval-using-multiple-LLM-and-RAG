Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context only mentions that the model was trained from scratch using a large dataset of nearly 30,000 labeled samples per class, but it does not provide the name of the dataset. It also mentions that the dataset consists of photographs, specifically repeat photographs, but it does not provide further information about the dataset. Therefore, I do not know the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
