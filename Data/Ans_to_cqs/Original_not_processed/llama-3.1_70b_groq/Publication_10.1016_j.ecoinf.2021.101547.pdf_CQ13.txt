Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The text only mentions the mini-batch size as a user-adjustable parameter, but does not provide information on other hyperparameters. It does mention that the details of the parameters and settings used for the two training stages are summarized in Table 1, but the table is not provided in the context. Therefore, I do not know the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
