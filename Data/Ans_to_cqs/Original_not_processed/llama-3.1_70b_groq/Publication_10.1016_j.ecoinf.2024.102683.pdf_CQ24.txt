Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the proposed approach (SCAM-Herb model) for medicinal plant identification using deep CNN-based models, attention mechanisms, and data augmentation techniques. It discusses the importance of texture characteristics, attention mechanisms, and feature extraction in improving the performance of CNN models. However, it does not provide information on handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
