Answer:::

The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not explicitly stated as traditional train, test, and validation sets. However, two approaches are mentioned: Random Individual (RI) splitting and Random Year (RY) splitting.

For RI splitting, the data is randomly split into two parts, but the exact proportions are not specified. This approach is considered optimum in machine learning as it does not introduce systematic differences between the test and train datasets.

For RY splitting, the data is grouped by year of capture, and years are randomly selected for inclusion in the train and test datasets. This approach may produce systematic differences between the test and train datasets but ensures that the model is tested on previously unseen combinations of explanatory variables.

Additionally, a three-part split is mentioned, where the data is split into train, validation, and test sets. The validation set is used to tweak the model's parameters and evaluate its performance, and the test set is used as a final evaluation of the model's generalization performance.
