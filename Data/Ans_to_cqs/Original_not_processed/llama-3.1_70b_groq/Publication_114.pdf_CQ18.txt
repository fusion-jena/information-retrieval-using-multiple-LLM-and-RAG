Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does provide information on the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the deep learning models, such as user's accuracy (UA), producer's accuracy (PA), F1-score, overall accuracy (OA), and Kappa coefficient. These metrics are typically used to evaluate the performance of classification models, but they do not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training.
