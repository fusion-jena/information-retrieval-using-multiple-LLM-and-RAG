Answer:::
The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows:

* Optimizer: Adam optimizer
* Learning rate: 0.0001 (default learning rate)
* Weight decay: 0.0

These hyperparameters were used for fine-tuning the pretrained CNN backbone using classical meta-metric learning architectures adapted from the EasyFSL.
