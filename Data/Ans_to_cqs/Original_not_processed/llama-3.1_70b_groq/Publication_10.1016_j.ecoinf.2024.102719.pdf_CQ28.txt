Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the generalizability of various machine learning models for river health index (RHI) prediction, bias-variance decomposition analysis, and the use of different machine learning algorithms such as random forests, XGBoost, and weighted soft voting. However, it does not provide information about the deployment platform used for the deep learning model.
