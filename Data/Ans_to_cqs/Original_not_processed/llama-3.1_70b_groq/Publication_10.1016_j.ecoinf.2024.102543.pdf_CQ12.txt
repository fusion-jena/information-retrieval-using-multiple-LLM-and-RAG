Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically a variant of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) architecture, namely YOLOv8. This is evident from the text, which mentions the YOLOv8 algorithm and its various network structures, such as YOLOv8n, YOLOv8s, YOLOv8m, YOLOv8l, and YOLOv8x. The text also discusses the addition of a new layer, C2f2, to the YOLOv8 architecture, which further supports the use of a CNN-based model.
