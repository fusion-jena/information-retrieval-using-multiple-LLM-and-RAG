Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention anything about handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline or the use of random seed values. The context appears to be related to a study on Amur tigers, specifically on data validation and population estimation using footprint trails. It discusses the results of a holdback trial partitioning test and the challenges of collecting data in the field.
