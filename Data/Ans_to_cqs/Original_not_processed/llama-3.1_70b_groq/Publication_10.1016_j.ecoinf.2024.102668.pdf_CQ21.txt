Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context appears to be related to audio signal processing and acoustic data analysis, but it does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps mentioned in the query, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, and Confusion matrix.

The context does describe a proposed preprocessing approach for tackling issues related to audio signal processing, but it does not discuss postprocessing steps. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.

If you have any further context or information, I would be happy to try and assist you further.
