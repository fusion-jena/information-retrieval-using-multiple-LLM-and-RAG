Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that the system uses 20 epochs with 500 steps each for training images and 100 steps for validation images while evaluating the model. This suggests that the data is split into training and validation sets, but the exact criteria for this split are not specified.

In general, common criteria for splitting data into training, validation, and test sets include:

* Random sampling: randomly selecting a portion of the data for each set
* Stratified sampling: ensuring that each set has the same proportion of samples from each class or category
* Time-based splitting: splitting the data based on the time it was collected, such as using earlier data for training and later data for testing

However, without more information, it is not possible to determine the specific criteria used in this case.
