Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses the challenges of using machine learning algorithms for ecology and conservation applications, the limitations of traditional machine learning approaches, and the benefits of using the MTMI-SMF algorithm. It also presents confusion matrices for different imagery types, but it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training the model.
