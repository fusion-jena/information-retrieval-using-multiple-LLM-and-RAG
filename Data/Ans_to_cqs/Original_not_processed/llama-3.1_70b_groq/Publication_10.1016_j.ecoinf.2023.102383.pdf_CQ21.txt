Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and training process of the model, including the feature map selection criterion, residual neural networks, and hard negative mining. It does not provide information on the postprocessing steps that occur after the model training is complete. 

Therefore, I do not know the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training based on the provided context.
