Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the structure of the CNN and LSTM models, the performance of different models on algal bloom forecasting, and the evaluation metrics used. It does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
