Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. It discusses the calibration of models for classification challenges, the architecture of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and the results of the classification tasks. However, it does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation.

In general, common practices for splitting data include using a random split, stratified split, or k-fold cross-validation. However, without specific information from the provided context, it is not possible to determine the exact criteria used in this case.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the provided context does not provide enough information to determine the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training.
