Answer:::

The provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection. However, it does mention that hyper-parameter tuning was performed via GridSearchCV with cross-validation (cv = 10), which can help reduce bias in the model predictions.

Additionally, the context mentions that the data was divided into training (80%), validation (10%), and test sets (10%), which can help ensure that the model is trained and tested on diverse data. However, it does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know what specific techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
