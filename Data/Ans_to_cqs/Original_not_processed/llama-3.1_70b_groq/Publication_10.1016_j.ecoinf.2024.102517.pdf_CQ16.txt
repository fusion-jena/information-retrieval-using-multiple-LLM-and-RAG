Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the audio classification loss network, the loss function used, and the experimental setting. It also provides some results in terms of Î”SNR and SNR values, but it does not discuss the stopping criteria for training.

Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete in this particular study.
