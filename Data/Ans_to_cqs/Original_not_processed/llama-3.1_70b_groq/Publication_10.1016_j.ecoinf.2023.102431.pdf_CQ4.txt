The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be related to a research paper on a non-invasive survey method called FIT (likely "Footprint Identification Technique") for wildlife conservation, and does not discuss deep learning or data augmentation techniques.
