Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the training process of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), specifically Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks, and the tuning of hyperparameters. It also mentions the use of grid search method for hyperparameter tuning and the selection of optimal predictor variables.

The context does mention the computation of error during the training phase, but it does not provide information on the calculation of metrics or the creation of confusion matrices after the model training. Additionally, there is no mention of Saliency maps, which are a technique used to visualize the importance of input features in the model's predictions.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
