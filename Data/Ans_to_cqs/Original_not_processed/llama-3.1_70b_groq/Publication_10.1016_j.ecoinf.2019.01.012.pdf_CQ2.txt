Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the primary data format used is images. The context mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image analysis and the classification of digital images. It also mentions the use of 50 Ã— 50 pixel tiles of images for training and testing the model. Therefore, it can be concluded that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images. The context does not provide any information about the use of audio, video, or CSV data formats in the pipeline.
