Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be discussing a clustering approach for determining freshness classes, and it mentions the use of Silhouette and Calinski-Harabasz methods for evaluating the clustering results. However, it does not provide information on data splitting for deep learning model training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
