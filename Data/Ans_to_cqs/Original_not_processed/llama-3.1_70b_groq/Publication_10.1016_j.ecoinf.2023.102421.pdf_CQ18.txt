Answer:::
To monitor the model performance during training, the strategy implemented is 10-fold cross-validation. This is mentioned in the context as: "To eliminate bias, 10-fold cross-validation was used during the training process, and mean RMSE was used as the objective function (lost function)." This suggests that the model's performance is evaluated on multiple folds of the training data, and the average performance is used to monitor and optimize the model's hyperparameters.
