Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling, specifically addressing the issue of sampling bias in the presence of a low number of presence data. It discusses methods for estimating sampling effort and correcting for sampling bias, but does not mention data annotation techniques.
