Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the framework of the bird sound noise reduction network based on deep feature loss, the training process, and the comparison of noise reduction algorithms. It does not discuss data preprocessing techniques or strategies to address data bias.

However, it does mention the scarcity of labeled clean bioacoustic recordings, which could potentially lead to data bias. But it does not provide information on how this issue is addressed.

Therefore, I do not know the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline in this context.
