Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline, such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. However, it does provide a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) for the dataset associated with the paper: https://doi.org/10.5068/D16M4N. This might be a starting point for searching for the code repository, but the exact location is not specified in the given context.
