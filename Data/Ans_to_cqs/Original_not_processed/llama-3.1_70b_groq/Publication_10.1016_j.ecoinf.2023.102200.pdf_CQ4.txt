Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a collection of research papers and articles related to remote sensing, computer vision, and deep learning, but it does not provide specific information on data augmentation techniques.

However, I can provide some general information on common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. These techniques are used to artificially increase the size of the training dataset and improve the robustness of the model. Some common data augmentation techniques include:

* Flipping: horizontally or vertically flipping the input image
* Rotating: rotating the input image by a certain angle
* Scaling: scaling the input image by a certain factor
* Color jittering: randomly changing the brightness, contrast, or saturation of the input image
* Cropping: randomly cropping a portion of the input image

These techniques can be applied individually or in combination to create new training samples. However, without more specific information, I cannot determine which specific techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the query.

Therefore, my answer is that I don't know the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, as this information is not provided in the context.
