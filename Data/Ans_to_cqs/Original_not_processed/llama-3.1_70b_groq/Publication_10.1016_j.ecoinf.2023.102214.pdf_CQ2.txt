Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the pipeline primarily deals with image data, specifically camera trap images of snow leopards. The context mentions "image classification for individual ID" and "camera trapping image analysis," which suggests that the pipeline is designed to process and analyze image data.

There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the pipeline. Additionally, while CSV (Comma Separated Values) files are commonly used in data analysis, there is no explicit mention of CSV files being used in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be concluded that the deep learning pipeline primarily uses image data, but the exact format (e.g., JPEG, TIFF, etc.) is not specified.
