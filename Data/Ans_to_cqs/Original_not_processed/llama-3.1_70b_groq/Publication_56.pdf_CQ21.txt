Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. It discusses the architecture of the 2-BiLSTM network, the use of attention mechanism, and the data used for training and validation, but it does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix.
