Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST or CIFAR. However, it does mention ImageNet, which is a large-scale image classification dataset. According to the context, the DCNN model used in the study was the AlexNet model, which was originally trained on the ImageNet dataset (Krizhevsky et al. 2012). Additionally, the study used a camera-trap image dataset, but the specific name of the dataset is not mentioned.
