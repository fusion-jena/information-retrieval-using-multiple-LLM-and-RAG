Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context only provides information about the neural network architecture, including the number of layers, nodes, and the use of Monte Carlo Dropout and DenseVariational layers in the MCD and VBI approaches, respectively. It also discusses the advantages of Bayesian Neural Networks and the performance of the two architectures during the prediction phase, but it does not provide details about the hyperparameters used.
