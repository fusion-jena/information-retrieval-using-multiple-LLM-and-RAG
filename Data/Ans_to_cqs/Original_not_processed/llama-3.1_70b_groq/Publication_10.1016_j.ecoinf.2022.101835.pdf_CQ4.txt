Answer:::
I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be focused on the optimization of machine learning models, specifically Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network, and LightGBM, using the Optuna library. It discusses the hyperparameters and their ranges used for optimization, as well as the evaluation metrics used to compare the performance of the models. However, it does not mention any data augmentation techniques.
