Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The context mentions the use of remote sensing observations and data-driven models, but it does not provide information on the specific data formats used.

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the data formats used might include image data, as remote sensing observations often involve satellite or aerial imagery. Additionally, the context mentions the use of random forest models, which can handle various types of data, including tabular data (e.g., CSV).

But without more specific information, it is difficult to determine the exact data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.
