Answer: 
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, the model structure consists of four convolutional layers and a fully connected layer with 100 hidden units. The 3D convolution filters in the convolutional layers are set to 3 × 3 × N in the first convolutional layer, 3 × 3 × 20 in the second and third layers, and to 1 × 1 × 100 in the fourth layer. Additionally, the pipeline also utilizes the DeepLabV3+ architecture, which is a type of CNN model.
