Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the training regime, hyperparameters, and model architectures, but does not provide information on regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I do not know the specific regularization methods used in this pipeline.
