Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of deep learning models or specific architectures such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. The text appears to focus on data filtering, scaling, and preprocessing steps using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, but it does not provide information on the type of machine learning or deep learning models used in the pipeline.
