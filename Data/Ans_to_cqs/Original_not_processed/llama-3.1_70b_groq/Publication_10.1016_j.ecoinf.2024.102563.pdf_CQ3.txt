Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing, digital soil mapping, and land cover classification, with references to various machine learning and deep learning techniques, but it does not delve into the specifics of data annotation techniques.

However, it is worth noting that some of the papers mentioned in the context, such as those related to object-based image analysis and land cover classification, may implicitly involve data annotation techniques. For example, the paper by Lu et al. (2021) mentions optimal segmentation scale selection, which could involve annotating data for training and validation purposes.

Despite this, the context does not provide explicit information on the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a more detailed answer to this query based on the provided context.
