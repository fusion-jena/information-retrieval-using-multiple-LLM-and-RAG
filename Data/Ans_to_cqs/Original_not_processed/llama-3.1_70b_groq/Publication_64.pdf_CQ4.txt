Answer:::
The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include standard techniques such as shear, translation, and mirror. However, rotation and upside-down mirroring are not applied to images tagged as 'habit', as it does not make sense to have a tree or a landscape upside down. After applying these transformations, the images are downscaled to the ResNet standard 224x224 input size.
