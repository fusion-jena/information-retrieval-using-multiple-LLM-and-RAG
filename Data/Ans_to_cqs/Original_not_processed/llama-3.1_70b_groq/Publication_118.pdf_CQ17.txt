Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that "2d batch normalization" was applied between each layer, which can help with regularization. Additionally, it mentions that "no dropout" was applied between each layer, indicating that dropout was considered but not used in this specific implementation.
