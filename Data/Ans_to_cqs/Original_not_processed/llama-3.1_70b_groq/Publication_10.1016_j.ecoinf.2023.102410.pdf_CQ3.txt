Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a research paper on vocalisation analysis, specifically discussing the analysis of song structures and patterns. The tables and text provided do not mention deep learning or data annotation techniques. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide an answer to the query.
