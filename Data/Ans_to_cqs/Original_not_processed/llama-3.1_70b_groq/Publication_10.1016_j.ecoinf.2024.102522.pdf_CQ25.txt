Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. The context mentions a "Classification table" (Table 4) and a "Summary of the model" (Table 3) with metrics such as Cox & Snell R2 and Nagelkerke R2, which are commonly used to evaluate the performance of classification models. Additionally, the context mentions "Observed Y" and "Forecast Y" in the classification table, which suggests that the model is predicting a categorical outcome variable.
