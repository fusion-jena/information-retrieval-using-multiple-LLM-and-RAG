Answer:

According to the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are Overall Accuracy and Kappa Coefficient.

Overall Accuracy measures the proportion of pixels correctly classified out of the total number of pixels in the image. It is calculated as the ratio of the number of pixels correctly classified by the model (Ncorrect) to the total number of pixels (Ntotal), multiplied by 100%.

The Kappa Coefficient, on the other hand, takes into account the chance agreement between classification and observations. It determines how much the classification accuracy exceeds random agreement. The Kappa Coefficient is calculated using the formula: Kappa = (Po - Pe) / (1 - Pe), where Po is the ratio of agreed pixels to the total number of pixels, and Pe is the expected probability of agreement.
