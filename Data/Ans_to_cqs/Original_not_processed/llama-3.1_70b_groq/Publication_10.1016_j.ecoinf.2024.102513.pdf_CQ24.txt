Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for land use and land cover (LULC) classification, discussing the architecture of CNNs, the use of attention mechanisms, and techniques for handling data scarcity.

However, it does mention the use of gradient descent or its variants for updating weights during the training process, which may involve random initialization of weights. But it does not provide specific information on how randomness is handled in the pipeline.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
