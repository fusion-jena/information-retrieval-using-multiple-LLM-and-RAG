Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention anything about preprocessing steps for training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to the FAIR principles for data management and the use of the F-UJI tool for evaluating the compliance of datasets with these principles. It does not provide information on deep learning models or preprocessing steps.
