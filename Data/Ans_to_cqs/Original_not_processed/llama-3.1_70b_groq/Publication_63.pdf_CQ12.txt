Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, the study employs several state-of-the-art CNN architectures, including Inception-Resnet-v2, Xception, and MobileNetV2. These models are used for both image and mixed data processing, with the latter incorporating bioclimatic data in addition to images. The CNN models are used in various setups, including a baseline setup, a setup with plasticity (target augmentation), and an ensemble approach that combines the predictions of multiple models.
