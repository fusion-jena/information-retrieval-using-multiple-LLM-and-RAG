Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to image capture, curation, and metadata, but it does not delve into the specifics of deep learning pipelines or data augmentation techniques.

However, I can suggest that common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include:

* Flipping (horizontal and/or vertical)
* Rotating (by a certain angle or randomly)
* Scaling (up or down by a certain factor)
* Color jittering (adjusting brightness, contrast, saturation, etc.)
* Cropping (randomly or center cropping)
* Padding (adding zeros or reflection around the image)
* Noise injection (adding Gaussian noise or salt and pepper noise)

But please note that these are general techniques and not specifically mentioned in the provided context. If you're looking for information on data augmentation techniques used in a specific project or paper, I recommend checking the relevant publication or documentation.
