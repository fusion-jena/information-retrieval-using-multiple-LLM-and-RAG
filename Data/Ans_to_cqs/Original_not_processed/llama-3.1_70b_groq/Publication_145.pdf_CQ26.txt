Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention data augmentation as a technique applied to the input images. Data augmentation involves applying random transformations to the input images, such as rotations, flips, and changes in brightness, saturation, and hue. This technique can help increase the diversity of the training data and potentially reduce data bias. 

The context does not mention stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection as techniques used to address data bias. It only mentions that data augmentation was applied randomly to the input images.
