Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The text primarily focuses on the architecture of the neural network, including the number of layers, neurons, activation functions, and training parameters. It also discusses the use of batch normalization, dropout, and a learning rate scheduler, but does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. If you have any additional context or information, I would be happy to try and help further.
