Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a crawling tool for retrieving data from SRS products, data storage in NetCDF files, and some operational details of the tool. However, it does not provide information on preprocessing steps for training a deep learning model.

Therefore, I do not know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model based on the provided context.
