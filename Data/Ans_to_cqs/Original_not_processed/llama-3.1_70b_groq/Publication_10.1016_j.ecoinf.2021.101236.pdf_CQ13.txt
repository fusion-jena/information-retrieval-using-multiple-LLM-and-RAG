Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The text only discusses the architecture of the model, the data preprocessing, and the training process in general terms, but does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
