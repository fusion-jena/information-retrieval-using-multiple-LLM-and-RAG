Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on a research study related to water contamination classification in aquaculture using IoT-based real-time data collection and deep learning approaches. It discusses the challenges of existing deep learning approaches, the proposed framework, and the literature survey, but it does not mention any specific datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
