Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The text primarily focuses on the use of the Gumbel-Softmax function to make the update criterion differentiable, allowing for the computation of gradients. It also discusses the use of a neural network to learn the neighborhood relationship Rk, but it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used to train the network.

However, it is mentioned that the Gumbel-Softmax function is used to approximate discrete distributions with continuous distributions, which is useful in optimizing neural networks involving discrete variables. This suggests that the optimization technique used may be related to reinforcement learning or generative models, but the specific technique is not specified.

Therefore, I do not know the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam, as this information is not provided in the context.
