Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. In fact, the context only mentions the use of a Random Forest (RF) model and its hyperparameters, such as the number of trees (n_estimators), minimum number of leaves (minleaf), and number of randomly selected node-split feature variables (max_features). It also mentions the use of a grid search method (GridSearchCV) to search for the optimal parameters of the RF model. There is no mention of a deep learning model or its hyperparameters.
