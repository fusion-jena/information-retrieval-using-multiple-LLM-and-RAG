Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of a stratified sampling method, where 70% of the samples are allocated to the training dataset and the remaining 30% to the validation dataset. Additionally, three error statistics are employed to compare the accuracies of the models: R2, mean absolute error (MAE), and RMSE (as indicated in Eqs. 8, 9, and 10). This approach allows for the evaluation of model performance, particularly when dealing with less important variables, and helps to identify the most influential variables for predicting AGB.
