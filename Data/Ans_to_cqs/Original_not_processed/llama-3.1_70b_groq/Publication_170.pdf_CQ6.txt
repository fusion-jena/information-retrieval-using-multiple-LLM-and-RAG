Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model used in the study, AlexNet, performed Local Response Normalization (LRN) processing and Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function processing in each layer, except for the last fully connected layer. Additionally, the first, second, and fifth convolutional layers performed a downsampling operation using the mean pooling method.

It is also mentioned that Yousif et al. (2019) had more complex preprocessing, which might have affected their model's performance. However, the specific preprocessing steps used by Yousif et al. are not mentioned.

In the context of the study, it is mentioned that the model can automatically filter empty images, which might be a preprocessing step. However, the exact steps involved in this process are not specified.

Overall, the provided context does not provide a comprehensive list of preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model.
