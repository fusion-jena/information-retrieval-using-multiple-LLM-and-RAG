Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling. However, it does mention the use of data augmentation techniques to make the CNN classification more robust and generalize better.

According to the context, the data augmentation techniques used include rotation, noise, and flip, which allowed the dataset to be augmented by six times. This suggests that the authors attempted to increase the diversity of the dataset through data augmentation, but it does not provide information on other techniques used to address data bias.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the answer to the query is that data augmentation techniques such as rotation, noise, and flip are used to make the CNN classification more robust and generalize better, but it does not provide information on other techniques used to address data bias.
