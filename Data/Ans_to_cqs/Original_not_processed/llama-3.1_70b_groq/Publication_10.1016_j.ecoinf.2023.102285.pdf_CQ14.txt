Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context appears to be related to research papers on medical applications, wildlife census, and object detection in ocean surfaces, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
