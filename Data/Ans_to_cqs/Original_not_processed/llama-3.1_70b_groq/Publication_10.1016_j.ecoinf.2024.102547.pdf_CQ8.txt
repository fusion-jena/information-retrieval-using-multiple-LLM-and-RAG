Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. The text appears to be a research paper or article discussing the application of Functional Data Analysis (FDA) in ecological and marine conservation efforts. It references various studies and authors, but does not mention a specific code repository or deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to the query.
