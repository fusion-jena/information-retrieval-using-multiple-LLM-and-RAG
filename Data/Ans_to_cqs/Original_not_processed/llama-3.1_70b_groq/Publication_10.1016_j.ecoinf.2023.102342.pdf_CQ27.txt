Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention the deployment of a trained deep learning model or the process followed for it. The context mainly discusses the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process, data mining, and the steps involved in identifying patterns or relationships within a dataset. It does not provide information on model deployment or related topics like model serialization or platform selection.
