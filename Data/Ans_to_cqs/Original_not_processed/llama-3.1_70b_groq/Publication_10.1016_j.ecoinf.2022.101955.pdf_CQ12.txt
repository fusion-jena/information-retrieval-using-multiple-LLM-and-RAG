Answer: I don't know. The provided context does not mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline, such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. It mentions the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classification, but does not provide information on the specific architecture or type of deep learning model used.
