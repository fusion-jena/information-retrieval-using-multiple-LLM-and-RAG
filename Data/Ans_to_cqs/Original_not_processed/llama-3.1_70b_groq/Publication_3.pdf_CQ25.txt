Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model is image classification, specifically for species identification. The model is designed to perform automated feature extraction and classification of species based on their spectrograms. The model architecture is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that consists of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The model is trained on a dataset of spectrograms and is evaluated on its ability to correctly identify species. The model is tested on different challenges, including identifying species from a reference library of 20 species and 41 species, and the results show high correct identification rates.
