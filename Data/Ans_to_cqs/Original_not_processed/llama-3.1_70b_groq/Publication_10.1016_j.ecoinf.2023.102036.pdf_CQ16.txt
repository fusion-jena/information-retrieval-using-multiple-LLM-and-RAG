Answer:::
The text does not explicitly state the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions that the performance of the runs was studied using TensorBoard, a set of visualization tools included in the TensorFlow library. Additionally, it is mentioned that the model was validated every 300 iterations. 

It can be inferred that the performance of the model on the validation set was monitored, but the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete (e.g., validation loss plateau) is not mentioned.
