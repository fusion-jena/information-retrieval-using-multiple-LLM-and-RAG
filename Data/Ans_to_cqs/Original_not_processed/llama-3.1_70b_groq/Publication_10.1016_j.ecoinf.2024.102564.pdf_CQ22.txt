Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the machine learning models (not specifically deep learning models) in this study are:

1. RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
2. MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
3. r (correlation coefficient)
4. Bias

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the models in estimating the net growth in Atlantic Forest fragments. The values of these metrics are reported in Table 2 for the different models (ANN, RF, and SVM) tested in the study.
