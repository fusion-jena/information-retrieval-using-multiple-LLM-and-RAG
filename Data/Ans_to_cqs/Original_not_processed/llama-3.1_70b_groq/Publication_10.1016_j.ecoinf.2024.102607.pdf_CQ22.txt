Answer:

The provided context does not specifically mention the evaluation metrics used for a deep learning model. However, it does provide a confusion matrix and mentions several metrics used to evaluate the performance of a land use and land cover (LULC) mapping model.

The metrics mentioned in the context include:

* Overall Accuracy (OA)
* Producer Accuracy (PA)
* User Accuracy (UA)
* Kappa coefficient (%)

These metrics are commonly used to evaluate the performance of classification models, including LULC mapping models. However, it is not clear if these metrics are used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model specifically.

Additionally, the context mentions that the performance of the SSA-TPRF model is evaluated using a confusion matrix, which is a common tool used to evaluate the performance of classification models. The confusion matrix provides information about the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives, which can be used to calculate various evaluation metrics.
