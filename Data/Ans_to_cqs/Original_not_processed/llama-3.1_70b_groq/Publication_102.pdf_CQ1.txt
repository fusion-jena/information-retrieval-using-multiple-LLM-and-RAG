Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of two datasets: the SSLs' dataset and the elephants' dataset. The elephants' dataset is specifically mentioned as "The aerial elephant dataset" which is a public benchmark for aerial object detection. 

It can be inferred that the data might have been collected through aerial means, possibly using drones or aircraft, as the dataset is mentioned to be for aerial object detection. However, the exact methods used for collecting the raw data are not specified in the provided context.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of synthetic data in one of the references, which suggests that synthetic data might be used in some cases, but it is not clear if it was used in the specific datasets mentioned.
