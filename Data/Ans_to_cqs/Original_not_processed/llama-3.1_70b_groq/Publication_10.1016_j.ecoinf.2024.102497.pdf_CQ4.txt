Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data augmentation techniques or a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to bathymetry retrieval methods, remote sensing data, and water environment analysis. It discusses various models and techniques used for bathymetry retrieval, such as linear regression, CART, RFR, and SVM, but does not mention data augmentation techniques or deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
