Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context discusses the model selection and parametrization, training, and evaluation of the model, but it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed.

The context mentions the use of open-source CNNs, such as VGG16, ResNet50, and Inception-v3, and the optimization of the models using the Adam optimizer algorithm. It also discusses the evaluation of the models using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and f1-score. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was serialized, which platform was used for deployment, or any other details related to the deployment process.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
