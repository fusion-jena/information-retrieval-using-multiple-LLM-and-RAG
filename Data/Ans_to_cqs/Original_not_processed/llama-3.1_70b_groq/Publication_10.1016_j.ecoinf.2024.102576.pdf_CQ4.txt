Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily discusses the use of deep learning models for land use and land cover classification, phenology-based multi-index, and random forest, but it does not provide details on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I do not know the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
