Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. The context appears to be related to remote sensing and atmospheric correction, with references to various research papers and algorithms. However, there is no mention of a specific code repository or link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository. Therefore, I am unable to provide a link to a code repository.
