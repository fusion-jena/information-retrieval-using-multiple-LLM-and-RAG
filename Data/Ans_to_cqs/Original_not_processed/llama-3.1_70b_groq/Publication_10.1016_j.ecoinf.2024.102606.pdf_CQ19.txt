Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. It mentions the use of Yolov5 and Faster R-CNN, which are deep learning models, but it does not provide information on the underlying frameworks used to implement them. Yolov5 and Faster R-CNN can be implemented using various frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or others, but the context does not provide enough information to determine which one is used in this specific case.
