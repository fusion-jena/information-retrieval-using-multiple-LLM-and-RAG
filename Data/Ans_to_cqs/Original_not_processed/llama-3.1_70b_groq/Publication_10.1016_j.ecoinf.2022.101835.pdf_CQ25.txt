Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning models (specifically, the Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) models) in this context is regression, not classification, segmentation, or detection. The models are used to predict continuous values, as evidenced by the use of mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) as evaluation metrics. The models are trained to predict the first flowering date and the full blossom date, which are continuous variables. The goal is to minimize the error between the predicted and actual values, indicating a regression task.
