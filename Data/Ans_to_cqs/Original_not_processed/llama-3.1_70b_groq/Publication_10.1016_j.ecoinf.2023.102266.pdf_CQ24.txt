Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on a specific model and its properties, particularly in relation to the Von Neumann model. It discusses the probability of obtaining the Von Neumann dynamics and the optimal value of a parameter p0 for achieving this.

However, I can provide some general information on handling randomness in deep learning pipelines. In deep learning, randomness is often introduced through random initialization of weights, random shuffling of data, and random selection of batches. To handle this randomness, several strategies can be employed:

1. **Fixing the random seed**: Setting the random seed to a specific value can ensure reproducibility of results. This is often done in research papers to ensure that results can be replicated.
2. **Averaging over multiple runs**: Running the model multiple times with different random seeds and averaging the results can help reduce the effect of randomness.
3. **Using techniques like dropout**: Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly drops out units during training, which can help reduce overfitting and improve generalization.
4. **Using ensemble methods**: Combining the predictions of multiple models trained with different random seeds can help improve overall performance.

These are just a few examples, and the specific strategy employed will depend on the particular problem and model being used. However, I must emphasize that these strategies are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
