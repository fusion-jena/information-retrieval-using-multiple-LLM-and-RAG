Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the authors experimented with different versions of the dataset (color, gray-scale, and segmented) to test the model's adaptability and ability to learn higher-level structural features in the absence of color information. This suggests that the authors attempted to reduce potential biases associated with lighting conditions and data collection methods by using different dataset versions.

Additionally, the context mentions that the authors used multiple train-test set distributions (80-20, 60-40, 50-50, 40-60, and 20-80) to evaluate the performance of their models. This could be seen as a way to mitigate overfitting and ensure that the models generalize well to new, unseen data.

However, the context does not provide information on whether techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection were used to address data bias. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this question based on the provided context.
