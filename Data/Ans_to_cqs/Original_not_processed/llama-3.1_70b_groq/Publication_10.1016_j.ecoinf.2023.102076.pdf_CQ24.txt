Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of random sampling in various parts of the pipeline.

For example, the context mentions that researchers can annotate a randomly selected sample of collected data according to their own relevancy criteria. Additionally, the context mentions that a random sample of 50 texts was used to initialize the classifier, after which point different selection strategies (Bert K-means, Least Confidence or random selection) were used to select the next 50 texts to include in the training set.

It also mentions that data were grouped according to their initial exploitation-related query term (stemmed) and then randomly selected to create a balanced stratified sample. However, it does not mention anything about setting a random seed value to ensure reproducibility.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it appears that randomness is handled through random sampling, but there is no mention of strategies for ensuring reproducibility, such as setting a random seed value.
