Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is to continuously assess the model accuracy using the validation set. This is mentioned in the text as: "The model accuracy was continuously assessed using the validation set during training, and the performance of the testing set guided the final decision." This suggests that the model's performance on the validation set was used as a proxy to monitor its performance during training, allowing for adjustments to be made as needed.
