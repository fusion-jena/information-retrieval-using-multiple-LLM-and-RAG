Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does mention that the authors worked with biology experts to label many videos and created a training database composed of 13000 fish thumbnails. They also cropped some frames of the videos and applied rotations and symmetries to capture all possible positions of the fishes.

Additionally, the authors mention that they added a class for the background, which was constituted with random thumbnails of the background and specific background thumbnails taken around the fish thumbnails. They also created another class called "part of fish" to ensure that the network processes the fish as a whole, and a class "fish" to recognize any fish even though it is not in the learning database.

The only preprocessing step mentioned in the context is the creation of the training database, which involved cropping frames, applying rotations and symmetries, and adding classes for the background and "part of fish". However, it is likely that other preprocessing steps, such as normalization and scaling, were involved in the process, but they are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
