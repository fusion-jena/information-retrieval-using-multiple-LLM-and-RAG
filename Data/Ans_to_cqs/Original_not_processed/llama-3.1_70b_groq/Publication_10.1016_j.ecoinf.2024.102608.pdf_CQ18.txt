Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. It discusses the use of randomized grid search methods to explore the parameter space and find the optimal hyperparameter values for the machine learning models. It also presents the resulting hyperparameter values for the four machine learning models, but it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training.
