Answer: 

The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the dataset was split into 70% for training, 10% for testing, and 20% for validation. This suggests that the data was split based on a common practice in machine learning, where the majority of the data (70%) is used for training the model, a smaller portion (10%) is used for testing the model's performance, and the remaining portion (20%) is used for validation, which is often used to fine-tune the model's hyperparameters.
