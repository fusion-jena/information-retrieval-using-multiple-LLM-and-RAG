Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific datasets commonly used in deep learning pipelines such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention a few specific image sets used in various studies:

* Karyotyping images of chromosomes (Sharma et al., 2017)
* Sectioned brain microvasculature images (no specific dataset name mentioned)
* Images of the nematode-trapping fungus A. oligospora stained with SR2200 (available at https://github.com/hsueh-lab/FFT)
* An unspecified image set used in previous studies (Lopez-Molina et al., 2015; Shokouh et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2019), with an example shown in Fig. 2a.

These image sets appear to be specific to the studies mentioned and are not widely known datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
