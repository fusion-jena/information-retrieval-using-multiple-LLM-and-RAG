Answer: 
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). This is mentioned in the context as one of the four machine learning models used, along with Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and AdaBoost. However, it does not specify the exact architecture of the ANN, such as whether it is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer.
