Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on different types of deep learning models, such as CNN-like models, Transformer-like models, and MLP-like models, and their applications in computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP). It also discusses the performance of these models on various datasets, including the IP102 dataset.

However, it does mention the use of pre-training data and data augmentation techniques to improve the performance of these models. For example, Yuan et al. (2022) claimed that the superior performance of a ViT can primarily be attributed to extensive pre-training data. Additionally, the context mentions the implementation of advanced deep transfer-learning strategies and the incorporation of multiple data augmentation techniques to improve the performance of the models.

But, it does not provide information on how the raw data was collected in the first place. Therefore, I do not know the specific methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
