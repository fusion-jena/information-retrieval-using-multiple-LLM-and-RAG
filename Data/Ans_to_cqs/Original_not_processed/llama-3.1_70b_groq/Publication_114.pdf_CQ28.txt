Answer: 
I don't know. The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the use of deep learning approaches in remote sensing, specifically for tree type classification, and compares the performance of different deep learning algorithms such as VGG16, ResNet50, and AlexNet. However, it does not provide information about the deployment platform.
