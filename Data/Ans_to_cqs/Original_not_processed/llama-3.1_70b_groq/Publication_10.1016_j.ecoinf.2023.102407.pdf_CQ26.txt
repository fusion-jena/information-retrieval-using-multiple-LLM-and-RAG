Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention data augmentation, which can be used to address data bias by artificially increasing the size of the training dataset and reducing overfitting.

Additionally, the context mentions pseudo-labeling, which is a technique used in semi-supervised learning to assign labels to unlabeled data. This can help to address data bias by increasing the size of the labeled dataset.

The context also mentions sampling techniques, specifically sampling 10% and 30% of the remaining dataset for validation and test sets, respectively. However, it does not mention stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling as techniques used to address data bias.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the answer to the query is that data augmentation and pseudo-labeling are mentioned as techniques that can be used to address data bias, but other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling are not mentioned.
