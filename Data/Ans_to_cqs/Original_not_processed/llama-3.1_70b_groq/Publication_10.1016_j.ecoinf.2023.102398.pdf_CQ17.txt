Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the model is tuned with optimized hyperparameters to prevent overfitting and underfitting situations. Additionally, it mentions the use of a "restrictive and gradually increasing training cycle and accuracy calculation approach" to avoid over-training and biased training.

It also mentions the use of Mean Square Error (MSE) to obtain the optimal training state for the model, which could be related to regularization, but it's not explicitly stated.

Therefore, I couldn't find any specific information about the use of dropout, L2 regularization, or other regularization methods in the provided context.
