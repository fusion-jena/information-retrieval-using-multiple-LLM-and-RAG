Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and training of the neural networks, including the use of Adam optimizer, batch normalization, dropout, and different loss functions. It also discusses the exploration of various hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and latent dimension. However, it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
