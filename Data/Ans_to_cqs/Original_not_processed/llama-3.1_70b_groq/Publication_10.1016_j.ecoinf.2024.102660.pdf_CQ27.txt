Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only discusses the data acquisition and processing, network structure, parameter setting, and evaluation metrics, as well as the performance of the Res_AUNet network on the WSGD test dataset. It does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
