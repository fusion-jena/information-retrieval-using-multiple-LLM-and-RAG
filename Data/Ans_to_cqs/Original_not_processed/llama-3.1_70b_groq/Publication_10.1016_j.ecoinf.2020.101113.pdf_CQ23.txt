Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model used is a pre-trained ResNet50 model, which was initially trained on the ImageNet dataset containing over one million photo images across 1000 classes. This suggests that the model has been exposed to a diverse range of images, which could potentially help in generalizing to new datasets.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model was fine-tuned for the specific task of spectrogram classification, which implies that the model was adapted to the specific characteristics of the dataset being used. However, it does not provide information on whether techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting were used to evaluate the model's performance.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
