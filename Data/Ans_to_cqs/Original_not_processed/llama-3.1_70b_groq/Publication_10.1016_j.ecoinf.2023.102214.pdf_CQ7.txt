Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The text discusses the importance of avoiding overfitting by tuning the number of required epochs and inspecting model outputs and error outcomes, but it does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
