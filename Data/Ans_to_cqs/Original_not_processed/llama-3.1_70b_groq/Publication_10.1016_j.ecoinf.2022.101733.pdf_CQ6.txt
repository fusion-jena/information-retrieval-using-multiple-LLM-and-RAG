Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to remote sensing, agriculture, and support vector machines (SVMs), but it does not provide information on deep learning model preprocessing.

However, I can mention that the context does discuss the importance of carefully selecting and checking samples for a classification task, as mentioned in the section "4.3. Point-wise vs. polygon-based sample selection strategies". It also mentions that the samples were checked carefully after selection, and no mis-collected samples were detected.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a normalized difference water index (NDWI) for remote sensing of vegetation liquid water, which involves normalization. However, this is not directly related to deep learning model preprocessing.

In summary, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about preprocessing steps for deep learning models.
