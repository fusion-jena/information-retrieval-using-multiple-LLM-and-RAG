Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the data preparation, model training, and fine-tuning process. It discusses the creation of merged .wav files, data augmentation, and the use of pre-trained models with external sound data. However, it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps that occur after model training.

Therefore, I do not know the specific postprocessing steps involved in this project, as they are not mentioned in the provided context.
