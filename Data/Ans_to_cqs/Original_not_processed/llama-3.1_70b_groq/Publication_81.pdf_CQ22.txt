Answer:::
The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are accuracy, recall, and F1-Score. These metrics are used to compare the performance of different models, such as the Autoencoder (AE), Stacked Autoencoder-Kernel Density Estimation (SK), and the Elastic Net-based model (ESK). The accuracy, recall, and F1-Score are calculated for each dataset, including Sciaenidae, Barbinae, and Mugilidae, and are presented in tables and figures to illustrate the performance of the models.
