Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the context, which mentions the use of convolutional layers, batch normalization, and activation layers, which are typical components of a CNN architecture. Additionally, the context mentions the use of specific CNN models such as ResNet-50, Inception V3, and DenseNet, which further supports the conclusion that the pipeline uses a CNN.
