Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that the same test set (Test) was used to evaluate the performance of models in different training phases. This suggests that the data was split into at least two parts: a training set and a test set.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model was trained on different training sets (Traini, i = 1, 2, ..., 7), which correspond to different percentages of training samples in the BMXSM data set. However, it does not provide information on how the data was split into these different training sets or whether a validation set was used.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we can only confirm that the data was split into at least two parts: a training set and a test set. The criteria used to split the data into these sets and whether a validation set was used are not specified.
