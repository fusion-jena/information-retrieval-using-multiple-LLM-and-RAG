Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning in bird species recognition, feature extraction, and selection methods. It discusses the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), feature learning, and mutual information-based feature selection methods. However, it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
