Answer:::
The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model. Instead, it mentions the use of seven different machine learning models, including Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Random Forest (RF), and Classification and Regression Tree (CART) models. 

However, it does mention that a correlation analysis of the variables was conducted before model implementation to enhance the predictive performance of the model and mitigate the risk of overfitting. This suggests that some measures were taken to ensure the robustness of the models, but it does not specifically mention measures such as cross-validation or stratified splitting. 

Additionally, the context mentions that data from the third and fourth natural environment surveys were used, which may indicate that a diverse dataset was used, but this is not explicitly stated. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to the query.
