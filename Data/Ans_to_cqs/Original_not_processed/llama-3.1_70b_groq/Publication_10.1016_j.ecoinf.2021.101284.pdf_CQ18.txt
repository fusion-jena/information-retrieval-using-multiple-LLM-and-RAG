Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. It appears to be a discussion of the results of a study on the COVID-19 epidemic in Poland, including data analysis and modeling. The text mentions various models (M1, M2, M3, M4, M5) and figures showing the W* parameters values, but it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training.
