Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context primarily focuses on the proposed ESK model, its architecture, and its performance in classifying fish from different families. It also discusses the use of Elastic Net to address overfitting and improve the generalization ability of the model. However, it does not provide information on the data splitting criteria used for training, testing, and validation.
