Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It mentions that the kernel size could be anything from 3 × 3 to 5 × 5 to 7 × 7, and the kernel could be chosen randomly, but it does not provide information on the optimization method used for hyperparameters such as grid search or random search.
