Answer: 

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). These metrics are used to compare the actual and predicted counts obtained by the models. Specifically, the RMSE and MAE scores are reported for the SLL and elephants' data sets. 

For example, the proposed Model-2 with EfficientNet feature extractor achieved an RMSE value of 1.88 and 0.60 for the SLL and elephants' data sets, respectively. In contrast, Model-K achieved an RMSE of 2.17 and 0.81 for the SLL and elephants' data sets, respectively. Similarly, Count-ception achieved an RMSE of 5.57 and 1.59 for the SLL and elephants' data sets, respectively. 

The MAE scores are also reported for the models, with Model-2 achieving an MAE of 1.09 and 0.34 for the SLL and elephants' data sets, respectively. Model-K achieved an MAE of 1.43 and 0.43 for the SLL and elephants' data sets, respectively. Count-ception achieved an MAE of 3.54 and 0.84 for the SLL and elephants' data sets, respectively.
