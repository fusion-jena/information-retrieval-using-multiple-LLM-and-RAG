Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention that the validation loss was consistently lower than the training loss before the overfitting point, as shown in Figure 5. This suggests that the training process may have been monitored for signs of overfitting, but the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete are not specified.

It is also mentioned that the training process was monitored using TensorBoard, which is a tool for visualizing and tracking the performance of machine learning models during training. This suggests that the training process may have been stopped when the validation loss stopped improving or started to increase, but this is not explicitly stated.

Therefore, the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete are not specified in the provided context.
