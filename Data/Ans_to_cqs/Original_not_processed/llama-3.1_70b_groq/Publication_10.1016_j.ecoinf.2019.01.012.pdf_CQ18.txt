Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is to track the model's accuracy and loss on both the training and validation sets. The model's performance is evaluated on the validation set during the training process, and the best model is chosen based on the two parameters accuracy and loss. The validation set is used for fine-tuning hyperparameters and model selection. Additionally, the model's performance is also evaluated on a separate test dataset containing 5796 individual tiles, which were not used during the process of model selection. This is done to assess the model's prediction error on unseen data.
