Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper or article discussing the development and evaluation of a pipeline for identifying bird and frog species in tropical soundscape recordings using a convolutional neural network. The text does not include any information about a publicly available code repository, such as a link to GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
