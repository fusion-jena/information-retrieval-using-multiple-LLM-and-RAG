Answer:::
I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of deep learning models or specific architectures such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. The text primarily discusses the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process, data mining, and data processing techniques, but it does not delve into the specifics of deep learning models or their applications. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query.
