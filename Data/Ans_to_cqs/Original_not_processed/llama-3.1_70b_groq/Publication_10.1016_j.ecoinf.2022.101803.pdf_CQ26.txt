Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on ensemble methods, such as bagging, boosting, and random forests, as well as model evaluation and optimization techniques. It does mention the use of block cross-validation to address autocorrelation of dataset structures, but this is not directly related to addressing data bias during preprocessing. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
