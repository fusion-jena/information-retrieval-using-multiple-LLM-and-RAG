Answer: 
The provided context does not explicitly mention the method used for hyperparameter optimization, such as grid search or random search. However, it does mention that "fivefold cross-validation and early stopping were employed for efficient hyperparameter optimization." This suggests that the model uses a combination of cross-validation and early stopping to optimize its hyperparameters, but the specific method used for searching the hyperparameter space is not specified.
