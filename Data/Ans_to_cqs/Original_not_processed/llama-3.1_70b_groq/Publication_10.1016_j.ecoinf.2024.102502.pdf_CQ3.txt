Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on data filtering, acquisition, and processing of Earth Observation System (EOS) data using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. It discusses the challenges of working with large datasets, the importance of flexible data scaling, and the benefits of using online data repositories and cloud computing platforms. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines.
