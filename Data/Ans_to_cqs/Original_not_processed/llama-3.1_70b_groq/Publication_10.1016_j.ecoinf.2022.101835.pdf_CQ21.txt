Answer:

After the model training, the postprocessing steps involved are:

1. **Metrics calculation**: The performance of the optimized models is evaluated by comparing the loss function (mean squared error (MSE)) of the optimized models. Additionally, the mean absolute error (MAE) and the coefficient of determination (R2) are calculated for reference.

2. **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) calculation**: The RMSE is calculated for all observation sites to evaluate the overall performance of the optimized models. Additionally, the RMSE for each observation site is calculated to evaluate the performance of the models for each site.

3. **SHAP values calculation**: SHAP values are calculated to understand the machine learning models. Specifically, the average of the absolute SHAP values for each input variable is calculated using the formula: AA_SHAPj = 1/ni * âˆ‘|SHAPi,j|, where AA_SHAPj is the average of the absolute SHAP values for input variable j, ni is the number of response values, and SHAPi,j is the SHAP value for the jth input parameter of the ith response value.
