Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the pipeline is primarily focused on image classification tasks, as it mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as ResNet and GoogLeNet, which are commonly used for image classification tasks.

The context also mentions the use of remote sensing images and high-resolution imagery classification, which suggests that the pipeline may be working with image data formats such as TIFF, JPEG, or other raster image formats. However, this is not explicitly stated, and other data formats such as CSV may also be used for tasks such as data augmentation or transfer learning.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of Tensorflow, a popular deep learning framework, which supports a wide range of data formats, including images, audio, and text data. However, without more specific information, it is difficult to determine the exact data formats used in the pipeline.
