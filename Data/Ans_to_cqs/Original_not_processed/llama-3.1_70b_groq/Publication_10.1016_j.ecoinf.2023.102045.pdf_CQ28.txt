Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a deep learning model or any specific platform used for such deployment. The context appears to be related to a research paper discussing the use of color palettes in scientific visualization, particularly for individuals with color blindness, and the development of an R package called "cblindplot" to address this issue. There is no mention of deep learning models or cloud platforms.
