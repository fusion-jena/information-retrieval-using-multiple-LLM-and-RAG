Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a random forest model and its application to a specific problem, but it does not provide information on deep learning or random seed values. Therefore, I cannot provide a meaningful answer to the query based on the provided context.
