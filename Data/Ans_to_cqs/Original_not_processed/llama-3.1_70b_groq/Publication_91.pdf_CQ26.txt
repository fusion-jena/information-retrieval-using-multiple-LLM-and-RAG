Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention data augmentation techniques used to gain a more robust and better generalizing classifier. These techniques include:

- Flipping images horizontally
- Flipping images vertically
- Adjusting brightness by ±12.5%
- Adjusting saturation by ±50.0%
- Adjusting contrast by ±12.5%
- Adjusting hue by ±20%

These data augmentation techniques can help increase the diversity of the training data, which may help reduce data bias. However, it is not explicitly stated that these techniques are used to address data bias.

Additionally, the context mentions that the dataset is split into training, validation, and testing sets in the proportions 80:10:10, but it does not mention whether the splitting is stratified or not.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions that the dataset is large, with 426,876 images, and that the authors have previously suggested that a minimum of 200 images per species are required for accurate species identification. However, in this study, five out of six species with fewer than 200 pollen grains were classified with an accuracy higher than 90%. This suggests that the dataset may be relatively balanced, but it is not explicitly stated.

In summary, while the context mentions data augmentation techniques that may help reduce data bias, it does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
