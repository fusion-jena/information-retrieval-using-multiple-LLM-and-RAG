Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided pieces of context do not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily discusses the architecture of the neural network, the use of pre-trained models, and the data pre-processing steps, including segmentation, downsampling, and conversion to log-mel spectrograms. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
