Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The text primarily focuses on the architectures used for video prediction, including Transformer-based architectures and Convolutional LSTM networks, as well as the implementation details using PyTorch Lightning and hyperparameter optimization using Optuna. It does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.
