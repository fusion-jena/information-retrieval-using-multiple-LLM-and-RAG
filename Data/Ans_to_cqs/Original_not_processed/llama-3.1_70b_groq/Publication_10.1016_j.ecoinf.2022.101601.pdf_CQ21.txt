Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context appears to be related to model pre-validation and references various research papers on topics such as permafrost degradation, tuberculosis epidemiology, and thermal analysis. However, it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps involved after model training. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this query.
