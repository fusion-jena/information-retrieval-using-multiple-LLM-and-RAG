Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. The text mentions the use of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model, specifically a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) architecture, but it does not specify the framework used to implement this model. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
