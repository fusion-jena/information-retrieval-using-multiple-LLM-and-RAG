Answer: 

The study used a 10-fold cross-validation technique to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. This is mentioned in the text as "10-fold cross-validation of the deep learning models" (Table 3). Cross-validation is a technique used to evaluate the performance of a model by training and testing it on multiple subsets of the data. This helps to ensure that the model is not overfitting to a specific subset of the data and can generalize well to new, unseen data.

There is no mention of using a diverse dataset or stratified splitting in the provided text. However, the use of 10-fold cross-validation suggests that the study took steps to ensure the generalizability of the model by evaluating its performance on multiple subsets of the data.
