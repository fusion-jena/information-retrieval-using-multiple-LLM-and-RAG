Answer: 
The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, it appears that the data is related to water quality parameters, and the units of measurement are provided in the format of mg/L, Î¼S/cm, MPN/100 mL, etc. This suggests that the data is likely in a tabular format, possibly in CSV (Comma Separated Values) format, as it contains numerical values and units of measurement. There is no indication of image, audio, or video data being used in the pipeline.
