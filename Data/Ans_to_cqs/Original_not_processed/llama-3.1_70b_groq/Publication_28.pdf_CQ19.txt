Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models. It discusses various deep learning architectures such as VAE (Variational Autoencoder), CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), and mentions the use of pre-trained models like VGG19, AlexNet, Resnet50, and GoogLeNet. However, it does not provide information about the frameworks used to implement these models.

It mentions the use of Apache Spark for accelerating deep learning inference for large-scale satellite image analytics, but it does not provide information about the framework used for building the deep learning models.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine which frameworks are used to build the deep learning models.
