Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on the description of a specific model, MLPnn-MC, which integrates a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) algorithm and Markov chain for land use and land cover (LULC) simulation. It also provides information on the MLP parameters and performance, but it does not discuss preprocessing steps.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to perform preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning before training a model. These steps help to prepare the data for training by reducing the impact of feature scales, handling missing values, and removing noise or outliers.

Since the context does not provide specific information on preprocessing steps, I cannot provide a definitive answer. If you have any further questions or need more information on preprocessing steps in general, I'll be happy to help.
