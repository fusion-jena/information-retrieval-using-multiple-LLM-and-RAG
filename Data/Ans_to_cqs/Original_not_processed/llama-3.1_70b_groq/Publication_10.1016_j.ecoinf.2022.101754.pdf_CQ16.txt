Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. It only mentions that "Tuning of the hyperparameter on the training set was done for each set" and that "model training using an optimal setting of the hyperparameter" was performed. However, it does not provide information on the specific stopping criteria used to determine when training is complete.
