Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly state the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention the number of epochs used for training each model. 

For the PConv networks and Pix2Pix networks, the context states that they were trained for 50 epochs. For the classification networks, it is mentioned that they were trained for 20 epochs.

While the context does not explicitly mention a validation loss plateau as a stopping criterion, it does provide information on the number of epochs used for training. It can be inferred that the training process was stopped after a fixed number of epochs, but the exact criteria used to determine the completion of training are not specified.
