Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of a "random Gaussian initialization" for weight initialization, which suggests that randomness is introduced in the model's weights at the beginning of the training process.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a dropout of 50% as a regularization technique to prevent overfitting. Dropout is a technique that randomly sets a fraction of the neurons to zero during training, which can help to reduce overfitting by preventing the model from relying too heavily on any single neuron.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of an Adam Solver type as the learning algorithm, which is a stochastic optimization algorithm that uses random gradients to update the model's weights. However, the context does not provide information on how the randomness in the Adam Solver is handled.

Overall, while the context does not provide a comprehensive answer to the question of how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline, it does suggest that randomness is introduced in the model's weights and during the training process through the use of random Gaussian initialization and dropout.
