Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on machine learning applications in ecology, particularly in inferring animal behavior from movement data. It mentions various machine learning algorithms such as random forests, support vector machines, and hidden Markov models, but does not provide information on the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline.

The context does mention the use of ACC (accelerometer) data, location data, and movement data, but it does not specify the format of these data (e.g., CSV, image, audio, video). Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
