Answer:::
The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data. The text mentions that the dataset consists of images, which are used to train and test deep learning models. Specifically, it mentions that the images are resized to 224 Ã— 224 pixels and used as input for the ResNet-34 architecture. Additionally, the text mentions that the Convolutional Autoencoder is used to extract features from the images, resulting in a compact and informative feature matrix. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
