Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it appears that the data is primarily in the form of weather data, micro-meteorological data, and feature data (e.g., NDVI, NDWI, DOY) that are used to estimate evapotranspiration (ETo).

The context mentions that the data is recorded at sub-hourly time-steps, which suggests that the data may be in a time-series format. Additionally, the mention of variables such as U2, Rs, RHmin, RHmax, Tmin, Tmax, ETo, SWC, NDVI, NDWI, DOY suggests that the data may be in a tabular or CSV format.

However, without more explicit information, it is difficult to say for certain what data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline. It is possible that the data is preprocessed and transformed into a different format before being used in the pipeline.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are likely to be tabular or CSV, but this is not explicitly stated in the provided context.
