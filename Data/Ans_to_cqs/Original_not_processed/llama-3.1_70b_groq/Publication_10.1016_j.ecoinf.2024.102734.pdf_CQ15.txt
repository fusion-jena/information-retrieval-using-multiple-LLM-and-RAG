Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. The context primarily focuses on semi-supervised learning techniques, active learning, and feature extraction model selection, but does not delve into the details of optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
