Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, except for one instance where "dropout" is mentioned as a hyperparameter that can be optimized to improve model performance. However, it does not provide further details on the specific regularization methods used.

Additionally, the context mentions that "progressive learning" was used to adapt regularization to the image size, but it does not provide more information on the specific regularization techniques used.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the only regularization method that can be confirmed is "dropout". However, it is likely that other regularization methods such as L2 regularization, batch normalization, etc. may have been used, but this information is not available in the provided context.
