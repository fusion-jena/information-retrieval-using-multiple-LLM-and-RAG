Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the datasets are divided into a training set and a test set according to a ratio of 8:2, and the accuracy on the test set is used as an indicator to evaluate the performance of the classification models. This suggests that the model performance is evaluated on a separate test set after training, but the specific strategy used to monitor performance during training is not mentioned.
