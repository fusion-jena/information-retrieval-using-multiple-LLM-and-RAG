Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to remote sensing and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) reconstruction, with references to various research papers and a study using MCD43A4 V6.1 data from the Google Earth Engine platform. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline.
