Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the purpose of a deep learning model. However, based on the context, it appears that the study is focused on using automated signal recognition software to monitor bird species, particularly cryptic and nocturnal species. The study aims to assess the effectiveness of this approach in gaining insights into the ecology of species with limited information available.

One of the references mentioned, LeBien et al. (2020), mentions the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for identifying bird and frog species in tropical soundscape recordings. This suggests that the deep learning model may be used for classification purposes, such as identifying species based on their vocalizations.

However, without more explicit information, it is difficult to determine the exact purpose of the deep learning model. Therefore, I can only provide a speculative answer based on the context.

If I had to guess, I would say that the purpose of the deep learning model is likely classification, specifically species identification based on audio recordings. However, I would like to emphasize that this is only a speculative answer, and more information is needed to provide a definitive answer.
