Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention that the model was trained on very high-resolution images, and the validation dataset was used to segment 1195 objects. It also mentions that the model was applied to individual tree species mapping in tropical forests, suggesting that the dataset may be a custom or specialized dataset for this specific task.
