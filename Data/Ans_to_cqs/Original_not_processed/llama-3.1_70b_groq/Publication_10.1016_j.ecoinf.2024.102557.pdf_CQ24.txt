Answer: I don't know. The provided context does not mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or the use of random seed values. The context appears to be focused on the use of machine learning algorithms, specifically random forest models, for predicting fungal productivity and species distribution modeling. It does mention the use of the "ranger" R package for implementing random forest models, but it does not discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
