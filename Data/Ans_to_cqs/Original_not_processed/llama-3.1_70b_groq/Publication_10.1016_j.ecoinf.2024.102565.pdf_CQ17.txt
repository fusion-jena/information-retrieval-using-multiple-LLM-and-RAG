Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the K-fold cross-validation technique, neural networks (NN), and their application in a specific study. It does not delve into the specifics of regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization.

However, it does mention that random under-sampling (RUS) was applied to the training set to address imbalances, but this is not a regularization method per se. It's a technique used to handle class imbalance issues.

Therefore, I don't know the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, as this information is not provided in the given context.
