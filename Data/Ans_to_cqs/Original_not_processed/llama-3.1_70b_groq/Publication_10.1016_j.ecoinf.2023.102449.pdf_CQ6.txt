Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does describe the pre-processing block used in the encoder, which includes:

* A convolution with a wide receptive field (5 × 5 kernel)
* Signal coarsening along the time axis (2 × 1 kernel)
* Coarsening using the concatenated output of 2 × 2 maximum and 2 × 2 average pooling, recombined using a 1 × 1 convolution

Additionally, the context mentions that the feature representations are chunked along the time axis into T = 19 independent frames, each corresponding to 3.072 s, and then flattened and passed through a final linear layer.

It also mentions that batch normalization is used to mitigate internal covariate shift and stabilize training residual networks, which allows for the use of higher learning rates and reduces power usage.

However, it does not provide information on other preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, the answer to the query is incomplete based on the provided context.
