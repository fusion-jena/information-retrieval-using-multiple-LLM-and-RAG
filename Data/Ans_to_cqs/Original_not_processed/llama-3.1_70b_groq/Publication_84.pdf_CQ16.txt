Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that the optimal number of iterations in SAE (Stacked Autoencoder) is estimated based on the mean error and number of misclassified points (Fig. 6). 

Additionally, the context mentions that the number of iterations for SAE is set to a range of 7132-9756, but it does not provide information on how this range was determined or what criteria were used to stop the training process. 

Therefore, based on the provided context, the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete are not explicitly stated.
