Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does provide a confusion matrix (Table 1) that shows the classification results of the YAMNet-based classifier. The matrix includes the predicted and actual classes, as well as the percentage of correct and incorrect classifications.

From the confusion matrix, we can infer that the model's performance is evaluated in terms of accuracy, as the percentages in the matrix represent the proportion of correctly classified instances. However, the context does not provide information on other metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, or mean average precision.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we can only confirm that accuracy is one of the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. We do not have enough information to determine if other metrics are used.
