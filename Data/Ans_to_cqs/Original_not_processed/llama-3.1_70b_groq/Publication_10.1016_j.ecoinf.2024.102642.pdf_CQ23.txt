Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the models were trained on annotations from both novices and an expert, and that the performance of the models was evaluated using metrics such as AUC and mAP.

It is mentioned that the models were trained on aggregated annotation sets of novices using majority voting, and that the performance of the model trained on the expert's annotations was used as a reference. This suggests that the models were trained on a dataset that was annotated by multiple individuals, which could potentially increase the diversity of the annotations and improve the generalizability of the model.

Additionally, the context mentions that the hyperparameters were kept consistent across all training instances for each task, which could help to ensure that the results are comparable across different models. However, it does not provide information on whether techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting were used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

Therefore, while the context provides some information on the training and evaluation of the deep learning model, it does not provide a complete answer to the question of what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.
