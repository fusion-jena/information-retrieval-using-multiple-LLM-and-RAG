Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. It only mentions that the model was trained on a training set, validated on a validation set, and evaluated on an independent test set of 2060 images. However, it does not provide information on how the data was split into these sets.
