Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The text only discusses the concepts of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), model performance assessment techniques, and hyperparameter tuning, but it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training the model.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
