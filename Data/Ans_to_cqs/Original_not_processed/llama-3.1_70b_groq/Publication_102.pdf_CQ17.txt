Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, it does mention the use of early stopping technique to avoid over-fitting in Model-2. Early stopping is a regularization method that stops the training process when the model's performance on the validation set starts to degrade, preventing overfitting. 

Additionally, the context mentions the use of batch normalization in the contracting path of the proposed model, which can also help to prevent overfitting by normalizing the input data for each layer. However, it does not provide information on other regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization.
