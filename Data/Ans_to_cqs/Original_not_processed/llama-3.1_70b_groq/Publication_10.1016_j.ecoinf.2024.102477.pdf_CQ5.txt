Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the application of deep learning methods for time-series prediction, specifically for air pollution analysis on carbon monoxide in Taiwan. It mentions the use of SLSTM and SGRU models, but does not provide information on the datasets used. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
