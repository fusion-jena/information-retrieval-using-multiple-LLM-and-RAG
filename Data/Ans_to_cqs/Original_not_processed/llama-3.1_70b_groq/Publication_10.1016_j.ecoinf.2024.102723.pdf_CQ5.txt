Answer: 
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the implementation of Neural Networks using TensorFlow and Keras, and the development of Bayesian Deep Learning models for regression problems, but it does not provide information about the datasets used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
