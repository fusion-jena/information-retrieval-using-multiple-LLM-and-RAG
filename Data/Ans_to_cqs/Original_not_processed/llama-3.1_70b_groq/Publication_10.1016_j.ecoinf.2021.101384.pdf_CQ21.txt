Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any information about model training, saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context appears to be related to a workflow for estimating fishing pressure on stocks and other species, using vessel tracking data and environmental, biodiversity, and fishery data. It discusses the process of associating information on stocks, species variety, and threatening status to fishing hours, but does not mention any machine learning or model training steps. Therefore, I do not have enough information to answer the query about postprocessing steps involved after model training.
