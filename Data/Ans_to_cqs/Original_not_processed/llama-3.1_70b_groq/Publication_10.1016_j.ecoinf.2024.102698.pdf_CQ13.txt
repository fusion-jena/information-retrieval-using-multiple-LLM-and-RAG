Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. It only mentions that a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model was used to generate synthetic connectivity data, and that the model was implemented using the y-data-synthetic Python package. However, it does not provide any information about the hyperparameters used to train the model.
