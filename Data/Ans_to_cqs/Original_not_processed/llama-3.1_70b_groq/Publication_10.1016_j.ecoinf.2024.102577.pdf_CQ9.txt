Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research article or a paper that discusses the use of machine learning for sustainable Indian Ocean tuna purse seine fishery, but it does not provide information on where the data repository is hosted. The context mentions various research institutions and publications, but it does not mention Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other data repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
