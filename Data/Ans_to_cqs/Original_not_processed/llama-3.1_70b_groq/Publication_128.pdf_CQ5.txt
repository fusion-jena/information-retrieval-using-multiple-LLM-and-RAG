Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the input data resolution is 224Ã—224 with Red Green Blue (RGB) format, which is a common resolution for the ImageNet dataset. Additionally, the context mentions AlexNet, which is a model that was originally trained on the ImageNet dataset.

While it is not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that the ImageNet dataset might be one of the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, there is no mention of MNIST or CIFAR datasets in the provided context.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used, but it can be inferred that ImageNet might be one of them.
