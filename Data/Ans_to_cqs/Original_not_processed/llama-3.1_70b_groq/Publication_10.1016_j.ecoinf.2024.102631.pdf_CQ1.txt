Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the architecture and performance of a deep learning model, specifically a network that uses Spatial and Channel Attention (SCA) modules to enhance its capacity for capturing fine-grained features and context. The context also includes quantitative comparisons of the model's performance on various datasets (C-60, U45, and UCCS) using metrics such as UIQM, UCIQE, and NIQE.

There is no mention of data collection methods, such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
