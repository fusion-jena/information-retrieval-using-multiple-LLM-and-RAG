Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the text, it appears to be related to species distribution modeling and ecological informatics. The context mentions "species distribution data", "detecting outliers", and "species distribution model", which suggests that the deep learning model may be used for classification or regression tasks, such as predicting the presence or absence of a species in a given area, or modeling the distribution of a species based on environmental factors. However, without more specific information, it is difficult to determine the exact purpose of the deep learning model.
