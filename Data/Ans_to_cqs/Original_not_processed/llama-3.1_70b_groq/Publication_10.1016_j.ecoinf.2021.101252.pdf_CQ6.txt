Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily discusses the AutoML procedure, which involves generating candidate models, training them on a small subset of data, and selecting the best-performing model. It also presents the results of three case studies, showing the accuracy of candidate models and the predictive performance of the selected models.

However, it can be inferred that some preprocessing steps might be involved, as the context mentions that the AutoML procedure starts by generating candidate models with architectures and hyperparameters selected at random from a prespecified range of values. This might imply that the data has been preprocessed to some extent, but the specific steps involved are not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query. If you have any further context or clarification regarding the preprocessing steps, I would be happy to try and assist you further.
