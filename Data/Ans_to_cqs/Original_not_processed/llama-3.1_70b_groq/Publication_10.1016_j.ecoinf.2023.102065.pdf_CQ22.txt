Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are precision and recall. Specifically, the paper mentions "total precision" and "total recall" as the metrics used to assess the performance of the CNN-XC models and BirdNET. 

Total precision is defined as the proportion of true positives among all predicted positive instances, while total recall is the proportion of true positives among all actual positive instances. The paper also presents precision-recall curves, which show the trade-off between precision and recall at different probability thresholds. 

Additionally, the paper mentions that the authors set a target total recall of 20% for their application, and evaluate the performance of the models at different thresholds (ranging from 0.65 to 0.99) to achieve this target. Overall, the paper suggests that both precision and recall are important metrics for evaluating the performance of the deep learning model in this context.
