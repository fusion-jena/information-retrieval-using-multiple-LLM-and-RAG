Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context appears to be related to air quality and pollution studies, with some references to deep learning and LSTM models, but it does not delve into the details of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

However, I can provide some general information on handling randomness in deep learning pipelines. In deep learning, randomness can be introduced through various sources, such as random weight initialization, random sampling of training data, and random shuffling of data. To handle this randomness, researchers often employ techniques such as:

* Setting a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results
* Using techniques like dropout and batch normalization to reduce overfitting
* Averaging model predictions over multiple runs with different random seeds
* Using ensemble methods to combine predictions from multiple models trained with different random seeds

However, without more specific information from the context, I cannot provide a more detailed answer to the query.
