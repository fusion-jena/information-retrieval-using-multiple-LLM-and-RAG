Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, species distribution modeling, and data analysis, but it does not provide information on the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline.

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the data used in the analysis is likely to be in the form of CSV (Comma Separated Values) files, as the context mentions variables such as "Land Area", "Forest Area", "Water Area", and others, which are typical of ecological data. Additionally, the context mentions the use of data from sources such as eBird, Pl@ntNet, iNaturalist, and Observation.org, which may provide data in CSV or other formats.

But, without explicit information on the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
