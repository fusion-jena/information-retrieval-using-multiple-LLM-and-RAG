Answer: The text does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention that the Random Forest (RF) model uses bootstrap aggregation and randomisation of predictors to obtain a high level of predicted accuracy. This suggests that the model's performance may be evaluated through techniques such as out-of-bag error or cross-validation, but the specific strategy used is not mentioned.
