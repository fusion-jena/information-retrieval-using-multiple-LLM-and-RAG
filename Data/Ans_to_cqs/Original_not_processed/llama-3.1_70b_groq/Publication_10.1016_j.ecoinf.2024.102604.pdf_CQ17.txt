Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling, environmental covariates, and bias correction methods, but it does not touch on deep learning or regularization techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
