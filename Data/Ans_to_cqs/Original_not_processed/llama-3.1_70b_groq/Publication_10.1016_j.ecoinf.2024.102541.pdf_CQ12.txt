Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a convolutional neural network (CNN). This is evident from the various references to CNNs in the provided context, such as "Dense convolutional neural networks based multiclass plant disease detection and classification using leaf images" (Tiwari et al., 2021) and "Wild animal detection from highly cluttered images using deep convolutional neural network" (Verma and Gupta, 2018). Additionally, the context mentions the use of specific CNN architectures, such as Inception-v4 and ResNet (Szegedy et al., 2017), and YOLOv5 (Liu et al., 2023a), which is a real-time object detection system based on CNNs. There is no mention of RNNs or Transformers being used in the pipeline.
