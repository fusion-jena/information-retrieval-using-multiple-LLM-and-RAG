Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the training process, data augmentation, and comparison with a baseline model, but it does not provide information on regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
