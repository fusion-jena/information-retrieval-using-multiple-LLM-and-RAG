Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is object detection. The text mentions that the model generates "tentative annotations" with bounding boxes and confidence scores, indicating that it is designed to detect objects within images. Additionally, the model is trained on a dataset with manual annotations, which is typical for object detection tasks. The text also mentions that the model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as recall and precision, which are commonly used to evaluate object detection models.
