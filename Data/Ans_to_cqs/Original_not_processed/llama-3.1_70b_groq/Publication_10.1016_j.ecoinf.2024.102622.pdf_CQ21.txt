Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context appears to be focused on the performance evaluation of different machine learning models (MLR, RF, SVM, XGboost, and MLP) for estimating rice canopy coverage and chlorophyll content. It discusses the accuracy evaluation of these models using metrics such as R2, RMSE, and REP (%), but it does not provide information on postprocessing steps like saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training based on the provided context.
