Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on a proposed deep learning framework for highway air quality monitoring and prediction, and it discusses the architecture and functionality of the framework, as well as some results and future research directions. However, it does not provide information on the datasets used in the pipeline. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
