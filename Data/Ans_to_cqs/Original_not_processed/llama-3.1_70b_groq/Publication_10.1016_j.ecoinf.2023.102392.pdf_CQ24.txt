Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context appears to be focused on ecological informatics, land use/land cover classification, and forest type classification using machine learning models like XGBoost.

However, I can provide some general information on handling randomness in deep learning pipelines. In deep learning, randomness can be introduced through various sources, such as random weight initialization, dropout, and data augmentation. To handle randomness, researchers and practitioners often employ techniques like:

1. Setting a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results.
2. Using techniques like batch normalization and regularization to reduce the impact of randomness.
3. Averaging model predictions over multiple runs with different random seeds.
4. Using ensemble methods that combine the predictions of multiple models trained with different random seeds.

Unfortunately, the provided context does not provide specific information on these strategies or any other methods employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
