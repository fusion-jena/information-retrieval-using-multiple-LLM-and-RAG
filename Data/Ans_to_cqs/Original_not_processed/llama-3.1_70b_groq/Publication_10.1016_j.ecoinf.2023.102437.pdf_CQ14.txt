Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, it does mention that the study by Azedou et al. (2023) is referenced, which is titled "Enhancing land cover/land use (LCLU) classification through a comparative analysis of hyperparameters optimization approaches for deep neural network (DNN)". This suggests that hyperparameter optimization is a relevant topic in the context of the study, but the specific method used (e.g., grid search, random search) is not mentioned in the provided text.
