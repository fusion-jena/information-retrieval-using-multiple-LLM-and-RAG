Answer:::
The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training is K-fold cross-validation. Specifically, the dataset is partitioned into 5 distinct subsets, and each subset undergoes evaluation. The final result is derived from the average of these evaluations. This is mentioned in the text as: "We utilize K-fold cross-validation to partition the dataset into 5 distinct subsets.
