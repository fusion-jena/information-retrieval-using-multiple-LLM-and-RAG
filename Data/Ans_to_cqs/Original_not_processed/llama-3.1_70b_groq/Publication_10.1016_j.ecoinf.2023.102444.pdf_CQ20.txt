Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses the application of UMAP to estimate species distribution based on bioclimatic variables, and mentions the use of convolutional neural networks in other studies, but does not provide information on the hardware resources used for training the model.
