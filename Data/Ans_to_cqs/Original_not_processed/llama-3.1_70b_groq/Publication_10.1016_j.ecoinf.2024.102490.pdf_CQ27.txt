Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The text discusses the development and evaluation of climate models, specifically BBC-CSM2-MR and MIROC6, but it does not provide information on the deployment process.

The context mentions the use of committee averaging and weighted mean approaches to create ensemble models, and the selection of models with a TSS score of â‰¥0.7. However, it does not discuss model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related processes.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
