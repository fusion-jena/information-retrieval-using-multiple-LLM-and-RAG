Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The context discusses the use of the ERNIE model and its performance in various tasks, but it does not provide details on the hyperparameters used in the model. Additionally, the context mentions the use of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling, but it does not discuss the hyperparameters used in this technique either. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide an answer to this question.
