Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The context only mentions the experimental design, including the training parameter settings (e.g., batch size, input image resolution, number of epochs, learning rate, and optimizer), but it does not specify the stopping criteria for training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
