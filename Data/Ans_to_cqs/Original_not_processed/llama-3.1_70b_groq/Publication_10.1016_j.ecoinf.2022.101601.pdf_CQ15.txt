Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be related to permafrost modeling, geohazard indices, and Bayesian networks, but it does not discuss deep learning or optimization techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
