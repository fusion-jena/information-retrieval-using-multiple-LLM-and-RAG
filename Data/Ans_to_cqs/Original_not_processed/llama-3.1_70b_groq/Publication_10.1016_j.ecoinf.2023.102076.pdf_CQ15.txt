Answer: According to the provided context, the optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline is Adam optimization (Kingma and Ba, 2014). This is mentioned in the context as the method used for fine-tuning the whole architecture, including the base model and the linear classification layer, during training. There is no mention of other optimization techniques such as SGD being used in the pipeline.
