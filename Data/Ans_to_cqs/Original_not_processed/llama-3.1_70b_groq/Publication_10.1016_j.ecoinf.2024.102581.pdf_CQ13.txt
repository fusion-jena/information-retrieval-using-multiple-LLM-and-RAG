Answer:

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are listed in Table 4 of the provided context. The hyperparameters and their ranges are as follows:

* Convolution Layers: 1 to 10
* Filters: 1 to 64
* Filter Size: 1 to 10
* Number of Neurons: 32 to 1024
* Batch Size: 8 to 512
* Epochs: 1 to 25
* CNN Model Optimizer: ADAM, SGD, RMSProp, Adadelta, Adagrad, Adamax

Note that the learning rate is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, the optimizer hyperparameter is listed, which includes popular optimizers such as ADAM, SGD, and RMSProp, among others.
