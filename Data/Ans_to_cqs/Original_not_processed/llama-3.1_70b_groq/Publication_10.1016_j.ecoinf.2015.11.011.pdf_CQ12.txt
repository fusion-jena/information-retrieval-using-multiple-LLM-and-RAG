Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of deep learning models such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer in the pipeline. It mentions the use of machine learning techniques in conjunction with segmentation to classify images, but it does not provide specific details about the type of deep learning model used. The context primarily focuses on the use of multi-resolution segmentation, multi-threshold segmentation, and ArcGIS's 'classify' tool for raster symbology. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
