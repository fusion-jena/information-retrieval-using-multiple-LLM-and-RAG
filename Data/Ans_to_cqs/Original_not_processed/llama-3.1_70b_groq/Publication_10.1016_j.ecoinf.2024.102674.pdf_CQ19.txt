Answer: None of the provided context mentions the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context only mentions the use of the GBM R package for fitting Generalized Boosted Models and the NEURALNETTOOLS R package for assessing variable importance in Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), but it does not provide information on the frameworks used for building the deep learning model.
