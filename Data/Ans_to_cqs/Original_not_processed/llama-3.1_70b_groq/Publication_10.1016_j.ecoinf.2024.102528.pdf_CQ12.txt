Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It only mentions that the framework relies on the BirdNET-Analyzer deep learning model, but it does not provide further details about the architecture of the model. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
