Answer:::

The text does not provide a comprehensive overview of the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that specific format image annotation files were required for training the object detection algorithm, and that the AUDD provides annotation files in the MS-COCO format. These annotation files needed to be converted into a usable text format for the ground truth bounding box annotation files.

It can be inferred that bounding box annotation is one of the data annotation techniques used in the pipeline, as the text mentions the need for ground truth bounding box annotation files. However, there is no mention of instance segmentation or other data annotation techniques.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that bounding box annotation is one of the data annotation techniques used in the pipeline, but the text does not provide information on other techniques that may be used.
