Answer:

The provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention an "outlier detection and artificial data replacement process" was applied to the dataset, as reported by Casillas-Garc√≠a et al. (2021). This suggests that some form of data preprocessing was performed to handle outliers, but it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias.

Additionally, the context mentions that the dataset was split into a full dataset and a best training subset (BTS) composed of sites selected by CA and TSA. This could be interpreted as a form of data selection or sampling, but it is not explicitly stated as a technique to address data bias.

The context does not mention stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection as techniques used to address data bias. Therefore, I do not know what specific techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline in this context.
