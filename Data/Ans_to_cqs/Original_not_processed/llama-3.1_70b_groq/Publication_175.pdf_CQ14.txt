Answer:::
The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the same hyperparameters (e.g., model architecture and training process) are used when training the same DL architecture on different datasets (AT0 and AT1). It does not provide information on the method used to optimize these hyperparameters, such as grid search or random search.
