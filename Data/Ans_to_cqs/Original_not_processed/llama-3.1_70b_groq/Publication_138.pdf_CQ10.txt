Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention a code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper discussing various deep learning architectures, including ICSNet, LeNet, AlexNet, VGG-19, GoogLeNet, and ResNet, but it does not provide any information about a code repository.
