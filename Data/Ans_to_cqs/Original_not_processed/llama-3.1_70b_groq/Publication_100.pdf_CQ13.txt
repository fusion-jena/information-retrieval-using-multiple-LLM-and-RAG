Answer:::

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows:

- The base learning rate (α) is 10^−4.
- The learning rate is automatically reduced by a factor of 0.1 when the validation loss has not improved for 15 consecutive epochs.
- The optimizer used is the Adam variant of stochastic gradient descent (SGD), with the following hyperparameters:
  - β1 = 0.9
  - β2 = 0.999
  - ε = 10^−8
- Weight decay is applied to control the strength of the unit Gaussian prior, with an empirically chosen magnitude of 10^−3 that is inversely proportional to the hyperparameter λ from Eq. (1).
- The batch size (B) is 64.

These hyperparameters were used to train the model on a single Nvidia RTX2080Ti GPU for approximately 14 days.
