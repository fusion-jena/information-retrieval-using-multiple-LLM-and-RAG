Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the location of the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the challenges of processing high-resolution remote sensing data, the importance of training samples, and the use of feature optimization tools. It also mentions specific studies and research papers, but does not provide information about the data repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
