Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the development and training of the ESK model, which combines Elastic Net-Stacked Autoencoder (EN-SAE) with Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) for fish classification using DNA barcode sequences. It discusses the importance of addressing overfitting in small datasets and the benefits of using Elastic Net to improve the model's performance. However, it does not provide information on model deployment, such as model serialization or platform selection.
