Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and components of the neural network, including the SPPF module, neck network, feature fusion, and attention mechanism. It also describes the C2f module and its operations, including Conv2d convolution, BatchNorm2d, and activation functions. However, it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used for training the network. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
