Answer: I don't know. The provided context does not mention a code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It only provides information about the model architecture, specifically the encoder and decoder, and some details about the pre-processing block and the output of the encoder. There is no mention of a code repository or a link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other version control platform.
