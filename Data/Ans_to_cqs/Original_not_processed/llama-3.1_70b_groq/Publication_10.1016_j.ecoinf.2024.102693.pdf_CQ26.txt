Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the performance of different models, such as ViT, CNN, and Volo, on the IP102 dataset, and the use of advanced deep transfer-learning strategies and multiple data augmentation techniques to improve model performance. However, it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
