Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a passage about a study on Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) using Geographic Information System (GIS) and remote sensing image data. The context discusses the study area, land use classification, and image processing techniques, but it does not mention deep learning or data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
