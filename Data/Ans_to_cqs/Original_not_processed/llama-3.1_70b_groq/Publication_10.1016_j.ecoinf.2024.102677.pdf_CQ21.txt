Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the model training process, evaluation metrics, and the selection of the best-performing model (ResNet50). It also discusses the application of the selected model to classify the case study area, but it does not delve into the postprocessing steps.

However, the context does mention the calculation of evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, as shown in Table 6. But it does not provide information on other postprocessing steps like Saliency maps or Confusion matrix.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, apart from the calculation of evaluation metrics mentioned in the context.
