Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of simple crop and resize data augmentation with the default settings of Caffe, which suggests that some form of data preprocessing was performed.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of batch normalization, which is a technique used to normalize the input data for each layer in a neural network. This is done to improve the stability and speed of training. However, it does not provide information on other preprocessing steps such as scaling or cleaning.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the only preprocessing step that can be confirmed is the use of simple crop and resize data augmentation and batch normalization. Other preprocessing steps may have been performed, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.
