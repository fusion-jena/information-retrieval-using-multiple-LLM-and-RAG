Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does mention that the traditional approach of manually annotating images is not feasible for collecting large amounts of individually labelled data, especially in wild animal populations.

The context suggests that the authors are using a different approach to collect training data, which involves using RFID technology to automatically label images. This approach allows for the collection of large amounts of data without the need for manual annotation. However, the specific annotation techniques used to prepare the data for training the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
