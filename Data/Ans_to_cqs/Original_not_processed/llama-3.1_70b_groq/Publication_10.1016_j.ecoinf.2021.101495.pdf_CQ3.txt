Answer: The data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that "experienced analysts" annotate the selected images by "delineating and assigning each fish to a class" (Step 1 of the training/validation module). This suggests that the annotation technique used is likely instance segmentation, where each fish is delineated (or segmented) and assigned a class label. There is no mention of bounding box annotation.
