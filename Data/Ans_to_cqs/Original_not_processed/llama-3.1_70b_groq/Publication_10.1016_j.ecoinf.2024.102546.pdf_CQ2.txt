Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the references to image datasets, such as the "DeepWeeds: a multiclass weed species image dataset for deep learning" by Olsen et al. (2019), it can be inferred that image data is used in the pipeline. Additionally, the context mentions the use of metadata, such as camera, date, and capture time, which is often stored in formats like CSV. However, there is no explicit mention of audio or video data formats being used.
