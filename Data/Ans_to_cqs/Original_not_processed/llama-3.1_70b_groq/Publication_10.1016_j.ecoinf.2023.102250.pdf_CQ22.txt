Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model include:

1. Accuracy: calculated as (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
2. Precision: calculated as TP / (TP + FP)
3. Recall: calculated as TP / (TP + FN)
4. F1-score: not explicitly defined in the provided context, but typically calculated as the harmonic mean of precision and recall
5. Top-1 accuracy: not explicitly defined in the provided context, but typically refers to the proportion of correctly classified samples among the top 1 predicted class
6. Top-5 accuracy: not explicitly defined in the provided context, but typically refers to the proportion of correctly classified samples among the top 5 predicted classes
7. Top-1 error: not explicitly defined in the provided context, but typically refers to the proportion of misclassified samples among the top 1 predicted class
8. Top-5 error: not explicitly defined in the provided context, but typically refers to the proportion of misclassified samples among the top 5 predicted classes

Additionally, the Inception Score (IS) and Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) are used to evaluate the quality of generated images. The IS is calculated as exp(E[DKL(p(y|x) || p(y))]), where x represents the input image, y represents the corresponding label, p(y|x) denotes the probability distribution of categories given the input image x, and p(y) represents the distribution of category labels.
