Answer:::
The text does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that the authors performed an exhaustive search for the fully connected architecture for all mono-site and multi-site models, and compared the training, validation, and testing performance to avoid overfitting. This suggests that the authors may have used some form of early stopping or monitoring of validation performance to determine when to stop training, but the specific criteria used are not specified.
