Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model in the provided context is classification. Specifically, the model is used to classify coral images into two categories: bleached coral and healthy coral. The model takes an image as input, extracts features using handcrafted descriptors and D-CNNs (such as AlexNet), and then uses a classifier (such as SVM) to predict whether the image represents bleached coral or healthy coral. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, F1-score, and Cohen's Kappa.
