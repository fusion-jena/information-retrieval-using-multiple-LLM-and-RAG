Answer:::
The optimization technique applied in the deep learning pipeline is the RMSprop stochastic descent optimizer. This is mentioned in the context as the chosen optimizer with the default parameters. RMSprop is a popular optimization algorithm used in deep learning to adapt the learning rate for each parameter based on the magnitude of the gradient. It is known for its ability to handle non-stationary objectives and to converge faster than traditional stochastic gradient descent (SGD) methods.
