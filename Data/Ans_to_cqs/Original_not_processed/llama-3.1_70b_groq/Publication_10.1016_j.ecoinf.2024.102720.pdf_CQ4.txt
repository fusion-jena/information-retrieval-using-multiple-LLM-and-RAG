Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Flipping, Rotating, or Scaling. The context appears to be focused on research in natural areas, such as agro-land ecology, and the use of various machine learning models, including deep learning, for analyzing and predicting ecological phenomena. However, it does not provide details on the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. If you have any further context or clarification, I would be happy to try and assist you further.
