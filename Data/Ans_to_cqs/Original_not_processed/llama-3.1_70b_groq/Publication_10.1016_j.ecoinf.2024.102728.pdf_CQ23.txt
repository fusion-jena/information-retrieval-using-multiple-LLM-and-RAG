Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context appears to be a collection of references and descriptions of various studies, datasets, and methodologies, but it does not provide information on the specific techniques used to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model.

However, one of the references (Cohen, N., Shashua, A., 2017) mentions the concept of "inductive bias" in deep convolutional networks, which could be related to the generalizability of the model. But without more information, it is unclear what specific measures were taken to ensure generalizability.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of various datasets and methodologies, such as the use of georeferenced maps, GIS software, and drone flight software, but it does not provide information on how these datasets and methodologies were used to ensure the generalizability of the model.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know what specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
