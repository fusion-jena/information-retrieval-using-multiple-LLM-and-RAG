Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that one of the three datasets will be defined as a training base, and the standardization parameters will be calculated and applied to the other two datasets considered as test bases. This suggests that the data is split into training and test sets, but the specific criteria for this split are not mentioned.

Additionally, the context mentions that the role of training base and test base of each system is swapped, and the Hyperband algorithm is applied to each database to determine the best model. This implies that the data is split into multiple sets, possibly including a validation set, but the exact criteria for this split are not specified.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the exact criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training.
