Answer: 
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions that the "Agmon annotated dataset" was created to evaluate the performance of BirdNET, and that the annotations were carried out by experts. However, it does not provide details on the specific annotation techniques used, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
