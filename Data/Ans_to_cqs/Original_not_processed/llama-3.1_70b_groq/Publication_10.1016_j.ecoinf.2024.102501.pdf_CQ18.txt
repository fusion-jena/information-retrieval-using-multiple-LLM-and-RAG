Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context provides information about various machine learning models, their performance metrics (R2, MSE, MAE), and optimization algorithms used for parameter tuning. However, it does not provide details on how the model performance was monitored during training.

Therefore, I don't know the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training.
