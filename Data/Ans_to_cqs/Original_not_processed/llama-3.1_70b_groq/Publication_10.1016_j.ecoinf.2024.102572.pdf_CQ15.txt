Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be related to remote sensing, geospatial analysis, and forest fire research, but it does not provide information about the specific optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline.
