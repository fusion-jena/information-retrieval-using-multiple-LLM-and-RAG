Answer: I don't know. The provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. It discusses the use of various machine learning models (MLR, RF, SVM, XGboost, and MLP) for estimating rice canopy coverage and chlorophyll content, and evaluates their accuracy using metrics such as R2, RMSE, and REP. However, it does not provide information on the training process or the criteria used to determine when training is complete.
