Answer:

The data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for bird detection involve a combination of automated and manual methods. Initially, a pre-trained object detection model, YOLO v7, is used to label images preliminarily. This model predicts the frames, analyzes the structure, and identifies the positions of potential birds. The predicted labels are then further processed using LabelImg, a tool that facilitates adjustments to the boundaries and classes of bird species.

The specific annotation techniques used include:

1. Bounding box annotation: YOLO v7 predicts the bounding boxes around the detected birds, which are then adjusted manually using LabelImg.
2. Class labeling: The detected birds are assigned a class label, which is also adjusted manually if necessary.

There is no mention of instance segmentation in the provided context. The annotation process seems to focus on object detection and classification, with an emphasis on accurate bounding box annotation and class labeling.
