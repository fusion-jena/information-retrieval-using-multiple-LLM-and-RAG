Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is detection, specifically cetacean vocalization detection. The study aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of detecting cetacean vocalizations using deep learning models, leveraging multi-annotation campaigns involving both expert and novice annotators. The models are trained on annotations from both novices and experts to address the challenges associated with the scarcity of ground truth data in underwater PAM studies.
