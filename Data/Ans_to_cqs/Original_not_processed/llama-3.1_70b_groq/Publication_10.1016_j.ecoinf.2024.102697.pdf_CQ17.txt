Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily discusses the use of random forest models, an ensemble learning method, and the machine learning training methodology employed, including the use of nested k-fold cross-validation and Bayesian Optimization for hyperparameter tuning. It does not delve into deep learning or neural networks, which are typically associated with regularization methods like dropout and L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
