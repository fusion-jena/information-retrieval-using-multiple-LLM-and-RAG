Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is primarily images. The text mentions the use of camera traps to collect information on wildlife, resulting in a large volume of raw image data that needs to be reviewed and annotated. The context also mentions the use of computer vision models to automate tasks such as detecting and classifying wildlife in images. Additionally, the text mentions the extraction of image file metadata using TimeLapse2, further indicating that images are the primary data format used in the pipeline.

There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline. Therefore, the answer is limited to images.
