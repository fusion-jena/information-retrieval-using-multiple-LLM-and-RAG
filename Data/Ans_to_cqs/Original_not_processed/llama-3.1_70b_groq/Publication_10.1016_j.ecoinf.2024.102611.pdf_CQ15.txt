Answer:::

According to the provided context, the following optimization techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline:

1. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD): In the study by Barhate et al. (2023), a hyperparameter-tuned batch-updated stochastic gradient descent technique is used for plant species identification using a hybrid deep learning approach.

No other optimization techniques, such as Adam, are mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the study by Barhate et al. (2023) uses a hyperparameter-tuned and batch-updated stochastic gradient descent technique, which suggests that the authors may have experimented with different hyperparameters and batch sizes to optimize the performance of the model.

It is worth noting that the context does not provide an exhaustive list of optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines, and it only mentions the specific technique used in the study by Barhate et al. (2023).
