Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a crawling tool for collecting data from SRS products, data storage in NetCDF files, and the use of Sentinel-3-related products for monitoring. There is no mention of deep learning or data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. 

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
