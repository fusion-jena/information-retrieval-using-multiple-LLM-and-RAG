Answer:::

The text mentions the use of a deep learning model called YWnet, but it does not explicitly state the type of model it is. However, based on the context, it appears to be a convolutional neural network (CNN) variant, as it is mentioned that the model is used for underwater target detection and feature extraction, which are typical applications of CNNs. Additionally, the text mentions the use of convolution kernels, feature maps, and upsampling/downsampling operations, which are also characteristic of CNNs. However, without more specific information, it is not possible to confirm the exact type of model used.
