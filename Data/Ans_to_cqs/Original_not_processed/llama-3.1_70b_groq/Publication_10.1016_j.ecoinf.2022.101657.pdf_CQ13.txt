Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context discusses the potential for training bespoke neural networks for species sets and the use of low-power neural networks in hardware, but it does not provide details on the hyperparameters used in the model. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
