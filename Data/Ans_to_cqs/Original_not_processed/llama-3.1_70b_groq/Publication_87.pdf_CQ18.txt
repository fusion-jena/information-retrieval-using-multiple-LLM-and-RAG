Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of metrics and callbacks. Specifically, the code snippet shows that the model is trained with the `fit_one_cycle` function, which takes a list of metrics as an argument. In this case, the metrics used are `accuracy` and `error_rate`. This suggests that the model's performance is being monitored based on its accuracy and error rate during training.

Additionally, the code uses a `SaveModelCallback` to save the model after each epoch. This allows for the model's performance to be evaluated at each epoch and the best-performing model to be saved.

However, the code snippet does not provide information on how the model's performance is being evaluated or visualized during training. It is likely that the model's performance is being evaluated using a validation set, but the code snippet does not provide explicit information on this.
