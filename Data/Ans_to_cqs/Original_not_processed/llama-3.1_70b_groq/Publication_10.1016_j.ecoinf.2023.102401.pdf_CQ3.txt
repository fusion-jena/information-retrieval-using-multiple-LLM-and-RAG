Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. It only discusses data augmentation techniques, which are used to artificially increase the size of the training dataset by applying random transformations to the existing images. The data augmentation techniques mentioned include HSV adjustment, rotation, scaling, cropping, flipping, and mosaicking. 

However, it does mention that the datasets used in the experiment are Aquarium, Trash-ICRA19, VisDrone, NWPU VHR-10, and HRSID, and provides information about the number of images and categories in each dataset. But it does not provide information about how the data was annotated.

Therefore, I do not know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
