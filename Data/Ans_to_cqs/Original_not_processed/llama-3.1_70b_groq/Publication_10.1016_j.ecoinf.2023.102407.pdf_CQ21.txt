Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention the evaluation criteria for the AUC and TSS metrics, which suggests that some form of metrics calculation is performed after the model training.

According to Table 5, the evaluation criteria include the Area Under the Curve (AUC) and the True Skill Statistic (TSS) metrics. This implies that the model's performance is evaluated using these metrics after the training process.

There is no mention of saliency maps or confusion matrices in the provided context. Therefore, it is unclear whether these postprocessing steps are involved in the study.

In summary, the only postprocessing step that can be confirmed from the provided context is the calculation of AUC and TSS metrics. Other postprocessing steps, such as saliency maps and confusion matrices, are not mentioned.
