Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning and machine learning techniques for object detection, classification, and tracking in various domains, including marine ecosystems and medical applications.

However, it does mention the use of supervised and non-supervised techniques, as well as ensemble learning methods, but it does not provide details on the optimization techniques used. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
