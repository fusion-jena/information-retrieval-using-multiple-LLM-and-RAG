Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention a "Salmon scale 9056 image dataset" and an "Expert reading of extra 150 image dataset", which suggests that the raw data may be in the form of images of salmon scales.

Additionally, the context mentions a "SALSEA-Merge - Workshop on Digital Scale Reading Methodology" and a report on "RÃ¸mt oppdrettslaks i vassdrag i 2018" (which translates to "Escaped farmed salmon in watercourses in 2018"), which may indicate that the data is related to salmon ecology and may have been collected through field surveys or monitoring programs.

However, without more information, it is not possible to determine the specific methods used for collecting the raw data.
