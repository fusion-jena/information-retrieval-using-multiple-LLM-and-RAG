Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The text primarily focuses on the application of deep learning and computer vision techniques for the automatic annotation of marine images, specifically coral reefs. It discusses the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), spatial pyramid pooling (SPP), and Multi-scale Orderless Pooling (MOP) schemes, but does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness in the pipeline.

However, it is worth noting that the text mentions the use of a pre-trained VGGnet, which is fine-tuned on the Benthoz15 dataset. This suggests that the authors may have used a fixed random seed value or other strategies to ensure reproducibility, but this information is not explicitly stated.

In general, strategies to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines may include setting a fixed random seed value, using deterministic algorithms, or employing techniques such as data augmentation to reduce the impact of randomness. However, without further information, it is unclear which specific strategies were employed in this particular study.
