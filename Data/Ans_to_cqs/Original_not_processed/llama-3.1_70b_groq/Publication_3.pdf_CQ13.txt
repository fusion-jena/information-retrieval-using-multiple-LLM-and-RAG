Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The text only mentions the number of training steps used for each challenge, with 4000 steps being the optimum for all challenges except Challenge 3, which used 8000 steps. It also discusses the architecture of the convolutional neural network (CNN) used, including the types of layers employed, but does not provide details on the hyperparameters used for training the model.
