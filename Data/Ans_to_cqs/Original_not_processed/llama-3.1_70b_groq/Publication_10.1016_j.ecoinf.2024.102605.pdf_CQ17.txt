Answer: Unfortunately, the provided pieces of context do not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The texts primarily focus on the application of machine learning and remote sensing techniques for plant disease detection, pest damage identification, and vegetation monitoring. They discuss various methods, such as CNN, 1D-CNN, and multi-scale attention-UNet models, but do not provide information on regularization techniques like dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
