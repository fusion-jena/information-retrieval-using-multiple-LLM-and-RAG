Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to digitized natural history collections, particularly in the United States National Herbarium. It discusses the potential benefits of using CNNs for image classification tasks, such as detecting specimens previously treated with mercury and discriminating between superÔ¨Åcially similar plant families. However, it does not delve into the details of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
