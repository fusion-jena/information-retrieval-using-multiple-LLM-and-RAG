Answer: The hyperparameters of the FERM model are optimized using the Shuffle Complex Evolution method, which is used to fit parameters by maximizing the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) as the objective function. This method is used to calibrate the model on daily timestep LAI outputs taken from the WAVES water and energy balance model.
