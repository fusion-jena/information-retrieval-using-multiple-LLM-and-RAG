Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention the location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. It mentions that supplementary data to the article can be found online at a specific DOI (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2022.101955), but it does not specify if this is the data repository for the deep learning pipeline or just supplementary data for the article.
