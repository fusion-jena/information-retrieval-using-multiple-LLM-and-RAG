Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention "pre-processing" as a step in the methodology (Section II) but does not elaborate on the specific steps involved.

However, based on general knowledge of deep learning, common preprocessing steps involved before training a model include:

* Data cleaning: removing any missing or corrupted data
* Normalization: scaling the data to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model
* Scaling: scaling the data to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model
* Data augmentation: artificially increasing the size of the dataset by applying transformations such as rotation, flipping, and cropping to the existing data

It's also worth noting that the context mentions data augmentation as a technique used to improve the results of the model, specifically mentioning that "small changes in brightness and zoom can help to improve significantly". This suggests that some form of data augmentation was used in the study, but the exact preprocessing steps involved are not specified.
