Answer: According to the provided context, a simple linear transformation is used to mitigate the effect of hardware variance on the learned representation, which can help address data bias during preprocessing. However, it does not mention any specific techniques such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling. It also mentions that the approach paves the way for development of a new class of deep neural networks that afford more interpretable learned ecoacoustic representations, but it does not provide further details on how data bias is addressed.
