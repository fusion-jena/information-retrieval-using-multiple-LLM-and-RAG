Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context appears to be focused on the data sources, preprocessing, and clustering quality index (CQI) of a Human Activity (HA)â€“Natural Endowment (NE) coupled zoning model. It also discusses the limitations of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm and the need for optimization.

The context does mention the use of a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) network and the calculation of a clustering quality index (CQI), but it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps after model training.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
