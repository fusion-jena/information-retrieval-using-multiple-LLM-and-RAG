Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about training completion criteria, validation loss plateau, or any related concepts. The context appears to be related to classification and landscape ecology, with equations and tables describing classification methods and results. There is no mention of training or validation processes, so I am unable to provide an answer to the query.
