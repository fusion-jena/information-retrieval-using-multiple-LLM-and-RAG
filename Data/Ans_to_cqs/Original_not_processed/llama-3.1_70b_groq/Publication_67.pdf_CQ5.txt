Answer: 
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention that the training datasets were built with examples of images with different levels of tree cover, continuous and discrete approximations, and inclusion of auxiliary class "Non-Forest". 

Additionally, it mentions that the database was compiled from two sources, but the names of these sources are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it does mention that the NWPU-RESISC45 dataset was used as a source for image data, along with Google and Maxar.
