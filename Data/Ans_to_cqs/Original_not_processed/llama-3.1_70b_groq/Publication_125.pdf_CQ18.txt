Answer: 
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the information available, it can be inferred that the model performance is monitored through the training accuracy and validation accuracy. 

Figure 7 shows the model accuracy over plain data, with sub-figures (a) and (b) representing the training accuracy and validation accuracy, respectively. Similarly, Figure 8 shows the model accuracy over encrypted data, with sub-figures (a) and (b) representing the training accuracy and validation accuracy, respectively. 

This suggests that the model performance is monitored by tracking the training accuracy and validation accuracy during the training process. However, the exact strategy or metrics used to monitor the model performance are not explicitly stated in the provided context.
