Answer:::

To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, the techniques used in this context are batch normalization and weighted classes. 

Batch normalization is used to normalize the input data by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation for each channel in the current batch. This helps to reduce the differences in the distribution between different batches of training data and between the training set and the test set.

Weighted classes are used to address the imbalance in the categorical data. The training data has a ratio of 7:14:1:5:7 for the five types of LU suitability samples, which means that some categories have fewer samples than others. To solve this problem, a relatively large weight is generated for the categories that have fewer samples, and a small weight is generated for the categories that have more samples. This helps to improve the performance of the model for the categories that have small sample sizes.

There is no mention of stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection in the provided context.
