Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. However, it does mention that the trained model was applied to the test dataset, and the prediction accuracy was quantified by the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of the respective dataset. 

Additionally, the context mentions that the MAE of the validation dataset was computed after each epoch, and the models were trained until the validation MAE did not further improve compared to the preceding epochs and diverged from the training MAE (‘overfit’). This suggests that the model's performance was evaluated using the MAE metric, but it does not provide information on other postprocessing steps.
