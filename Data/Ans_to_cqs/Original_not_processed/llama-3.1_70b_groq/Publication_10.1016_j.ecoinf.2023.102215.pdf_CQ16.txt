Answer: According to the provided context, the training process is considered complete when the training loss converges. Specifically, it is mentioned that "After 65 K iterations, the training loss converges, and the training process takes approximately 11.5 h." This suggests that the training process is stopped when the training loss stops improving, but the exact criteria for determining convergence (e.g., validation loss plateau) are not specified.
