Answer: 
The specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the model is trained using the Keras interface with a Tensorflow backend, and that the model is able to segment objects in high-resolution imagery, achieving accuracy similar to human-level classification accuracy. Additionally, it is mentioned that the model is able to identify features in large amounts of data, which is a characteristic often associated with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Furthermore, the context mentions the use of a deep learning method called U-net, which is a type of CNN architecture. Therefore, while it is not explicitly stated, it is likely that the model used in the pipeline is a type of CNN, possibly a U-net architecture.
