Answer:::
None. The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model in the pipeline. It mentions the use of Gompertz population models for feature extractions of population time series, hierarchical clustering, machine learning, and state space model, but it does not specify the use of a deep learning model such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer.
