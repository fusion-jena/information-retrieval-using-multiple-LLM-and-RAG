Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the LaDeco module, its pre-trained models, and the process of semantic segmentation. It also references various research papers and datasets, but it does not provide information on how the raw data was collected.

However, based on the references to Google Street View and datasets such as Places and ADE20k, it can be inferred that some of the data may have been collected through public datasets and online sources. Additionally, the mention of Li et al. (2015) assessing street-level urban greenery using Google Street View suggests that remote sensing and online data sources may have been used.

But without more specific information, it is impossible to provide a definitive answer to the query. Therefore, I must conclude that I don't know the exact methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
