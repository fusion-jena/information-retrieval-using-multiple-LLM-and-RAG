Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the performance evaluation of pre-trained models, hyperparameter optimization, and the impact of data augmentation on model performance. It does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

However, it does mention that the implementation of the performance evaluation was carried out in MATLAB R2021a, which suggests that some form of metrics calculation and evaluation may have been performed. Additionally, the context mentions the use of validation datasets to evaluate the models with optimal hyperparameter values, which implies that some form of evaluation or metrics calculation may have been involved.

But without further information, it is not possible to provide a detailed answer to the query.
