Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to bird species recognition and classification, but it does not mention well-known datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. It does mention the use of datasets in the context of the LifeCLEF bird recognition challenge and the BirdCLEF competition, but it does not provide the names of the specific datasets used. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
