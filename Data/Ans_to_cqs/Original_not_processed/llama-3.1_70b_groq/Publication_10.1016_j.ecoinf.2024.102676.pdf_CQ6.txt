Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does mention the use of "missing value imputation as part of the data preprocessing pipeline" to handle incomplete or imperfect footprints. This suggests that some form of data preprocessing is involved, but the exact steps are not specified.
