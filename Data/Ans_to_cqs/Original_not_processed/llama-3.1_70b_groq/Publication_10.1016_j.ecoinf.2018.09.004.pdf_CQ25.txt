Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention deep learning models or their purposes. The context appears to be focused on traditional machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees, random forests, k-nearest neighbors, and support vector machines, which are used for classification tasks. There is no mention of deep learning models or their applications.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the question about the purpose of deep learning models based on the provided context.
