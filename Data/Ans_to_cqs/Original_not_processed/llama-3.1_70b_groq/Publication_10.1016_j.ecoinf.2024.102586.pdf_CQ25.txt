Answer: 
The purpose of the model is not explicitly stated as a deep learning model, but rather as a random forest (RF) model. According to the context, the RF model is used to examine the relative importance of selected environmental and anthropogenic variables on the invasive plant species richness and abundance separately. The model is employed to analyze the drivers of invasive species diversity, with the goal of improving predictive capacity towards prevention and targeted management of invasive alien species and mitigation of their impacts.
