Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is through the use of 10 K-fold cross-validation and 10-fold bootstrapping. This approach allows for the assessment of the model's performance on unseen data, providing an unbiased estimate of its predictive accuracy. Additionally, the model's performance is evaluated based on various metrics, including Area Under the Curve (AUC), True Skill Statistics (TSS), Cohen's KAPPA, point-biserial correlation (COR), and Receiver Operator Characteristics (ROC). The sensitivity-specificity sum maximization technique is also employed to determine the optimal model threshold.
