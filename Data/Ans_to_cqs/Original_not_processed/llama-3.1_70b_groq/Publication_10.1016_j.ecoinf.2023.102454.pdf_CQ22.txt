Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a study on estimating urban carbon emissions using nighttime light data and energy consumption statistics. It discusses the data sources, methodology, and some results, but it does not mention the use of a deep learning model or its evaluation metrics.

However, it does mention that the study assessed the accuracy of the urban carbon emission estimates by comparing the errors between the fitted values and the statistical values of carbon emissions. It also mentions that there were significant relative errors during the period of 2000-2004, but it does not provide further details on the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model.

Therefore, I don't know the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
