Answer:::

The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics, including:

1. Overall Accuracy (OA): The ratio of the sum of correctly classified pixels to the total number of pixels in the test dataset.
2. Producer Accuracy (PA): The accuracy from the point of view of the mapmaker.
3. User Accuracy (UA): The probability that a pixel classified in each category corresponds to the actual category on the ground.
4. Kappa Coefficient of Agreement: A measure of the agreement between the predicted and actual classifications.

Additionally, errors of omission and commission are calculated for each Land Cover Land Use (LCLU) class. Errors of omission represent the proportion of reference data pixels that the model incorrectly classifies, while errors of commission correspond to the proportion of model-predicted pixels that were incorrectly classified according to the reference data.

Note that precision and recall are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context as metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, the metrics mentioned above provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance.
