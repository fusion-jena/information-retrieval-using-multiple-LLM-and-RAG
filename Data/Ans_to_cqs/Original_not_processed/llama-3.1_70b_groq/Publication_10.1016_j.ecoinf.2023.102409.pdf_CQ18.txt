Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model's performance is evaluated using various metrics such as Mean Intersection over Union (MIoU), Mean pixel accuracy (MPA), Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 score. These metrics are likely used to monitor the model's performance during training and fine-tune the hyperparameters as needed.

The context mentions that the model's initial learning rate was set to 0.01 (or 0.0001 for the second model) and was further refined via iterative testing. This suggests that the model's performance was monitored during training, and the learning rate was adjusted accordingly. However, the specific strategy or criteria used to monitor the model's performance during training are not provided.
