Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be focused on random forests, a type of ensemble learning method, and does not discuss deep learning or neural networks.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
