Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning models, such as learning rate and optimizer. The context only discusses the selection of deep learning models, their architectures, and their performance on the dataset, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameters used to train these models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
