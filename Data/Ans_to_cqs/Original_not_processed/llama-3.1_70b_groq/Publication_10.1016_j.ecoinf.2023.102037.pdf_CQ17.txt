Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the limitations of existing studies on insect recognition, the importance of strict validation procedures, and the potential causes of misclassifications from both model-centric and data-centric approaches.

However, it does mention that some studies employ a variety of models and training procedure optimizations to find the "best" result, which may include regularization methods. But it does not provide specific details on the regularization methods used.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
