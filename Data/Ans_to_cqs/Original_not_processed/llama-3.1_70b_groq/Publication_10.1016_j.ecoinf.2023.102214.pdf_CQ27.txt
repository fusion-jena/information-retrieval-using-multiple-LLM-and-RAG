Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly describe the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that a Microsoft Sponsorship supported Azure-based development and model deployment in Whiskerbook.org. This suggests that the model was deployed on the Azure platform, but the specific process followed (e.g., model serialization) is not mentioned.
