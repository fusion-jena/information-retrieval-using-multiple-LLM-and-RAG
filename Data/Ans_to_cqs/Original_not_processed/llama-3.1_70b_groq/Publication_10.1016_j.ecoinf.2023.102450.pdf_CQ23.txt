Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the training dataset contained an insufficient number of samples, and therefore, the few-shot learning method was used to train the network. This approach involves training the network on a limited number of samples, which can help improve its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

Additionally, the context mentions that the classification task was defined as the N-way K-shot problem, where the training set contained N different categories with each category comprising K labeled samples. This approach can help the model learn to recognize patterns and relationships between different categories, which can improve its generalizability.

However, there is no mention of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the use of a diverse dataset to ensure generalizability. Therefore, it is unclear whether these measures were taken to ensure the model's generalizability.
