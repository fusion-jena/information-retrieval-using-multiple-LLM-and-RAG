Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing, land use/cover change analysis, and landscape fragmentation index, but it does not provide information on data preprocessing techniques for deep learning pipelines.

However, I can suggest that the context does mention the use of random sampling to create training and validation datasets at a 7:3 ratio, which may help to reduce bias in the data. Additionally, the context mentions the use of a random forest algorithm, which can handle imbalanced datasets to some extent.

But, I couldn't find any specific information on techniques such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection being used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
