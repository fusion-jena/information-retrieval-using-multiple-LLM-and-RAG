Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided pieces of context do not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that 70% of the data were used for training the algorithms, and the remaining 30% were used only for validation. This suggests that the data was split into training and validation sets, but it does not provide information on how the data was split (e.g., stratified splitting) or if any techniques were used to address data bias.

The context does provide information on various deep learning techniques and applications, including hyperspectral data classification, oil palm tree detection, scene classification, and image registration. However, it does not provide information on data preprocessing techniques used to address data bias.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
