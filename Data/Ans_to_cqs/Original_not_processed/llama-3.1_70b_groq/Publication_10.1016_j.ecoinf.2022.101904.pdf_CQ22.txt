Answer:

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are:

1. Kappa index (KI): This metric measures the agreement between the predicted and actual class labels.
2. Overall accuracy (OA): This metric measures the proportion of correctly classified samples out of the total number of samples.
3. Average accuracy (AA): This metric measures the average accuracy of the model across all classes.
4. Time (h): This metric measures the computational time taken by the model to perform the classification task.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of different deep learning models, including Vision Transformer (ViT), Swin Transformer (ST), CoAtNet, CNN + ST, GAN + ST, and 3DUNetGSFormer. The results of these metrics are presented in Table 5.
