Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does describe the process of randomly sampling a batch of reference data patches and randomly picking an optical image and two SAR images (one ascending and one descending orbit) with acquisition dates near the one of the optical image.

This suggests that the data augmentation techniques might be limited to random sampling and possibly using different image acquisitions (optical and SAR) with varying dates and orbits. However, there is no mention of flipping, rotating, or scaling the images, which are common data augmentation techniques.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query.
