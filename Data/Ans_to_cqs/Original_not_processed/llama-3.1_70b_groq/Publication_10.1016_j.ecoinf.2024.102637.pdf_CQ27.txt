Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the design and optimization of the model, specifically the AlexNet network and the proposed SIAlex model, but it does not provide information on the deployment process.

However, it does mention that the AlexNet network was designed to be lightweight and optimized for deployment, and that the two convolution layers are merged in the model deployment mode. This suggests that some consideration was given to the deployment process, but the specific steps involved are not described.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this question.
