Answer:

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are listed in Table 2. The hyperparameters and their values are as follows:

* Learning rate (lr0): 0.01
* Learning rate factor (Lrf): 0.01
* Momentum: 0.937
* Weight decay: 0.0005
* Warmup epochs: 3.0
* Warmup momentum: 0.8
* Warmup bias learning rate (warmup_bias_lr): 0.1
* Box loss weight (box): 0.05
* Class loss weight (cls): 0.5
* Class loss weight for positive samples (cls_pw): 1.0
* Object loss weight (obj): 1.0
* Object loss weight for positive samples (obj_pw): 1.0
* IoU threshold (iou_t): 0.2
* Anchor threshold (anchor_t): 4.0

Additionally, the hyperparameters for data augmentation are also listed in Table 2, including:

* Gamma correction factor (fl_gamma): 0.0
* Hue shift (hsv_h): 0.015
* Saturation shift (hsv_s): 0.7
* Value shift (hsv_v): 0.4
* Rotation degrees (degrees): 0.0
* Translation (translate): 0.1
* Scale (scale): 0.5
* Shear (shear): 0.0
* Perspective (Perspective): 0.0
* Flip up-down (flipud): 0.0
* Flip left-right (fliplr): 0.5
* Mosaic (mosaic): 1.0
* Mixup (mixup): 0.0
* Copy-paste (copy_paste): 0.0

Note that these hyperparameters are based on the optimized values for YOLOv5 COCO training from scratch.
