Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention deep learning pipelines or strategies for handling randomness in such pipelines. The context primarily discusses the use of Random Forest classification for seagrass mapping and monitoring, as well as other related topics such as multispectral images and seagrass habitat characterization.

However, I can provide some general information on handling randomness in machine learning pipelines. In many machine learning algorithms, including deep learning, randomness is often introduced through techniques such as random initialization of weights, random sampling of data, or random selection of features. To handle this randomness, researchers and practitioners often employ strategies such as:

* Setting a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results
* Using techniques such as bootstrapping or cross-validation to reduce the impact of randomness on model performance
* Averaging the results of multiple runs with different random seeds to obtain a more robust estimate of model performance

However, these strategies are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, and I do not have enough information to provide a more specific answer to the query.
