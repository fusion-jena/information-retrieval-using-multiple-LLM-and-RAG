Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention various remote sensing and imaging technologies used for collecting data, such as:

* Sentinel-2 data
* Hyperspectral imaging technology
* Colour images
* UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) images
* Landsat-8 OLI data
* SPOT-5 images

These imaging technologies are likely used to collect data on vegetation, soil, and other environmental characteristics. Additionally, the context mentions the use of single-board computers and sensors for estimating SPAD values and chlorophyll content.

It can be inferred that the data collection methods used in the deep learning pipeline may include:

* Remote sensing and imaging technologies
* Sensor data from single-board computers and other devices
* Possibly, public datasets (although not explicitly mentioned)

However, the context does not provide information on the use of surveys as a data collection method. Therefore, it is unclear if surveys are used in the deep learning pipeline.
