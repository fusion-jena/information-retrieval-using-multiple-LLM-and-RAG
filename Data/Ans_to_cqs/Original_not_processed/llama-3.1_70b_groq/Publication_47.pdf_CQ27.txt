Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It mentions that the deep neural network algorithm, IUC-NN, was implemented as an R package (IUCNN) based on the Python (version 3.7) TensorFlow library. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection.
