Answer:::
The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are the following:

1. ImageNet: This dataset is used for pre-training the weights of the model. The weights are obtained from the Lasagne Model Zoo.

2. PlantNet: This is the primary dataset used for training the model. It consists of around 250K images belonging to more than 6K plant species of Western Europe.

3. Google Search Image: This dataset is used for testing the model. It consists of the top 10 images returned by the Google Image Search engine for each of the 3680 labels with more than 12 images in the training dataset.

4. Portuguese Flora and iNaturalist: These are also test datasets used to evaluate the performance of the model.

Note that the datasets used for training and testing are different, with the model being trained on the PlantNet dataset and tested on the Google Search Image, Portuguese Flora, and iNaturalist datasets.
