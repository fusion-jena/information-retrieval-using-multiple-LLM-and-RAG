Answer:

The text does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the results are averaged over three repetitions, which suggests that some form of cross-validation or repeated evaluation was performed.

Additionally, the text mentions that the network is trained on different datasets (ImageNet, GBIF Natural, and GBIF Preserved) and that the results are compared across these datasets. This could be seen as a form of evaluation on diverse datasets, but it is not clear if the datasets were used for training and testing in a way that would ensure generalizability.

There is no mention of stratified splitting or other techniques that are commonly used to ensure generalizability, such as data augmentation or ensemble methods. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a complete answer to this question based on the provided text.
