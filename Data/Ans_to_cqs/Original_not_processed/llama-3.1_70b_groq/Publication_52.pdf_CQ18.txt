Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention a specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention that ELMs do not address known NN problems such as stopping criterion, learning rate, and learning epochs. This suggests that ELMs may not require traditional monitoring strategies, as they can handle non-differential activation equations and do not have the same issues as other neural networks.

Additionally, the context mentions the Online Sequential ELM (OSELM) algorithm, which is a sequential learning algorithm that can learn from data one-by-one or chunk-by-chunk. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance is monitored during training in OSELM.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
