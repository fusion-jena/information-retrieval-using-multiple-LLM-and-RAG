Answer: The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training is k-fold block cross-validation, specifically 5-fold block cross-validation. The region of interest is divided into 5 Ã— 5 geospatial blocks, and each fold contains approximately the same number of presence observations. For each partition, the model is trained on 80% of the presences and validated on the remaining 20%. This approach is used to alleviate issues with presence-only data and to favor models that can generalize to unseen areas.
