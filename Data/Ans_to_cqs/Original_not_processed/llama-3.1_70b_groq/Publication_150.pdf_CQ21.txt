Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention the calculation of certain metrics and the creation of a confusion matrix.

According to the context, the metrics calculated include Top-1 accuracy, Top-2 accuracy, Top-3 accuracy, Top-4 accuracy, Top-5 accuracy, Macro recall, and Macro precision. These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the models.

Additionally, the context mentions the creation of a confusion matrix for the InceptionV3 model, which shows the number of test images for each prediction. However, it does not provide information on the creation of saliency maps or other postprocessing steps.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include the calculation of metrics such as accuracy and recall, and the creation of a confusion matrix. However, the context does not provide information on other postprocessing steps such as the creation of saliency maps.
