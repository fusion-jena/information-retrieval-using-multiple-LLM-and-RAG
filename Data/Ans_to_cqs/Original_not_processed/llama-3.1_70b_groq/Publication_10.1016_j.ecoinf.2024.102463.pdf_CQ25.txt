Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific purpose of the deep learning model, such as classification, segmentation, or detection. It discusses the architecture of the model, including the use of recurrent highway networks (RHN) in both the encoder and decoder, and the optimization of hyperparameters using the HyperBand algorithm. However, it does not provide information on the task or problem that the model is intended to solve.
