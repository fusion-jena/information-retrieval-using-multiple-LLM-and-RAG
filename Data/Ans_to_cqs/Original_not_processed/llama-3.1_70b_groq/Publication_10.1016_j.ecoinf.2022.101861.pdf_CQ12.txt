Answer: A convolutional neural network (CNN) is used in the pipeline. According to the text, "A pipeline for identification of bird and frog species in tropical soundscape recordings using a convolutional neural network" (LeBien et al., 2020). This suggests that the pipeline utilizes a CNN architecture for species identification.
