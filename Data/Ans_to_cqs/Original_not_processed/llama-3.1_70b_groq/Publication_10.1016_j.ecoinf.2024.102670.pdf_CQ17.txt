Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily discusses the application of deep learning methods in various domains, including image analysis and network data examination, but does not delve into the details of the deep learning pipeline or regularization techniques.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in one of the studies (Xu et al., 2021), which may employ regularization methods to prevent overfitting. Nevertheless, the specific regularization methods used are not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to the query.
