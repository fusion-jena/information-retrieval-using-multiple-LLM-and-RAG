Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. However, it does mention the use of Bayesian Neural Networks and probabilistic approaches to express uncertainty in the prediction phase.

One approach mentioned in the context is the use of Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD) in the MCD approach, which is a technique for approximating Bayesian inference in neural networks. This method involves randomly dropping out neurons during training and using the resulting uncertainty estimates to make predictions.

Another approach mentioned is the use of Variational Bayesian Inference (VBI) in the VBI approach, which is a method for approximating Bayesian inference in neural networks. This method involves using a probabilistic encoder to learn a distribution over the model's weights and then using this distribution to make predictions.

While these approaches do involve randomness, they are primarily focused on handling uncertainty in the model's predictions rather than specifically addressing randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
