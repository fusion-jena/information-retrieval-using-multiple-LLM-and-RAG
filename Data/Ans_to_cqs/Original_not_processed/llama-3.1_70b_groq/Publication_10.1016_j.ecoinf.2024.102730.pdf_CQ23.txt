Answer: To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the data was divided into a training set (80% of the data) and a test set (20% of the data). This split allows the model to be trained on one portion of the data and tested on a separate, previously unseen portion, enabling the assessment of its ability to generalize to new, unseen data accurately. However, there is no mention of using cross-validation, stratified splitting, or ensuring a diverse dataset in the provided context.
