Answer:

Based on the provided context, it appears that the data collection methods utilized for collecting raw data are primarily focused on environmental and ecological data. The context mentions various data sources, including:

1. Resource Environment Science and Data Research Center Data Center (https://www.resdc.cn/)
2. Openstreetmap (https://www.openstreetmap.org/)
3. Geospatial Data Cloud (http://www.gscloud.cn/)
4. National Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Scientific Resource Environment Science and Data Research Center (http://data.tpdc.ac.cn)
5. National Earth System Science Data Center Resource Environment Science and Data Research Center (http://www.resdc.cn/data.aspx?DATAID=252)
6. Chinese Research Data Services Platform (http://www.cnrds.com)

These sources suggest that the data collection methods may include:

* Remote sensing data from satellites or aerial sensors
* Geospatial data from mapping platforms like Openstreetmap
* Environmental monitoring data from sensors or field observations
* Public datasets from research institutions and government agencies

However, it is not explicitly stated whether surveys are used as a data collection method. The context does mention the use of various indices, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which may be derived from remote sensing data.

Overall, the data collection methods appear to be focused on gathering environmental and ecological data from various sources, including remote sensing, geospatial data, and public datasets.
