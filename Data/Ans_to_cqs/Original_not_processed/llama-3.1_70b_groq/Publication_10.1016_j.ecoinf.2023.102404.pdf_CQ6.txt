Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the tuning of hyperparameters for a machine learning model using grid search and cross-validation techniques. It also discusses the selection of training and testing datasets using stratified random sampling.

However, it can be inferred that some form of preprocessing might have been performed, as the context mentions the use of LiDAR-derived AGB maps and the integration of GEDI and ICESat-2 data. This suggests that the data might have undergone some form of cleaning, normalization, or scaling before being used for training the model. Nevertheless, the specific preprocessing steps involved are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
