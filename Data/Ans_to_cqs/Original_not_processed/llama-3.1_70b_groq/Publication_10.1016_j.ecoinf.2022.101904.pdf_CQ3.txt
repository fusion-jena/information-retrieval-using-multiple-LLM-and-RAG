Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the use of transformers, particularly the Swin Transformer, in remote sensing and computer vision applications, as well as the proposed 3DUNetGSFormer model for wetland mapping. It does mention the use of generative adversarial networks and the Swin Transformer, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques.

Therefore, I do not know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context.
