Answer:::
The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the machine learning models, including the deep learning model (ANN), are:

1. Mean Squared Error (MSE)
2. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
3. Coefficient of Determination (R2)
4. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the optimized models, including the ANN model. The RMSE is also calculated for each observation site to evaluate the performance of the models for each site.

Note that the provided context does not mention accuracy, precision, or recall as metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. These metrics are typically used to evaluate the performance of classification models, but the context suggests that the models are used for regression tasks (e.g., predicting flowering dates).
