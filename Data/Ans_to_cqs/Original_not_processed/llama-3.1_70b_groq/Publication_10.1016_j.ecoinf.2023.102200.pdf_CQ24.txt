Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context appears to be focused on individual tree detection and segmentation using various algorithms, including deep learning methods.

However, it does mention the use of Stochastic Gradient Descent (with momentum) as an optimization algorithm for training the Faster R-CNN detector. This algorithm is a type of stochastic optimization method, which implies that randomness is involved in the optimization process. Nevertheless, the context does not provide information on how randomness is handled or controlled in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
