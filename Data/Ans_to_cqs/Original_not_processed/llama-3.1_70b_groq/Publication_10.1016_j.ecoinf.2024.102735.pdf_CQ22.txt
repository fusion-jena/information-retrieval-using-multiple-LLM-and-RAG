Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The context appears to focus on the tuning of model parameters, uncertainty quantification, and the use of various machine learning models, but it does not provide information on the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of uncertainty bands and prediction distributions, which suggests that the authors may be using metrics related to uncertainty or confidence intervals to evaluate the performance of the model. Additionally, the context mentions the use of hyperparameter optimization frameworks such as Optuna, which often use metrics such as accuracy or mean squared error to evaluate the performance of the model.

Overall, without more information, it is difficult to determine the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model.
