Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the framework's learning phase, which consists of two consecutive steps: training a CNN model on a database T0 and tuning a risk threshold Ï„i specific to each class using an independent database T1.

However, the context does mention the use of TensorFlow, a popular open-source machine learning library, as a system for large-scale machine learning (Reference 43). This suggests that the model might have been deployed using TensorFlow's serving capabilities or other compatible platforms. Nevertheless, the exact process followed for model deployment, such as model serialization or platform selection, is not specified in the provided context.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this query.
