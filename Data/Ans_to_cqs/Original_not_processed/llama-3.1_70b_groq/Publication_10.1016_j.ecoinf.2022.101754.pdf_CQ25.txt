Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the titles of the references and the text, it appears that the deep learning model is being used for retrieval of forest above-ground biomass (AGB) from combined LiDAR and Landsat 8 data. This suggests that the purpose of the model is likely regression-based, such as estimating the amount of biomass in a given area. The model may be using the LiDAR and Landsat 8 data as input features to predict the AGB values. However, without more information, it is not possible to provide a more specific answer.
