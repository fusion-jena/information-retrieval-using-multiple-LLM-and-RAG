Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be related to a research article on feature-based and shape-match classifications of animal population time series, and it discusses various methods such as Gompertz population models, hierarchical clustering, and state space models. However, it does not provide information on data splitting criteria for deep learning model training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
