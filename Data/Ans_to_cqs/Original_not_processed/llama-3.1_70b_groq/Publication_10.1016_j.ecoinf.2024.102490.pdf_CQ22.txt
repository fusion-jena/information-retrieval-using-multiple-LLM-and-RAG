Answer:::

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the models are the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and the true skill statistics (TSS). These metrics are used to assess the accuracy of the models, but the text does not specifically mention accuracy, precision, or recall as evaluation metrics. The AUC-ROC score is mentioned to be >0.94, indicating a good overall model fit, and the TSS values ranged between 0.739 and 0.838, which also indicates a good fit to the model.
