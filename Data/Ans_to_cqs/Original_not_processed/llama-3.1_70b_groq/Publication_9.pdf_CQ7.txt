Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention the use of stochastic gradient descent with backpropagation to adjust model weights and minimize error on each subsequent run. This suggests that the data may have been split into training and validation sets, but the specific criteria used for this split are not mentioned.

In general, common criteria for splitting data into training, validation, and test sets include:

* Random sampling: randomly selecting a portion of the data for each set
* Stratified sampling: ensuring that each set has a similar distribution of classes or labels
* Holdout method: holding out a portion of the data for testing and using the remaining data for training and validation

However, without more information, it is not possible to determine the specific criteria used in this case.
