Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of multiple performance criteria, including the coefficient of determination (R2), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE), and correlation coefficient (COR). These criteria are used to evaluate the performance of both statistical models (frequency ratio (FR) and statistical index (SI)) and machine learning models (Random Forest (RF) and Classification and Regression Trees (CART)) during the training process.
