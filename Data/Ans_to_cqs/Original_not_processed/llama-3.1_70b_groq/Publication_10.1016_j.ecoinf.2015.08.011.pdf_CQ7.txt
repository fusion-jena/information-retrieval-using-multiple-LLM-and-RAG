Answer: The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, as mentioned in the provided context, is to randomly split the data set into two sets: 80% for model training (training set) and 20% for model testing (validation set). This is done to avoid overfitting and to test the model's error validation. The training set is used to compute the gradient and update the network parameters, such as weights and biases, while the validation set is used to test the model's performance and stop the training process when the network begins to overfit the data.
