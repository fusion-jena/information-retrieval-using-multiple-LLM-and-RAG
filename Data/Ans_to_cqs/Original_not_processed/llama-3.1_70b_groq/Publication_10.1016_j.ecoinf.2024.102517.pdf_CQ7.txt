Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. It only mentions that the entire training set was presented in a random order during each epoch, but it does not provide information on how the data was split into training, test, and validation sets. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
