To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the dataset was randomly divided into two subsets, with 75% of the data used for training and 25% for testing. This random sampling approach helped maintain the covariance structure among the predictor variables relatively intact between the training and testing datasets.

Additionally, the use of Random Forest (RF) modeling was opted for, which is known for its robustness to data noise and ability to handle multi-dimensional data. RF modeling is also resilient to preprocessing burdens, such as feature scaling, and is flexible with outliers.

Furthermore, the integration of sensor data with machine learning (ML) modeling was employed to elucidate the role of environmental stressors that modulate phytoplankton dynamics. This approach advances our understanding of the complex relationships between variables and has been successful in predicting chlorophyll-a (Chl a), a commonly used proxy for algal biomass.

Lastly, the use of maximal information coefficient (MIC) was used to evaluate the relationships between variables, which helps to identify generalizable non-linear patterns in the data.

Overall, the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model include random sampling, the use of RF modeling, integration of sensor data with ML modeling, and the use of MIC to evaluate relationships between variables.
