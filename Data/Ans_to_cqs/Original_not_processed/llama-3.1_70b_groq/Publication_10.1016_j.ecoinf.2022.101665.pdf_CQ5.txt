Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on environmental mapping and machine learning applications in the field of ecology and geography, with mentions of datasets related to above-ground biomass, soil carbon stock, land cover change, and Earth observation imagery.

However, it does mention that a compiled version of the datasets used in the paper can be downloaded from a specific URL (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6513429), but it does not provide information on the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query regarding the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline.
