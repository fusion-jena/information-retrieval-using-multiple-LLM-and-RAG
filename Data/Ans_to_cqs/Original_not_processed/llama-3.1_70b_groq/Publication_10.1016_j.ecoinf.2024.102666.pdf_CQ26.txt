Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on atmospheric correction (AC) algorithms for remote sensing data, specifically in aquatic environments. It discusses various AC algorithms, such as FLAASH, and their effectiveness in different environments. However, it does not touch on deep learning pipelines or techniques for addressing data bias.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
