Answer:::

According to the provided context, one method utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is through the use of camera traps. Camera traps are widely used as a non-invasive and cost-effective method for gathering observational data on wildlife. They are capable of passively capturing images in any environment where wild animals may appear, resulting in a diverse range of data. This method is particularly useful for collecting data in challenging and unpredictable environments.

Additionally, the context mentions that field surveys are also used for collecting data, which can be expedited through the use of the proposed method. However, it does not provide further details on other methods such as sensors or public datasets.

It is worth noting that the context primarily focuses on the use of camera traps for collecting data, and the challenges associated with processing and analyzing low-quality images captured by these cameras. Therefore, it is likely that camera traps are a primary method for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, but other methods may also be used.
