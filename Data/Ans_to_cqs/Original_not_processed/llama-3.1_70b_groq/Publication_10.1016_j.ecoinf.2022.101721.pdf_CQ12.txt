Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is mentioned in the context provided by Paumen et al. (2021), which states "Development and test of a bat calls detection and classification method based on convolutional neural networks." This suggests that the pipeline uses a CNN for the classification of bat calls.
