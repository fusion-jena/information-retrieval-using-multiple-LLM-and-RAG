Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. The text mentions the use of seven different machine learning models, including Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Random Forest (RF), and Classification and Regression Tree (CART), but it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used in these models. Additionally, the context does not mention the use of a deep learning model at all. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
