Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model are:

1. Cohen’s kappa coefficient (κ) to measure the proportion of agreements.
2. Precision to determine the proportion of correct predictions.
3. Sensitivity for the true positive rate (correctly predicted phases).
4. Specificity for the true negative rate (correct allocation to other phases).
5. Prevalence for the proportion within each phase.

These metrics are calculated using the following formulas:

* κ = 2 × (TP × TN - FN × FP) / ((TP + FP) × (FP + TN) + (TP + FN) × (FN + TN))
* Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
* Sensitivity = TP / (TP + FN)
* Specificity = TN / (TN + FP)
* Prevalence = (TP + FN) / (TP + FN + FP + TN)

Where TP is the number of true positives, TN the true negatives, FP the false positives, and FN the false negatives.

Note that accuracy is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, but the metrics listed above provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance.
