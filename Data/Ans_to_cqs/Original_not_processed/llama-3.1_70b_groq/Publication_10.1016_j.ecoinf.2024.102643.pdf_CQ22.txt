Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the models are AUC (area under the receiver operating curve) and TSS (true skill statistic). According to the context, AUC values range from 0.5 to 1, with higher values indicating improved accuracy and predictive power. TSS values range from -1 to +1, with positive values indicating a perfect fit.
