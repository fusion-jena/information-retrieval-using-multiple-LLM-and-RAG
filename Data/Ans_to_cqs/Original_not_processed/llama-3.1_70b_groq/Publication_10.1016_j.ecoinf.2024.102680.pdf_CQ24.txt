Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and components of the UODN (Underwater Object Detection Network) and the challenges of underwater optical image detection. It does mention the use of mosaic data augmentation as a preprocessing operation, but this is not directly related to handling randomness in the pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
