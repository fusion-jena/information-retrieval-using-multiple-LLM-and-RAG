Answer:::
None of the provided text mentions the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it does mention that a deep learning solution called "Birdnet" is used for avian diversity monitoring in one of the references (Kahl et al., 2021), but it does not provide information about the specific architecture used in Birdnet. The main text discusses the use of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Wavelet Transform (WT) for feature extraction and classification, but it does not mention the use of deep learning models like CNN, RNN, or Transformer.
