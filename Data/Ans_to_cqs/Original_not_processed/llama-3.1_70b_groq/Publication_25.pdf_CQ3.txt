Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does mention the use of "hand-annotated trees" and "high-quality annotations" in the semi-supervised framework. This suggests that some form of manual annotation is involved, but the exact technique is not specified.

The context also mentions the use of unsupervised methods to generate initial training data, which is then refined with hand-annotated data. This implies that the annotation process may involve some form of correction or refinement of the automatically generated annotations, but the details of the annotation process are not provided.

Therefore, while we can infer that some form of manual annotation is involved, the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly stated in the provided context.
