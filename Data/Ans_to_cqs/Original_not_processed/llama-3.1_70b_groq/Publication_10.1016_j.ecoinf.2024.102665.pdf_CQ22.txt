Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does mention the "Contingency Table Fit (CTF)" as a network performance indicator that represents the quality of the fit to the data. The CTF is a normalized measure that ranges from 0 to 100%, with 0% indicating the poorest fit and 100% indicating the best possible fit.

Additionally, the context mentions that the CTF was extracted for the individual taxa factor networks as well as the meta-factor network. However, it does not provide information on other metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the only metric mentioned that is related to evaluating the performance of the model is the Contingency Table Fit (CTF).
