Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context discusses the use of various machine learning algorithms, model evaluation metrics (AUC, ROC, TSS, KAPPA, COR), and techniques (K-fold cross-validation, bootstrapping), but it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training.
