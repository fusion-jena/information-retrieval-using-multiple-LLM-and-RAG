Answer:

To ensure the generalizability of the model, several measures were taken. According to the text, consistent ratios across groups were maintained in the sampling process to avoid any potential bias during classification. This suggests that stratified splitting was used to ensure that the training, testing, and validation sets were representative of the overall population.

Additionally, the text mentions that different samples are present across groups to establish the reliability and generalizability of the model. This implies that a diverse dataset was used to train and evaluate the model.

Furthermore, the text states that both validation and test sets are considered separately to fine-tune the model's hyperparameters, leading to generalizability and scalability towards unseen datasets. This suggests that cross-validation was used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

Overall, it appears that the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model include stratified splitting, use of a diverse dataset, and cross-validation.
