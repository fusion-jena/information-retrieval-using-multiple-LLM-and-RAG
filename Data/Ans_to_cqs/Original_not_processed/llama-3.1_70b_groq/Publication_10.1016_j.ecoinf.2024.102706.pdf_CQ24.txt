Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on machine learning models, particularly LightGBM, XGBoost, and Random Forest, and their applications in predicting canopy cover from satellite data. It discusses the unique features of these models, such as leaf-wise splitting and gradient-based one-side sampling, but does not delve into the topic of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of bagging in Random Forest and LightGBM, which is a technique used to reduce the variance of a model by training multiple instances of the model on different subsets of the data. This can help to reduce the impact of randomness in the model. Additionally, the context mentions the use of hyperparameters such as learning rate, max depth, and number of estimators, which can also affect the randomness of the model. However, these are not specific strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

In summary, the provided context does not provide a direct answer to the query, and I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer.
