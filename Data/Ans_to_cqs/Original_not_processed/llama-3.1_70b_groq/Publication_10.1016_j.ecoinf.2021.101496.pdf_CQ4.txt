Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to various topics such as plant physiology, fog computing, smartphone-based optical assays, thermal-RGB imaging, and SPAD value modeling using linear models, generalized linear models, and artificial neural networks. However, it does not specifically discuss data augmentation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
