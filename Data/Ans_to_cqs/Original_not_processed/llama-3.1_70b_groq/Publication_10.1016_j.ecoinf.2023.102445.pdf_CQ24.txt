Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context appears to focus on the architecture and components of a deep learning model, including feature extraction, attention mechanisms, and network training. It also includes references to various research papers on pest detection and management, but does not discuss randomness or strategies for handling it.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question. If you have any further context or clarification, I would be happy to try and assist you further.
