Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on species distribution modeling, bioclimatic modeling, and conservation biology, with mentions of techniques such as Maxent, Biomod2, and sdm. However, it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias in deep learning pipelines.

That being said, the context does mention the issue of "imbalanced-biased data" in species distribution modeling and suggests that using a specific method (not specified) can help cope with this issue. Additionally, it highlights the importance of "scrupulous parameter selection" in ensuring the reliability of species predictions.

However, in terms of specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection, the context does not provide any information. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
