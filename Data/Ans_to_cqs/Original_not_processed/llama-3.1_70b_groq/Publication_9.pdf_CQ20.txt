Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses the training process, model convergence, and the use of pre-trained CNNs, but it does not provide information on the hardware resources used. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
