Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on the model's performance evaluation using metrics such as mean average precision (mAP) and recall, but it does not provide information on how the model's performance was monitored during the training process.

However, it is mentioned that the model was partially trained to learn the data first and then used to annotate new data before training it further. This suggests that the model's performance was evaluated at some point during the training process, but the specific strategy used to monitor its performance is not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not know the exact strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training.
