Answer:

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are:

1. Accuracy
2. Precision
3. Recall
4. F1-Score

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the model on both the validation set and the test set. The F1-Score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, and it provides a balanced measure of both metrics.

Additionally, the paper also mentions the use of other metrics such as false positive rate, but the primary metrics used for evaluation are accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the model on different groups (G1 to G5) and on different datasets (e.g., INT-TS-GSL100, RTL80, and RTP40). The results are presented in tables and figures, which provide a detailed comparison of the model's performance on different datasets and groups.
