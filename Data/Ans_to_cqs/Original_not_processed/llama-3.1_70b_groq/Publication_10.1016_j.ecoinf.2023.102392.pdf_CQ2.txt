Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the pipeline uses image data. The context mentions the use of UAV data and SPOT satellite images, which are processed using CATALYST PROFESSIONAL image processing software. Additionally, the context discusses the classification of forest types using XGBoost, which is a machine learning algorithm commonly used for image classification tasks. Therefore, it is likely that the pipeline uses image data, but the specific format (e.g., TIFF, JPEG, etc.) is not mentioned.
