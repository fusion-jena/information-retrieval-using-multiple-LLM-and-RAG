Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the MLP parameters and performance, research design, and data processing, as well as the description of the MLPnn-MC model. It does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
