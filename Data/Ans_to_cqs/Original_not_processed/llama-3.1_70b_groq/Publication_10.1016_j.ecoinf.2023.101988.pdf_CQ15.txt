Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be focused on the application of deep learning and other technologies in wildlife research, biodiversity monitoring, and ecological informatics, but it does not delve into the details of the deep learning pipeline or optimization techniques used.

However, it is worth noting that the paper "Modelling animal biodiversity using acoustic monitoring and deep learning" by Chalmers et al. (2021) is mentioned in the context, which suggests that deep learning techniques are being applied in this field. But without further information, it is not possible to determine which optimization techniques are being used.

Therefore, I do not know the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, and I cannot provide a more detailed answer.
