Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the use of deep learning for detecting invasive alien plants, particularly Cortaderia selloana, and discusses the opportunities and limitations of using social media and citizen science data for this purpose.

While the context mentions the use of various deep learning models, such as Faster R-CNN ResNet101 and Inception-v2, it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the pipeline. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
