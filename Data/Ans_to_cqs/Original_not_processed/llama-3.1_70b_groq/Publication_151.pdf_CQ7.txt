Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that when applying the model in practice on real data, it is possible to fine-tune all the hyperparameters using a validation set. 

The context suggests that a subset of the reference species can be randomly selected as the validation set, and these can be used as testing data to tune the parameters for the given data set. After tuning the parameters, the model can be trained one last time with all the data using the fine-tuned parameters. 

There is no mention of a specific ratio or criteria for splitting the data into training, testing, and validation sets. The context only mentions that the authors did not fine-tune the hyperparameters on any data set due to computational reasons, and instead used preselected values.
