Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the network, which is based on GoogLeNet, and the use of inception layers, convolutional neural networks, and a soft-max classifier. It also discusses the post-processing and bounding box fusion techniques used in the pipeline. However, it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used for training the network.
