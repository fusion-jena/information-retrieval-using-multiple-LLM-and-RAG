Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on techniques for reducing memory access, reconfiguring computation sequences, and optimizing model architectures to improve computational efficiency.

However, it does mention the use of various neural network models, such as ResNet-50, Inception V3, DenseNet, YOLOv5, YOLOv6, YOLOv7, and YOLOv8, which are commonly optimized using various techniques. But the specific optimization techniques used in these models are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
