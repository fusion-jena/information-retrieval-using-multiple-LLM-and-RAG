Answer: The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model, but rather a species distribution model. According to the text, the performance of the model is evaluated using the following metrics:

1. Area Under the receiver-operator Curve (AUC): This metric ranges from 0 to 1, where values closer to 1 indicate a higher accuracy of model prediction.
2. True Skill Statistics (TSS): This metric ranges between -1 and +1, where a value of +1 means complete agreement between observed and predicted distributions, and values of â‰¤0 denote no better than random performance.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model's performance is classified into three categories based on the AUC values: poor (0-0.335), medium (0.336-0.665), and good (0.666-1).

It does not mention the use of accuracy, precision, or recall as evaluation metrics.
