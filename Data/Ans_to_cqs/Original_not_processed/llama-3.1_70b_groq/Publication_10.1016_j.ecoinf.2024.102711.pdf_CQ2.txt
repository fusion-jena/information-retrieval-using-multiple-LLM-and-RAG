Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that AutoGluon is designed to work with structured data and that it automates feature engineering, data pre-processing, model training, and ensembling. This suggests that the data format used in the pipeline is likely to be tabular or CSV-like, as these are common formats for structured data. However, it does not provide information on whether image, audio, or video data formats are used in the pipeline.
