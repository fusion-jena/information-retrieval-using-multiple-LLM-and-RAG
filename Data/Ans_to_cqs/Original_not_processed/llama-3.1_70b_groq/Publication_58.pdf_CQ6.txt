Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does mention that the SPOT6 satellite data for the five study areas were preprocessed to be fed into the different deep learning architectures and the XGBoost model. 

The preprocessing steps mentioned in the context include splitting the data into three mutually exclusive parts: a learning set, a validation set, and a test set. Additionally, the context mentions that the data were balanced using the median frequency balancing method to address the issue of unbalanced data sets. 

It is also mentioned that the internal parameters of the employed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures were not changed with regards to the originally proposed ones, but it does not provide information on the specific preprocessing steps involved.
