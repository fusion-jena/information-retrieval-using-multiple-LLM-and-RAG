Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided pieces of context do not mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context appears to be focused on ecological informatics, wildlife research, and biodiversity monitoring, with a few papers mentioning machine learning and deep learning approaches for tasks like animal biodiversity modeling and bird species identification. However, the specific question about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline is not addressed in the provided context.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
