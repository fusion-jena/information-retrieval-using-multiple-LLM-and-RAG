Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context appears to be focused on the PLUS model, its components, and its application in predicting NPP in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, but it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training in this context.
