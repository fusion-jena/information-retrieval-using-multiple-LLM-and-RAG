Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context only mentions the use of the Python programming language and the 'sklearn' library for building the CART model, but it does not provide information on the hardware resources used for training the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
