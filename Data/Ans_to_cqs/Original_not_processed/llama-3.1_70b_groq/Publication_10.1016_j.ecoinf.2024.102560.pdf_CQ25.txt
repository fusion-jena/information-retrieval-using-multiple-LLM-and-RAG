Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific deep learning model or its purpose. It appears to be a collection of references and abstracts related to environmental science, soil salinity, and remote sensing, but it does not provide information about a specific deep learning model or its intended use. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the question.
