Answer:

To ensure the generalizability of the model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the training data was augmented to extend the existing training data, which enhances the generalization capabilities of the model. 

Additionally, the reference dataset was split into training and testing sets at a 70:30 ratio, and two types of accuracy assessments were applied. The first type of accuracy assessment was 10-fold cross-validation with three repetitions, which helps to find the best models with the largest overall accuracy and reflects the resulting distribution models. This type of accuracy assessment helps to ensure that the model is reliable and generalizable.

Furthermore, the dataset was split randomly into 10 folds, with 9 folds used for model training and 1 for testing, and this procedure was repeated until all folds were used as testing data. This process was repeated two more times using new random splits. This process helps to ensure that the model is robust and can generalize well to unseen data.

Lastly, hyperparameter tuning was conducted using a grid search, which helps to find the optimal hyperparameters for the model. This process helps to ensure that the model is optimized and can generalize well to new data.

Overall, the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model include data augmentation, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning.
