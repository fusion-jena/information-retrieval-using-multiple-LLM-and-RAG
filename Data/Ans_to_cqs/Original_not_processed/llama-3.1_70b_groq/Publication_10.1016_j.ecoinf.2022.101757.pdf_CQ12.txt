Answer: 
The pipeline uses a deep learning model called Deeplabv3+, which is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is mentioned in the context as "Deeplabv3+ with COCO classes" and is used for semantic segmentation. Additionally, another paper mentioned in the context, "Tang, J., Gong, C., Guo, F., Yang, Z., Wu, Z., 2022a. Geo-localization based on cnn" also suggests the use of CNNs. However, it is not clear if this is the same pipeline or a different one.
