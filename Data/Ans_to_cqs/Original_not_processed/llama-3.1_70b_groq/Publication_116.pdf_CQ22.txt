Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does mention "accuracy" in the context of the hand-crafted feature extraction experiment and the deep learning experiment. Specifically, it mentions "top-1 accuracy" and "top-5 accuracy" in the deep learning experiment.

Additionally, the context mentions that the best accuracy obtained in the hand-crafted feature extraction experiment is 41.6%, and that the top-1 accuracy and top-5 accuracy in the deep learning experiment are significantly higher for the biased dataset compared to the unbiased dataset.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions that the results are compared to a previous study that reported an accuracy of 90%, suggesting that accuracy is a key metric used to evaluate the performance of the model.

However, it is not clear if other metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, etc. are used to evaluate the performance of the model.
