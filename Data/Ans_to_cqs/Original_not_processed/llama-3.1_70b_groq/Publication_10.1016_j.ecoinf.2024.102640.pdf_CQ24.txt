Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context appears to focus on computer vision and image segmentation tasks, discussing various models and their performance metrics.

However, I can provide some general information on handling randomness in deep learning pipelines. In deep learning, randomness can arise from various sources, including random weight initialization, data shuffling, and dropout. To handle this randomness, researchers and practitioners often employ techniques such as:

1. Fixing the random seed: Setting a fixed random seed value can ensure reproducibility of results, as the same sequence of random numbers will be generated.
2. Averaging multiple runs: Running the model multiple times with different random seeds and averaging the results can help reduce the impact of randomness.
3. Using techniques like dropout and data augmentation: These techniques can help the model generalize better to new data and reduce overfitting.

However, without more specific information from the context, I cannot provide a more detailed answer to the query.
