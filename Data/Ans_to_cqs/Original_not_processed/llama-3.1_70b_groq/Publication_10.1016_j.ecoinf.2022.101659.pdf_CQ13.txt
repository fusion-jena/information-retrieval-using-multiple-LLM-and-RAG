Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or hyperparameters such as learning rate and optimizer. The context appears to be related to shellfish farming, ecology, and environmental monitoring, with references to scientific studies and research papers. There is no mention of machine learning or deep learning models, so I am unable to provide an answer to the query.
