Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context discusses the architecture and training of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model, as well as its application to semi-supervised clustering, but it does not provide information on data splitting. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
