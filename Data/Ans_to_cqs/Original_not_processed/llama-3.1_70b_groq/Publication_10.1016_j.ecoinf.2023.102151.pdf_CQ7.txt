Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be focused on soil science, digital soil mapping, and related topics, with references to various research papers and studies. While some of the papers may touch on machine learning or data analysis, none of them seem to specifically address the criteria for splitting data for deep learning model training.

Therefore, I must conclude that I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context. If you have any further information or clarification, I'd be happy to try and assist you further.
