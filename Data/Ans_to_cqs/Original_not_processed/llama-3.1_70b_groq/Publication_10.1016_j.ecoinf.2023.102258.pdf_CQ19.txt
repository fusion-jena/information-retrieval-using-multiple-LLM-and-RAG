Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models. The text mentions various techniques, architectures, and methods used in the models, such as CNN, ResNet, Perceiver, and Prototypical Networks, but it does not specify the frameworks used to implement these models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
