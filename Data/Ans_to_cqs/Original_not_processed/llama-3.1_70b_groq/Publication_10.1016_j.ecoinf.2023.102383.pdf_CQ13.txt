Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context primarily discusses the architecture of the model, including the use of residual neural networks (ResNet) and feature pyramid networks (FPN), as well as the challenges of detecting small objects in UAV thermal images. It does not provide information on the specific hyperparameters used to train the model.
