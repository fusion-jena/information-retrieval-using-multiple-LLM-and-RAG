Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only discusses the workflow used to select a deep learning model, develop a ground-truth imagery dataset, train the deep learning models, evaluate model performance, and obtain and analyze data to quantify spatial patterns and resilience of the ecosystem (Fig. 1). 

However, it does mention that the deep learning and post-processing scripts, along with the 2012 aerial imagery and data output used in the study, are available at a specific GitHub repository (https://git.wur.nl/deep-learning-tools-for-marine-ecosystem-monitoring). This suggests that the model and related scripts are available for others to use and potentially deploy, but the actual deployment process is not described in the provided context.
