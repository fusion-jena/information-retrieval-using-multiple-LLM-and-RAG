Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context mentions the use of various machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest (RF), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), but it does not provide detailed information on the specific techniques used to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.

However, it is mentioned that the RF model used default settings, which included creating around 500 decision trees with over 3000 training samples randomly selected for training purposes. This suggests that some form of random sampling was used, but it is unclear if this was done to ensure generalizability or for other purposes.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a "Control() function" to evaluate tuning parameters for model performance, but it does not provide further details on what this function entails or how it relates to ensuring generalizability.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
