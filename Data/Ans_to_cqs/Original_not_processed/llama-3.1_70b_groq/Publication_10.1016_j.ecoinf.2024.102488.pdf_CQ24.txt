Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided pieces of context do not specifically address the question of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing, wetland mapping, and machine learning algorithms, particularly ensemble learning methods like Random Forest, AdaBoost, and LightGBM.

However, I can provide some general information on handling randomness in machine learning pipelines. In many machine learning frameworks, randomness is often introduced during processes like data splitting, feature selection, and model initialization. To ensure reproducibility and consistency in results, it is common to set a random seed value, which allows for the same sequence of random numbers to be generated.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness, it does mention the use of ensemble learning methods, which can help reduce the impact of randomness by combining the predictions of multiple models. Additionally, some of the cited papers may implicitly use techniques like cross-validation, which can help mitigate the effects of randomness in model evaluation.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly address the question, it is likely that researchers in the field of remote sensing and machine learning employ strategies like setting random seed values, using ensemble methods, and cross-validation to handle randomness in their pipelines.
