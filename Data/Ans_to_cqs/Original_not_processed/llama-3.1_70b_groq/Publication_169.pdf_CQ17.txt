Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, it does mention that data augmentation was used to enlarge the dataset and overcome the problem of overfitting. This suggests that data augmentation was the primary method used to prevent overfitting, but it does not provide information on other regularization methods that may have been used.
