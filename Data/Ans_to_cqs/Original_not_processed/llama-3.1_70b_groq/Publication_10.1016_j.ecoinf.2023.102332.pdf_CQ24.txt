Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on word embedding techniques, specifically Word2vec, and its application in semantic analysis, as well as natural language processing (NLP) methods for text mining. It does not discuss deep learning pipelines or randomness handling strategies.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
