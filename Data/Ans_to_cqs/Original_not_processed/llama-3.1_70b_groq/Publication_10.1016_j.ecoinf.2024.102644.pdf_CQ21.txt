Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context appears to be discussing the results of a model prediction, specifically a MaxEnt model, and its application to a real-world scenario, but it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
