Answer: Unfortunately, the provided text does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that "Details on the hyperparameters used for model fitting are provided in Supplementary material 1: Text S2" and "Details on the R packages and hyperparameter values used for fitting these three algorithms are provided in Supplementary material 1: Text S1". This suggests that the information on hyperparameter optimization is available in the supplementary materials, but it is not provided in the main text. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided text.
