Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the study uses "satellite data" as the input for the hybrid deep learning model to forecast algal blooms in the Zhoushan fishery. This suggests that satellite data is the primary source of raw data used in the study, but the exact methods of collecting this data are not specified.
