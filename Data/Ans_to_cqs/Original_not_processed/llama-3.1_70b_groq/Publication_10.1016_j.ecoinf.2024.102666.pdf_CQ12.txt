Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used in the pipeline. Specifically, the context mentions the use of "deep-convolutional neural networks" (Kumar, A., Gorai, A.K., 2023) and "convolutional neural networks" (Meng, H., Zhang, J., Zheng, Z., Song, Y., Lai, Y., 2024) for land use/land cover classification and water quality level classification, respectively. Additionally, the context mentions the use of "neural networks" (Men, J., Liu, J., Xia, G., Yue, T., Tong, R., Tian, L., Arai, K., Wang, L., 2022) for atmospheric correction, but it does not specify the type of neural network used. However, based on the other mentions of CNNs, it is possible that CNNs are also used for atmospheric correction. There is no mention of RNNs or Transformers in the provided context.
