Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The context appears to be discussing a method for assessing the explanatory power of driver factors on the spatial variability of the kNDVI (a vegetation index) using a statistic called Q. It mentions the use of different grid scales (e.g., 1 km*1 km, 2 km*2 km) to compare Q values, but it does not discuss deep learning models or their generalizability. Therefore, I do not have enough information to answer the query.
