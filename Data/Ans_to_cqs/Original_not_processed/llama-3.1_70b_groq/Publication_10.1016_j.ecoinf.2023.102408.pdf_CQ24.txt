Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning pipelines or strategies for handling randomness in such pipelines. The context appears to be focused on a study that used machine learning algorithms, specifically Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), to predict Above-Ground Biomass (AGB). The context discusses the advantages and limitations of the RF algorithm, the evaluation of hyper-parameters, and the results of the study, but it does not provide information on handling randomness in deep learning pipelines.
