Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The text appears to be a research paper discussing the use of machine learning models to assess the impact of urban development on species distribution. It mentions the use of seven different machine learning models, including Generalized Linear Model (GLM) and Random Forest (RF), but does not provide any information about a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link.
