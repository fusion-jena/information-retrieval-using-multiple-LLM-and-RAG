Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the performance of various deep learning models, including GoogleNet, ResNet, and ResNeXT, on plant species identification tasks. It also discusses ensemble methods and transfer learning techniques used to improve model performance.

However, it can be inferred that the datasets used in the studies, such as LifeCLEF 2015 and Plant CLEF 2016, likely required some form of data annotation to prepare the images for training and testing the deep learning models. Common data annotation techniques used in computer vision tasks include image classification, object detection (which may involve bounding box annotation), and instance segmentation.

Unfortunately, without more specific information, it is not possible to determine the exact data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for the studies mentioned in the context.
