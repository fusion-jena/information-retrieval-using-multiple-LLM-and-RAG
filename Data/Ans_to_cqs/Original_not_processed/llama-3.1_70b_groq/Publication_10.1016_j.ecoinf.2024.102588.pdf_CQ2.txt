Answer: The text does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the CNN model is used to process "multidimensional data" and that the input data includes "water quality and hydraulic and hydrological data". Additionally, it mentions that the data is divided into training and validation datasets, suggesting that the data is in a tabular format, possibly CSV. However, it does not rule out the possibility of other data formats being used.
