Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in the study by Huang et al. (2019). The study focuses on monitoring ecosystem service change in the City of Shenzhen using high-resolution remotely sensed imagery and deep learning, but it does not provide information on the evaluation metrics used for the deep learning model.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
