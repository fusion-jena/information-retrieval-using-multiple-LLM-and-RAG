Answer: The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using various metrics, including:

1. Precision: represents the proportion of positive samples correctly recognized by the model.
2. Recall: denotes the proportion of all actual positive samples that are correctly recognized.
3. F1 score: a harmonic mean of Precision and Recall, providing a comprehensive performance measure.
4. Mean Average Precision (mAP): calculates the average precision across all categories of recall.
5. Frames Per Second (FPS): measures the real-time performance of the model.
6. Box_loss: assesses the accuracy of the model’s predicted bounding boxes against the actual ones.

These metrics provide a comprehensive assessment of the model’s performance in object detection tasks.
