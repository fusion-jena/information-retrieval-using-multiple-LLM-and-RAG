Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the use of existing datasets, such as WorldClim and ETCCDI, which are likely publicly available datasets. There is no mention of surveys or sensors being used for data collection.

However, it is mentioned that the data is "difficult and costly to collect", which suggests that data collection may be a challenging and resource-intensive process. But the specific methods used for collecting raw data are not specified in the provided context.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
