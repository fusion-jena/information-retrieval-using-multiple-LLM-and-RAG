Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to focus on the application of machine learning models, specifically ensemble techniques and XGBoost, for landslide susceptibility mapping. It discusses the advantages of using XGBoost and the implementation of heterogeneous ensemble techniques, but it does not delve into the preprocessing steps required for training a deep learning model.

However, it is generally known that preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning are crucial before training a deep learning model. Normalization involves scaling numeric data to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model. Scaling involves transforming data to have a similar magnitude, which can improve model performance. Cleaning involves handling missing values, removing outliers, and encoding categorical variables.

Since the context does not provide specific information on preprocessing steps for deep learning models, it is recommended to consult additional resources or literature on deep learning for more information on this topic.
