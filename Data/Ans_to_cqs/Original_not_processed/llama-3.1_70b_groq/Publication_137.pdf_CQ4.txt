Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the SPG framework, model training, and result output, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.

However, it does mention that the learning decay rate is set to 0.7, and the regularization strength is adjusted to 0.2 for better results. Additionally, it discusses the use of geometric features such as linearity, planarity, and scattering, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
