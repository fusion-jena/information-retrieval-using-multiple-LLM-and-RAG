Answer: The text does not explicitly state the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions that the training and evaluation process is iterated until a "satisfactory level of performance is achieved" (Step 3). This suggests that the performance metrics, such as accuracy, recall, F1 score, and others, are used to evaluate the model's performance and determine when to stop training. However, the specific criteria, such as a validation loss plateau, are not mentioned.
