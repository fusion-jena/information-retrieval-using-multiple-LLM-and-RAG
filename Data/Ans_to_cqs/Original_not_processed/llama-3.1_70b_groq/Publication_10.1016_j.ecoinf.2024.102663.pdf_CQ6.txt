Answer:::

Based on the provided context, specifically Table 3, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model (YOLOv8) are:

1. White balance
2. Gamma correction
3. Sharpening
4. Dehazing
5. Denoising
6. CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization)

These preprocessing steps are applied to the images before training the YOLOv8 model. However, it is not explicitly mentioned whether normalization, scaling, or cleaning are involved in the preprocessing steps. The context only mentions the above-mentioned techniques as part of the preprocessing methods.
