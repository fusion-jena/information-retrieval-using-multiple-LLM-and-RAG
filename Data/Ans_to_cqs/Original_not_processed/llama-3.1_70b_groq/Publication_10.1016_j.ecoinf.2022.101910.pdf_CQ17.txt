Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline of BirdNET. The context primarily focuses on the capabilities and limitations of BirdNET, a research project for automated bird species identification, and its application in ecological informatics. It does not delve into the technical details of the deep learning pipeline, including regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this query.
