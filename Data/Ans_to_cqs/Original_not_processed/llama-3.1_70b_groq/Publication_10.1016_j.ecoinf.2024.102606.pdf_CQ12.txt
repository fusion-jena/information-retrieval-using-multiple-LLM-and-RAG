Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically Faster R-CNN, which is a variant of CNN. This is evident from the text, which mentions "Faster R-CNN (640)" and "Faster R-CNN (1280)" as two different versions of the model used in the benchmark. Additionally, the text mentions that the models use Resnet50 as a backbone, which is a type of CNN architecture. There is no mention of RNN or Transformer models in the provided context.
