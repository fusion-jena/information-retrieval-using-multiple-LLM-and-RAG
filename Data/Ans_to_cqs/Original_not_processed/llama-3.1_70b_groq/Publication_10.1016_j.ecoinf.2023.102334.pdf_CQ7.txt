Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The text only mentions that the model was trained and evaluated on a test set using metrics like accuracy, loss, and a confusion matrix, but it does not provide details on how the data was split into training, validation, and test sets. Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used for data splitting in this study.
