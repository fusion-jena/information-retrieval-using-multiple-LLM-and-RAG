Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. It primarily focuses on hyperparameter tuning and model development using k-fold cross-validation and grid search. However, it does mention the evaluation of the model's performance using the tuning dataset and the calculation of average performance across k models.

It mentions the use of metrics calculation and the evaluation of the model's performance, but it does not provide details on the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as the creation of saliency maps or the generation of a confusion matrix.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query about the postprocessing steps involved after model training.
