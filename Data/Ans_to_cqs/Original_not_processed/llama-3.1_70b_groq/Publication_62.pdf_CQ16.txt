Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be focused on the architecture of the deep convolutional neural networks used for the project, as well as the importance of proper metadata curation. It does not provide information on the training process or the stopping criteria used. Therefore, I do not know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete.
