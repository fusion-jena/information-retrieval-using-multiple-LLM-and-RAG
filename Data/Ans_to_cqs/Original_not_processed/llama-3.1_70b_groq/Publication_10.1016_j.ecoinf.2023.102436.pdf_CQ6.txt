Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to landscape ecology, urban design, and environmental performance evaluation, with a focus on 3D spatial metrics and landscape analysis. It does not provide information on deep learning model training or preprocessing steps.

However, I can provide general information on common preprocessing steps involved in training a deep learning model. These steps may include:

* Data cleaning: handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting errors
* Data normalization: scaling numeric data to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model
* Data scaling: transforming data to have zero mean and unit variance, which can improve model performance
* Feature engineering: selecting and transforming relevant features to improve model performance
* Data augmentation: artificially increasing the size of the training dataset by applying transformations to the existing data

Please note that these steps may vary depending on the specific problem, dataset, and model architecture. If you are looking for specific information on preprocessing steps for a particular deep learning model or application, I would be happy to try and help you find the relevant information.
