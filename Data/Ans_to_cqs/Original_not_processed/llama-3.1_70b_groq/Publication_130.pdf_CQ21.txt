Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. However, it does mention that the validation dataset is used to compute the accuracy and loss (estimation of the error during training) of the model. This suggests that some form of metrics calculation is performed, but the specific details are not provided.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model's performance is assessed by manually labelling pictures and adding them to the training dataset until a satisfactory performance is achieved. This implies that some form of evaluation or validation is performed, but the specific metrics or techniques used are not specified.

Therefore, while we can infer that some form of evaluation or validation is performed after model training, the specific postprocessing steps involved are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
