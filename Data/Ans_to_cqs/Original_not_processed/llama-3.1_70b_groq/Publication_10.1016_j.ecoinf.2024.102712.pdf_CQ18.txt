Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is a leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) approach. This is mentioned in the context as a method used to validate the model, which indicates that it was also used to monitor the model's performance during training. The LOOCV approach involves training the model on all data points except one, and then using the remaining data point to evaluate the model's performance. This process is repeated for all data points, and the results are used to estimate the model's performance. In this case, the LOOCV approach showed an RMSE of 13.93 ton/ha, an R2 of 0.88, a mean absolute error (MAE) of 10.77, and a bias of -0.28.
