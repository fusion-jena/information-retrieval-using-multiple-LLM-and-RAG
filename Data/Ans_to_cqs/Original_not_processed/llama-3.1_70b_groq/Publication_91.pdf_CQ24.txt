Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention that the training set images were augmented in various ways, including flipping, adjusting brightness, saturation, contrast, and hue. This data augmentation can help to increase the robustness of the model and reduce overfitting, which can be affected by randomness in the training process.

Additionally, the context mentions that the batch size is 32 and the learning rate is exponentially decayed every 3 epochs, but it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in terms of random seed values or other strategies.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a complete answer to the query.
