Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to adaptively synthesize wetland training data, which can help to address the problem of imbalanced data.

Specifically, the context mentions that the 3D GAN model uses a conditional map unit to produce synthetic samples from a random noise vector, similar to the Generative Adversarial Minority Over-sampling (GAMO) and 3D-HyperGAMO methods. This approach is used to generate synthetic samples for classes with a low number of training samples, which can help to balance the data and reduce bias.

While this approach is not explicitly mentioned as a technique for addressing data bias during preprocessing, it can be inferred that the use of GANs and synthetic data generation can be a useful technique for addressing data imbalance and bias in the context of wetland mapping.

It is worth noting that the context does not mention other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, so it is unclear if these techniques are used in the preprocessing pipeline.
