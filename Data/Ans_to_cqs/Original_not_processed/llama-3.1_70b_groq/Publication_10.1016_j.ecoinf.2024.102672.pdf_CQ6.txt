Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), hyperparameter tuning, and the training process. It does mention the addition of a new categorical binary variable to the dataset, but it does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to perform preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning before training a model. These steps can help improve the stability and performance of the model. Normalization typically involves scaling numeric data to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model. Scaling involves transforming data to have a similar magnitude, which can help with convergence during training. Cleaning involves removing or handling missing or erroneous data.

Since the context does not provide specific information on preprocessing steps, I cannot provide a definitive answer. If you have any further questions or context, I'll be happy to try and help.
