Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the researchers used a "FIT interface" to manually mark landmark points on the tracks, which suggests that some form of manual annotation was involved. Additionally, the context mentions that the annotation process is "somewhat subjective", which implies that human judgment was involved in the annotation process.

However, the specific annotation techniques used, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, are not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I do not know the exact data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
