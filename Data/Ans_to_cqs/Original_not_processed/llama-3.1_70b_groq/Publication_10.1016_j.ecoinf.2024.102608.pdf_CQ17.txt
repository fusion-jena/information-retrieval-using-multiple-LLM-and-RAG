Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily discusses the use of machine learning algorithms, including neural networks, for water quality modeling and the use of randomized grid search methods for hyperparameter tuning. It does mention the importance of balancing model complexity and reducing the risk of overfitting, but it does not provide specific details on regularization methods used to achieve this.

Therefore, I don't know the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the query.
