Answer:

The provided context does not specifically mention a "deep learning model". However, it does mention an "Artificial neural network" which is a type of deep learning model. According to Table 1, the hyperparameters used in the Artificial neural network are:

* Hidden layer sizes
* Activation
* Solver
* Alpha
* Learning rate

These hyperparameters are used for both Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat-8 OLI imagery, but the specific values are not provided in the context.
