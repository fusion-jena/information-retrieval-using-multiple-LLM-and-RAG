Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. However, it does mention the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the Machine Learning Models (MLMs), which include:

* Area under the receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curve (AUC)
* True skill statistics (TSS)
* Kappa
* Phi

These metrics are used to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of each MLM. Additionally, the context mentions the use of the Kruskal-Wallis test to determine whether a significant difference in prediction accuracy exists among the classifiers.

It also mentions the calculation of Î” AUC (the difference between the AUC of the training data and the AUC of the test data) to evaluate the model complexity and sensitivity to the training data.

However, it does not provide information on Saliency maps or Confusion matrix as postprocessing steps. Therefore, I do not know the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, except for the calculation of the mentioned evaluation metrics.
