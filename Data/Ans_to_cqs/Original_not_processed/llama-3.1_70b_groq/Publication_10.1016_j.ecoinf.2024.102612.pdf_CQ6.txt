Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The text primarily focuses on the training and evaluation of the SoftGroup semantic branch, the use of synthetic data, and the retrieval of fuel models. It does mention the use of real MS point clouds as inputs for the decision tree scheme, but it does not provide information on the preprocessing steps applied to these point clouds.

However, it is mentioned that the real MS point clouds are segmented using the methodology exposed in Section 2.3 to create a ground truth, which suggests that some form of preprocessing or data preparation is involved. Unfortunately, the details of this preprocessing are not provided in the given context.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query regarding the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model.
