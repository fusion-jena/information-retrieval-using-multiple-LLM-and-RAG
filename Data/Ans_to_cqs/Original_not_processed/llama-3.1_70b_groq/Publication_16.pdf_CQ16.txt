Answer:::
The criteria used to determine when training is complete is not explicitly stated in terms of validation loss plateau. However, it is mentioned that the model achieved convergence early in the training session, and the loss continued to decrease throughout the specified 100 epochs. Additionally, it is stated that the accuracy of the model flattens towards the end of the training session, indicating that the necessary number of epochs required for model convergence is sufficient. Increasing the number of epochs would likely lead to overfitting, suggesting that the training is complete when the model's accuracy stops improving and further training would not result in significant gains.
