Answer: 
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it does mention the use of "deep convolution neural networks" in a referenced paper by El Abbadi and Alsaadi (2020), which suggests that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) might be used in the pipeline. Additionally, the context mentions the use of "deep learning methods" and "deep learning pipeline" in general, but it does not provide specific information about the type of model used. Therefore, while CNNs might be a possibility, the exact type of model used in the pipeline is not explicitly stated in the provided context.
