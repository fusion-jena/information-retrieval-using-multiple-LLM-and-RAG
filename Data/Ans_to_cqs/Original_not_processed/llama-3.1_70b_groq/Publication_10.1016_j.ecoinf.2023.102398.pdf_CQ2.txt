Answer:::
Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily deals with image data. The context mentions various papers and techniques related to image recognition, object detection, and visual recognition using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). There is no explicit mention of audio or video data formats being used in the pipeline. However, it is mentioned that Bhagabati and Sarma (2016) highlighted various object detection techniques using video input, but this seems to be a reference to a specific paper rather than a description of the pipeline itself.

There is also no mention of CSV (Comma Separated Values) data format being used in the pipeline. The context primarily focuses on image data and the use of CNNs for image recognition and object detection tasks.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data.
