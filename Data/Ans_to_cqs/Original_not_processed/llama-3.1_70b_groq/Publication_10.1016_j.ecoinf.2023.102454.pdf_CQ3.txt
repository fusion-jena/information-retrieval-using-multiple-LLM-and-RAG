Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a research study on carbon emissions and energy data in China, and it discusses data sources, funding, and author contributions. There is no mention of deep learning, bounding box annotation, or instance segmentation.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
