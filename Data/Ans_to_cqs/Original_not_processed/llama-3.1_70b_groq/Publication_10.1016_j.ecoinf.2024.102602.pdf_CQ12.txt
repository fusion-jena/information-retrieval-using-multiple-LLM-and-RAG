Answer: The deep learning models used in the pipeline are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Specifically, six open-source CNNs were selected: VGG16, ResNet50, ResNet101, Inception-v3, DenseNet201, and EfficientNetB0. These models were chosen for their ease of transfer learning and high performance on similar classification tasks.
