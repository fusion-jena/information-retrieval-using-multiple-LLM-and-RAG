Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a study on coral reefs, and it discusses the use of a Minimum Weighted Spanning Tree (MWST) algorithm for clustering and network analysis, but it does not mention deep learning models or any measures taken to ensure their generalizability.

However, one of the references mentioned in the context, "Do, A.N.T., Tran, H.D., 2023. Combining a deep learning model with an optimization algorithm to detect the dispersal of the early stages of spotted butterfish in northern Vietnam under global warming," suggests that a deep learning model was used in a different study, but the context does not provide any information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of that model.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to answer the query.
