Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning and deep learning models for predicting cotton leaf curl disease (CLCuD) incidence, and it does not delve into the details of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
