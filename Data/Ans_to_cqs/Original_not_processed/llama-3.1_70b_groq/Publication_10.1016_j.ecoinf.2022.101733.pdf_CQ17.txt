Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing, support vector machines (SVM), and feature selection, but it does not discuss deep learning or regularization methods specifically.

However, I can provide some general information on regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. Common regularization methods include dropout, L2 regularization (also known as weight decay), and L1 regularization. These methods help prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function or by randomly dropping out neurons during training.

Dropout is a technique where a fraction of neurons are randomly dropped out during training, which helps prevent the model from relying too heavily on any single neuron. L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the magnitude of the model's weights, which helps prevent the model from having large weights. L1 regularization adds a penalty term that is proportional to the absolute value of the model's weights, which helps prevent the model from having non-zero weights.

It's worth noting that the provided context does mention SVM, which is a type of machine learning model that can be prone to overfitting. However, the context does not discuss regularization methods specifically in the context of SVM or deep learning.
