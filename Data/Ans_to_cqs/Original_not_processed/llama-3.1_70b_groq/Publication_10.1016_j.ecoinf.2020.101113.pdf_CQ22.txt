Answer:::

The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics, including:

1. Precision (P(τ)): the fraction of predictions of presence that are correct.
2. Recall (R(τ)): also known as sensitivity or true-positive rate, measures the fraction of presences that are correctly identified.
3. Precision-Recall Curve: a curve that consists of the points in precision-recall space achieved at each possible threshold.
4. Average-Precision (AP): the weighted sum of precisions at each threshold, using the increase in recall from the previous threshold as the weight. It approximates the integral of, or area under, the precision-recall curve.
5. Mean-Average-Precision (mAP): the average-precision across classes, commonly used in multi-label prediction evaluation.

Note that accuracy is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context as a metric used to evaluate the performance of the model. However, the context does mention true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN), which are the components used to calculate accuracy.
