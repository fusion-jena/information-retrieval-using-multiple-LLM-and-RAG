Answer:::
The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, as mentioned in the provided context, are:

1. Horizontal flip: Each image was horizontally flipped.
2. Grayscale: Grayscale was applied to 25% of the images.
3. Blur: Image blur was applied up to 10px.
4. Noise: Image noise was applied up to 10% of pixels.
5. Cropping: A patch with the same size as the original image was randomly cropped from the image.

These techniques were used to extend the amount of data and act as a regularizer to reduce overfitting. The context does not mention rotating or scaling as part of the data augmentation techniques used in this study.
