Answer: I don't know. The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link for such a pipeline. It appears to be a research study focused on ecological informatics, specifically drought monitoring and land cover variations in the Urmia Lake basin, using satellite-based datasets from Google Earth Engine (GEE) and NOAA.
