Answer: The hyperparameters of the models are optimized using a 5-fold cross-validation grid search strategy within the training dataset. This approach is implemented to tune the hyperparameters for all machine learning models, leveraging the functionalities inherent in their respective Python packages. The grid search range and optimized values for each model's hyperparameters are presented in Table 4.
