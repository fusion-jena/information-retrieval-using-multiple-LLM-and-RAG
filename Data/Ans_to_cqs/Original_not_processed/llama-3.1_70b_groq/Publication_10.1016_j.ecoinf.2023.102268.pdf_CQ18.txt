Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is 10-fold cross-validation. Additionally, 50% of the training data was held-out for validation, which was used for model selection and parameter optimization. This approach allows for evaluating the model's performance on unseen data during training and helps to prevent overfitting.
