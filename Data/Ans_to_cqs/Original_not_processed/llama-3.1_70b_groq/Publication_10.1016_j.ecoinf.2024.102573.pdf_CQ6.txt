Answer:::

The provided context mentions several preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. These steps include:

1. **Log compression**: The outputs of the frontend are log-compressed without normalization.
2. **Normalization**: Normalization is applied on top of the log compression, which is found to significantly improve the performance of the models.
3. **PCEN (Per-Channel Energy Normalization)**: PCEN is used as an alternative to log compression, and it is found to be effective in whitening the data and alleviating stationary background noise.
4. **Data augmentation**: Although not explicitly described, the context mentions that data augmentation is used, but its specific details are not provided.

It is also mentioned that the frontend's output is normalized before being fed into the backend classifier. This normalization step is found to make the learning process easier and improve the performance of the models.

It is worth noting that the context does not mention any specific scaling or cleaning steps involved in the preprocessing pipeline. However, it does mention that the frontend's output is normalized, which may involve some form of scaling.
