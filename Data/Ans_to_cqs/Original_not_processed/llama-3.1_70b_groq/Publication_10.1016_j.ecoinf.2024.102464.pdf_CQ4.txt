Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data augmentation techniques or a deep learning pipeline. The text appears to be discussing a study on the impact of urban development on species distribution, using machine learning models and environmental variables. The context mentions the use of seven different machine learning models, including Generalized Linear Model (GLM) and Random Forest (RF), but does not provide information on data augmentation techniques or a deep learning pipeline.
