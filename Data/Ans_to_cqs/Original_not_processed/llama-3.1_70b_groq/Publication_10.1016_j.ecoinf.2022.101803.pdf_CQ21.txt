Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context appears to be focused on the model training and evaluation process, specifically on the splitting of the dataset into folds, training the model, and calculating the out-of-sample R2. 

However, it does mention calculating the out-of-sample R2 and the median of k-1 out-of-sample R2's for each number of iterations. This suggests that some form of evaluation or metrics calculation is being performed, but it does not provide information on other postprocessing steps like Saliency maps or Confusion matrix.
