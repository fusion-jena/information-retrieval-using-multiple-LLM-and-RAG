Answer: 

The deep learning pipeline uses audio data formats. Specifically, the pipeline processes raw waveform audio data, which is then converted into a sequence of feature vectors, or latent feature vectors, that represent the latent feature of bird vocalization. Additionally, the pipeline also uses Mel spectrograms, which are a visual representation of audio signals. There is no mention of image, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
