Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as train, test, and validation sets. The context primarily discusses the use of Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network, and Support Vector Machine models, but it does not provide information on data splitting criteria.

However, it does mention that the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model was fitted using the CARET package, which is a popular R package for building and testing regression models. CARET provides functions for data splitting, but the specific criteria used in this study are not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not know the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training in this study.
