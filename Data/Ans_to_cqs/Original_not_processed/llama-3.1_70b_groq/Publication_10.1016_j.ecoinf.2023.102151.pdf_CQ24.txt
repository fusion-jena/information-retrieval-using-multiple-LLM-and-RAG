Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context appears to be focused on soil science, ecology, and visualization, with some references to machine learning and computational algorithms. However, it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in a deep learning pipeline.

One relevant mention of randomness is in the description of the growth algorithm, which applies a probability function, typically a normal distribution, in all directions to allow for a certain degree of randomness in the growth effect. However, this is not directly related to handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
