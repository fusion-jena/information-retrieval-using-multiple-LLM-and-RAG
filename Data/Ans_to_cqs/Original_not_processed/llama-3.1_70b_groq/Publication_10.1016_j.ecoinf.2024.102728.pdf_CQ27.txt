Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a research study that used various data sources, including archaeological survey data, remotely sensed data, and ancillary data, but it does not provide information on the deployment of a deep learning model.

The only mention of deep learning is in the reference "Mohedano, E., Salvador, A., McGuinness, K., Nieto, X.G.-I., OConnor, N., MarquÂ´es, F., 2017. Object retrieval with deep convolutional. Deep Learn. Image Proc. Appl. 31, 137.", but this is just a citation and does not provide any information on the deployment process.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
