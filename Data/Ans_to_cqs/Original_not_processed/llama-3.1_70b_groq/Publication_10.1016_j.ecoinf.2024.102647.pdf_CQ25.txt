Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific purpose of the deep learning model. It mentions the use of a "deep learning convolutional neural network algorithm" in a study on soil salinity distribution mapping in Lake Urmia, Iran, but it does not specify the purpose of the model (e.g., classification, segmentation, detection). The context appears to be focused on evaluating the performance of machine learning models in predicting groundwater salinity hazard maps, but it does not provide information on the specific purpose of the deep learning model.
