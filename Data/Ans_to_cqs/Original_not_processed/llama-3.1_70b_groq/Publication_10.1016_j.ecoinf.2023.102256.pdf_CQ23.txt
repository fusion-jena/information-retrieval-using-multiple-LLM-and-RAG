Answer: The text does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the models were trained and tested over ten independent executions, which suggests that some form of cross-validation or repeated testing was performed. Additionally, the text mentions that the network is trained on a relatively small number of examples, which is often the case in ecology datasets, but it does not provide further information on how this was addressed. Therefore, while some measures may have been taken to ensure generalizability, the specific details are not provided in the text.
