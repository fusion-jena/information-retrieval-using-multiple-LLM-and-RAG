Answer:

The provided context does not specifically mention deep learning models, but it does discuss the general approach to splitting data for model training and evaluation in machine learning. According to the text, when data are abundant, a common approach is to randomly divide the full dataset into three parts: a training set, a validation set, and a test set.

The criteria for splitting the data are not explicitly stated, but it is mentioned that the data is randomly divided. The purpose of each set is also described:

* The training set is used for fitting the models.
* The validation set is used to estimate prediction error for model selection and hyperparameter tuning.
* The test set is used for assessing the accuracy of the final model.

In the context of k-fold cross-validation, the data is split into k approximately equally-sized disjoint subsets or folds. The folds are chosen randomly, and the model is calibrated on k-1 folds while the remaining fold is used for assessing prediction accuracy.

It is worth noting that the context does not provide specific criteria for splitting data for deep learning models, and the approach may vary depending on the specific problem and dataset.
