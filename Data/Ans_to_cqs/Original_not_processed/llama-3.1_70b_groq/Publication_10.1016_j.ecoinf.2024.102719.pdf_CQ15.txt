Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) algorithm, which is used for hyperparameter optimization in machine learning models, but it does not delve into the details of the deep learning pipeline or optimization techniques used within it.

However, it does mention that the TPE algorithm is used to find the optimal hyperparameter set for machine learning models, which can include deep learning models. But it does not provide information on the specific optimization techniques used during the training process of these models.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
