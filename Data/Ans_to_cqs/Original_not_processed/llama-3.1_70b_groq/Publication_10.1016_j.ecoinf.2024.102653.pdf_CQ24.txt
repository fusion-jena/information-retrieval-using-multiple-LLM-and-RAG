Answer:::
To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, the study employed a specific integer seed to randomly initialize the model's weights, ensuring consistent reproducibility of results. This suggests that the researchers used a fixed random seed value to ensure that the same sequence of random numbers is generated each time the model is trained, allowing for reproducibility of the results. 

Additionally, the study used the train_test_split function from the scikit-learn library, which facilitates randomized shuffling and division of datasets into distinct training and testing subsets. However, the study also mentions that the division of the dataset into training and validation sets was performed through random selection, but it does not specify whether a fixed random seed was used in this case. 

Overall, the study appears to have employed a fixed random seed value to handle randomness in the model's weight initialization, but it is unclear whether a fixed seed was used for other random processes in the pipeline.
