Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The text appears to be a research paper discussing the analysis of valve gaping data from bivalves in the Venice Lagoon and the Wadden Sea, but it does not provide information on the specific methods used for splitting the data for deep learning model training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
