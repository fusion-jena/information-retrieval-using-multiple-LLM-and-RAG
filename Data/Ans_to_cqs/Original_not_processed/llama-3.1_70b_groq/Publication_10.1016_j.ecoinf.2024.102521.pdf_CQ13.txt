Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning models, such as learning rate and optimizer. The context appears to be a collection of research papers and abstracts related to the use of deep learning for computer vision tasks, particularly in the field of ecology and agriculture. While the papers discuss the use of deep learning models for tasks such as insect detection and classification, they do not provide details on the specific hyperparameters used in the models. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
