Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The text only discusses the use of transfer learning, minibatch gradient descent, and early stopping (as indicated by the "Number of epochs without improvement in validation error before training will terminate early" parameter in Table 1). Therefore, I do not know what regularization methods were used in this study.
