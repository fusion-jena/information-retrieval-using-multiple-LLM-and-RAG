Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context appears to be focused on the challenges of model evaluation, particularly in the context of species distribution modeling (SDM) and the integration of multiple datasets.

The text highlights the importance of accounting for biases in biodiversity datasets and the limitations of traditional validation methods. It also mentions the use of prior knowledge to inform model development, but does not provide information on preprocessing steps.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
