Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, except for Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) on Backpropagation (BP). It is mentioned that the BP technique is used for learning the entire network parameters, but it does not provide information about other optimization techniques such as Adam.
