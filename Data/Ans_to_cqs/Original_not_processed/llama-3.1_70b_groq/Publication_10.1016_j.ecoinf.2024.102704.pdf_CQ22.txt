Answer:::

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP). These metrics are used to assess the model's detection accuracy. Additionally, the model's complexity is gauged by the number of parameters (Params), giga floating-point operations (GFLOPs), number of model network layers (Layers), and frames per second (FPS), as well as the memory footprint (memory) which assesses the model's size.
