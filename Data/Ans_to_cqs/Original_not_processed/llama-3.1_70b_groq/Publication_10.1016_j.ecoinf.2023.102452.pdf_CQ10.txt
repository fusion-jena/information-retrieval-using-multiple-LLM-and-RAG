Answer:::
I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific deep learning pipeline or its code repository link. The context appears to be a list of academic papers and references related to machine learning, genetic programming, and signal processing, but it does not include any information about a specific code repository or pipeline. Therefore, I am unable to provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
