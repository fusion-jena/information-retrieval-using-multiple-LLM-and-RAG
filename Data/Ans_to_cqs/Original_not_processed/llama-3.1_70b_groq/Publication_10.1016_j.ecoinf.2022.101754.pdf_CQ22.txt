Answer:

The provided context does not specifically mention the evaluation metrics used for a deep learning model. However, it does mention various evaluation functions used to assess the performance of machine learning models in estimating above-ground biomass. These metrics include:

* Accuracy with tolerance (ACT1 and ACT2)
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
* Coefficient of Determination (R2)
* Cross-validation R2 (CV_R2)
* Average Angle Deviation (AD)

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of different machine learning methods, such as AdaBoost, Bayes, RF, and NET. However, it is not clear if these metrics are also used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model, as deep learning is only mentioned in a few references cited in the context.
