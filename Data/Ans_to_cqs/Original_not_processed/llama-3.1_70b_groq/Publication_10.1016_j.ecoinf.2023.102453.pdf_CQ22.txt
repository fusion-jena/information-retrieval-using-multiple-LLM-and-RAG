Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics are derived based on the relative numbers of True Positive (TP), True Negative (TN), False Negative (FN), and False Positive (FP) images.

Accuracy is the ratio of correctly predicted instances to total instances, but it may not be reliable with imbalanced classes. Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive instances to the total positive instances. Recall indicates the number of positive instances that are classified correctly. F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.

In addition to these metrics, macro and weighted measures are also used to evaluate the model's performance in multi-class classification. Macro precision and weighted precision are calculated by taking the average of precision for each class, with macro precision giving equal weight to each class and weighted precision giving weight to each class based on the number of occurrences in the dataset.
