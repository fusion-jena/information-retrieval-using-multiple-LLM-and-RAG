Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a collection of academic papers and research articles related to environmental science, ecology, and data analysis, but it does not include any information about a specific code repository or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I am unable to provide a link to a code repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
