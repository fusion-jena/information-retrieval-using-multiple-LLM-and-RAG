Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as cross-validation or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the model was trained on a large dataset (AT0) with an average of 3458 natural thumbnails per species, which suggests that the dataset may be diverse. 

Additionally, the context mentions that the model was tested on a separate test-dataset (T2), which implies that some form of splitting was used to evaluate the model's performance. However, the exact method of splitting (e.g., stratified splitting) is not specified.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions that the model was trained on a large dataset and then on smaller datasets obtained by subsampling the large dataset, which may be a form of testing the model's robustness to smaller datasets. However, this is not a traditional method of ensuring generalizability.

Overall, while the context provides some information about the dataset and the testing process, it does not provide enough information to fully answer the question about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
