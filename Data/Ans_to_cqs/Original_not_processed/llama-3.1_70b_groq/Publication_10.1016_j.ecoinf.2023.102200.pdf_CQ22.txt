Answer:

According to the provided context, specifically Table 6, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the BEV Faster R-CNN algorithm are:

1. True Positives (TP)
2. False Negatives (FN)
3. False Positives (FP)
4. Recall (R)
5. Precision (P)
6. F-score (F)

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the model in segmenting individual trees in the study area. The recall, precision, and F-score values are calculated for three different sites with varying stand densities (low-density, medium-density, and high-density).
