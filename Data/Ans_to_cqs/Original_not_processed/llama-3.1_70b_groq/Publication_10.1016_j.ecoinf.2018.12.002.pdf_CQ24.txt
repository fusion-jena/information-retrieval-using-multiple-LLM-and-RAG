Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily discusses the application of machine learning algorithms, including random forests and support vector machines, to ecological studies, specifically in classifying animal behaviors and movement patterns. It also touches on the concept of hidden Markov models, but does not delve into the specifics of deep learning pipelines or strategies for handling randomness.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
