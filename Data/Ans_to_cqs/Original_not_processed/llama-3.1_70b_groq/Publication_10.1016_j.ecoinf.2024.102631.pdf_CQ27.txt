Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and performance of the model, as well as its comparison with other models on various datasets. It does mention that the model is "well-suited for real-time applications" and has a "high-performance speed", but it does not provide details on the deployment process.

However, it does mention that the model has a "notable difference" in terms of processing time, which positions it as a "highly competitive option for deployment in real-time processing applications". This suggests that the model's efficiency and speed were important considerations during deployment, but the exact process followed is not specified.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
