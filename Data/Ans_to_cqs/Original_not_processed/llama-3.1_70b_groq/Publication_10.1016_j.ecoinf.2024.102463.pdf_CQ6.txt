Answer:::

According to the provided context, one preprocessing step involved before training a deep learning model is standardization. The text states: "During the training of the model, the data is then standardized." Additionally, it is mentioned that the standardization parameters will be calculated on one of the three datasets (defined as the training base) and applied to the other two datasets (considered as the test base). However, no further details are provided on other preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.
