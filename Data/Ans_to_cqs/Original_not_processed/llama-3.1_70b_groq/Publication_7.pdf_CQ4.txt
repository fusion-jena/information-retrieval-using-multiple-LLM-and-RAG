Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The text primarily focuses on the use of deep neural networks, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for image classification tasks, and the application of spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) and Multi-scale Orderless Pooling (MOP) schemes to make CNNs independent of the input image size. However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in the pipeline.
