Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is to perform regression tasks, specifically to predict the BBCH (BBCH_res) value based on input features such as Day of Year (DOY) and Growing Degree Days (GDD). The model is designed to handle uncertainty in the data and provide probabilistic outputs, making it suitable for applications where decision-making plays a crucial role.
