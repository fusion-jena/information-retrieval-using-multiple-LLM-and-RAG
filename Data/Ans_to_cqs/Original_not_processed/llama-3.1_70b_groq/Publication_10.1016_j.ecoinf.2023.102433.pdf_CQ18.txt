Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention anything about monitoring model performance during training. It appears to be focused on the NasaWebServiceAPIProvider class and its methods for interacting with NASA's web service, as well as a cloud-based solution for providing services to farmers and decision makers. There is no mention of model training or performance monitoring.
