Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, the models used are ResNet and GoogLeNet, which are two of the most accurate CNNs. ResNet has 152 layers and 25.5 million parameters, while GoogLeNet is based on inception v3 and has 22 layers with learnable weights and 23.2 million parameters. These models are used for image classification tasks and are trained using the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm to minimize the prediction loss.
