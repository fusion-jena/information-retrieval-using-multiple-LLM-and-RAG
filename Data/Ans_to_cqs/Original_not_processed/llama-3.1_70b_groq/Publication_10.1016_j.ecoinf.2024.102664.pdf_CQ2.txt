Answer: 

The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data, specifically 3 × 3 sized segmented images, which are used as input to the CNN model. These images are composed of 9 pixels and are generated by iteratively moving a window pixel-by-pixel over a grid of 100 × 40 points. Additionally, the data structure for the model input is 9 × 5 × 13, indicating that the images are used in conjunction with time series data, with 5 time steps and 13 input parameters. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
