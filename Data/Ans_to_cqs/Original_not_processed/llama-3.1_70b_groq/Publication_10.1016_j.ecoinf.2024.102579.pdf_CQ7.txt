Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deep learning model training, data splitting, or criteria for splitting data into train, test, and validation sets. The context appears to be related to forestry and ecological informatics, discussing topics such as continuous cover forestry, inventory estimators, and diversity indices. There is no mention of machine learning or deep learning, so I am unable to provide an answer to the query.
