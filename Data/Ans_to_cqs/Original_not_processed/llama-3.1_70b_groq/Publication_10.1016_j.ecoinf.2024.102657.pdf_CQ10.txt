Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The text appears to be a research paper or article discussing the DialectDecoder project, which uses human-machine teaming for bird song classification and anomaly detection. However, it does not provide any information about where the code is hosted.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
