Answer:::

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model are not explicitly stated as accuracy, precision, and recall. However, the text mentions the following metrics:

* True Positive Rate (TPR) = TP / (TP + FN)
* False Positive Rate (FPR) = FP / (TP + TN)
* Accuracy is mentioned, but not explicitly defined in the text.
* True positive rates and false positive rates are mentioned, but not precision.

The text also mentions that the overall performance is measured by obtaining the average of these metrics, and that the analysis is carried out using k = 5. 

It is worth noting that the text does not mention precision, which is a common metric used to evaluate the performance of a model.
