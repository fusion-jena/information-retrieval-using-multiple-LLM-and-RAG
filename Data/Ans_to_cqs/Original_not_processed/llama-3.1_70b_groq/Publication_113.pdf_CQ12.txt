Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a deep neural network, specifically a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for object detection and image classification. The text mentions that "Deep convolutional neural networks are a class of deep neural networks designed specifically to process images" and that the embedding model used is a deep neural network. However, it does not explicitly state that the entire pipeline uses a CNN. It is also mentioned that the embedding model is used for dimensionality reduction, which is a common application of CNNs.
