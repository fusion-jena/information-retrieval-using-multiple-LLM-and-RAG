Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly list all the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. However, it mentions a few hyperparameters that were considered during the optimization process. These include:

* Number of layers and nodes
* Learning rate
* Dropout rate

Additionally, the context mentions that a dropout layer was added to prevent overfitting, which suggests that the dropout rate is a hyperparameter that was optimized. However, the specific values or ranges of these hyperparameters are not provided.

The context also mentions that a search grid of several hyperparameters was defined, but it does not provide the details of this grid. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive list of all the hyperparameters used in the model.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of three architecture optimization algorithms: Random Search (RS), Hyperband, and Bayesian optimization. These algorithms may have used different hyperparameters or ranges of hyperparameters, but the specific details are not provided.
