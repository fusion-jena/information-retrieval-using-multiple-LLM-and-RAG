Answer: The text mentions that the algorithm was trained on an RTX 3090, which is a type of NVIDIA graphics processing unit (GPU). Specifically, it is mentioned that the training time of the original YOLOv5 algorithm was 12 hours with a video memory usage of 17.1 G, and the training time of the EfficientNetV2-based model was 6 hours with a video memory usage of 12 G. There is no mention of TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) being used for training the model.
