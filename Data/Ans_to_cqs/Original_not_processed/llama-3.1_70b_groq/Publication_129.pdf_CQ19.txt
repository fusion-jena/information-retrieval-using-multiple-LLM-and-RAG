Answer:::
The framework used to build the deep learning model is TensorFlow. According to the provided context, "All experiments of our developed mobile-based crop pest recognition system were done using the Tensorï¬‚ow object detection API framework [36] on a GPU of NVIDIA GAMINGX GTX 1080 8 GB and DDR4-16 GB memory." This indicates that TensorFlow is the framework used for building the deep learning model in this specific study.
