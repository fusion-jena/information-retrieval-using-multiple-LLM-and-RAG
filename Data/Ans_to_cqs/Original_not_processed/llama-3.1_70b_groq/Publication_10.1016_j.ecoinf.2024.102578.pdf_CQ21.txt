Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the post-processing steps involved after model training. However, based on the information provided in the context, we can infer some of the steps that might be involved.

After model training, some of the post-processing steps that might be involved include:

1. Manual quality checks: The context mentions that manual quality checks are part of the workflow, which suggests that after model training, the output might be manually reviewed to ensure its accuracy.

2. Final data formatting: The context mentions that final data formatting is part of the workflow, which suggests that after model training, the output might be formatted into a specific format for further analysis or use.

3. Metrics calculation: The context provides definitions of model performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. It is likely that these metrics are calculated after model training to evaluate the performance of the model.

4. Confusion matrix: Although not explicitly mentioned, a confusion matrix might be generated after model training to evaluate the performance of the model.

However, the context does not mention anything about saliency maps, which are a technique used to visualize the importance of input features in a model's predictions. Therefore, we cannot confirm if saliency maps are part of the post-processing steps involved after model training.
