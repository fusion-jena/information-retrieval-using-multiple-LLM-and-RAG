Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and training of deep neural networks (DNNs) for bioacoustic classification tasks, discussing various models, datasets, and techniques for analyzing embeddings. It does not delve into the optimization techniques used for training these models.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
