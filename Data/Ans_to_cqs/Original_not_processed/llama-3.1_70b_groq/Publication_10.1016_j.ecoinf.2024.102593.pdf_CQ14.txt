Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses the use of active learning, model embeddings, and dimensionality reduction, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
