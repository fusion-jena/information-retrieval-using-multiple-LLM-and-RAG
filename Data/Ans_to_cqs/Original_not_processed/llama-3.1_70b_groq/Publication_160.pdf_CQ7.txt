Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that the "deeply learned features and the different layer outputs of the training, validation, and test sets were extracted in advance." This suggests that the data was split into training, validation, and test sets, but the specific criteria or proportions used for the split are not provided.
