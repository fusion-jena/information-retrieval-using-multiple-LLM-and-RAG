Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are F1-score and the geometric mean of true positives and negatives (G-mean). Additionally, the results are also compared in terms of Cross-Entropy Loss and Focal Loss. The F1-score is a measure of the model's accuracy, and the G-mean is a measure of the model's ability to handle imbalanced datasets. The results are presented in Table 3, which shows the best results of each method, with the best results for each metric in bold and the second-best results underlined.
