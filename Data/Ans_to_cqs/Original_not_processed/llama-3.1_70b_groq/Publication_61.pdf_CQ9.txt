Answer: 
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the methodology for building a dataset, the case study of the Tehuacán-Cuicatlán Valley, and the performance of the proposed approach, but it does not provide information on where the dataset is stored or shared. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
