Answer: The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the provided context are CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, as well as ImageNet. Specifically, the context mentions that the ResNet50 architecture was modified and trained with transfer learning using pre-trained weights from ImageNet. Additionally, the context cites a paper by Krizhevsky et al. (2009) that introduces the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. There is no mention of the MNIST dataset in the provided context.
