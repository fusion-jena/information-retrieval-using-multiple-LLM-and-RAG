Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context appears to be related to a study on land use/land cover classification and forest fire risk assessment using XGBoost, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process.

The context includes tables and references to studies, but it does not mention specific details on hyperparameter tuning, such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question based on the provided context.
