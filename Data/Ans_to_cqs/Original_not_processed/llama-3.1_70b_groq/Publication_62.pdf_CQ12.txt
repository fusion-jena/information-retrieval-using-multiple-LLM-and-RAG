Answer:::
Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the provided context, which mentions the use of ConvolutionLayer, BatchNormalizationLayer, Ramp (ReLU), and PoolingLayer, all of which are typical components of a CNN architecture. Additionally, the context mentions the use of FlattenLayer, DropoutLayer, LinearLayer, and SoftmaxLayer, which are also commonly used in CNNs. There is no mention of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers in the provided context.
