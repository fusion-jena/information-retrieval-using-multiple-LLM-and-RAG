Answer:::
The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model. However, it does mention the evaluation of the performance of five component models (GLM, MaxEnt, RF, GBM, and MARS) and an ensemble model. According to the context, the performance of these models is evaluated using two metrics: the area under the curve (AUC) and the true skill statistic (TSS). 

The context provides a categorization of the AUC values as follows: excellent (>0.9), good (0.9-0.8), moderate (0.8-0.7), and poor (<0.7). Similarly, the TSS values are categorized as excellent (>0.75), good (0.75 to 0.4), and poor (<0.4). 

Therefore, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the models in the provided context are AUC and TSS.
