Answer: 
The provided context mentions the use of a deep learning model, specifically a version of the YOLO DCNN (You Only Look Once Deep Convolutional Neural Network) using pretrained weights from the COCO dataset. However, it does not explicitly mention the framework used to build the deep learning model. It does mention "libraries such as TensorFlow" in a general context, but it does not confirm whether TensorFlow was used for this specific model. Therefore, we cannot confirm the exact framework used to build the deep learning model.
