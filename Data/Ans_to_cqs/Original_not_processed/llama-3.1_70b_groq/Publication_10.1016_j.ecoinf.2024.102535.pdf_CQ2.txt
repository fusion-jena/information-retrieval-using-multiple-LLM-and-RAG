Answer:::
Answer: Image data format is used in the deep learning pipeline. The context mentions "deep-sea images" and "image recognition" which suggests that the pipeline is designed to process and classify image data. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline. The focus is on using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify substratum in hydrothermal vent environments, which is a computer vision task that typically involves image data.
