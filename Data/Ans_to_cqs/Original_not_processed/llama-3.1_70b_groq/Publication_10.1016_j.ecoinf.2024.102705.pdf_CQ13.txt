Answer: The provided context mentions several optimization algorithms used in the deep learning model, including:

1. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) (Herbert and Sutton, 1951)
2. Adaptive Gradient (AdaGrad) (Duchi et al., 2011)
3. Root Mean Square Prop (RMSProp) (Tieleman and Hinton, 2012)
4. Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014)

However, it does not explicitly mention the learning rate or other hyperparameters used in the model. It only mentions that the model uses a joint training approach for image adaptive enhancement modules and deep learning models, and that a small CNN is employed to predict hyperparameters for image enhancement.
