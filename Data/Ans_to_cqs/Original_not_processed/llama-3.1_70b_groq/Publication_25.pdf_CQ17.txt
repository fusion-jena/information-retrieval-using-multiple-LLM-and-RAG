Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the challenges of applying deep learning to natural systems, the need for large training datasets, and the potential of self-supervised learning and semi-supervised frameworks to address data limitations.

However, it does mention the work of Erhan et al. (2009) in the context of training deep architectures, which might be related to regularization methods. But without further information, it is not possible to determine the specific regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to the query.
