Answer: The text mentions that the authors recommend reserving monitoring areas for the creation of validation and test sets, avoiding a link with the training data, to allow the generalization of the model to be correctly estimated. This suggests that the authors are aware of the importance of having separate datasets for training and testing to ensure the generalizability of the model. However, it does not provide information on whether cross-validation or stratified splitting were used. Additionally, the text mentions that the method benefits from numerous and diverse data, suggesting that the dataset used was diverse, but it does not provide further details on the measures taken to ensure diversity.
