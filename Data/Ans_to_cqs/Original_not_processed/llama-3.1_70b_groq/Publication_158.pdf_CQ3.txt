Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that segmentation-based approaches were considered as an alternative, but sufficient quality training data for segmentation was a limitation. This suggests that instance segmentation might have been considered, but it is not clear if it was actually used. Additionally, the context does not mention bounding box annotation or any other specific data annotation techniques. Therefore, the answer to this query is that the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not mentioned in the provided context.
