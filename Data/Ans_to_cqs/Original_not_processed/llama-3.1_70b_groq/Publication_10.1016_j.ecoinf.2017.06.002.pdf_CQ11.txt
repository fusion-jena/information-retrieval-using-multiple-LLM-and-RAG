Answer: I don't know. The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline, nor does it mention Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. It only mentions the NGEE Tropics Archive, which is the data repository used by the NGEE Tropics project, but it does not provide a link to it.
