Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The text only mentions the training parameters used in the regression phase, including the mean scaled absolute error as regression loss, batch size, input image resolution, and learning rate. It also mentions the use of horizontal flipping for data augmentation, but it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
