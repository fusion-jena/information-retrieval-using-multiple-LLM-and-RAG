Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the model was tested on two different datasets: UCM Dataset and AID Dataset. This suggests that the model was evaluated on diverse datasets, which can help to ensure its generalizability.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of precision, recall, F1-Score, and F2-Score as evaluation metrics, which are commonly used to assess the performance of machine learning models. However, it does not provide information on whether cross-validation or stratified splitting were used to evaluate the model.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and the "reparameterization trick" in the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model, which can help to improve the model's ability to generalize to new data. However, without more information, it is difficult to say for certain what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.

Overall, while the context provides some information on the evaluation metrics and techniques used in the model, it does not provide a complete picture of the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.
