Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the comparison of two object detection models, YOLOv5 and Faster R-CNN, and their variants, as well as the application of deep learning for mapping the density of wild Pacific oysters. It does not provide information on the data annotation process. Therefore, I don't know the specific data annotation techniques used in this pipeline.
