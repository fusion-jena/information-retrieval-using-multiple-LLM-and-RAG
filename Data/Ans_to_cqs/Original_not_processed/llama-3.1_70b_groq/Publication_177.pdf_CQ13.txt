Answer:::
The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows:

- Batch size: The batch size was optimized using Bayesian optimization and was set to be between 1 and 32.
- Initial learning rate: The initial learning rate was also optimized using Bayesian optimization and was set to be between 1×10-4 and 1×10-2.
- Optimizer: The optimizer used was stochastic gradient descent with momentum (‘sgdm’).
- Momentum: The momentum value was optimized using Bayesian optimization, but the specific range is not mentioned in the provided context.
- Regularization strength: This hyperparameter was mentioned as a variable that can be optimized using Bayesian optimization, but it was not used in this study.
- Number of epochs: The models were trained for a maximum of 10 epochs.

Note that the specific values of the optimized hyperparameters are not provided in the context, but the ranges and the optimizer used are mentioned.
