Answer:::
The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows:

* Input image size: 512 Ã— 512
* Maximum batch size: 4
* To prevent underfitting, the models were ensured to follow back-propagation after accumulating the batch size 32 times.
* Optimizer: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
* Initial learning rate: 0.01
* Cycle learning rate: 0.2

These hyperparameters were used during the training of the depth-attention YOLOv5 model.
