Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the CNN model architecture, its components, and the training process. It discusses the use of the AlexNet architecture, the number of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers, as well as the training parameters such as kernel size, stride, dropout rate, and learning rate.

However, it does mention that the input images are categorized into three water quality levels (Class I, Class II, and Class III) and used as training sets for the CNN model. This suggests that some form of data preparation or preprocessing may have been involved in categorizing the images, but the specific steps are not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query about the preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model.
