Answer: 
The provided context does not explicitly mention the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, except for the IP102 dataset, which is mentioned in the comparison of the performance of the method with previous studies. It is not clear if IP102 is the only dataset used or if other datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet are also used. Therefore, I can only confirm that the IP102 dataset is used, but I do not have information about other datasets.
