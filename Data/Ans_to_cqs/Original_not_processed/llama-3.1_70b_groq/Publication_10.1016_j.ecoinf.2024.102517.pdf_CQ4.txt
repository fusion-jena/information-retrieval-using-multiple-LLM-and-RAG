Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context only discusses the architecture of the noise reduction network, the operation performed at each layer, and the experimental setting, but does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I don't know what data augmentation techniques were applied in this specific pipeline.
