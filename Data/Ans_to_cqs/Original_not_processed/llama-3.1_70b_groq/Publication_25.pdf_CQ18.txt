Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention that the full model's performance is evaluated on data withheld from model training, as shown in Figure 7. This suggests that the model's performance is evaluated using a validation set or test set that is separate from the training data.
