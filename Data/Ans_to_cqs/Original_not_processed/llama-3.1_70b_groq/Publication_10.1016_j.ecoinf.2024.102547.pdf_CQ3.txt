Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on functional data analysis (FDA) and its applications in various fields, including fisheries acoustics and marine biology. It discusses the use of FDA methods for analyzing spatial-functional data, but does not provide information on data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines.
