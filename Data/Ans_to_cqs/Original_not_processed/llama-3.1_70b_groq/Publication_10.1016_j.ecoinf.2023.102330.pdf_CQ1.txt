Answer:

According to the provided context, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Acoustic Recordings: The study uses recordings from Acoustic Recording Units (ARUs) to collect audio data of bobwhite calls.
2. Human Observer Point Counts: Human observers conduct point counts to collect data on bobwhite presence and abundance.
3. Sensor Data: The study mentions the use of sensors, specifically ARUs, to collect acoustic data.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of publicly available datasets and models, such as OpenSoundscape, a platform that allows users to develop their own custom CNN for species detection and identification from their field-collected acoustic data.

It is also mentioned that the CNN model used in the study was trained on a separate dataset of covey call spectrogram data collected from various sites in Georgia and Alabama, USA.
