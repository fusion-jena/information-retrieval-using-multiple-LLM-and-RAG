Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the CNN algorithm was trained on a dataset using manual annotations of the moths. Additionally, it mentions that the manual annotations do not surround the moths as closely as the bounding boxes placed by the blob segmentation. This suggests that the dataset may have used bounding box annotation, but the exact annotation technique used is not specified. There is no mention of instance segmentation being used as an annotation technique.
