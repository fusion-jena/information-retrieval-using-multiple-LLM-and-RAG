Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on data preprocessing, augmentation, and classification methods for birdsong classification using deep learning models like ViT and DenseNet-161. It discusses the use of weakly labeled data, random chunk selection, and the addition of background noise to the training data. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the specific data annotation techniques used in this pipeline.
