Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. However, it does mention that the testing set is used to evaluate the generalization ability of the final model, and the mean value of the ten results is used to estimate the accuracy of the model.

It also mentions that the validation set is used to conduct a preliminary evaluation of the model's capabilities and to adjust the hyperparameters of the model. However, it does not provide specific details on the metrics used for evaluation or the postprocessing steps involved.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
