Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the purpose of the deep learning model. The context mentions that deep learning analysis can be performed using Tensorflow in Google Earth Engine (GEE), but it does not specify the purpose of the model, such as classification, segmentation, or detection. It also mentions that other machine learning frameworks like PyTorch, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK), and Caffe can be used, but it does not provide information on the specific purpose of the model. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
