Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of dropout as a form of regularization to reduce overfitting. Dropout randomly removes a proportion of nodes during training, which can help to prevent the model from becoming too specialized to the training data.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a conservative threshold for retaining frames in the DeepMeerkat model, which prioritizes minimizing false negatives at the potential expense of increasing false positives. This suggests that the model is designed to be robust to some degree of randomness or uncertainty in the data.

However, the context does not provide information on how the random seed value is handled in the deep learning pipeline. It is possible that the model uses a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility, but this is not explicitly stated.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the provided context does not provide a clear answer to the question of how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline, but it does mention the use of dropout as a form of regularization and a conservative threshold for retaining frames.
