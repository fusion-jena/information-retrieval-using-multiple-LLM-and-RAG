Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the results are averaged across 13 unique executions, which suggests that some form of cross-validation or repeated splitting of the data was used to evaluate the model's performance. Additionally, the context mentions that the results are ordered based on the average performance of each network architecture across all configurations, which implies that the model was evaluated on multiple datasets or configurations.

Furthermore, the context mentions that the datasets used include vocalisations from different species, such as Hainan gibbons, birds, and amphibians, which suggests that the model was trained and evaluated on a diverse dataset. However, it does not provide information on whether stratified splitting was used to split the data into training and testing sets.

Overall, while the context provides some hints about the measures taken to ensure generalizability, it does not provide a clear answer to the query. Therefore, I can only provide a partial answer based on the available information.
