Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention an "early stopping strategy" which is used to prevent overfitting issues. This suggests that the model is stopped from training when its performance on the validation set starts to degrade, rather than training for a fixed number of epochs. No other regularization methods, such as dropout or L2 regularization, are mentioned in the provided context.
