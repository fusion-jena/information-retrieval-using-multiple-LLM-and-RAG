Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that the model was trained twice, once with a training subset of 498 images and a test subset of 155 images, and then again on all 653 annotated images. 

It can be inferred that the data was split into training and test subsets, but the specific criteria used for this split are not mentioned. There is no mention of a validation subset, which is often used in deep learning model training to evaluate the model's performance during training and prevent overfitting.

Therefore, the exact criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not specified in the provided context.
