Answer:::
Answer: The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is primarily image-based. The training database is composed of 13,000 fish thumbnails, which are cropped frames from videos. Each thumbnail contains only one labeled fish and has a size that varies from 20 × 40 pixels to 150 × 200 pixels. The thumbnails are used as input to the deep learning network, which is based on the GoogLeNet architecture. There is no mention of audio or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline. Video data is used as the source for the thumbnails, but the actual input to the network is the cropped image thumbnails.
