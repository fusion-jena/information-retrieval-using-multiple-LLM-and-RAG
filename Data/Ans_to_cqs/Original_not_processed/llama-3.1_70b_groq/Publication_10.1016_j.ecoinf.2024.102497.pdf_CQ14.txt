Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the Random Forest Regression (RFR) model are optimized. However, it does mention that "fine-tuning the model parameters - such as 'n_estimators', 'max_depth', 'min_samples_split', 'min_samples_leaf', and 'max_features' - was crucial to achieving optimal prediction results and enhancing nearshore bathymetry accuracy." This suggests that some form of hyperparameter tuning was performed, but the specific method used (e.g., grid search, random search) is not specified.
