Answer:::
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. 

Data augmentation was applied to enhance sample variation. This included rotation, reflectance bias of ±10%, and random noise of ±10% reflectance for 15% of the input image. This helped to increase the diversity of the training data and prevent overfitting.

Additionally, an ensemble of three models was generated, and the average of the final output layer was taken. This ensemble approach can help to reduce the variability in the results and improve the generalizability of the model. The use of different pooling methods (max pooling for two models and average pooling for one) in the ensemble also helped to capture different aspects of the data.

However, it is not mentioned in the provided context whether cross-validation or stratified splitting was used. Therefore, it is not possible to confirm whether these specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.

It is also worth noting that the use of a diverse dataset is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the range of image objects size/scales encountered was a challenge, and the ensemble with varying input image sizes was selected to address this issue. This suggests that the dataset may have been diverse in terms of object sizes, but the overall diversity of the dataset is not explicitly stated.
