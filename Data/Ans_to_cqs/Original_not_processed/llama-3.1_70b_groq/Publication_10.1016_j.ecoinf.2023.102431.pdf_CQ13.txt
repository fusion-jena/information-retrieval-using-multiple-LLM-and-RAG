Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or any hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer. The text appears to be discussing a study on species and sex discrimination using linear discriminant analysis, and the equations and models mentioned are related to this type of analysis, not deep learning. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide an answer to the query.
