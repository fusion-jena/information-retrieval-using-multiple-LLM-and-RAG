Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context only mentions that a deep learning model is combined with an optimization algorithm to detect the dispersal of the early stages of spotted butterfish in northern Vietnam under global warming (Do, A.N.T., Tran, H.D., 2023). However, it does not provide details on the optimization techniques used, such as SGD or Adam. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
