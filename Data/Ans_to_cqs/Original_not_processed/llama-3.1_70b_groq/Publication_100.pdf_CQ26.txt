Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the implementation details of the model, such as the use of PyTorch, batch size, learning rate, and optimizer hyperparameters. However, it does mention that the model's predictions generally have low bias across a large portion of the range, but notes some exceptions, such as under-estimation of height-related variables and canopy density.

The context does not provide information on techniques like Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection. It only mentions that the model was trained on a large dataset, but does not provide details on how the data was preprocessed or if any techniques were used to address data bias.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
