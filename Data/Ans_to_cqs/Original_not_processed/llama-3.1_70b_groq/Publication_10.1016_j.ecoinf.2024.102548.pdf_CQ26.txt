Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention data augmentation as a technique used to enhance the performance and generalization capability of deep learning models by augmenting the training dataset with artificially generated variations.

Data augmentation can be seen as a related concept to addressing data bias, as it can help increase the diversity of the training data and reduce the impact of biases present in the original dataset. However, it is not a direct technique for addressing data bias.

The context also mentions that the dataset is split into training, testing, and validation sets, but it does not provide information on how the splitting is done (e.g., stratified splitting).

Therefore, based on the provided context, I can only mention data augmentation as a related concept, but I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
