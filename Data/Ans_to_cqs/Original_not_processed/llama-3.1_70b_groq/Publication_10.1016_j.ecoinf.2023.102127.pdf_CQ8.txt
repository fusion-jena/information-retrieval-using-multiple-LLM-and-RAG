Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The text appears to be a passage from a scientific paper or documentation, discussing the use of species distribution models and machine learning approaches, but it does not provide information about the code repository.

However, it does mention a few specific packages and tools, such as "cmdstanr" and references to R packages, but it does not provide a link to a code repository.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
