Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Flipping, Rotating, or Scaling. The context primarily discusses the use of Neural Networks (NN) for tasks like classification and regression, the structure of NN, and the validation phase of machine learning algorithms using K-fold cross-validation. It also mentions the use of random under-sampling (RUS) to address imbalances in the training set, but this is not a traditional data augmentation technique.

Therefore, I don't know the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, as this information is not provided in the given context.
