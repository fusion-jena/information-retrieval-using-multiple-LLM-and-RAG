Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. Specifically, it is used for herbarium specimen classification, which involves identifying the species of plant specimens based on images. The model is also used for transfer learning across herbarium data from different regions and from herbarium data to non-dried plant images. The goal of the study is to analyze a large dataset of herbarium specimen images using deep learning and to explore the potential of deep learning for automating the annotation, classification, and revision work of taxonomists and experts at herbaria.
