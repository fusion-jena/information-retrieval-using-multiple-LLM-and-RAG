Answer: The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model, but rather a Random Forest (RF) model. However, it does mention that the evaluation of generalization power is crucial to ensure a model's reliability and applicability in real-world scenarios. The context states that the evaluated models generally showed satisfactory generalization power, indicated by similar precision results between the observed and estimated data in the validation for all variables studied. 

Although the specific measures taken to ensure generalizability are not explicitly stated, the fact that the models were validated and showed satisfactory generalization power suggests that some form of validation or cross-validation was performed. However, the details of the validation process, such as whether a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting were used, are not provided.
