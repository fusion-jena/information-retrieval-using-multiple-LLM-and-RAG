Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the process of model retraining, manual classification, and the importance of reviewing training images manually to avoid misclassification. It also provides information on the number of training, validation, and test images used for model training and validation. However, it does not provide specific details on the criteria used to determine the completion of training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
