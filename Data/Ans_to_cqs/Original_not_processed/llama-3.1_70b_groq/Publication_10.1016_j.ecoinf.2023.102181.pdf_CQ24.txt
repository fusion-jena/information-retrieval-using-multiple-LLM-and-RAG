Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on addressing issues of biased model training and validation in geospatial modeling using machine learning approaches, particularly bagging models like Random Forest. It discusses the challenges of spatially clustered sampling and proposes a method for correcting for these effects using residual spatial autocorrelation information in the bagging procedure.

However, it does mention the use of bootstrap samples in bagging, which involves drawing many random samples of the data to train models and aggregate their predictions. This process inherently involves randomness, but the context does not provide specific strategies for handling this randomness, such as setting a random seed value.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
