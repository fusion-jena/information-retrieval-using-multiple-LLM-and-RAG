Answer:::

The provided context does not specifically mention the regularization methods used in a deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, it does mention several regularization techniques used in the context of species distribution models (SDMs) and covariate selection.

The mentioned regularization techniques include:

* Elastic net regularization (used in generalized linear models, GLM-EN)
* Null-space penalization (used in generalized additive models, GAM-NP)
* Guided regularized random forest (RF-GR)

These techniques are used to prevent overfitting and select relevant covariates in the context of SDMs. However, it is not clear if these techniques are directly applicable to a deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about the regularization methods used in a deep learning pipeline.
