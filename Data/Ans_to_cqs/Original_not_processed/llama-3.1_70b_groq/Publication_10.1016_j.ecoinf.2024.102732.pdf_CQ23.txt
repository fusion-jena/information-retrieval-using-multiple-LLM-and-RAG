Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The context appears to focus on the performance evaluation of various machine learning models, including Support Vector Regression (SVR), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), and Random Forest (RF), for predicting above-ground biomass (AGB). 

However, it does mention the use of hyperparameter optimization for the RF model, which involved tuning parameters such as max_depth, n_estimators, and mtry to achieve the best performance. Additionally, the context mentions the use of different combinations of predictor variables, including spectral bands, SRTM DEM, and vegetation-derived indices, to improve the model's performance.

But, there is no mention of measures specifically taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.
