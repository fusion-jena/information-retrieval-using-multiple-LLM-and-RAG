Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the comparison of different deep learning models for plant disease classification, their accuracy, and F1-score. It also discusses the pre-processing steps and the metrics used to evaluate the models. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
