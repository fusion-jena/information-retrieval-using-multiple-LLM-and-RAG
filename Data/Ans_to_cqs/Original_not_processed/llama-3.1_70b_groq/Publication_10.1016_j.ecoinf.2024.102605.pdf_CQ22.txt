Answer:::
The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, specifically the 1D-CNN model, are overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient. According to the text, the model achieved an overall accuracy of 89.50% and a kappa coefficient of 0.8666. These metrics are used to assess the model's performance in classifying pest damage to forest trees.
