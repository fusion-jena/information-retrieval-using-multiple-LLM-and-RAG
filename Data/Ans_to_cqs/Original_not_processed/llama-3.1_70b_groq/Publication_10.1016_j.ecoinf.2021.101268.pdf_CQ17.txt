Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the architectures of different deep learning models (AlexNet, VGG-19, ResNet-101, and DenseNet-201), their performance on raw and pre-processed images, and the use of pre-trained models with fine-tuning. However, it does not provide information on the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
