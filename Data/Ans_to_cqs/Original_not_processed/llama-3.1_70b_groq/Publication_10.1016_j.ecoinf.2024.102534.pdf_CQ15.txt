Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a research paper or study on orchids, including authorship contributions, data sources, and research findings. There is no mention of deep learning, SGD, Adam, or any other optimization techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
