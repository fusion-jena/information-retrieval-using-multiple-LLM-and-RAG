Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the data formats used are likely to be image-based, specifically nadir photographs, as mentioned in the context of using deep convolutional neural networks for semantic segmentation of ground cover vegetation composition. Additionally, the context mentions the use of satellite images and LiDAR data, which are typically used in remote sensing applications. There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the pipeline. CSV (Comma Separated Values) format is not explicitly mentioned either, but it is possible that it might be used for storing or processing other types of data, such as feature data or model outputs.
