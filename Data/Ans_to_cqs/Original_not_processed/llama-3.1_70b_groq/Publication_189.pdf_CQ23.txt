Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention the use of a validation dataset during the training process of the Mask R-CNN model. The context states that the model was trained for 20 epochs with 500 steps each for training images and 100 steps for validation images.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of data augmentation in a separate study [27], which can help improve the generalizability of a model by artificially increasing the size of the training dataset. However, it is not clear if data augmentation was used in the specific study mentioned in the context.

Overall, while the context does not provide detailed information on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model, it does suggest that some form of validation was used during the training process.
