Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the data used, the prediction task, and the implementation of the models using PyTorch Lightning and Optuna-based hyperparameter optimization. It does not provide information on data preprocessing techniques, including those related to addressing data bias.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
