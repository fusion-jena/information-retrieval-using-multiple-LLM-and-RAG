Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the regularization parameter used to control model complexity and prevent overfitting in the context of Support Vector Regression (SVR). The regularization constant C is used to constrain the loss function during training.

In the context of deep learning, the text mentions the use of SLSTM (Seasonal LSTM) and SGRU (Seasonal Gated Recurrent Unit) models, but it does not provide information on the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in these models.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization.
