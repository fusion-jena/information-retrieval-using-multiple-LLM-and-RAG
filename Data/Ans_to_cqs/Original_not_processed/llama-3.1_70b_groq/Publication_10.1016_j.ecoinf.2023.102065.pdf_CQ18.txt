Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that a validation set was created by randomly sampling 100 ROIs per species, which suggests that the model's performance was evaluated on this validation set during training. This is a common strategy in machine learning, where a separate validation set is used to monitor the model's performance and adjust hyperparameters or stop training when the model's performance on the validation set starts to degrade.
