Answer: The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the provided context are:

1. CUB-200-2011 (Wah et al., 2011) - a dataset of 11,788 images of 200 bird species.
2. Birdsnap (BirdGuides, 2012) - a dataset of bird images, but the exact number of images and species is not specified.

Additionally, the context mentions a custom dataset of 83 bird species native to Indonesia, which is used for training and testing deep learning models for bird species classification. This dataset is not a standard benchmark dataset like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, but rather a specific dataset collected for the purpose of bird species classification.

It's worth noting that the context does not mention the use of MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet datasets in the deep learning pipeline. These datasets are commonly used benchmark datasets for image classification tasks, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.
