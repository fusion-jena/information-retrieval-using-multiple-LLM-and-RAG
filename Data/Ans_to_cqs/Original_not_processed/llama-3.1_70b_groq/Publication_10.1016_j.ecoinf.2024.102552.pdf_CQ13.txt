Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. The text discusses the use of machine learning tools for refining classifications, but it does not provide specific details about the models used or their hyperparameters. It only mentions the potential limitations of machine learning methods and the need for more testing. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
