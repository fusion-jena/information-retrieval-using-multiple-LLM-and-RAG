Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be related to remote sensing, land use/land cover classification, and spectral indices, but it does not provide information on deep learning or optimization techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
