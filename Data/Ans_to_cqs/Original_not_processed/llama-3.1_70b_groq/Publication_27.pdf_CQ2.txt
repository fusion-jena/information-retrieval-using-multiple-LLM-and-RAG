Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not contain any information about the specific data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a jumbled collection of characters, symbols, and numbers, possibly from a corrupted or encoded text file. It does not provide any meaningful information about data formats or deep learning pipelines.

However, I can provide some general information about common data formats used in deep learning pipelines. These may include:

* Image formats: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, etc.
* Audio formats: WAV, MP3, FLAC, etc.
* Video formats: MP4, AVI, MOV, etc.
* Text formats: CSV, JSON, XML, etc.

But without more specific information from the context, I cannot provide a more detailed answer to the query.
