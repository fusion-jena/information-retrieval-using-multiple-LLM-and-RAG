Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the study draws upon continuous sensor-based water quality datasets sourced from the Land Development Division of Greenville County. These datasets were collected using a YSI multiparameter sonde strategically positioned at Boyd Millpond's outlet, which measured various water quality parameters, including pH, temperature, specific conductivity, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, and chlorophyll-a levels, at approximately 15-minute intervals. 

There is no mention of surveys or public datasets being used for collecting raw data in the provided context.
