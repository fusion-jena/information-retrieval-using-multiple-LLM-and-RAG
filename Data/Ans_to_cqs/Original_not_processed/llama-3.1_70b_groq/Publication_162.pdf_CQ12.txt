Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a variant of the Mask R-CNN architecture, which is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, the model is called D-Mask R-CNN, which is an extension of the original Mask R-CNN model. The model uses a feature fusion module to combine the extracted features from two backbones, and it also uses a region proposal network (RPN) classifier and mask head. The model is pre-trained on the Microsoft COCO dataset and is fine-tuned for the task of detecting deer in RGB-D images.
