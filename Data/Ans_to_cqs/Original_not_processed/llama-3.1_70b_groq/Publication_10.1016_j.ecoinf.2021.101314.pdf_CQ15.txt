Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be discussing a method for generating redescriptions, which are used to identify local patterns in data, and the parameters used to control the complexity of the queries. There is no mention of deep learning or optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline.
