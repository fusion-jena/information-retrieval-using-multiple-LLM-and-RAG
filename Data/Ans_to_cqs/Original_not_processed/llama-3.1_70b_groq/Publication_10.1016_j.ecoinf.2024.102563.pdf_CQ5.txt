Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing, digital soil mapping, and land cover classification, with references to various research papers and journals.

However, I can mention that some of the papers mentioned in the context do mention the use of remote sensing datasets, such as GF-1 remote sensing data, Sentinel-1/2 SAR and MSI imagery, and Quickbird imagery. But these are not the typical datasets used in deep learning pipelines like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
