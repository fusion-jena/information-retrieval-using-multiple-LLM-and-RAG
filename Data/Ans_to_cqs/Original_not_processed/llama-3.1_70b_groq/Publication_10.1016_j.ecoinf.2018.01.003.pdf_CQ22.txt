Answer:

The provided context does not specifically mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. However, it does mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the BPNN and SVM models, which are:

* Absolute error
* Relative error
* RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
* Standard deviation

These metrics are used to compare the predicted values with the actual values. The context also mentions the mean square error, which is used to evaluate the performance of the BPNN model.

It's worth noting that the context does not mention accuracy, precision, or recall, which are common metrics used to evaluate the performance of classification models. The context appears to be focused on regression models, where the goal is to predict a continuous value rather than a class label.
