Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It only discusses the methodology used to develop the model, including data gathering, pre-processing, and training the U-Net. It also mentions the results achieved by the model, but it does not provide information on how the model was deployed. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
