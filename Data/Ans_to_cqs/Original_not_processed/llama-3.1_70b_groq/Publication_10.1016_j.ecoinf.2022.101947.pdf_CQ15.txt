Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The text only discusses the validation of the algorithm and the determination of the optimal size for the training and test sets, but it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
