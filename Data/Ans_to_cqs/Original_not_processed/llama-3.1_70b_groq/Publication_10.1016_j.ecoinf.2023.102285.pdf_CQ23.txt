Answer:::

To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the model was evaluated using recent surveys (Phase III) on a dataset that was not included in the dataset used for establishing the methodology. This dataset consisted of 57 images with ISMMMOs and 5000 images with no ISMMMOs. The test results showed satisfactory performance (Se, Sp, PPV, NPV, and ACC > 0.95).

Secondly, the model was validated by field experts using the most recent surveys (Phase IV) on an independent verification dataset. This phase involved letting field experts evaluate the model with a completely new dataset independent from the first and second datasets.

Additionally, the experimental design of data utilization and data processing phases with their targeted objectives were outlined in Table 3 regarding the APEM's database. The viability of the methodology was ensured in 4 phases, which included evaluating the model on a new dataset and having field experts validate the results.

It is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context whether cross-validation or stratified splitting were used. However, the use of multiple phases with independent datasets and evaluation by field experts suggests that efforts were made to ensure the generalizability of the model.
