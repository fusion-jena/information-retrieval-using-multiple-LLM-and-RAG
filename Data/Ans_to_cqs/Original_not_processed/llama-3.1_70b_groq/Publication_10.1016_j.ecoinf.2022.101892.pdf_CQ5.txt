Answer:::
The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the provided context are:

1. ImageNet: This dataset was used for pre-training the deep neural network model.
2. PAD Full: This dataset was used for fine-tuning the pre-trained model.
3. PAD Lite: This dataset was also used for fine-tuning the pre-trained model.

Additionally, the context mentions that the original images were expanded by a factor of five (from 8002 to 40,010 images) for testing the models. However, it does not provide a specific name for this expanded dataset.

There is no mention of MNIST or CIFAR datasets in the provided context.
