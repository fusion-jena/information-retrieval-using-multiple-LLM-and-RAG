Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that the model achieved an accuracy of 0.83 for the train split and 0.74 for the test split, and that Figure 10 shows the accuracy for both the train and validation data over 100 epochs. This suggests that the data was split into at least three sets: train, test, and validation. 

However, the specific criteria used to split the data, such as the proportion of data allocated to each set or the method used to split the data (e.g., random split, stratified split), are not mentioned in the provided context.
