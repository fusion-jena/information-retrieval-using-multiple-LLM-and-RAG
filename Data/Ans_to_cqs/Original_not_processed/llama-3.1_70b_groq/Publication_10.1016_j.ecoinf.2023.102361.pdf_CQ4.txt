Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. However, it does mention that many studies use data augmentation techniques to increase the number of training data and improve the classification accuracy.

The context only mentions that application of several image pre-processing techniques, such as resizing, removing background, image enhancement, and denoising, can also improve the performance of the models. But it does not provide information on the specific data augmentation techniques used.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
