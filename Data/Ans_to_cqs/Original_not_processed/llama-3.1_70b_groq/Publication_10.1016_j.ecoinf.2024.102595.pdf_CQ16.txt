Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. It discusses the division of the dataset into training, validation, and test sets, the use of GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation, and the performance of different models. However, it does not provide information on the stopping criteria used during the training process.
