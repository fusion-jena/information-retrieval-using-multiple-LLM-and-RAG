Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide some general information on regularization methods that are commonly used in deep learning.

Regularization methods are techniques used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models, including deep learning models. Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and learns the noise in the training data, resulting in poor performance on unseen data.

Some common regularization methods used in deep learning include:

* Dropout: This method randomly drops out neurons during training, which helps to prevent the model from relying too heavily on any single neuron.
* L2 regularization (also known as weight decay): This method adds a penalty term to the loss function to discourage large weights.
* L1 regularization: This method adds a penalty term to the loss function to discourage large weights, similar to L2 regularization, but uses the absolute value of the weights instead of the square.
* Early stopping: This method stops training when the model's performance on the validation set starts to degrade.
* Batch normalization: This method normalizes the inputs to each layer, which can help to reduce overfitting.

These methods are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization of the model. However, the specific context provided does not mention these methods, so I couldn't provide a more specific answer.
