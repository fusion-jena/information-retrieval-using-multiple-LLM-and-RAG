Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on metadata standards for imaging data, including camera settings, image acquisition, and data curation. It does mention "image-annotation-QAQC" which suggests that annotation is an important aspect of the imaging data curation process, but it does not provide further details on the specific annotation techniques used. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
