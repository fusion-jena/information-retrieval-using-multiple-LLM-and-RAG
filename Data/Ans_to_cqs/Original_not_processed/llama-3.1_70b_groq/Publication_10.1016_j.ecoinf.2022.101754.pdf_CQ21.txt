Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the training and validation set, regression models used, and evaluation metrics. 

However, it does mention the calculation of various metrics such as R2, RMSE, AD, ACT1, and ACT2, which are used to evaluate the performance of the models. Additionally, it mentions the use of cross-validation R2 (CV_R2) and the calculation of the difference between R2_test and R2_all (Diff_R2). 

But, it does not provide information on other postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrices. Therefore, I do not know the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, apart from the calculation of the mentioned metrics.
