Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on machine learning algorithms, ecological data analysis, and animal behavior studies. It mentions the use of Accelerometer (ACC) data in animal behavior studies, but it does not provide information on the methods used for collecting raw data in general.

However, it can be inferred that sensors, such as accelerometers, might be used for collecting data in certain studies. Additionally, the context mentions the use of long-term ecological data, which might be collected through various methods, including surveys, sensors, and public datasets. Nevertheless, this is not explicitly stated, and more information would be needed to provide a definitive answer.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I can only speculate that sensors and possibly surveys or public datasets might be used for collecting raw data, but I do not have enough information to provide a more specific answer.
