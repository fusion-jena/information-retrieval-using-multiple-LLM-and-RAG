Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention a specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention that two indicators were used to evaluate the effectiveness of each model in correcting the sampling bias: the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and Î”D. These indicators are likely used to assess the model's performance, but the context does not provide details on how the model performance is monitored during training.
