Answer:

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model, but rather a random forest classification model. However, it does mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model.

According to the context, the following metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the model:

1. Overall Accuracy (O.A.): represents the proportion of correctly classified validation samples to the total number of validation samples, irrespective of class.
2. Producer Accuracy (P.A.): quantifies the proportion of accurately classified samples for each class.
3. User Accuracy (U.A.): also known as precision, it is not explicitly defined in the context, but it is mentioned as a metric used to evaluate the performance of the model.

These metrics are calculated based on the confusion matrix, which is created using the available validation dataset. The context does not mention the use of recall as a metric to evaluate the performance of the model.
