Answer:::
The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context are left-right mirroring, also referred to as "mirroring or flip augmentation". This technique involves flipping the images horizontally to create new training data, which helps to expand the dataset and improve the performance of the deep learning algorithms. There is no mention of other data augmentation techniques such as rotating or scaling in the provided context.
