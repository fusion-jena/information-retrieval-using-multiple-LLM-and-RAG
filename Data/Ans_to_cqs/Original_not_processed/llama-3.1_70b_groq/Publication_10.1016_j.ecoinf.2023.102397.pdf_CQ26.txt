Answer:::

The provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the importance of evaluating the quality and uncertainty of algorithmic processes, particularly in fields that rely heavily on automated processes.

It mentions that new biases may arise depending on the specificities of the choice of feature extraction (Towsey et al., 2012), but it does not provide specific techniques to address data bias.

However, it does mention that increasing the number of hidden layers or adding more training recordings can improve the performance of the model (Benkendorf and Hawkins, 2020). This could be related to techniques such as oversampling or diverse data collection, but it is not explicitly stated.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query. The techniques mentioned in the query, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and Diverse data collection, are not mentioned in the provided context.
