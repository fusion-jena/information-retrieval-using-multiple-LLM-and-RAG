Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. It appears to focus on the processing and analysis of existing datasets, specifically the Amazon and Cerrado databases. The context mentions the use of tiles and samples, but it does not provide information on how the raw data was initially collected. Therefore, I do not know the specific methods used for collecting raw data in this context.
