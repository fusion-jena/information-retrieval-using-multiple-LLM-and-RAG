Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the processing and analysis of the data, including signal decomposition, feature correlation, and attention mechanisms, but it does not provide information on how the raw data was collected. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
