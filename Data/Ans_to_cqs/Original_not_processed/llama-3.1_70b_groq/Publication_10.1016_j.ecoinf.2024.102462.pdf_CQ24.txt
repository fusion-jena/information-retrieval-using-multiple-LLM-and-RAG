Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The text primarily focuses on the importance of high-quality annotated data, fieldwork expeditions, and observer studies for developing a deep learning model for sub-alpine shrub species identification. It also discusses the concept of generalization power and data leakage, but does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this query.
