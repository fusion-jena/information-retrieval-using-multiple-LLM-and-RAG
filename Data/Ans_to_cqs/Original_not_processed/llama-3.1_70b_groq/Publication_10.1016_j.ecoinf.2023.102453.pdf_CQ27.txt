Answer:::
The process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model involved converting the model to the TensorFlow Lite format. This conversion reduces the model's size, but also reduces its accuracy. After conversion, the model can be used on an edge device, such as a Raspberry Pi (RPi), for classification of unseen images. Additionally, the TensorFlow or TensorFlow Lite model can be optionally optimized for size or latency depending on the application requirements and the edge device specifications.
