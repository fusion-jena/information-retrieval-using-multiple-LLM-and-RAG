Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a research paper on ecological informatics, specifically on analyzing urban acoustic environments. It discusses various aspects of the research, such as land use types, average shortest path length (ASPL), and sound event classification using machine learning approaches. However, it does not provide information on the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
