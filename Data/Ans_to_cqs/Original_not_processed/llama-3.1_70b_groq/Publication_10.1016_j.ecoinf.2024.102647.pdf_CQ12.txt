Answer: I don't know. The provided context mentions the use of machine learning models such as Random Forest (RF) and Classification and Regression Trees (CART), as well as statistical models like frequency ratio (FR) and statistical index (SI). However, it does not mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. The only mention of deep learning is in a reference to a separate study that applied an "automated deep learning convolutional neural network algorithm" for soil salinity distribution mapping, but this is not related to the pipeline in question.
