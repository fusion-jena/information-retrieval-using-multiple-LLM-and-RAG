Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The text only mentions that the training and validation of the classifier were run on a laptop using its CPU with 5-fold cross-validation, but it does not provide details on the stopping criteria used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
