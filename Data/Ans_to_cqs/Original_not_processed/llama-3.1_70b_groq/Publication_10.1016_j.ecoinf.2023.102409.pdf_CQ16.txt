Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. It only mentions the number of iterations (150) and the batch size (4) used in the training process, but it does not provide information on how the training process was stopped or what criteria were used to determine convergence. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
