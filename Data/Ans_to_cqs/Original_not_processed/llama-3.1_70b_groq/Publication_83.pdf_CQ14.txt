Answer: 
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context primarily discusses the classification performance of different methods using single CNN-based models and various spectrograms, as well as citing several research papers related to bird sound recognition and classification. However, it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search.
