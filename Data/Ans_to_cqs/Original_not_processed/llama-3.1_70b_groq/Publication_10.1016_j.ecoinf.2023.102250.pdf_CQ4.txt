Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention specific data augmentation techniques such as Flipping, Rotating, or Scaling. However, it does mention that data augmentation can be used to enhance the dataset and improve the accuracy of birdsong classification. It also references a survey on image data augmentation for deep learning by Shorten and Khoshgoftaar (2019), which may provide more information on various data augmentation techniques. But based on the provided context, I don't know the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
