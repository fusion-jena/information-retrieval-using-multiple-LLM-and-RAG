Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. It only discusses the training process of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network, including the assignment of initial connection weights, forward feeding of inputs, error computation, and iterative error back-propagation. It also mentions the use of a grid search method for tuning hyperparameters, but it does not provide information on the hardware resources used for training the model.
