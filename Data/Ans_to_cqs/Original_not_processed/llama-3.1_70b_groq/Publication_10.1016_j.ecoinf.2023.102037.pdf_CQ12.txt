Answer: 

The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, it is a variant of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model, called YOLOv5, which is a real-time object detection system. The model uses a Cross Stage Partial Network (CSPNet) as its backbone and a Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) layer, along with a path aggregation network (PANet) as its neck. This architecture is designed for object detection tasks, such as detecting and classifying pest species from images.
