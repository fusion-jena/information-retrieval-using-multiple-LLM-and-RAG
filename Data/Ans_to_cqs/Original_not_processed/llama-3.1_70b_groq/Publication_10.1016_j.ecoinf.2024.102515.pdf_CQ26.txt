Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The text primarily focuses on the challenges of working with Twitter data, such as the high volume and heterogeneity of the data, and the difficulties of obtaining useful information from tweets due to their brevity and informal writing style.

However, the text does mention the use of filtering processes to focus on relevant data and eliminate invalid tweets, such as removing tweets that contain images in GIF format that are likely to be memes. Additionally, the authors mention the use of a "Full-archive search endpoint" to access the entire dataset published on Twitter, which may help to reduce bias by including a larger and more diverse set of data.

But, it does not provide information on techniques like Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
