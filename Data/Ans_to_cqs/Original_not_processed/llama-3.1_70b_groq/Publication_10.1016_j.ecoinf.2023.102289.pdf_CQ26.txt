Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the LaDeco platform, its functionality, and the computational efficiency of the system. It does not delve into the specifics of data preprocessing or techniques used to address data bias.

However, it does mention that the platform uses a semantic segmentation algorithm (DeepLabv3) and a ResNet neural network (ResNet269), which are pre-trained models. It also mentions that users can switch to other pre-trained models as needed, but it does not provide information on how these models are trained or how data bias is addressed during training.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. If you have any further questions or context, I would be happy to try and assist you.
