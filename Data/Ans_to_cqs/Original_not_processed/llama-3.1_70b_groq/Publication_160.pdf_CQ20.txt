Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses the performance of different ResNet architectures, the impact of batch size on classification performance, and the use of pre-trained weights from the ImageNet challenge, but it does not provide information on the hardware resources used for training the model.
