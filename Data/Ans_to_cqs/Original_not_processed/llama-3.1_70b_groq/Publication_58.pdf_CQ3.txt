Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does mention two types of labeling techniques used in the study: "central-pixel labeling" and "semantic labeling".

In the case of "central-pixel labeling" architectures, it is possible to make balanced data sets with the initial pixels selection used for the learning. This suggests that the annotation technique used in this case might involve labeling individual pixels or small regions of interest.

In the case of "semantic labeling" architectures, the composition of the images makes it more difficult to precisely control the number of pixels per class. This suggests that the annotation technique used in this case might involve labeling larger regions or objects in the images, but the exact technique is not specified.

The context also mentions that the median frequency balancing method was used to balance the data sets, but this is a technique used to balance the classes in the data set, not an annotation technique.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the context mentions "central-pixel labeling" and "semantic labeling" as the labeling techniques used, but does not provide more specific information on the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
