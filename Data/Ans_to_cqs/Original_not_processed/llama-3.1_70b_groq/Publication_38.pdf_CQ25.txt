Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model is detection. Specifically, it is designed to detect the presence of a search-phase bat call in a spectrogram. The model is applied in a sliding window fashion to predict the presence of a bat call at every instance of time in the spectrogram. This is a binary classification problem, where the model outputs a probability vector indicating the presence or absence of a bat call.
