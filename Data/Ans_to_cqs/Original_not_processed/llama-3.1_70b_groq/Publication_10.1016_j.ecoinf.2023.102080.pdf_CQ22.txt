Answer:::
The provided context does not specifically mention the evaluation metrics used for a deep learning model. However, it does mention metrics used to evaluate the performance of Species Distribution Models (SDMs), such as AUC', maxTSS, and CBI. These metrics are used to measure predictive accuracy, but they may not capture the full picture of the model's quality. The context also mentions that other model outputs, such as response curves and mapped predictions, should be checked depending on the focus of the SDM study. 

It does not provide information on metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall, which are commonly used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models. Therefore, I do not know the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this context.
