Answer:::
Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is to run all experiments across a whole range of train-test set splits, namely 80–20, 60–40, 50–50, 40–60, and 20–80. This approach helps to track if any of the models are overfitting. Additionally, the model performance is also monitored by observing the convergence of the learning within 30 epochs, as well as by checking for divergence between the validation loss and the training loss.
