Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, such as learning rate and optimizer. The context appears to be related to machine learning and remote sensing, but it focuses on traditional machine learning models like Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM, rather than deep learning models.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
