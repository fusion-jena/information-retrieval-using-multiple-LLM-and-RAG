Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. The text appears to be discussing a methodology for collecting and processing tweets related to biodiversity observations, including data acquisition, filtering, and processing. It mentions the use of specific libraries and APIs, such as twarc2 and Google Cloud Vision API, but does not discuss deep learning or regularization methods. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide an answer to the query.
