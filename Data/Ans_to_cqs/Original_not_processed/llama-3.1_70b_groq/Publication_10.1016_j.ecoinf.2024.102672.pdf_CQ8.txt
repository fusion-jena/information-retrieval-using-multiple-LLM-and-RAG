Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or where it is available. The text appears to be a research paper or a scientific article discussing the use of machine learning and deep learning models for predicting temperature profiles in water masses and algal blooms, but it does not provide information about the code repository.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
