Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the model is trained by minimizing the loss function of Eq. (2) and that the hyperparameter Î» is estimated to be 8.75e-5, but it does not provide information on the optimization method used to obtain this value. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
