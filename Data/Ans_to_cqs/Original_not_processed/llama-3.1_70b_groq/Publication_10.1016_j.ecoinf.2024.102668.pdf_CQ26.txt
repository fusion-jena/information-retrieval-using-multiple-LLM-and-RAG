Answer:

The provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection. The context primarily focuses on the preprocessing approach to tackle issues related to differences in recording devices, specifically in the context of ecoacoustic data analysis.

However, it does mention a proposed preprocessing methodology that consists of three steps (Fig. 2), but the details of these steps are not provided. It also mentions the use of specific metrics (K-S and DKL) to quantify the effectiveness of bias reduction strategies within EAI.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. The context does not mention the techniques listed in the query, and I do not want to provide an incorrect or incomplete answer.
