Answer: 
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention a "moths dataset" that was used for training and validation of the CNN model. This suggests that the dataset used is a custom or specialized dataset focused on images of moths, rather than a widely used benchmark dataset like MNIST or CIFAR.
