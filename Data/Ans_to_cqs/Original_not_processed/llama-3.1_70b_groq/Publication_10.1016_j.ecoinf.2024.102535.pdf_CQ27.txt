Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only discusses the training process, including the batch size, early stopping procedure, data augmentation, and network architectures. It also provides information on the performance metrics and the specific architectures used, such as VGG, ResNet, and Xception.

However, it does not provide any information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related processes.

Therefore, I must say that I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
