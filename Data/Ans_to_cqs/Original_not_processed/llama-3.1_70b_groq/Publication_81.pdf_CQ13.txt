Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context discusses the use of Elastic Net to improve the performance of the proposed model and to solve the overfitting problem in small datasets. It also mentions the use of Autoencoders and Stacked Autoencoders (SAE) in the model, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameters used to train these models. Therefore, I do not know the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
