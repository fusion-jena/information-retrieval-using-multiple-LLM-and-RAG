Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the exponential parameters were set as follows: C = 20–210, ε = 2^8–21, and σ = 2^8–21 (Yang et al., 2022), but it does not provide information on the optimization method used to determine these values. It is possible that the authors used a method such as grid search or random search, but without further information, it is impossible to say for certain.
