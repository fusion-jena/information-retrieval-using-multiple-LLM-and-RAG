Answer: The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are the modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset of handwritten digits and the authors' own dataset of clusters of extracted numbers from point cloud data. The MNIST dataset was used to train Models 1, 2, and 3, while the authors' own dataset was used to train Models 4, 5, and 6.
