Answer: The deep learning pipeline uses image data formats, specifically spectrograms, which are visual representations of audio signals. The text mentions that the CNN model uses "grayscale input spectrograms" and that mapping these to a color scheme improved performance in one study. Additionally, it is mentioned that combining various types of spectrograms into 3-channel images improved performance for CNNs pre-trained for image classification. There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used directly in the pipeline, although audio recordings are presumably the source of the spectrograms. CSV (Comma Separated Values) files are not mentioned at all.
