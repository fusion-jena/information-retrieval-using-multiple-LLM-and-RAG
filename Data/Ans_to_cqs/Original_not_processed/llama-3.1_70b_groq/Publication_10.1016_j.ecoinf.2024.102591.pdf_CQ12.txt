Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. The text mentions the use of machine learning (ML) algorithms and supervised ML classification, but it does not specify the type of model used. It mentions the use of JavaScript, Python, or R application programming interface (API) and the associated interactive development environment (IDE) in Google Earth Engine (GEE), but it does not provide information on the specific deep learning model used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
