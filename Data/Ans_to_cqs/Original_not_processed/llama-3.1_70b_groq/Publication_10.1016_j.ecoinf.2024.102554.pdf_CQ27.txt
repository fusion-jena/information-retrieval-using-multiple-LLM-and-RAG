Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context appears to be related to data acquisition and processing, specifically discussing the crawling tool developed to retrieve historical and near real-time data from different SRS products, as well as in situ monitoring and satellite instrument features. However, it does not provide information on model deployment. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
