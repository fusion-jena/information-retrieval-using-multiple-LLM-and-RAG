Answer:::
According to the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include denoising, contrast enhancement, and image resizing. However, it is mentioned that only image resizing was used to make the images suitable for the input image resolution required for the selected models. There is no mention of normalization or scaling as preprocessing steps. Additionally, cleaning is not explicitly mentioned as a preprocessing step, but denoising can be considered as a form of cleaning the data.
