Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the use of deep learning models for bioacoustics, particularly for animal vocalization classification and individual discrimination. It mentions the use of pre-trained models such as BirdNET, VGGish, and Wav2Vec 2.0, but does not delve into data preprocessing techniques or strategies for addressing data bias. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
