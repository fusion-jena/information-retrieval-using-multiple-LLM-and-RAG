Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the classification pipeline, the performance of CNN Model 4, and the use of the VGG16 architecture. It also references various research papers on image classification and deep learning, but does not specifically mention regularization methods.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
