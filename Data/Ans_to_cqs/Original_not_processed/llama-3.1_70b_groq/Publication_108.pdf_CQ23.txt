Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model was trained on high-resolution orthophotos with 20-cm spatial resolution obtained from an aerial survey, which suggests that the dataset may be diverse and representative of the problem domain.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model was evaluated using a custom implementation of the intersection over union metric and overall accuracy, which suggests that the model's performance was evaluated on a separate validation set. However, it does not provide information on whether cross-validation or stratified splitting was used to further ensure the model's generalizability.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions that the model was trained on a large amount of representative training data, which is a key factor in ensuring the generalizability of deep learning models. However, without more information on the specific techniques used to ensure generalizability, it is difficult to provide a more detailed answer.
