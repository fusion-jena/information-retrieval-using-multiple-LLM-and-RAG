Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. However, it does mention that the model outputs the relative probability that an event is from a specific data class, and analysts can sort the data accordingly.

It also mentions that analysts are presented with ranked pages containing a large number of panels, where each panel contains a visualization of an individual data sample. For images, the visualization consists of image cropping around the object of interest, contrast enhancement, and consecutive frame differences. For audio, 2D spectrograms of an appropriate duration are displayed per panel.

Additionally, the context mentions that analysts have the ability to play the audio corresponding to each spectrogram and view more temporal context around it to help with their auditing decision. This suggests that some form of visualization and analysis is performed after model training, but the specific postprocessing steps mentioned in the query are not explicitly mentioned.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.
