Answer: To ensure the generalizability of the models, the study utilized a training-and-test approach with stratification splitting. For each setting, 100 different splits to the training-and-test set were given. This means that the data was split into training and test sets 100 times, with each split being stratified to maintain the same proportion of samples in each class. This approach helps to reduce overfitting and ensures that the model is evaluated on unseen data.

Additionally, the study used cross-validation to evaluate the performance of the models. The coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean squared error (RMSE) were calculated under cross-validation, which provides a more robust estimate of the model's performance.

It is not explicitly mentioned whether the dataset used was diverse or not. However, the study does mention that the variety among research sites corresponds to equal variety among predictors and machine learning methods used, which suggests that the dataset may have been diverse.

It's worth noting that the study used four different machine learning methods (AdaBoost, random decision forest, multilayer neural network, and Bayesian ridge regression) to model forest AGB, which can help to identify the most robust and generalizable approach.
