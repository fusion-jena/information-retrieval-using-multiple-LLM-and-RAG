Answer: The optimization technique applied in the deep learning pipeline is the Adam optimizer. According to the text, "The loss function and optimizer were set as the mean squared error and Adam optimizer, respectively, at a learning rate of 0.001." This indicates that the Adam optimizer is used to optimize the model's performance, specifically with a learning rate of 0.001. There is no mention of other optimization techniques such as SGD being used in the pipeline.
