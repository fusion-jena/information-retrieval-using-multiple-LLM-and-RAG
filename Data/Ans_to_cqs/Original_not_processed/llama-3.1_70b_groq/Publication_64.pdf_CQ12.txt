Answer:::
The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically the ResNet model, which is a type of CNN architecture that won the ILSVRC'15. The ResNet model consists of a stack of similar residual blocks, each block being a stack of convolutional layers. This architecture alleviates the vanishing gradient problem, allowing for the training of much deeper networks. In this case, the model has 50 convolutional layers, also known as ResNet50.
