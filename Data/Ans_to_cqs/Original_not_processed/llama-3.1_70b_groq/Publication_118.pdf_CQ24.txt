Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The text primarily focuses on the network architecture, data pre-processing, and the use of auto-encoders for automatic feature extraction. It does not discuss methods for handling randomness or setting random seed values. Therefore, I do not know the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in this deep learning pipeline.
