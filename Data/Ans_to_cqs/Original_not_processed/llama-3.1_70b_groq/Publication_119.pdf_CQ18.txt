Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention the use of hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance. For the Deep Neural Network (DNN) model, the hyperparameters such as learning rate, number of epochs, and batch size were tuned to achieve the best testing accuracy and kappa. Similarly, for the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, the hyperparameters C and Î³ were optimized using GridSearchCV. 

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a batch normalization layer after hidden layer 2 in the DNN model, which helps to reduce over-fitting and increase generalization on testing data. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training.
