Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context discusses the model architecture, training and test datasets, and evaluation metrics, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I do not know how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.
