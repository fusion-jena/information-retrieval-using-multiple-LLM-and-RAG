Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The text describes the training process, including the use of mini-batches, loss scores, and epochs, but it does not specify how the training process is terminated. It does not mention validation loss plateau or any other criteria that might be used to determine when training is complete. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
