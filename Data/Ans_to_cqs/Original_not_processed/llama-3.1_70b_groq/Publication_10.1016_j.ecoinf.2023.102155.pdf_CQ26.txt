Answer:

The provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention "bias correction" in the context of evaluating the performance of different methods, including lasso and non-lasso approaches. 

It appears that the context is focused on evaluating the performance of different methods for addressing bias, rather than discussing specific techniques for addressing bias during preprocessing. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.

That being said, the query mentions several techniques that are commonly used to address data bias during preprocessing, including stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. These techniques are often used to ensure that the training data is representative of the population of interest and to reduce the impact of bias on the model's performance. However, I do not have enough information to determine if these specific techniques are used in the context provided.
