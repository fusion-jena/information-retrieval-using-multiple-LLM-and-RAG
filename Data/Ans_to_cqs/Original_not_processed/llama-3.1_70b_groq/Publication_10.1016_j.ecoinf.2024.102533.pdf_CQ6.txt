Answer: 

According to the provided context, the data normalization stage is unnecessary. This suggests that normalization is not a preprocessing step involved before training a deep learning model in this specific case. However, it does not provide information on other preprocessing steps such as scaling or cleaning. Therefore, we can only confirm that normalization is not a required step, but we cannot provide information on other preprocessing steps.
