Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention various sources of image data that can be used for biodiversity analysis, such as:

* Social media imagery (e.g., Flickr and Instagram)
* CCTV
* Imagery collected along linear infrastructure (e.g., Google StreetView)
* Camera traps
* Citizen observations

These sources can potentially be used to collect raw data for deep learning pipelines. Additionally, the context mentions the use of "AI naturalists" to locate and classify images of biodiversity, which implies that the raw data may be collected through automated means, such as web scraping or API calls.

However, it is not clear if surveys or sensors are used as methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context does mention the use of classical statistical analyses and classification by citizen scientists, but it does not provide information on the specific methods used for collecting raw data.
