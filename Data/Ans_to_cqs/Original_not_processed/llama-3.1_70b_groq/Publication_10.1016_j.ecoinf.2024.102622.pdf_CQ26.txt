Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing, vegetation indices, and crop classification, but it does not discuss data bias or preprocessing techniques in the context of deep learning.

However, I can provide some general information on the techniques you mentioned. Stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling are indeed techniques used to address data bias in machine learning pipelines. Stratified splitting involves splitting the data into training and testing sets while maintaining the same class distribution. Oversampling involves creating additional instances of the minority class to balance the class distribution, while undersampling involves reducing the number of instances of the majority class.

Diverse data collection is also an important technique for addressing data bias, as it involves collecting data from a wide range of sources and scenarios to ensure that the model is trained on a representative sample of the population.

Unfortunately, I do not have enough information to provide a more specific answer to your question based on the provided context.
