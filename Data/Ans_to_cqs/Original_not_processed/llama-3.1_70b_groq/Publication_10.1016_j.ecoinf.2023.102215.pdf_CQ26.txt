Answer: None of the provided techniques (Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, Diverse data collection) are mentioned in the given context as methods to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and components of the U2-Net and TA (channel-wise attention) models, discussing techniques such as dilated convolution, nested encoder-decoder structures, and l2-norm normalization. It does not provide information on data preprocessing techniques or addressing data bias.
