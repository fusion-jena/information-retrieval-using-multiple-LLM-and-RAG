Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context only mentions that the samples were randomly divided into training and validation datasets at a 7:3 ratio, and that the random forest algorithm was applied to rapidly classify the land use types in the study area. However, it does not provide information on the stopping criteria used for training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
