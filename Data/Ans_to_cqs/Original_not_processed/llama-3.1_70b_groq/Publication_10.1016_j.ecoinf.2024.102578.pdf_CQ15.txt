Answer: 
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of a "one-cycle learning rate policy" with a minimum of 0.000001 and a maximum of 0.001, which suggests that the learning rate is dynamically adjusted during training. This is a common technique used in conjunction with optimization algorithms like SGD or Adam, but the specific optimization algorithm used is not mentioned.
