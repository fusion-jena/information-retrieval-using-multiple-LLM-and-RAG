Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention the importance of training the model on data that resembles the data on which the model will be applied later, and the need to create specific datasets tailored to the desired application.

It also mentions that neural networks can be trained in a supervised, semi-supervised, or unsupervised way, and that supervised learning typically involves training with a huge amount of labeled data. Additionally, it mentions the importance of semantic image segmentation and the use of specific neural network architectures for this task.

While it does not provide explicit criteria for splitting data, it implies that the data should be split in a way that allows the model to learn from a representative sample of the data and generalize well to new, unseen data. However, without more specific information, it is difficult to provide a more detailed answer.

Therefore, I must say that I don't know the exact criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training based on the provided context.
