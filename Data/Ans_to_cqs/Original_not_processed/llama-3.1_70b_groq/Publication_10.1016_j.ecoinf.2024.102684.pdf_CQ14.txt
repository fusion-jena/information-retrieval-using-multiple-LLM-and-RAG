Answer: The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a small grid search. The hyperparameter search involved selecting the following hyperparameters and values: 

1. Hidden activation function: ReLU, sigmoid, or elu
2. Optimizer: RMSprop or adam
3. Learning rate: 0.1, 0.001, 0.0001, and 0.00001.

This approach was chosen to control every aspect of the process and avoid problems, although it is mentioned that hyperparameter search software such as Optuna and Sklearn could have been used to achieve the same results and potentially save coding time.
