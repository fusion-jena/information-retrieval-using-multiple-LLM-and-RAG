Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deep learning pipelines or strategies to handle randomness in such pipelines. The context appears to be related to a study on invasive plant species, their distribution, and the factors that influence their richness and abundance. It discusses the use of random forest models and field surveys, but does not touch on deep learning or related topics. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
