Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the use of satellite images, particularly Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2, for analyzing forest fires and fire risk maps. It also mentions the use of various indices, such as NDVI, NBR, and NDWI, which are likely derived from the satellite images. However, it does not provide information on the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
