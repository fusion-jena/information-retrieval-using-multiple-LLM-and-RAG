Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the dataset used in this work can be downloaded at the UCI Machine Learning Repository, specifically the "One-hundred plant species leaves data set" database. This suggests that the dataset is a publicly available dataset, and the raw data was likely collected by the creators of the dataset.

Additionally, the context mentions that the dataset contains images of plant leaves, which appear in controlled backlit and front-lit versions, with several samples per species. This suggests that the images were likely collected through a controlled process, possibly in a laboratory or greenhouse setting. However, the exact methods used for collecting the raw data are not specified.

It is also mentioned that data augmentation was used to enlarge the dataset for training and overcoming overfitting, but this is a method used to preprocess and expand the existing dataset, rather than a method for collecting raw data.
