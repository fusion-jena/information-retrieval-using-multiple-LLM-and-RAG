Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model. The text focuses on the architecture of the convolutional neural network (CNN), the training process, and the advantages of deep learning, but it does not provide information on the preprocessing steps.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to perform certain preprocessing steps before training a model, such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization typically involves scaling the input data to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model. Scaling involves transforming the data to have zero mean and unit variance. Cleaning involves removing missing or duplicate data, handling outliers, and data augmentation.

Since the context does not provide specific information on the preprocessing steps, it is impossible to determine the exact steps involved in this particular case.
