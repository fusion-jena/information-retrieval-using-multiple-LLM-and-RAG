Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. The text only discusses the architecture and components of the YOLOv5 model, including the depth-attention mechanism, but does not provide information about the framework used to implement it.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
