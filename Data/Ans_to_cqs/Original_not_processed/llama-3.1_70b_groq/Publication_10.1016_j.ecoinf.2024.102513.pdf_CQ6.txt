Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of a convolutional neural network, the convolutional layer, and the pooling layer, as well as the use of deep learning for land use and land cover (LULC) classification. It does not provide information on the preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

However, it is generally known that preprocessing steps are crucial in deep learning, and common preprocessing steps include normalization, scaling, data cleaning, and data augmentation. But without specific information from the context, I cannot provide a detailed answer to this query.

Therefore, I must say that I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this particular case, as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
