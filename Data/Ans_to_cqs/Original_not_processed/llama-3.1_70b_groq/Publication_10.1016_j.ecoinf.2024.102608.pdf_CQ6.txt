Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the structure and functioning of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), their applications, and the evaluation of model performance using metrics such as R2, RMSE, and MAE. It also mentions the use of randomized grid search methods for hyperparameter tuning, but it does not provide information on preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

However, it is generally known that preprocessing steps are crucial in deep learning, as they can significantly impact the performance of the model. Common preprocessing steps include normalization, scaling, handling missing values, data augmentation, and feature engineering. But without specific information from the context, we cannot determine the exact preprocessing steps involved in this particular study.

Therefore, I must say that I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model in this context.
