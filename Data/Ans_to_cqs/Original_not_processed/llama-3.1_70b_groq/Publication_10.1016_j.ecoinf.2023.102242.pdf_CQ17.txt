Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be discussing a study on filtering classification features to improve classification accuracy and efficiency, but it does not delve into specific techniques used to prevent overfitting.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
