Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization or scaling. However, it does mention some preprocessing steps that are applied to the data.

According to the context, the images are broken down into smaller patches, specifically square patches of various sizes (256, 320, 480, 640, and 800 pixels). Additionally, a simple augmentation strategy is applied to the patches, which involves flipping them horizontally and vertically with a 50% probability. This is done during the training stage.

It is also mentioned that the images are divided into regularly-spaced, overlapping patches during the validation phase, using the same size employed during training. The patches are then processed individually, and the overall output is reconstructed by combining the predictions from the patches.

Furthermore, the context mentions that the ground-truth required for the training phase is derived from dot labels by leveraging distinct procedures depending on the specific deep learning model being employed. This includes generating bounding boxes, density maps, and segmentation maps.

However, it does not provide information on other preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive answer to the query based on the provided context.
