Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in the study are Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) values. Specifically, the study mentions that the Deep Neural Network (DNN) model achieved an R2 value of 0.91, indicating that it explained 91% of the yield variation. Additionally, the study mentions that the MSE values of the models ranged from 1001.27 to 1025.74 for some models, and exceeded 1100 for others. However, it does not mention accuracy, precision, or recall as evaluation metrics for the deep learning model.
