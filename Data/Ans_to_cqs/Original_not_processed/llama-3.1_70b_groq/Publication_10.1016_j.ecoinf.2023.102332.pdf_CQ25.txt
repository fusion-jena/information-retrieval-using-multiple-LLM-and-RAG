Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the context is text classification. Specifically, it is used for identifying wildlife observations on Twitter (Edwards et al., 2022) and for cultural ecosystem service assessments using social media data (Egarter Vigl et al., 2021). Additionally, the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model is mentioned as a promising tool for text classification (Devlin et al., 2018; Hunter et al., 2023).
