Answer:::
The provided context mentions that the model was tested with and without image data augmentation. Specifically, it mentions that "several flips and rotations" were applied to each training image as part of the data augmentation process. This suggests that the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Flipping: This involves flipping the images horizontally or vertically to create new training examples.
2. Rotating: This involves rotating the images by a certain angle to create new training examples.

There is no mention of scaling as a data augmentation technique in the provided context. However, it is a common technique used in many deep learning pipelines to artificially increase the size of the training dataset.

It's worth noting that the context does not provide an exhaustive list of data augmentation techniques used in the pipeline, and it's possible that other techniques such as cropping, color jittering, or noise addition may have been used as well. However, based on the information provided, we can confirm that flipping and rotating were used as part of the data augmentation process.
