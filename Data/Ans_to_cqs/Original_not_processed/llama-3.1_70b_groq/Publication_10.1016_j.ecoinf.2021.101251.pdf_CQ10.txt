Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. The text appears to be discussing data citations, repositories, and management in the context of Earth science projects, but it does not provide any information about a deep learning pipeline or a specific code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
