Answer: 
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses the use of deep learning techniques for classifying Brazilian Savanna (Cerrado) physiognomies, the importance of spectral bands, and the architecture of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), but it does not provide information on the hardware resources used for training the model.
