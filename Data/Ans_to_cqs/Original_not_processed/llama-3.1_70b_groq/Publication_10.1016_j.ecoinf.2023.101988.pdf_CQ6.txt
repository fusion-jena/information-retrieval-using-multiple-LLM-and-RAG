Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, I can provide some general information on common preprocessing steps that are typically involved in training a deep learning model.

Typically, preprocessing steps may include:

* Normalization: scaling numeric data to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model.
* Scaling: transforming data to have zero mean and unit variance, which can help improve model performance.
* Cleaning: handling missing or erroneous data, such as removing duplicates, handling outliers, and imputing missing values.
* Feature engineering: transforming and selecting relevant features to improve model performance.

However, without specific information on the dataset and model architecture, it is difficult to provide more detailed information on the preprocessing steps involved.

It's worth noting that the provided context does mention the use of deep learning models in the paper "Modelling animal biodiversity using acoustic monitoring and deep learning" by Chalmers et al. (2021), but it does not provide information on the specific preprocessing steps used in that study.
