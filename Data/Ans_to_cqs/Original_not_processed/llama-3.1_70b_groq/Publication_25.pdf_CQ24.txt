Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the challenges of applying deep learning to natural systems, particularly in remote sensing, due to the need for large training datasets and the limitations of available data. It discusses approaches like self-supervised learning and semi-supervised frameworks to address these challenges but does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
