Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the performance of different basic models and proposed ensemble methods on the IP102 dataset, as well as the architecture and training hyper-parameters of these models.

However, it can be inferred that the models were fine-tuned on the target dataset (IP102) after being initialized with pre-trained weights, which may have helped to some extent in adapting to the specific characteristics of the dataset.

Additionally, the fact that the models were evaluated on a specific dataset (IP102) and their performance was compared suggests that some form of evaluation was performed to assess their generalizability. Nevertheless, the exact measures taken to ensure generalizability, such as the use of diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question based on the provided context.
