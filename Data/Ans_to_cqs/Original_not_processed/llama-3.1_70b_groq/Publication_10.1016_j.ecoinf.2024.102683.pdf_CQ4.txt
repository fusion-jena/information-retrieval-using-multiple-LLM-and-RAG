Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention specific data augmentation techniques such as Flipping, Rotating, or Scaling. However, it does mention that the Fast AutoAugment (FAA) method was applied to improve the data, which is an enhanced Auto-augmentation method that can automatically search for optimal data augmentation policies.

The context also mentions that the FAA method consists of controllers, augmenters, and a base model, where the controller samples the data augmentation policies from the searched space, and the augmenter transforms the images of the dataset with the new policy. However, it does not provide details on the specific augmentation techniques used.

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query, but I can suggest that the FAA method likely applies a range of data augmentation techniques to the data, although the specific techniques used are not specified in the provided context.
