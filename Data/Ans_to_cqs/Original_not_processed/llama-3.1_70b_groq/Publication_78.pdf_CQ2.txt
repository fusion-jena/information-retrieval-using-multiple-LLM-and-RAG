Answer:::
Answer: Image data format is used in the deep learning pipeline. The context mentions that an image is taken with the help of an underwater drone, and then it is segmentized and divided into small patches. Features are extracted from each patch with the help of handcrafted descriptors and D-CNNs. This indicates that the pipeline is working with image data. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
