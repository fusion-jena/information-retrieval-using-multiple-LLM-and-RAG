Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the application of deep learning in remote sensing and comparing its performance with other machine learning models, such as random forest. It discusses the use of deep learning for tasks like image segmentation, mapping vascular plant richness, and predicting Arctic sea ice concentrations, but it does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions the use of drone image segmentation and convolutional neural networks, which often require data annotation techniques like bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, or semantic segmentation. But without explicit information, it is difficult to determine the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to the query.
