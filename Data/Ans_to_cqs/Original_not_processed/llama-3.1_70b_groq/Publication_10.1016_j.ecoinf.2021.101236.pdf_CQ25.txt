Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model, called BirdNET, is classification. Specifically, it is designed to classify 984 bird species using spectrogram data. The model takes a 3-second input spectrogram and outputs probability predictions for all 984 classes. The model's architecture is based on a residual network (ResNet) and uses a classification block to produce the final predictions. The overall goal of the model is to support ornithologists and conservation biologists in their work to identify and address environmental challenges.
