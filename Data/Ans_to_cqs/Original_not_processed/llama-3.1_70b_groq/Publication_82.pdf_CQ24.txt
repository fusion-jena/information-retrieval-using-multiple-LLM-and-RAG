Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the experimental configurations, parameters, and results of the deep learning experiments for plant disease classification. It does not provide information on how randomness was handled in the pipeline. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
