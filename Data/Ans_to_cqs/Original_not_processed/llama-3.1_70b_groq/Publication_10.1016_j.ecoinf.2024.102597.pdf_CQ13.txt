Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. In fact, the text states that deep learning algorithms were considered, but the limited number of samples was not conducive to deep learning. The context only discusses the use of ensemble learning models (RF, GBDT, LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost) and traditional machine learning algorithms (SVM, neural network), but does not provide details on the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model.
