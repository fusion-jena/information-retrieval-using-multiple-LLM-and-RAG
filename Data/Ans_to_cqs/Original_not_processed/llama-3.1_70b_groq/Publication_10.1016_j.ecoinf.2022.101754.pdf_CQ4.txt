Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be focused on the use of machine learning and lidar data for estimating forest biomass, and it discusses various aspects of the study, including the training and validation set, regression models, and data preprocessing. However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline.
