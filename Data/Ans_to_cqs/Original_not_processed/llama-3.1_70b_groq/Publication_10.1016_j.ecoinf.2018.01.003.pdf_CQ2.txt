Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the development and application of neural network models, including the extension of classical neural network models and the emergence of deep learning. It discusses the use of large-scale data to train deep learning algorithms, but it does not specify the formats of the data used.

However, based on general knowledge of deep learning, it is common for deep learning pipelines to use various data formats such as images, audio, video, and text data, including CSV files. But without explicit information from the provided context, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer.

Therefore, I can only say that the context does not provide enough information to determine the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.
