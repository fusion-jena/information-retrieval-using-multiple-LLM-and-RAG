Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the tables and data provided, it appears that the model performance is being evaluated using metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error) for both training and testing datasets. This suggests that the model is being trained and evaluated using a supervised learning approach, where the model's performance is being monitored and adjusted during training to minimize the error between predicted and actual values.
