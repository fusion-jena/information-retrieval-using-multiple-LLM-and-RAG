Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of the Gumbel-Softmax function, which is a technique for approximating discrete distributions with continuous distributions. This function is useful in optimizing neural networks involving discrete variables, such as those used in reinforcement learning and generative models.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a stochastic update criterion, which yields different results for different seeds and allows the model to be used as a Monte Carlo method. This suggests that the model is designed to handle randomness and uncertainty, but the specific strategies for doing so are not explicitly stated.

One relevant detail is the mention of the law of large numbers, which is used to assume that the frequency of an event for each cell in each generation provides an estimate of the probability of that state occurring. This implies that the model may be using some form of averaging or aggregation to handle randomness, but the details are not provided.

Overall, while the context provides some hints about how randomness is handled in the model, it does not provide a clear answer to the query.
