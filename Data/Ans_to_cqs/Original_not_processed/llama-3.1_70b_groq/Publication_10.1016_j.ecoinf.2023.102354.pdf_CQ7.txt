Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be focused on drought characteristics, drought indices, and the Great Artesian Basin (GAB) region, but it does not provide information on data splitting for deep learning model training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
