Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the hyperparameters and architecture of the models, such as CNN-BiGRU, RVFL, KELM, and CNN-BiRNN, as well as their performance metrics (R, RMSE, and MAPE) on training and testing datasets.

However, it can be inferred that the models were trained and tested on separate datasets, as the context mentions "Training" and "Testing" phases for each model. This suggests that some form of data splitting was employed, but the specifics of the splitting strategy (e.g., cross-validation, stratified splitting) are not provided.

Additionally, the context mentions that the inputs and target parameters were normalized between 0 and 1 using a specific formulation (Equation 37). This normalization step may help improve the model's generalizability by reducing the impact of feature scales on the learning process.

Overall, while some basic measures may have been taken to ensure the generalizability of the model, the context does not provide sufficient information to determine the specific strategies employed.
