Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is for plant cover prediction and semantic segmentation of plant species in images. Specifically, the model is trained in three phases to predict the respective plant species when given an input image, generate weak segmentation maps using class activation mapping (CAM), and then train a segmentation network to focus on the complete plant instead of single parts. The model can be used to either train a plant cover prediction network on actual vegetation data or generate zero-shot predictions without any training on plant cover annotations.
