Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention two independent databases: T0 (Fig. 2a) used for building the classification model by training a CNN, and T1 (Fig. 2b) used for tuning a risk threshold Ï„i specific to each class.

It can be inferred that the data is split into at least two sets: one for training the model (T0) and another for tuning the risk threshold (T1). However, there is no mention of a validation set or a test set. It is also unclear how the data is split within each set (e.g., random split, stratified split, etc.).

Therefore, the exact criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training cannot be determined from the provided context.
