Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text only mentions that Table 2 presents the hyperparameters used for data augmentation, specifying the ranges and probabilities for each augmentation technique, but it does not provide information on the optimization method used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
