Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The text only discusses the development of a fully automatic system for fish biomass estimation based on a deep neural network, but it does not provide information on the computational resources used for training the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
