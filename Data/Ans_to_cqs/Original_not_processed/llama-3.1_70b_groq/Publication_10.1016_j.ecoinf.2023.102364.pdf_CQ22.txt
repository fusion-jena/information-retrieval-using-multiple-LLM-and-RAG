Answer:::
The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the machine learning model are not explicitly stated as accuracy, precision, or recall. However, the text mentions that the model performance was assessed internally using ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curves, which provide a measure of the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes. The ROC values for each individual algorithm in the ensemble range between 75% and 85%, with an average ROC value of 71% across the ensemble. This suggests that the model's performance is evaluated in terms of its ability to correctly classify instances as positive or negative, but the specific metrics used are not explicitly stated as accuracy, precision, or recall.
