Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the data collection methods may vary depending on the specific application or research study.

For instance, in the study on automated biodiversity monitoring (WÃ¤gele et al., 2022), it is mentioned that a multisensor station is used for data collection. This suggests that sensors may be one of the methods used for collecting raw data in this specific study.

In another study on fish detection and species classification in underwater environments (Jalal et al., 2020), it is mentioned that deep learning with temporal information is used. This implies that the data may be collected using underwater cameras or other sensors that capture temporal information.

Additionally, some studies may use public datasets or existing data sources, such as the study on age estimation of giant pandas (Hu, 1987), which uses data from droppings in the wild.

However, without more specific information, it is difficult to provide a comprehensive answer to the query. Therefore, I can only provide a partial answer based on the limited information available in the context.
