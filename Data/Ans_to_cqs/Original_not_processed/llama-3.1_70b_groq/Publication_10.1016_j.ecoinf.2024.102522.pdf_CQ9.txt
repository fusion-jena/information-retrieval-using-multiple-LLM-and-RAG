Answer: I don't know.

The provided context appears to be a list of academic references related to ecological informatics, remote sensing, and invasive species. There is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a data repository. The references are mostly research articles and papers published in various scientific journals, and they do not provide information about a specific data repository or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to the query.
