Answer:::

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows:

* Learning rate: Not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
* Optimizer: The Adam algorithm was used, which is a stochastic gradient descent method.
* Batch size: Not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
* Number of epochs: Initially set to 500, but later adjusted to the minimum number of epochs that guaranteed the stabilization of the loss curve in the four folds of the cross-validation process.

Additionally, the context mentions that the hyperparameters that define the architecture of the ANN (number of layers and number of neurons) were also explored, but the specific values used are not provided.
