Answer:::

The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that 8330 cells (half of the total) were randomly extracted as a mask for training data, and 3,332 cells (20% of the total) were randomly extracted as a mask for validation data. This suggests that the data was split randomly into training and validation sets, with a ratio of 80% for training and 20% for validation. There is no mention of a separate test set.

It is worth noting that the context does not provide information on the specific criteria used for splitting the data, such as stratification or cross-validation. The splitting of data appears to be done randomly, which is a common approach in deep learning. However, without more information, it is difficult to provide a more detailed answer.
