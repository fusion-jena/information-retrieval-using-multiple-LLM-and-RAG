Answer:

Based on the provided context, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM): This method involves collecting audio recordings from the environment, which can be used to monitor animal and ecosystem processes.
2. Point count surveys: This method involves conducting surveys to estimate bird abundance, which can be integrated with automated acoustic vocalization data.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of sensors, but it does not provide specific details about the types of sensors used. However, it can be inferred that audio sensors or recorders are used to collect the audio recordings.

There is no mention of public datasets being used as a source of raw data in the provided context.
