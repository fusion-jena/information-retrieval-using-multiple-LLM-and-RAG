Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context only discusses the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for identifying animal sounds in soundscape recordings, the conversion of audio clips into spectrograms, and the performance of the model. It does not provide information on the optimization techniques used during the training process.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
