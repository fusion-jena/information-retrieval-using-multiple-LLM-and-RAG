Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling (SDM), bias correction, and evaluation indicators, but it does not discuss deep learning or optimization techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a relevant answer to the query.
