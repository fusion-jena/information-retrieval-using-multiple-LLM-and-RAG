Answer: The purpose of the model is classification, specifically to classify species or sex based on footprint images. The model uses linear discriminant analysis to generate a discrimination line or hyperplane to classify the objects, and logistic regression to quantify uncertainty in classification. The model also uses predictor screening analysis to identify variables with the greatest potential to discriminate between classes of objects.
