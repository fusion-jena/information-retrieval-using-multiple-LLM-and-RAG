Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on various applications of machine learning and remote sensing in environmental management, such as water quality management and lake eutrophication evaluation.

However, I can provide some general information on common optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines. Some popular optimization techniques used in deep learning include:

* Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD): a widely used optimization algorithm that iteratively updates the model's parameters to minimize the loss function.
* Adam: a popular optimization algorithm that adapts the learning rate for each parameter based on the magnitude of the gradient.
* RMSProp: an optimization algorithm that divides the learning rate by a running average of the squared gradient.
* Adagrad: an optimization algorithm that adapts the learning rate for each parameter based on the magnitude of the gradient.

Please note that these optimization techniques are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, and I'm providing general information on common optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines.
