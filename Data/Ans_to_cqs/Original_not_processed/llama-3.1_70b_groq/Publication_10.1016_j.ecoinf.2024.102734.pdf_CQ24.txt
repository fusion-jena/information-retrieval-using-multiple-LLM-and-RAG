Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. However, it does mention "randomly ordered samples" in the context of comparing active learning strategies. This suggests that randomness is introduced in the sampling process, but the specific strategies used to handle this randomness are not discussed. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
