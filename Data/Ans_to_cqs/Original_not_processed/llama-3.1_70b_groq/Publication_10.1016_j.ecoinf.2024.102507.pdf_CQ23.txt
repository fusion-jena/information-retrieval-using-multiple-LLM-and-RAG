Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the research team took actions to address the imbalance in the training data, which could affect the model's generalizability.

The actions taken include:

* Data reduction: The team used a sampling method to force the number of samples of various forest types to be limited to the same, but this approach had a problem of different sampling ratios.
* Data augmentation: The team used image rotation or overlapping plots to standardize the number of samples of the forest type to the same.

While these actions may help to some extent, they do not explicitly address the measures mentioned in the query, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Therefore, it is unclear what specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
