Answer: 
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the datasets used, the evaluation method (random ten crop testing), and the performance of the ResNet50 model compared to another algorithm, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search.
