Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the sources of the datasets used, which are:

* htt ps://www.resdc.cn/ (for GDP data)
* http s://www.tpedc.ac.cn/ (for NTL data)
* htt ps://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/ (for NPP data)

These sources suggest that the datasets used are publicly available and obtained from online repositories. There is no mention of surveys or sensors being used to collect raw data. It appears that the datasets are pre-existing and obtained from external sources, rather than being collected through primary data collection methods.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that public datasets are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, the exact methods used for collecting these datasets are not specified.
