Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the code repository of the BirdNET deep learning pipeline. It only mentions that BirdNET is a research project between The Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the Chemnitz University of Technology, but it does not provide information on where the code is hosted. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
