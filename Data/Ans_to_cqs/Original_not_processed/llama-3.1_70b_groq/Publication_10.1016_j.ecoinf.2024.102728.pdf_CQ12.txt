Answer:::
Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is inferred from the following sources:

* Mohedano et al. (2017) mention "deep convolutional" in the title of their paper, suggesting that they are working with CNNs.
* Cohen and Shashua (2017) discuss the inductive bias of Deep Convolutional Networks, further supporting the idea that CNNs are being used.
* Petrovska et al. (2020) also mention using deep learning for feature extraction in remote sensing, and specifically mention aerial scene classification, which is often done using CNNs.

While there is no explicit statement that says "CNN is used in the pipeline", the cumulative evidence from these sources suggests that CNNs are likely being used. However, without more direct information, it's impossible to rule out the possibility of other deep learning models being used as well.
