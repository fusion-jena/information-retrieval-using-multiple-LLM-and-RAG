Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate and optimizer. The context appears to be related to the application of deep learning models for NDVI reconstruction and vegetation cover study, but it does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in the models.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
