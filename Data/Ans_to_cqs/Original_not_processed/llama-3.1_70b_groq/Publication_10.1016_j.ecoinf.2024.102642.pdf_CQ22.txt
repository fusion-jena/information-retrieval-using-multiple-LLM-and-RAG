Answer:

According to the provided context, the following metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model:

1. True Positive (TP): A call is accurately detected and annotated.
2. False Positive (FP): A call is detected, but there is no annotation.
3. True Negative (TN): No call is detected and no call is annotated.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of the following metrics:

1. AUC (Area Under the Curve)
2. mAP (mean Average Precision)
3. F1 score (computed from the measurements of recall and precision)

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the model trained with expert annotations and non-expert annotations, as well as to compare the performance of different models.
