Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about training completion criteria, validation loss plateau, or any related concepts. The context appears to be from a research article discussing data analysis and COVID-19, but it does not provide information about machine learning or training processes. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
