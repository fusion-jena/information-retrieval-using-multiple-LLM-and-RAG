Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to focus on hyperparameter optimization, model training, and remote sensing applications, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for thin cloud removal in optical remote sensing images, as mentioned in the reference "Li, J., Wu, Z., Hu, Z., et al., 2020. Thin cloud removal in optical remote sensing images based on generative adversarial networks and physical model of cloud distortion." GANs can be used for data augmentation, but the context does not explicitly state that they are used for this purpose in the pipeline.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
