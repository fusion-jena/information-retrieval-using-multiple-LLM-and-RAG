Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. The context appears to be discussing model evaluation metrics, such as AUC, TPR, TSS, and Kappa, and comparing the performance of different models on various test datasets. However, it does not provide information on the specific hyperparameters used in the model.
