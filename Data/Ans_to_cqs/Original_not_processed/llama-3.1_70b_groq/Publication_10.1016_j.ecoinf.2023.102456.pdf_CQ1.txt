Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on machine learning, forest fires, and cellular automata, but it does not provide information on data collection methods.

However, it does mention "existing data and historical databases" as a source of information for learning neighbourhood relationships in the intelligent cellular scheme. This suggests that the authors may be using existing datasets or databases as a source of raw data, but it does not provide further details on how the data was collected.

Additionally, one of the references mentions a "survey on missing data in machine learning", which suggests that surveys may be used as a method for collecting data in some machine learning contexts. However, this is not explicitly stated as a method used in the deep learning pipeline.

Overall, the provided context does not provide a clear answer to the question, and more information would be needed to determine the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
