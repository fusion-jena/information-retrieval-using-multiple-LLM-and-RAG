Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context appears to be focused on machine learning for inferring animal behavior from location and movement data, and it discusses various models and techniques, including supervised and unsupervised learning, hidden Markov models, and state space models. However, it does not provide information on postprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training in this context.
