Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling using ensemble modeling approaches in R, and does not discuss deep learning or regularization methods. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide an answer to this query.
