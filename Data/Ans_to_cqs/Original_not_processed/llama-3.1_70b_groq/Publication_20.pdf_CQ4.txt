Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The text only discusses the architecture of the convolutional neural network (GoogLeNet), the training parameters, and the dataset used, but does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.
