Answer:::
The data is split into training, validation, and testing sets using the 10-fold cross-validation method. The training and validation sets are divided into ten parts, with nine parts used as the training set and one part used as the validation set. The percentage of the training, validation, and testing sets is 5.4:0.6:1, respectively. This means that 54% of the data is used for training, 6% for validation, and 40% for testing.
