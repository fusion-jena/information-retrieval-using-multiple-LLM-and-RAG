Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the training process, model selection, and performance evaluation. It discusses the use of a P100 GPU with 16 GB of VRAM memory and a Colab notebook set to "high RAM session" for training, but it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed.

However, it can be inferred that the model was likely used for prediction on a large dataset of 58,148 images, as mentioned in the context. The context also mentions that the prediction phase took approximately 10 hours, but it does not provide details on how the model was deployed or integrated into a larger system for making predictions.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
