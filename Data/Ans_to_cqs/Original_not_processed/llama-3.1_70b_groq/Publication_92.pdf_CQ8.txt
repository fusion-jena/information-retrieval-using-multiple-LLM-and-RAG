Answer:::
The provided context does not mention the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper or a technical document that describes the architecture and methodology used for coral reef fish detection and recognition in underwater videos, but it does not provide information about the code repository. Therefore, I do not know where the code repository is available.
