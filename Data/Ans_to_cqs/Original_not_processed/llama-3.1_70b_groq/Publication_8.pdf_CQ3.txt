Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the model was trained on annotated images, and the goal was to detect and annotate plant organs from digitized herbarium scans.

It is mentioned that the model was trained on a dataset of 653 annotated images, and the model was used to predict plant organs on an un-annotated independent dataset. However, the specific annotation techniques used, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, are not mentioned.

The context does mention that the model used is a Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) model, which is a type of object detection model that typically uses bounding box annotations. However, this is not explicitly stated in the context, and it is not clear if other annotation techniques were used in addition to bounding box annotation.
