Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily discusses the use of Vision Transformers (ViT) for image recognition, the architecture of ViT, and its advantages over traditional CNNs. It also provides some references to related research papers and a table with machine configuration information. However, it does not provide any information on model deployment, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
