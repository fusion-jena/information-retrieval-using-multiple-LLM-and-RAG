Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning and other machine learning methods, such as Random Forest (RF), to water quality management and environmental monitoring.

However, it does mention that the RF algorithm is robust to randomly receiving training data from subsets and can establish models with high predictive capacity. This suggests that the RF method can handle randomness in the data, but it does not provide information on how to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

Additionally, the context mentions that the dataset was randomly divided into two subsets, one for training and one for validation, but it does not discuss the use of a random seed value to ensure reproducibility.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
