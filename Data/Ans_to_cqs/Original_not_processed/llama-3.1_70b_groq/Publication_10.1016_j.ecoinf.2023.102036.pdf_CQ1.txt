Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning in computer vision, particularly in the field of fisheries, and discusses the challenges of working with a small dataset. It mentions the use of existing deep learning techniques in combination with statistical fundamentals to overcome the limitation in dataset size, but it does not provide information on data collection methods.

Therefore, I do not know the specific methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, as this information is not provided in the given context.
