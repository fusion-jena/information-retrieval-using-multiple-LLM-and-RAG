Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the workflow developed in the study aims to "enrich data" and "obtain more complete and less biased datasets" by using multiple data sources.

It is mentioned that the workflow uses a combination of textual and visual analysis to extract relevant data from social media posts. The study also uses image augmentation techniques, such as horizontal flip, shear, and random zoom, to increase the diversity of the training data. Additionally, the study uses a large dataset of images from Flickr, which may help to reduce bias by including a diverse range of images.

However, it is not clear if the study uses techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling to address data bias. The study does mention that the workflow is able to downsample the original dataset by around 99.5% while still achieving a precision of 0.636, but it is not clear what specific techniques are used to achieve this.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the study uses a combination of textual and visual analysis, image augmentation, and diverse data collection to address data bias, but it is not clear if specific techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling are used.
