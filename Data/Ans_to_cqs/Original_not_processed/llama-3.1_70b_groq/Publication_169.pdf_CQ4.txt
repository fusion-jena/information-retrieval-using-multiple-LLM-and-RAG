Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions that data augmentation was used to enlarge the dataset and overcome the problem of overfitting, but it does not provide details on the techniques used. Therefore, I do not know the specific data augmentation techniques applied in this case.
