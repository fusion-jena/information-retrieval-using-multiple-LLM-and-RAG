Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention "data augmentation" in the context of using the moths dataset with EfÔ¨ÅcientNetB0. This suggests that some form of data augmentation was used, but the specific details of the preprocessing steps are not provided.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of a dropout probability of 0.3 after the second to last hidden layer, which is a regularization technique used to prevent overfitting. However, this is not a preprocessing step, but rather a technique used during the training process.

Overall, the provided context does not provide enough information to determine the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model.
