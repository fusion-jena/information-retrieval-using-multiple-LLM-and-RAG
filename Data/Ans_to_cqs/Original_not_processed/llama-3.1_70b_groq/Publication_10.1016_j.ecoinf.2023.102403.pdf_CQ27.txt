Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deploying a trained deep learning model, model serialization, or platform selection. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, species distributions, and data curation, but it does not provide any information about deep learning models or their deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide a meaningful answer to this query.
