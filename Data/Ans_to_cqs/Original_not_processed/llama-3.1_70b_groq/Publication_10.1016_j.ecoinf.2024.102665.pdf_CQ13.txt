Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context only mentions that a deep learning model was combined with an optimization algorithm to detect the dispersal of the early stages of spotted butterfish in northern Vietnam under global warming (Do, A.N.T., Tran, H.D., 2023). However, it does not provide any details about the hyperparameters used in the model.
