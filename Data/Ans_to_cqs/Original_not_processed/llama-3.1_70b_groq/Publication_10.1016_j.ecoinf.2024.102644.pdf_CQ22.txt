Answer: The provided context does not specifically mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of the Area Under the Curve (AUC) metric to evaluate the quality of the models used for species richness estimation. According to the text, an AUC close to 1 indicates high model quality, whereas 0 indicates low model quality. The text also mentions that all models used for species richness estimation reached at least a 0.75 AUC, which contributed to result reliability. 

It is worth noting that the context does not mention the use of deep learning models explicitly. It mentions the use of MaxEnt, which is a maximum entropy modeling approach, but not deep learning. Therefore, the answer to the query is that the context does not provide information on the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model.
