Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does provide some clues about the data sources used in the study.

The context mentions "https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/" and "www.openstreetmap.org/#map=4/21.84/82.79" as references, suggesting that the study may have utilized publicly available datasets or satellite imagery from these sources. Additionally, the context mentions "LULC statistics of 1995, 2008, 2020, and 2035 (in ha)" which implies that the study may have used historical data or datasets related to land use and land cover (LULC) changes.

However, without more information, it is difficult to determine the exact methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question.
