Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context appears to be related to remote sensing and atmospheric correction, but it does not provide information on the deployment of a deep learning model. Therefore, I do not have enough information to answer this question.
