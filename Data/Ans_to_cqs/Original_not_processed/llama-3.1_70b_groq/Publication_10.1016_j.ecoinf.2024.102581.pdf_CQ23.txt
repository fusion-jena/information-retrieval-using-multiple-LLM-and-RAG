Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the model was tested on multiple datasets, including Mendeley and CVIP100, which may indicate some level of diversity in the data. Additionally, the context mentions the use of transfer learning approaches, which can help improve the model's generalizability by leveraging pre-trained models and fine-tuning them on the target dataset.

However, there is no explicit mention of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or other techniques that are commonly used to ensure the generalizability of deep learning models. Therefore, it is unclear what specific measures were taken to ensure the model's generalizability beyond testing on multiple datasets.
