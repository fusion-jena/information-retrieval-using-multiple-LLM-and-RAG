Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in this work is classification, specifically for deep-sea substratum characterization. The models were evaluated on single and multi-label classification problems, and the goal was to assess their performance in classifying different types of substrata. The classification decision committee (CDC) proposed in the work also aimed to improve the classification accuracy by fusing the predictions of individual models through a majority voting mechanism.
