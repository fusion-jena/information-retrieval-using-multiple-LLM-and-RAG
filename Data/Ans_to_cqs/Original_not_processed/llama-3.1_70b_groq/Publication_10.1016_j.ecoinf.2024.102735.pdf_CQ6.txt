Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The text primarily focuses on the methodology, data acquisition, and the use of machine learning models for predicting algal-related parameters. It discusses the importance of data-driven models, the use of various machine learning algorithms, and the impact of measurement uncertainties on model predictions.

However, it does mention the use of high-frequency datasets and the importance of dataset size in building models. It also touches upon the concept of overfitting and the need for models to learn effectively with limited datasets.

While the text does not provide specific information on preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning, it can be inferred that some form of data preprocessing might be necessary to prepare the data for model training. Nevertheless, without explicit information, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer to the query.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model.
