Answer:::
The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is audio. Specifically, the audio files are converted to Mel-spectrograms, a signal representation derived from the spectrogram that substitutes the normal frequency scale with the nonlinear Mel scale. This is done to input the sound files into the VGGish model. The audio samples are first downsampled to 16 kHz before being passed through a CNN to generate embeddings.
