Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context only mentions that the model is implemented using the Python library PyTorch and that it includes an energy-based optimization step, but it does not provide further details on the hyperparameters used. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
