Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the analysis and processing of existing data, specifically in the context of ecological source identification and land-use analysis. It mentions the use of the R package kohonen for Self-Organizing Feature Maps (SOFM) and Getis-Ord Gi* for hotspot analysis, but it does not provide information on data collection methods.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
