Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the evaluation of map accuracy using various methods, including k-fold cross-validation, and the computation of metrics such as RMSE and MEC. It does mention the use of a validation set for model selection and hyperparameter tuning, but it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
