Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the application of transformer models in computer vision, particularly the Vision Transformer (ViT) and its variants.

However, it does mention that the standard ViT model converts images into fixed-size tokens, which implies that some form of image preprocessing or annotation might be involved. Nevertheless, the specific techniques used for data annotation are not discussed in the provided context.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query. If you have any further questions or context, I would be happy to try and assist you.
