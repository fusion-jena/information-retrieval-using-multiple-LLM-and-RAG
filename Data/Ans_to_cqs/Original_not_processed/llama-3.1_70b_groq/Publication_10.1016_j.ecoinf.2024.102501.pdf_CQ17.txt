Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses various machine learning and deep learning methods used for predicting dissolved oxygen concentration in water, such as LSTM, GRNN, RBFNN, MLPNN, and others. However, it does not delve into the specifics of the regularization techniques used in these models.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
