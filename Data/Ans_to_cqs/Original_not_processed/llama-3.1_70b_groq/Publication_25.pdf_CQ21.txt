Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. It discusses the improvement in prediction quality during the training pipeline, comparing the results of unsupervised detection, self-supervised RGB model, and the full semi-supervised model. However, it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.
