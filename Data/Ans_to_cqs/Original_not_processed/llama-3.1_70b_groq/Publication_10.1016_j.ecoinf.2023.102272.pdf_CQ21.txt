Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context only discusses the model selection procedure, data partitioning, and the training process, but does not provide information on the postprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
