Answer:

The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network). This is a specific type of CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) that is designed for object detection tasks. The Faster R-CNN model is used to identify regions in an image that contain an object and then classify those objects into specific classes, such as animals, humans, or trucks.
