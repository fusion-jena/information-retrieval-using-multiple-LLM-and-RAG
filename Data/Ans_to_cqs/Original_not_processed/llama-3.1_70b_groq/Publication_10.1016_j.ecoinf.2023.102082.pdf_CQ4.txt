Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The text only mentions that a deep learning approach (convolutional neural networks) was used to create the high-resolution CHM of the Earth (Lang10m) at 10 m resolution using Sentinel-2 optical images. It does not provide details on the data augmentation techniques used, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
