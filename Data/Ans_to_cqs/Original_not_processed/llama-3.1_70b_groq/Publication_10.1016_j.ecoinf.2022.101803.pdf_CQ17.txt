Answer:::

The provided context does not specifically mention deep learning or the regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, it does mention regularization in the context of parameter estimation with Maximum Likelihood (ML) and provides an example of a particular form of regularization called ridge regression.

According to the context, ridge regression is a regularization method that adds a penalty term to the log likelihood to quantify model complexity. The penalty term is based on the weighted L2 norm of the parameter vector. This is similar to L2 regularization, which is a common regularization method used in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting.

However, the context does not mention dropout or other regularization methods commonly used in deep learning. Therefore, I can only confirm that L2 regularization (or a similar method called ridge regression) is mentioned in the context as a regularization method, but I do not know if it is used in the specific deep learning pipeline mentioned in the query.
