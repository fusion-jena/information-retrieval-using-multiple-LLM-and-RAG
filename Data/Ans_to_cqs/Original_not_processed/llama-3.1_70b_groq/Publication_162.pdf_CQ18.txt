Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is through a feedback mechanism that involves the user in the optimization of the system, also known as active learning. This mechanism involves forwarding images to humans at certain intervals, who then annotate these images. These annotated images are then used to train a classifier iteratively. 

Additionally, the model performance is evaluated with a retained test set of images that have been annotated manually. This test set is used to assess the model's performance and identify areas for improvement. 

It is also mentioned that the system will likely detect species that are unknown to the recognition system, and novelty detection is relevant in this context. However, the exact strategy for handling unknown species is not specified in the provided context.
