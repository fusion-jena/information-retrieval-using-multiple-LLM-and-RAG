Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context appears to be related to environmental science and species distribution modeling, with discussions on sampling bias, model evaluation, and research papers. However, it does not provide any information on the specific hyperparameters used in a deep learning model.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
