Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss data augmentation as a method to overcome the problem of limited data and improve model performance.

Data augmentation is mentioned as a technique to increase the variability of audio data in a training dataset by transforming the data, such as changing the frequency, pitch, and volume of audio signals, shifting, rotating, and zooming in the time and/or frequency domains of spectrograms, and adding additional noise.

While data augmentation can help to increase the diversity of the training data, it is not explicitly mentioned as a technique to address data bias. The context also mentions that data augmentation works well only on relatively clean recordings, not soundscape recordings.

The context does not mention stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection as techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. Therefore, it is unclear what techniques are used to address data bias in this specific context.
