Answer: 
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it does mention the use of deep learning in a few instances, such as in the work of Salaken et al. (2019) and in the use of deep CNN to identify oestrus and non-oestrus sounds of sows. Therefore, it can be inferred that at least one of the models used is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). However, it is unclear if other types of deep learning models, such as RNN or Transformer, are also used.
