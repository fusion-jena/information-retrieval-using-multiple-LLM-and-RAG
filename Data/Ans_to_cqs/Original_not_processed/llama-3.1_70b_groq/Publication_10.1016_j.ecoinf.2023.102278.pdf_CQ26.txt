Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and training of the model, including the use of transfer learning, dropout regularization, and the Adam optimizer. It also discusses the challenges of working with unbalanced datasets in entomological applications, but it does not provide specific information on techniques used to address data bias.

However, it is mentioned that the datasets in entomological applications are often unbalanced, with numerous classes nested inside each other in a taxonomic hierarchy. This suggests that techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, or stratified splitting might be necessary to address data bias, but this is not explicitly stated in the provided context.
