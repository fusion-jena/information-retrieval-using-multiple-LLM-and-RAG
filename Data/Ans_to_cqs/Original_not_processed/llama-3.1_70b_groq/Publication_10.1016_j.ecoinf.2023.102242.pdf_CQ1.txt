Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the challenges of processing high-resolution remote sensing data, the importance of representative and sufficient training samples, and the use of feature optimization tools to address these challenges.

However, it does mention the use of remote sensing data, which implies that the data may be collected through sensors, such as satellite or aerial imagery. Additionally, the context mentions the use of bark tissues spectra in a study on recognizing Amazonian tree species, suggesting that sensor data may be used in certain applications.

Unfortunately, the context does not provide more specific information on the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, such as surveys or public datasets. Therefore, I cannot provide a more detailed answer to this question based on the provided context.
