Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on species distribution modeling using machine learning models, and it discusses the use of various environmental variables and machine learning models to assess the impact of urban development on species distribution. It does not mention deep learning pipelines or techniques for addressing data bias.

However, it does mention the use of seven different machine learning models, including Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Random Forest (RF), and Classification and Regression Tree (CART), to assess species distribution. It also discusses the use of Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves to evaluate the performance of these models.

If you're looking for information on techniques to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, I would recommend searching for a different source of information that specifically addresses this topic.
