Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily discusses the use of randomized grid search for hyperparameter tuning, model performance assessment techniques, and the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in various applications. It does not delve into the specifics of optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
