Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the implementation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for automated detection of humpback whale songs, and it discusses the architecture, training, and inference procedures. However, it does not provide information on data preprocessing techniques used to address data bias.

The context mentions the use of a customized architecture and transfer learning approach, as well as the use of a dataset with a specific size and composition. However, it does not discuss techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, which are commonly used to address data bias.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
