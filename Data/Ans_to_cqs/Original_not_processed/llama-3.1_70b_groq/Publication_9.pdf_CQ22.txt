Answer:::

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in the provided context are:

1. Pixel accuracy (PxAcc)
2. Mean accuracy (MeanAcc)
3. Mean intersection over union (MeanIoU)
4. Frequency-weighted intersection over union (FreqIoU)

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the model in segmenting images from different sources (iNaturalist and J.E. Randall). The results of the evaluation are presented in Figure 7, which shows the bar plot of the four metrics by image source. The post-hoc comparisons for the main effect of evaluation metric are also presented in Table 1.

It's worth noting that the context does not mention precision and recall as evaluation metrics, which are commonly used in deep learning model evaluation. However, the provided metrics are specific to image segmentation tasks, which is the focus of the context.
