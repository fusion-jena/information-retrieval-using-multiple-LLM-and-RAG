Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of different test datasets and the evaluation of model performance using various metrics.

It appears that the study used a random background, filtered, targeted, filtered and targeted, and weighted approaches to evaluate the model's performance. Additionally, the study used two different test datasets: a random 25% of the data (Test set #1) and a dataset consisting of only Irish records (Test set #2).

The use of multiple test datasets and evaluation metrics suggests that the study attempted to assess the model's performance under different conditions. However, it is unclear whether the study employed techniques such as cross-validation, stratified splitting, or used a diverse dataset to ensure the generalizability of the model.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
