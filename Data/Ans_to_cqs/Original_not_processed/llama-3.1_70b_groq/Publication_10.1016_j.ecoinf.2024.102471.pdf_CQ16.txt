Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the pre-training and fine-tuning phases of the Wav2Vec model, as well as its performance evaluation. It mentions the loss and accuracy plots in Fig. 12 and Fig. 13, which show the model's performance over varying epochs, but it does not specify the criteria used to determine the completion of training.

However, it can be inferred that the model's performance is evaluated based on its loss and accuracy on the validation set, as is common in machine learning. The context mentions that the proposed transfer learning approach using Wav2Vec can perform well with fewer epochs, suggesting that the model's performance may be evaluated based on its convergence or plateauing of loss and accuracy. Nevertheless, the specific criteria used to determine the completion of training are not explicitly stated in the provided context.
