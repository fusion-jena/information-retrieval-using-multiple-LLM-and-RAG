Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the application of Elastic Net to improve the performance of a proposed model, the use of deep learning methods in biological networks, and the architecture of a Stacked Autoencoder (SAE) model.

However, it can be inferred that the input data is high-dimensional, as mentioned in the context. This might require some form of dimensionality reduction or feature selection. Additionally, the context mentions the use of mean square error as a loss function, which might imply that the data is continuous and numerical.

But, without explicit information, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer to the query. Therefore, I can only speculate that some form of preprocessing might be involved, but the exact steps are not mentioned in the provided context.
