Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention that 70% of the data were used for training the algorithms, whereas the remaining 30% were used only for validation (Table 2). This suggests that the model performance was likely evaluated using the validation set during training, but the specific strategy or metrics used for monitoring performance are not mentioned.
