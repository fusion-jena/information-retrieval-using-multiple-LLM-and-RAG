Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN), specifically a Deeplabv3-Resnet101 network. This is mentioned in the text as the base network that has been trained on a subset of the COCO train2017 dataset and is used as a learned feature extractor. The model is then modified by attaching a classification head of 2048 neurons with sigmoid activation to predict the class for each pixel.
