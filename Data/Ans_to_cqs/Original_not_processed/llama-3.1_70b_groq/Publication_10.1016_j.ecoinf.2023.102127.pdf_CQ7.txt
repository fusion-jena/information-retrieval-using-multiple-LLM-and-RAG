Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The text discusses the challenges of model evaluation, particularly in the context of species distribution modeling (SDM), and highlights the importance of considering all available data, biases, and sampling methods. It also mentions the limitations of withholding parts of the training data for validation, as both training and testing data may suffer from the same spatial and environmental biases.

However, the text does not provide specific guidance on how to split the data for deep learning model training. It only mentions that withholding parts of the training data for validation is a standard practice, but notes that this approach may not be effective in certain cases.

Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training based on the provided context.
