Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the use of deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for land use and land cover (LULC) classification, but it does not delve into the details of data annotation techniques. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
