Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context mentions various research papers, software programs, and online platforms, but it does not provide a direct link to a data repository.

However, it does mention the Rainforest Connection website (https://arbimon.rfcx.org/) which is linked to the Automated Remote Biodiversity Monitoring Network (ARBIMON) platform. This platform is used for automating data acquisition, data management, and species identification based on audio recordings.

If the query is looking for a specific data repository link, it is possible that the data is available on one of the mentioned platforms (Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF), but the provided context does not provide a direct link to it.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the specific data repository link is not mentioned in the provided context.
