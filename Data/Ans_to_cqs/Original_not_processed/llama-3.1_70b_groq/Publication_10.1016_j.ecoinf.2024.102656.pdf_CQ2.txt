Answer:::
The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or the specific data formats used in such a pipeline. However, it does mention the use of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images, which are likely in a raster format, and the calculation of various variables such as NDVI, distance maps, and categorical maps, which are also in raster format. Additionally, it mentions the use of ArcGIS and the formatting of variables as rasters with a grid size of 100 m. 

Therefore, based on the provided context, it appears that the data formats used are primarily raster images and possibly CSV files for storing variables, but this is not explicitly stated.
