Answer: The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training is a stratified train-test split. This procedure is particularly beneficial for imbalanced datasets as it maintains the proportion of each class in the original dataset. In this case, the proportion is 80% for training and 20% for validation. This ensures that all classes participate in both the training and validation phases of the model. However, this stratified train-test split was not applied to the dataset composed of trajectories of length 13, but rather to the original trajectories of variable length. This was done to ensure that each trajectory belongs exclusively to either the train or validation splits, but not both.
