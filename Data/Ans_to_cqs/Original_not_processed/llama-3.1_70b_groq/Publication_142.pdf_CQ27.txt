Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly describe the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that access to the Pl@ntNet classification tool is provided through a dedicated API available at my.plantnet.org. This API is a RESTful JSON-based web service that can accept one to five images of a plant and returns a list of likely species.

Additionally, the context mentions that a R-package called 'plantnet' has been developed to facilitate the implementation of future studies based on the methodology of the paper. This package allows users to query the Pl@ntNet API.

While the context does not provide detailed information on the deployment process, it suggests that the trained model is deployed as a web service through the API, and that users can interact with the model through this API or through the 'plantnet' R-package. However, specific details on model serialization, platform selection, and other deployment-related processes are not provided.
