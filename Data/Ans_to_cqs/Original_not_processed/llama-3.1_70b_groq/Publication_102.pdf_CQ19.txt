Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning models. It mentions the use of various architectures such as UNet, VGG16, EfficientNet, and Count-ception, but it does not specify the framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) used to implement these architectures.
