Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is folded cross-validation. Specifically, the dataset is partitioned into ten equal sections, known as folds. In a cyclical process, one fold serves as the test set while the remaining nine folds are used for training. The trained model is then evaluated on the test set, and the resulting performance metrics are recorded. This process is repeated, and the outcomes are averaged to obtain a comprehensive assessment of the model's performance.
