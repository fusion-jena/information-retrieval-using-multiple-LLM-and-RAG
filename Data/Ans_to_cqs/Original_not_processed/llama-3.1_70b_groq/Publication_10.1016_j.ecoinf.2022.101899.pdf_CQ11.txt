Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses various research studies on wildfire event predictions using deep learning and mentions the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) datasets for extracting NDVI data, but it does not provide information on where the deep learning pipeline is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
