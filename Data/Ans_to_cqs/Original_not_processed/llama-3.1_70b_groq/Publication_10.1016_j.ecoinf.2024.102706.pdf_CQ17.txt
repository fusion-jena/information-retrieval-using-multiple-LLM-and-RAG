Answer:::

The provided context does not specifically mention deep learning pipeline or methods like dropout, L2 regularization. However, it does discuss regularization methods in the context of linear regression and elastic net regression.

According to the context, the Enet algorithm is a regularization process that combines Lasso and Ridge regression. The Lasso regression uses L1 penalty, which removes or shrinks predictors that do not affect reducing the sum of square error (SSE). The Ridge regression uses L2 penalty, which adds a penalty term to the SSE. The Enet algorithm aggregates L1 and L2 penalties from Lasso and Ridge and forms a linear regularization method.

The context also mentions that the Enet regression needs two parameters to be optimized for a best-performing model: alpha (Î±) and l1_ratio. The alpha parameter controls the regularization strength, and the l1_ratio parameter determines the balance between L1 and L2 penalties.

While the context does not specifically mention dropout or L2 regularization in the context of deep learning, it does discuss L2 regularization in the context of Ridge regression. However, it is not clear if this is directly applicable to the deep learning pipeline.
