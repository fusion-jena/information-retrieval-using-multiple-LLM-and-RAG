Answer: The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically a wide residual network (ResNet) architecture. The encoder and decoder are both set up as wide ResNets, which allow for deeper architectures and increased model complexity by learning a perturbation of the input signal at each layer. The use of ResNets is mentioned in the context, citing the work of Zagoruyko and Komodakis (2017) and He et al. (2015a).
