The text does not explicitly mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. However, it does mention that a "robust deep learning framework available in Python" was used, which suggests that the framework is likely one of the popular Python-based deep learning frameworks. Unfortunately, without more information, it is not possible to determine which specific framework was used.
