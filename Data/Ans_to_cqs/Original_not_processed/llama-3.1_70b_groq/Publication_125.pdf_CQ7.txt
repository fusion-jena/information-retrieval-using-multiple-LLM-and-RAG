Answer: 

The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the considered dataset is further divided into three datasets, resulting in 22,666 images for training the model (training set), 7554 images for validating the trained model (validation set), and 7554 images for assessing the model performance (testing set). 

This suggests that the data is split into a training set (approximately 75% of the total data), a validation set (approximately 12.5% of the total data), and a testing set (approximately 12.5% of the total data). However, the exact criteria or method used to split the data (e.g., random split, stratified split) is not provided in the given context.
