Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. It discusses the evaluation of the ResNet50 model on three test datasets and compares its performance with the PlantNet tool. However, it does not provide information on the training process or the stopping criteria used. Therefore, I do not know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete.
