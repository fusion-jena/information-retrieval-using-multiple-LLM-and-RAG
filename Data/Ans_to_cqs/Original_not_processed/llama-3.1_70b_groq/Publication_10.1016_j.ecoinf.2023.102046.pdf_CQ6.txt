Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention that the images were resized to specific dimensions for different models: (299, 299) pixels for Inception-V3 and (224, 224) pixels for ViT and ResNet.

Additionally, the context mentions that dataset imbalance was dealt with by including class weights in the cross-entropy loss function, which suggests that some form of preprocessing or data balancing was performed. However, the specific steps involved in this process are not specified.

Therefore, the only preprocessing step that can be inferred from the provided context is image resizing. No information is available on normalization, scaling, or cleaning.
