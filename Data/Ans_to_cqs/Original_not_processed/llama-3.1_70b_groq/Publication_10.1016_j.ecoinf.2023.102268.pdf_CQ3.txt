Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the use of a pre-trained ResNet-50 convolutional neural network (CNN) for feature extraction and a support vector machine (SVM) classifier for classification. It mentions that the labeled dataset was split into training and testing datasets, but it does not provide details on how the data was annotated.

However, it can be inferred that the data annotation process likely involved labeling the spectrogram images as either belonging to a specific class or not (i.e., "other" class representing false alarms). The context also mentions that the approach allows users to incorporate additional site-specific training data, which suggests that the data annotation process might be flexible and adaptable to different datasets. Nevertheless, the specific data annotation techniques used, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
