Answer:::

To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. 

Firstly, the dataset was split randomly into a train set, validation set, and test set. The test set included 20% of the video clips of each class, and the validation set included 20% of the remaining clips in each class. The remaining clips formed the training set. This stratified splitting approach ensured that the model was trained and evaluated on a diverse set of data.

Secondly, the model was trained on a pre-trained version of the detection model, which was pre-trained on a large dataset (COCO 2017train for Mask R-CNN and Kinetics-400 for ResNets). This pre-training on a large dataset helped the model to learn generalizable features.

Thirdly, data augmentation was used to increase the diversity of the training data. Although the specific data augmentation techniques used are not mentioned in the provided context, it is mentioned that data augmentation was used for action recognition.

Lastly, the use of PyTorch detection models, which are well-arranged and flexible, allowed for more efficient training and evaluation of the model.

Overall, the combination of stratified splitting, pre-training on a large dataset, data augmentation, and the use of flexible detection models helped to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
