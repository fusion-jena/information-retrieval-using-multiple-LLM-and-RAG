Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of batch normalization, which can help reduce overfitting by normalizing the input data for each layer. 

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a multinomial logistic regression on top of the SOFTMAX layer and the linear classification layer, but it does not provide information on the specific regularization methods used.

It is worth noting that the context does not mention dropout or L2 regularization explicitly. However, it does provide information on the use of pre-training and fine-tuning, which can also help prevent overfitting by leveraging knowledge from a larger dataset.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we can only confirm the use of batch normalization as a method to reduce overfitting, but we cannot provide information on the use of dropout or L2 regularization.
