Answer:::
The deep learning pipeline appears to use audio data, specifically in the form of spectrograms. The text mentions "PAM audio spectrograms" and "acoustic event detection", indicating that the pipeline is designed to process audio data. Additionally, the mention of "monochrome images" suggests that the audio data is converted into a visual representation, such as a spectrogram, which is then processed by the deep learning model. There is no mention of video or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
