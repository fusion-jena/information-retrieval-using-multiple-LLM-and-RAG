Answer:

According to the provided context, the dataset was divided into 5 subsets for 5-fold cross-validation. At each iteration of the 5-fold cross-validation, one subset was used to evaluate the models using performance metrics, while the remaining 4 subsets were used for training (90% of the images) and validation (10% of the images). This approach provides a robust and unbiased estimate of a model's performance while also guiding effective hyper-parameter tuning for improved overall performance.
