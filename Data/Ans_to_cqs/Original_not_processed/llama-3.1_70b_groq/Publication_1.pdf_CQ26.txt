Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the use of deep learning for biodiversity monitoring and the challenges of processing and analyzing large amounts of wildlife data. It mentions the use of machine learning techniques, such as deep learning, to detect and classify events of interest, but it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. However, I can suggest that common techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, as mentioned in the query. These techniques can help to mitigate issues related to class imbalance, sampling bias, and data representation.
