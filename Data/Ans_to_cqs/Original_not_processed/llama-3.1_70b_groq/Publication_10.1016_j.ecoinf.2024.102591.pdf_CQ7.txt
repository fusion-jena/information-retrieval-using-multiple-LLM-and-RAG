Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, based on the information provided in Table 1, it appears that the data is split into "training" and "validation" sets.

In Table 1, some wildfire events are labeled as "training" (e.g., La Drova, Fuente de la Corcha, Torre de l'Espanyol, etc.), while others are labeled as "validation" (e.g., Folgoso do Courel, Vall d'Ebo, Navalacruz, etc.). This suggests that the data is split into two sets: one for training the model and another for validating its performance.

However, the specific criteria used to split the data into these two sets are not mentioned in the provided context. It is also unclear whether a separate test set is used to evaluate the model's performance after training and validation.

Therefore, while we can infer that the data is split into training and validation sets, the exact criteria used to split the data are unknown based on the provided context.
