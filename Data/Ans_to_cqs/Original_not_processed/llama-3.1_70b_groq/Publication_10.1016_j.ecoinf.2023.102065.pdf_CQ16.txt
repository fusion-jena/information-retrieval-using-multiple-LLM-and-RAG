Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The text discusses the process of fine-tuning CNN models with ROIs from the study site, but it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
