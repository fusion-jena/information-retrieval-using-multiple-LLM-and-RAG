Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The text appears to discuss the performance of various methods (e.g., LoopT, knn, LoopA, LoopE) in relation to lasso regularization and bias correction, but it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
