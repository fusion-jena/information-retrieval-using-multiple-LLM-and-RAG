Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. The text mentions that the accuracy of candidate models was measured using the proportion of correctly classified cases, and the performance of the selected models was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), which is a common metric for classification problems. Additionally, the text mentions that the models are trained on a dataset and are expected to predict the correct class labels, which further supports the idea that the purpose of the model is classification.
