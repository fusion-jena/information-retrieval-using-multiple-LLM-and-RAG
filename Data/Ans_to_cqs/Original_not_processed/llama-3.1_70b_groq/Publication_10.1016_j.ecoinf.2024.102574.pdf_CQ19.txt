Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models. The context mentions the use of machine learning techniques, such as random forests, support vector machines, feature fusion techniques, and neural networks, but it does not provide information on the frameworks used to implement these techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
