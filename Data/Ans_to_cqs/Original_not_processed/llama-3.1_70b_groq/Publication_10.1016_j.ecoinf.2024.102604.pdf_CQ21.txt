Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context appears to be focused on model evaluation, specifically on correcting sampling bias in environmental spaces, and discusses various methods and their limitations. It does not provide information on the postprocessing steps involved after model training.

Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, as this information is not provided in the given context.
