Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention any deep learning model or frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context appears to be related to an article about environmental flow, riparian ecosystem, and wetland biodiversity maintenance, and it discusses a model called FERM, but it does not provide information about the frameworks used to build any deep learning models.
