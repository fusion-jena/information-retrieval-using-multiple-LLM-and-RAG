Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on hyperparameter optimization using the TPEBO algorithm for LSTM models, particularly in the context of carbon emission forecasting. It discusses the importance of hyperparameters in shaping the architecture of deep learning models and steering the learning process.

However, it does mention that machine learning and deep learning methods have shown remarkable stability and effectiveness in big data analytics, which may imply that techniques such as data preprocessing and handling imbalanced datasets are important considerations in these methods. Nevertheless, specific techniques like Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
