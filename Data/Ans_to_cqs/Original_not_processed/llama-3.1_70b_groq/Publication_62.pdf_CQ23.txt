Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used for image classification, the applications of CNNs, and the author contributions. It does not provide information on the dataset used, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Therefore, I do not know what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
