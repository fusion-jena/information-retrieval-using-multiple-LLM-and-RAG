Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline, except for images. It is mentioned that the field of computer vision relies on deep learning that allows computational models to learn from training data – a set of manually labelled images – and make predictions on new data – a set of unlabelled images. Additionally, the case study mentioned in the context uses a dataset of labelled images for model training and validation, and a new dataset of unlabelled images for prediction. Therefore, it can be inferred that the data format used in this specific deep learning pipeline is images. However, it is not possible to determine if other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV are used in the pipeline based on the provided context.
