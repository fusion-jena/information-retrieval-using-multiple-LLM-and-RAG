Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily discusses the STARdbi system, its features, and related research papers on deep learning for insect identification, but it does not delve into the details of the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
