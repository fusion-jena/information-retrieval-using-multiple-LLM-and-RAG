Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in the context provided is classification, specifically bird species classification. The text mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for soundscape classification and bird species classification. It also mentions the use of a mixture of experts (MoE) approach, which is a type of ensemble learning method that can be used for classification tasks. Additionally, the text mentions the use of automated recording units (ARUs) and citizen science to collect acoustic data, which is then used to train and test the deep learning model for bird species classification. The ultimate goal of the model is to provide valuable bird diversity data for monitoring and conservation efforts.
