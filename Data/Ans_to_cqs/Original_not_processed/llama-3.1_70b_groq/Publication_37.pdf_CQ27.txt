Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only discusses the training process, including the optimization of cross-entropy loss via mini-batch stochastic gradient descent, the use of dropout and L2-regularization, and the implementation of the CNN model in Python using Lasagne. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection.
