Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only discusses the training process, including data preparation, model architecture, and optimization techniques. It does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
