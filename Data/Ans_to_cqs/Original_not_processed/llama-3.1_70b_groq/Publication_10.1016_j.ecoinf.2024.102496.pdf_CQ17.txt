Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. The context appears to be related to environmental science and engineering, specifically discussing best management practices (BMPs) for reducing pollutant loads in urban watersheds. It mentions various BMPs such as infiltration devices, porous pavement, and wet pond detention, but does not mention deep learning or regularization methods. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide an answer to the query.
