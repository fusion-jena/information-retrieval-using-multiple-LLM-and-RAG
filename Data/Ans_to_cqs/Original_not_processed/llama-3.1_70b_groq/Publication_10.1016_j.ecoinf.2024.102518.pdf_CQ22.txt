Answer:

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model are the Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) and the Continuous Boyce Index (CBI). Additionally, the delta in the Akaike minimum information criterion (delta.AICc) is used as a metric to determine the best tuning parameters. The model's performance is also evaluated using Cohen's KAPPA metrics in the comparison of different algorithms.
