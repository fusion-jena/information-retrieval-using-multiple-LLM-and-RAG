Answer: 
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context discusses the initialization of the network models with pre-trained ImageNet weights, fine-tuning to the datasets, and the use of Bayesian optimization to find optimal hyperparameters. It also provides performance metrics for the UBD_45 and VP_200 datasets. However, it does not provide information on model deployment, such as model serialization or platform selection.
