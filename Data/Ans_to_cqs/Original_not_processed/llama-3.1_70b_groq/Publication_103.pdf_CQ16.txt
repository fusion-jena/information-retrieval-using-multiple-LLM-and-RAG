Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The text describes the methodology used for transferring knowledge from one dataset to another, including training the network from scratch on dataset A and then fine-tuning it on dataset B. However, it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine the completion of training.

The context does provide information on the network architecture and the results of the experiments, including top-1 and top-5 accuracy. However, it does not mention how the training process is stopped or what criteria are used to determine convergence.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete.
