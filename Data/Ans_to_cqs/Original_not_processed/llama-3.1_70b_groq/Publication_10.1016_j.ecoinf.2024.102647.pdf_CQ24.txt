Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, groundwater salinity, and machine learning models such as random forests and classification and regression trees. There is no mention of deep learning or random seed values. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide an answer to the query.
