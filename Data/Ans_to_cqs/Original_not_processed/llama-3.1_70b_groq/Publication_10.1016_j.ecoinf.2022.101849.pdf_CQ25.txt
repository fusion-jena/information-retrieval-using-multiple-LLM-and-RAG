Answer: 
The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. According to the text, Hengl et al. (2018) evaluate different machine learning methods, including neural networks, for Potential Natural Vegetation (PNV) mapping in a classification setting. This suggests that the deep learning model is being used for classification tasks, specifically to predict the expected state of mature vegetation given a particular set of environmental constraints.
