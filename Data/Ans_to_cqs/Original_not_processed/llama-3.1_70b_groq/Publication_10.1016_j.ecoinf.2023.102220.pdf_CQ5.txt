Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be discussing the implementation of various machine learning methods, including Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), for a specific task, possibly related to ecological informatics or pest monitoring. However, it does not provide information about the datasets used for training or testing these models. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
