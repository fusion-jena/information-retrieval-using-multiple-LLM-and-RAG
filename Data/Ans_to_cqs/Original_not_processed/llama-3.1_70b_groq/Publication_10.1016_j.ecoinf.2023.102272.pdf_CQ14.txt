Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the model selection procedure involves randomly generating 5 models for each of the four available deep-ANN architecture types and training each one with a small subset of the training data. The accuracy of candidate models is then compared using a left-out validation data set, and the model with the highest performance is selected for training on the full training data.

However, Table 3 provides the parameters tested and values for each classical machine learning model used and each test year. This suggests that the hyperparameters may have been tuned manually or using a specific set of values, but the exact method of optimization is not specified.

Therefore, I do not know the exact method of hyperparameter optimization used in this study, such as grid search or random search.
