Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the dataset curation, hyperparameter settings, and evaluation metrics for the weed detection models (YOLOX and YOLOv8). It does not provide information on the training process or the stopping criteria used.

However, it does mention the use of a learning rate schedule, specifically "Warm up + cosine decay", which suggests that the learning rate is adjusted during training. But it does not provide information on how the training process is terminated.

Therefore, I do not know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete.
