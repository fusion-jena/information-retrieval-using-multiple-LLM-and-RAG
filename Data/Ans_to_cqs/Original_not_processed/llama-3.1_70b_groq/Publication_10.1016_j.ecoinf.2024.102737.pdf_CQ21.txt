Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context appears to be focused on the experimental setup, data augmentation, feature extraction, and precision results of the models, but it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
