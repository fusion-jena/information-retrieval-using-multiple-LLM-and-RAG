Answer:::
The criteria used to determine when training is complete is based on the minimum total loss after a certain number of epochs. Specifically, the best model with transfer learning was chosen based on the minimum total loss after nine epochs, as seen in Fig. C.5. Additionally, the training is stopped when overfitting is observed, which is indicated by a higher difference between training and validation loss, and the validation loss starts to increase.
