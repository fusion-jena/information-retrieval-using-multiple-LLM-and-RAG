Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline's data is available. It mentions that the workflow is open-source and integrated with the DataMiner Cloud computing platform, but it does not provide information on where the data repository is hosted. The context does mention that the workflow is integrated with the D4Science e-Infrastructure and that data is indexed in the D4Science catalogue, but it does not provide information on external data repositories like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
