Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the performance of the models was evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1-score at different epochs and with varying amounts of training data.

The context mentions that the performance of the presented models in different epochs is reported in Fig. 8, which suggests that the model performance was monitored and evaluated at different stages of training. Additionally, the context states that the models were trained with different percentages of the dataset (50%, 80%, and 90%) and the performance was evaluated accordingly.

However, the specific strategy or technique used to monitor the model performance during training, such as validation sets, cross-validation, or learning rate schedules, is not mentioned in the provided context.
