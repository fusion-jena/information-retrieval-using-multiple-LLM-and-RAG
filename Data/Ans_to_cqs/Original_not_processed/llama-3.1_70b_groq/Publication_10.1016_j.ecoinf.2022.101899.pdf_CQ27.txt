Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the development and analysis of various models for wildfire event prediction, including the use of deep learning technology. It discusses the methodologies used, the results obtained, and the insights gained from the analysis. However, it does not provide information on the deployment process of the trained model, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
