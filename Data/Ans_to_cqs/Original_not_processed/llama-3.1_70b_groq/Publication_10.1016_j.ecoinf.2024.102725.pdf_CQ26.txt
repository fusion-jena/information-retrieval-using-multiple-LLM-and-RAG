Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) reconstruction, time-series analysis, and remote sensing applications.

However, I can provide some general information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. Stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling are indeed common techniques used to handle imbalanced datasets and reduce bias. Stratified splitting involves splitting the data into subsets based on the class labels, ensuring that each subset has a similar proportion of samples from each class. Oversampling involves creating additional copies of the minority class samples to balance the dataset, while undersampling involves reducing the number of majority class samples.

Diverse data collection is also an important aspect of reducing bias in machine learning models. Collecting data from diverse sources and ensuring that the data represents the population of interest can help reduce bias and improve model generalizability.

It's worth noting that the context does mention the use of deep learning techniques, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), for image synthesis and cloud removal. However, it does not specifically discuss techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing.
