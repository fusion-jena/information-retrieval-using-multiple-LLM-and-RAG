Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. The context appears to be related to land cover classification, ecology, and urban planning, with references to research papers on topics such as habitat suitability models, land cover classification, and urbanism. There is no mention of deep learning, regularization methods, or techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
