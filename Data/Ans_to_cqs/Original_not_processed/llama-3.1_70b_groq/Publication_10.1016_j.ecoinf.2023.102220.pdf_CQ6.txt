Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The text only mentions the architecture of the Deep Neural Network (DNN) and the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) method used, as well as the activation functions employed (ReLU and sigmoid). It also mentions the use of the TensorFlow and Scikit-learn libraries in Python for implementation, but it does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this case.
