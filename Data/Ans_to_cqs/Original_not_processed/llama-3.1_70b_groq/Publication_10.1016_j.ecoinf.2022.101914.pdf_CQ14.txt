Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that scale optimization for environmental covariates is performed using a moving window of radius equal to each scale to be tested, and then compares scales using t-tests (step d in Fig. 2). However, this is specific to the environmental covariates and does not provide information on the optimization of hyperparameters for the models themselves. Therefore, I don't know how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.
