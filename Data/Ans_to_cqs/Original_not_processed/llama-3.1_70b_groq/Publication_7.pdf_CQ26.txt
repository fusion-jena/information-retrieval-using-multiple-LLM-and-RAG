Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the weights of the deep network are fine-tuned using the Benthoz15 dataset, which consists of expert-annotated and geo-referenced marine images from Australian seas. This suggests that the dataset used for fine-tuning is curated and annotated, which may help to reduce bias.

Additionally, the context mentions that feature extraction is performed at different scales (28x28, 224x224, and 448x448) to ensure efficient encoding of coral species independently of their size. This may help to reduce bias related to object size, but it does not address other types of bias.

The context does not mention specific techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query based on the provided context.
