Answer: The text does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, based on the context, it appears to be a pixel-based deep learning segmentation architecture, as mentioned in the text. Additionally, the proposed model is referred to as "MU-Net" in Figure 6, which suggests that it may be a custom or modified version of a U-Net model, a type of convolutional neural network (CNN) commonly used for image segmentation tasks. However, without further information, it is not possible to confirm the exact type of model used.
