Answer: The text does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that the model was evaluated using "stratified 10-fold cross-validation". This suggests that the data was split into 10 folds, and the model was trained and evaluated on each fold, with 9 folds used for training and 1 fold used for testing. The text does not provide further details on how the data was split or what specific criteria were used.
