Answer:

Based on the provided context, I don't see any specific techniques mentioned for addressing data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be discussing a different topic, such as modifying an update criterion, applying machine learning, and optimizing the scope of a model.

However, I do see a mention of "stratified sampling" in the context, which is a technique used to reduce variance in estimators. But it's not explicitly mentioned as a technique for addressing data bias during preprocessing.

The other techniques mentioned in the query, such as oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I don't have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
