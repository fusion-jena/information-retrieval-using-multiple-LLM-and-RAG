Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention anything about monitoring model performance during training. It appears to be focused on research progress in plantation fuel characteristics and management, fire severity, combustion efficiency, and calculating processing for a time series dataset in mainland China. There is no mention of model training or performance monitoring.
