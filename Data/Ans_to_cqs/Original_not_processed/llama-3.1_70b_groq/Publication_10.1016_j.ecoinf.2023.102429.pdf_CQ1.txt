Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of spectrometers for collecting spectral reflectance data from soil samples. Specifically, it mentions that "The number of spectral bars saved for each sample was 15, and the average value was taken as the spectral reflectance of the soil samples." This suggests that spectrometers are used to collect spectral data from soil samples.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of Vis-NIR spectral data, which implies that visible and near-infrared spectroscopy is used to collect data. However, it does not provide information on whether surveys, public datasets, or other methods are used to collect raw data.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that spectrometers and Vis-NIR spectroscopy are used to collect spectral data from soil samples, but it is not clear what other methods may be used to collect raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
