Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of the fast.ai platform, ResNet-34 architecture, and transfer learning, but it does not specify the regularization techniques employed.

However, it is worth noting that the ResNet-34 architecture, which is a variant of the ResNet family, typically uses techniques such as batch normalization and weight decay (L2 regularization) to prevent overfitting. Additionally, dropout is a common regularization technique used in many deep learning models, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, while we can make an educated guess about the potential regularization methods used, we cannot provide a definitive answer based on the provided context.
