Answer: The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a random search approach, specifically through an AutoML procedure. The procedure starts by generating a set of candidate models with architectures and hyperparameters selected at random from a prespecified range of values. Each candidate model is trained using a small subset of the data during a small number of epochs, and then the performance of the candidate models is compared using a left-out validation data set. The selected candidate model is then trained on the full training data. This approach allows for the automatic optimization of hyperparameters without requiring manual tuning or a grid search.
