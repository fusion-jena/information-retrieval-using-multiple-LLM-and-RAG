Answer: 

The provided context does not mention the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to remote sensing and satellite image processing, with references to Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 data, as well as various research papers on topics such as land use classification, crop mapping, and glacier segmentation.

The context does mention different batches of data, including visible bands of Sentinel-2 data, multispectral (MS) bands, spectral indices, textural features, and Sentinel-1 bands, but it does not mention any of the commonly used deep learning datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the answer to the query about the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline.
