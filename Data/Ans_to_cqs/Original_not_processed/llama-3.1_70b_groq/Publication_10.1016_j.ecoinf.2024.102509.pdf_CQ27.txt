Unfortunately, the provided context does not provide information on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context appears to be a collection of academic references and snippets discussing the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in ecological informatics, but it does not provide details on model deployment.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
