Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a list of references and citations related to various topics such as ecology, remote sensing, and geographic information systems.

However, I can try to provide some general information on common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. Data annotation is a crucial step in preparing data for deep learning models, and various techniques are used depending on the specific task and dataset.

Some common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include:

* Bounding box annotation: This involves drawing a bounding box around objects of interest in an image.
* Instance segmentation: This involves segmenting individual objects of interest in an image and assigning a unique label to each instance.
* Semantic segmentation: This involves assigning a label to each pixel in an image, where each label corresponds to a specific class or category.
* Classification: This involves assigning a label to an entire image or a region of interest.

It's worth noting that the specific data annotation technique used can significantly impact the performance of the deep learning model. However, without more information on the specific dataset and task, it's difficult to provide more specific guidance on the data annotation techniques used.

In the context of the provided references, Petrovska et al. (2020) mention the use of deep learning for feature extraction in remote sensing, but they do not provide details on the data annotation techniques used. Similarly, Mohedano et al. (2017) discuss object retrieval with deep convolutional networks, but they do not provide information on the data annotation techniques used.

In summary, while I can provide some general information on common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query based on the provided context.
