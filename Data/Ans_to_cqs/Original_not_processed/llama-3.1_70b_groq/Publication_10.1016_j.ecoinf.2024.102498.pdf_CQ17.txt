Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context only discusses the hyperparameters set for each machine learning model (CART, RF, GTB, and SVM) and mentions that combining differently weighted trees in GTB and RF can prevent overfitting. However, it does not provide information on the specific regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline.
