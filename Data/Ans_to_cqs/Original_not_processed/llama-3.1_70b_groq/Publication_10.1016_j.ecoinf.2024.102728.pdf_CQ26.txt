Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention a paper by Cohen and Shashua (2017) titled "Inductive bias of Deep Convolutional Networks through Pooling Geometry", which suggests that the authors may have explored the concept of inductive bias in deep learning models.

Additionally, the context mentions a paper by Mohedano et al. (2017) titled "Object retrieval with deep convolutional", which may imply that the authors used deep learning techniques for object retrieval tasks. However, it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias.

The context also mentions various other papers and sources related to ecology, archaeology, and land cover classification, but none of them appear to be directly related to addressing data bias in deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
