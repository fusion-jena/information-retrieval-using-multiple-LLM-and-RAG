Answer:

The postprocessing steps involved after the model training include the following:

1. Binarization of the results: The output of the model is binarized to separate the sky from other objects.
2. Extraction of the classes below the sky: The classes below the sky are extracted from the binarized output.
3. Extraction of the skyline: The skyline is extracted from the output.
4. Filter images that have natural objects below the sky: Images that have natural objects below the sky are filtered out.
5. Selection of reference points from the photo and association to the classified object: Reference points are selected from the photo and associated with the classified object.
6. Extraction of distances: Distances are extracted from the orthophotos.
7. Creation of metrics per class object: Metrics are created for each class object, including:
	* Normalized Segment Length
	* Sample variance
	* Average absolute deviation
8. Extraction of metrics: Metrics are extracted from the topographic maps.

Note that the context does not mention Saliency maps or Confusion matrix as part of the postprocessing steps.
