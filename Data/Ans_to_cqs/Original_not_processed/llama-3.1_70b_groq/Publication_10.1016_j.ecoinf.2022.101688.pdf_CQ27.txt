Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the training process, model architecture, and experimental setup, but it does not provide information on model deployment.

The context mentions that the models were trained on Microsoft Azure using the Data Science Virtual Machine and a NCv2-series virtual machine (NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU), but it does not discuss how the trained models were deployed or serialized. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.

If you have any further context or clarification regarding the deployment process, I would be happy to try and assist you.
