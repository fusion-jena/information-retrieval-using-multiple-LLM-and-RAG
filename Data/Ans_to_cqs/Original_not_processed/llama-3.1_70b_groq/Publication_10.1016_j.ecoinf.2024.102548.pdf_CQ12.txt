Answer:::
The text mentions several deep learning models, all of which are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Specifically, the models mentioned are:

* ResNet-50
* InceptionV3
* InceptionResNetV2
* EfficientNet
* VGG-19

All of these models are variants of CNNs, which are a type of neural network designed for image classification tasks. There is no mention of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers in the provided text.
