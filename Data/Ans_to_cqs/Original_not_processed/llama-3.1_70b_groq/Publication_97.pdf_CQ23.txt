Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as cross-validation or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the training images were generated randomly on the fly from source images, and that augmentation was applied. This suggests that the model was trained on a diverse set of images, which can help improve its generalizability.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model was trained on randomly cropped source images of 256 Ã— 256 resolution, which can help the model learn to recognize patterns at different scales and orientations. However, it is not clear if this was done in a way that ensures the model is exposed to a representative sample of the data.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions that the model was evaluated on the ImageNet-2012 dataset, which is a large and diverse dataset. However, it is not clear if this was done as part of a cross-validation or stratified splitting approach.

Overall, while the context suggests that some measures were taken to improve the generalizability of the model, it is not clear what specific measures were taken or how effective they were.
