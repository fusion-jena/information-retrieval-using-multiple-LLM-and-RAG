Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the primary data format used is images, specifically satellite images. This is evident from the various references to satellite image classification, remote sensing images, and the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and autoencoders (AEs) for image processing and classification.

There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the pipeline. Additionally, while CSV (Comma Separated Values) files are commonly used for storing and processing data, there is no explicit mention of CSV files being used in the context of the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, based on the available information, it can be concluded that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images, specifically satellite images.
