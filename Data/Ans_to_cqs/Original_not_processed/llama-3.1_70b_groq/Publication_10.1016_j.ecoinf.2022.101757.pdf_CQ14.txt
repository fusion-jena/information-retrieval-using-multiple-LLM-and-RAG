Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses the results of the model, including the R2 values and the dependency of certain metrics on distance, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
