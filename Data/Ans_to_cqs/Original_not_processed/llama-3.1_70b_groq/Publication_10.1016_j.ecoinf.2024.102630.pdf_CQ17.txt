Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. The context appears to be related to remote sensing and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) products, with references to research papers on topics such as cloud cover, land cover classification, and vegetation coverage response to climatic factors. There is no mention of deep learning or regularization methods. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
