Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention a strategy for monitoring model performance during training. The text primarily discusses the use of clustering methods to identify freshness classes and the evaluation of clustering results using internal methods such as Silhouette and Calinski-Harabasz. It also mentions the Elbow method, but only in the context of identifying the optimal number of clusters, not for monitoring model performance during training. Therefore, I don't know the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training.
