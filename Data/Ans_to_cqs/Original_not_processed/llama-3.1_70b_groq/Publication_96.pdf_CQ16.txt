Answer: 
The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. It only mentions the parameters defined for the training phase, including the learning rate (0.001), batch size (1,000), and number of interactions (7,000). However, it does not provide information on how the training process is stopped or what criteria are used to determine convergence.
