Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on the quantitative comparison of the model's performance on different datasets using various metrics such as UIQM, UCIQE, and NIQE. It also discusses the loss functions used in the model, including adversarial loss, L1 loss, and perceptual loss, but does not provide information on how the model's performance is monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
