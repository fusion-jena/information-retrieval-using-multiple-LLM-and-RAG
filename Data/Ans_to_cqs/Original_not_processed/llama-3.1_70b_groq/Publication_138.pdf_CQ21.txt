After the model training, the postprocessing steps involved are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, based on the given information about the model architecture, we can infer some of the steps that might be involved.

The model architecture consists of multiple layers, including convolutional and pooling layers, inception modules, and dropout layers. After training the model, the following steps might be involved:

1. Saliency calculation: This step is not explicitly mentioned,, but based on the model architecture, it's possible that sal calculation is performed to determine the the model's performance on the validation set.

2. Metrics calculation: This step is not explicitly mentioned, but it's likely that metrics such as the the model's performance on the validation set are calculated.

3. Confidence calculation: This step is not explicitly mentioned, but based on the model architecture, it's possible that that confidence calculation are calculated to evaluate the model's performance.

4. Confusion matrix calculation: This step is not explicitly mentioned, but based on the model architecture, it's possible that the confusion matrix is updated to reflect changes the model's weights and biases.

Note that these steps are speculative and based on the provided context. The actual postprocessing steps involved after model training are not explicitly mentioned.
