Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily discusses the setup and evaluation of species distribution models (SDMs) using various machine learning algorithms, but it does not provide information on data splitting criteria. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
