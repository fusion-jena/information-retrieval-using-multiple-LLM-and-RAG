Answer:::
The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are Precision, Recall, and F1 score. These metrics are used to measure the model's detection performance. 

Precision is a measure of how accurate the model is at making positive predictions, i.e., objects detected by the model. Recall accounts for false negatives, i.e., objects not detected, and is thereby a measure of how much is detected out of what should have been detected. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.

Additionally, the model is also evaluated using the Generalized Intersection over Union (GIoU) and mean Average Precision (mAP) metrics. The GIoU is steadily decreasing, indicating that the model is becoming better at correctly locating targets. The mAP score is seen to follow the F1 score closely, indicating the model's overall detection performance.

These metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance, allowing for a better understanding of its strengths and weaknesses.
