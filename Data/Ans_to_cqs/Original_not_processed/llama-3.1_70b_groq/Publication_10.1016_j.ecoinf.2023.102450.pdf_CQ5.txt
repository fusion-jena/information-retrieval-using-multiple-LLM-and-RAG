Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to a specific research paper on animal tracking and behavior analysis, and it mentions a custom dataset used for the study, but it does not provide information on the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
