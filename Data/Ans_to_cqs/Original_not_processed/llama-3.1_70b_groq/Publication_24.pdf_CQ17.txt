Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the application of different normalization strategies, but it does not specify the regularization methods employed. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
