Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the models were trained using a training set (80% of the data) and tested on a separate test set (20% of the data) to assess their ability to generalize to new, unseen data accurately. This suggests that the model performance was evaluated using metrics such as MSE, MAE, and r2 on the test set. Additionally, the Optuna grid search was used to identify the optimal set of hyperparameters by minimizing the MSE.
