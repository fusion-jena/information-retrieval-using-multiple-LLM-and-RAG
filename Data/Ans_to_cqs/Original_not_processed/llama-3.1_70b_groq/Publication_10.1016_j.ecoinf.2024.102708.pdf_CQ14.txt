Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the performance of different models (FRCNN, TPH-YOLOv5, YOLOv5s, YOLOv5m) on detecting Pacific oysters, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
