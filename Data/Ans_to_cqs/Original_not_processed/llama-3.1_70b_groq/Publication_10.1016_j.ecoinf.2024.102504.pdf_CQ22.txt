Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The context appears to be a collection of references and data statistics related to air quality and pollution, but it does not provide information on the performance metrics used to evaluate a deep learning model.

However, I can suggest that common metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, mean squared error, and mean absolute error, among others. But without more specific information, I cannot determine which specific metrics are used in this case.

Therefore, I must conclude that I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
