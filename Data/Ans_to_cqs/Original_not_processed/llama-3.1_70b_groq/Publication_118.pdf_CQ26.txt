Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the network architecture, data pre-processing, and training of an auto-encoder for ecoacoustic analysis. It discusses the use of a modified version of an existing architecture, the choice of activation function, and the comparison of different feature representations.

However, it does mention that the research design is outlined in Fig. 2, but the figure is not provided in the context. It also mentions that the proportion of non-silent audio clips is considered, but it does not elaborate on how this is addressed.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing.
