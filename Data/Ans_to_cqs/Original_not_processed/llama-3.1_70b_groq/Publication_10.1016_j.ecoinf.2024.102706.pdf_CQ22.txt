Answer:

The provided context does not specifically mention a deep learning model, but rather various machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Light Gradient Boosting Machine. However, it does provide information on the metrics used to evaluate the performance of these models.

According to the context, the performance metrics used to evaluate the models are:

1. R2 (coefficient of determination)
2. RMSE (root mean squared error)
3. rRMSE (relative root mean squared error, expressed as a percentage)
4. MAE (mean absolute error)

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the models on both the training and testing datasets. The context also mentions that a 5-fold cross-validation grid search strategy was implemented to tune hyperparameters within the training dataset for all machine learning models.

It's worth noting that the context does not mention accuracy, precision, or recall as performance metrics, which are commonly used in classification problems. The metrics mentioned in the context are more commonly used in regression problems, which suggests that the models are being used for a regression task, such as predicting canopy cover.
