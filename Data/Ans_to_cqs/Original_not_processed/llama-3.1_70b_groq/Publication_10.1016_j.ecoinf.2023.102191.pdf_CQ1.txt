Answer:::

The provided context does not specifically mention the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does describe a citizen science initiative that uses a mobile app to collect data on marine taxa. The app is used to conduct post-dive interviews with recreational SCUBA divers, and it collects metadata on location, number of dives, and number of divers. The app also has a custom species list that allows users to report sightings of specific marine taxa.

Additionally, the context mentions that a question-based survey was conducted to assess the opinion of users on the app's usability and potential value for the diving community/industry. However, it does not provide information on the use of sensors or public datasets for collecting raw data.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the methods used for collecting raw data in this initiative appear to be:

* Post-dive interviews with recreational SCUBA divers using a mobile app
* Surveys to assess user opinion on the app's usability and potential value

It is not clear if sensors or public datasets are used in this initiative, as this information is not provided in the context.
