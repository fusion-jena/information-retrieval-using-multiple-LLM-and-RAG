Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily discusses various applications of deep learning and machine learning methods in image analysis, network data examination, and biological processes, but it does not delve into the details of the optimization techniques used.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of deep learning-based models for tasks such as image classification and network analysis, which often employ optimization techniques like SGD or Adam. Nevertheless, without explicit mention of these techniques in the provided context, it is impossible to provide a definitive answer to the query.
