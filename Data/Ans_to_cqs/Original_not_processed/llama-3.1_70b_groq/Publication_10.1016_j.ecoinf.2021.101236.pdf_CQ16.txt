Answer:

According to the provided context, the criteria used to determine when training is complete is based on the validation loss. Specifically, the training is stopped when the validation loss stalls, and this is implemented through an early stopping mechanism with a cooldown of 3 epochs. This means that if the validation loss does not improve for 3 consecutive epochs, the training is stopped to prevent overfitting.
