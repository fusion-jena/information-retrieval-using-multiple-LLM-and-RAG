Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. It mentions that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can choose the features that discriminate different classes in datasets without being specified a priori, but it does not provide information on specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, I do not know the specific data augmentation techniques applied in this pipeline.
