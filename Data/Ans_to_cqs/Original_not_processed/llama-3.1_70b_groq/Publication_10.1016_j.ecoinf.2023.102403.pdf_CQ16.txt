Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be related to data curation and filtering of occurrence data from GBIF and OBIS, but it does not provide information on training or validation loss.

The context includes tables with various data, including numbers and percentages, but it does not provide any information on the criteria used to determine when training is complete. It is possible that the context is related to a specific research paper or study, but without more information, it is not possible to determine the criteria used to determine when training is complete.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
