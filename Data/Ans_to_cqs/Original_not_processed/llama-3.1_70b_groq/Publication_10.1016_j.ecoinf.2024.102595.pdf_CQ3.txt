Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The text primarily focuses on the importance of oil palm yield prediction, the role of machine learning and deep learning in predicting crop yields, and the methodology used in the study, including data preprocessing, model training, and testing. It does not delve into the specifics of data annotation techniques employed in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this question.
