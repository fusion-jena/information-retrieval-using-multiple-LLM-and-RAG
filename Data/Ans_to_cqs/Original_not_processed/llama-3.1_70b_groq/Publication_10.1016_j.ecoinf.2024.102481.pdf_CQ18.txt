Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of Out-Of-Bag (OOB) error. This involves training the model on bootstrapped data, with the excluded portion at each iteration serving as validation data for calculating generalisation error. This error measure is used for tuning two hyper-parameters: the number of covariates randomly selected prior to the growing of each tree (mtry) and the number of trees (ntree) combined for the forest.
