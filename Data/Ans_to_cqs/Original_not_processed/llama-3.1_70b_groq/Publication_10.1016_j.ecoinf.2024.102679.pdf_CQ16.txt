Answer:::
The text does not explicitly state the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that the model was selected relative to the epoch that gave the best performance on the validation set, suggesting that the validation set was used to monitor the model's performance during training. Additionally, the text mentions that the training procedure consisted of a fixed number of epochs (200 epochs for the first step and 50 epochs for the second step), but it does not provide information on whether the training was stopped based on a specific criterion such as a validation loss plateau.
