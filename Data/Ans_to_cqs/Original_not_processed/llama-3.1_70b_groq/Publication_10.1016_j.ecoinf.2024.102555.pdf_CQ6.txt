Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to research papers on topics such as flood susceptibility mapping, dry-wet variations, burned area mapping, and vegetation cover. While these papers may involve deep learning models, the specific preprocessing steps used are not mentioned.

However, I can provide some general information on common preprocessing steps involved in training deep learning models. These may include:

* Normalization: scaling numeric data to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model.
* Scaling: transforming data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, which can help improve model performance.
* Cleaning: handling missing or erroneous data, such as removing or imputing missing values.
* Feature engineering: creating new features from existing ones to improve model performance.
* Data augmentation: artificially increasing the size of the training dataset by applying transformations to existing data.

Please note that these are general preprocessing steps, and the specific steps used may vary depending on the problem, dataset, and model architecture. Without more information, I cannot provide a more detailed answer.
