Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions that a neural network was trained using datasets, but it does not specify how these datasets were collected. It mentions the use of satellite images and remote sensing Earth observation data, but it does not provide further details on the data collection process.

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the datasets used for training the neural network likely consist of satellite imagery data, which is a common source of data for land use and land cover (LULC) classification tasks. The context also mentions the use of raster bands stack, which suggests that the data may have been collected through remote sensing technologies such as multispectral or hyperspectral imaging.

Overall, while the context provides some hints about the type of data used, it does not provide explicit information on the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
