Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context only mentions the use of a python implementation of the XGBoostClassifier, but it does not provide any information about the hyperparameters used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
