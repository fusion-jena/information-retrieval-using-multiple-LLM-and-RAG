Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on species distribution modeling (SDMs) and discusses the effects of resampling techniques, such as bootstrapping, on model performance. It also mentions the importance of data structure and the use of algorithms like Random Forest and Generalised Linear Model.

However, it does not provide information on preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning, which are commonly used in deep learning. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
