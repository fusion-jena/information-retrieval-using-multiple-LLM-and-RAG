Answer:::
 
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context of ecological prediction and forest disturbance, it can be inferred that the data formats might include spatial data such as satellite images or raster data, as well as tabular data such as CSV files containing information about forest characteristics, climate, and other environmental factors.

The context mentions the use of bark beetle outbreaks in conifer-dominated forests as an example, which suggests that the data might include spatial information about forest cover, vegetation health, and other environmental factors. However, without more specific information, it is difficult to determine the exact data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of code and data in a reproducible example, which suggests that the data formats might be compatible with programming languages such as Python or R, and might include formats such as CSV, JSON, or GeoTIFF. However, this is purely speculative, and more information would be needed to determine the exact data formats used.
