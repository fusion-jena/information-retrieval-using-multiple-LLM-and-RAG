Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. It only discusses the use of a pre-trained ResNet-50 CNN model for feature extraction, but does not provide information on the underlying framework used to implement the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
