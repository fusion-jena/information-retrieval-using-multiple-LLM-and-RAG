Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the development and improvement of deep learning models for bird acoustic recognition, such as the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and attention mechanisms.

However, it does mention the use of benchmark datasets, such as BirdCLEF2018-Small (BC-S), BirdCLEF2018-Large (BC-L), Lishui-Zhejiang Birdsdata (LS), and Lishui-Zhejiang Birdsdata (LS*), which suggests that the raw data may be collected from existing datasets or databases. Additionally, the context mentions that the recordings were captured in various locations, including Europe, America, and China, but it does not provide information on the specific methods used for collecting these recordings.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to determine the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
