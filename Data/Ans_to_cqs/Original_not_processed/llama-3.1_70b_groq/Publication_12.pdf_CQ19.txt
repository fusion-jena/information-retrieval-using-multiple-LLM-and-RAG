Answer:::
Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific deep learning framework used to build the model. However, it does mention that the model was trained using a Graphic Processing Unit (GPU, Nvidia 1080ti, US) and that the model was implemented in Python, as evidenced by the citation of Scikit-learn: machine learning in python. But it does not provide enough information to determine the specific framework used.
