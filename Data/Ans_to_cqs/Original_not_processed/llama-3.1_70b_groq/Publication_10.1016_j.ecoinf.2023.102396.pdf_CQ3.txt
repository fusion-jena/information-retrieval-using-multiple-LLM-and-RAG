Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a research article on ecological informatics, specifically on feature-based and shape-match classifications of animal population time series. It mentions various statistical and machine learning techniques, such as dynamic time warping, hierarchical clustering, and state space models, but does not discuss data annotation techniques. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide an answer to the query.
