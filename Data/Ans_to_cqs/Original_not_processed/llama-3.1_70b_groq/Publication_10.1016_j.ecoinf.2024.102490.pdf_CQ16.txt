Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context only mentions that 80% of the data was used as the training set and the remaining 20% was used as the evaluation set to assess model performance. It also mentions the use of metrics such as AUC and TSS to evaluate model accuracy, but it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
