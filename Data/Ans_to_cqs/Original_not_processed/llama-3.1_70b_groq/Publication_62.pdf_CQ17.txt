Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided in the supplementary materials and the tables describing the constitutive layers of the CNNs, we can see that one of the layers is a "DropoutLayer". This suggests that dropout is one of the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. 

There is no mention of L2 regularization in the provided context.
