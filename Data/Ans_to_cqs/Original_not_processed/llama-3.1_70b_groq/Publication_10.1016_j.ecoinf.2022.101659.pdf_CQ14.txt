Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the optimization of hyperparameters or the use of specific methods such as grid search or random search. The text appears to focus on the analysis of valve gaping data in bivalves, the use of empirical laboratory experiments, and the potential applications of big-data in aquaculture decision making. It does mention that data analysis was conducted in R 4.0.5, but it does not provide information on the optimization of hyperparameters.
