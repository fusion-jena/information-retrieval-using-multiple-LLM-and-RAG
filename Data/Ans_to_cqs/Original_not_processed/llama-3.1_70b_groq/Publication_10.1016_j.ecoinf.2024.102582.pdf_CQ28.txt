Answer: Google Cloud platform.

The text mentions that the GEE (Google Earth Engine) platform was used for image processing and analysis. It also mentions that the GEE cloud platform has superior storage and computing capabilities, and has been widely used for various applications such as mangrove extraction, aquaculture ponds, and intertidal zones. Additionally, it mentions that the processing and analysis of multi-scale geographic and remote sensing data based on the GEE cloud platform is anticipated to become a powerful tool for geo-related research. Therefore, it can be inferred that the Google Cloud platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
