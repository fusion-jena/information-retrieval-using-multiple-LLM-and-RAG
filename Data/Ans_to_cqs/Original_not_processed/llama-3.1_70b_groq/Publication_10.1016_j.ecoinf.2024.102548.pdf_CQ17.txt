Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the model architecture, including the use of RNNs, transfer learning, and pre-trained models like ResNet-50, InceptionV3, and InceptionResNetV2. It also discusses the fine-tuning process and the importance of model parameters, but it does not provide information on regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I do not know the specific regularization methods used in this deep learning pipeline.
