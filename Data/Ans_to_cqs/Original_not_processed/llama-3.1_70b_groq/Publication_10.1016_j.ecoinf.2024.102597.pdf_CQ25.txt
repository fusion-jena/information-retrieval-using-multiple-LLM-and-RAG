Answer: 
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly state the purpose of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that deep learning algorithms were considered for water quality parameter (WQP) inversion, but the limited number of samples was not conducive to deep learning. This suggests that the deep learning model might be used for regression or estimation tasks, such as predicting Chla concentrations in lakes. However, without more specific information, it is difficult to determine the exact purpose of the deep learning model.
