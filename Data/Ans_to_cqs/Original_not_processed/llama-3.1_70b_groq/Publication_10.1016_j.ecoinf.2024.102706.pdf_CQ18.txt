Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the performance of the models is evaluated using various metrics such as R2, RMSE, rRMSE, and MAE. The context mentions that the performance of the models is presented in Table 6, which suggests that the model performance is evaluated and compared using these metrics. Additionally, the context mentions that the models are trained and tested on separate datasets, which implies that the model performance is monitored during training using techniques such as cross-validation or holdout method. However, the specific strategy implemented is not clearly stated.
