Answer:::

I don't know. The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to land cover classification, ecology, and environmental science, with references to research papers and datasets. There is no mention of deep learning or data annotation techniques.
