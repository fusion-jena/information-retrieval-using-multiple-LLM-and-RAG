Answer::: 

Unfortunately, the provided pieces of context do not mention the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a collection of academic references and a research paper discussing the application of deep learning methods in biological networks, specifically for fish classification using DNA barcode sequences. However, it does not provide any information about the code repository link.
