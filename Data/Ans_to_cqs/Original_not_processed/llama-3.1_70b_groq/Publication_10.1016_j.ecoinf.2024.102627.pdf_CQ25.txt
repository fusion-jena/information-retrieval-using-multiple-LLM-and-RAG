Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is to predict species assemblages worldwide, specifically to return likely sets of species that are present in a given location. This is achieved through a set-valued prediction approach, where the model is trained on presence-only data and outputs categorical probabilities associated with each species. The model is then used to predict a set of labels by thresholding these probabilities. In other words, the model is used for classification, but with a twist: instead of predicting a single label, it predicts a set of labels (i.e., a set of species) that are likely to be present in a given location.
