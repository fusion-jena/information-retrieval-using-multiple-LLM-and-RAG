Answer: I don't know. The provided context does not mention any specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to a study on the spectral characteristics of dissolved organic matter in Plateau Lakes and the use of a three-layer back propagation (BP) artificial neural network in MATLAB R2014b for predicting the Trophic State Index (TSI).
