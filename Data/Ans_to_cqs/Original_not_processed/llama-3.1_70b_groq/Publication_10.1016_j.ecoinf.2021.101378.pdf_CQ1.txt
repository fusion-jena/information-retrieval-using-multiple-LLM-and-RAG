Answer: The provided context does not specifically mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that digital maps were used to extract values for the dataset, and the geographic information system (GIS) program (ArcGIS 10.1; ESRI) was used to extract these values. Additionally, it mentions that digital maps for elevation and slope were obtained from the National Geographic Information Institute of Korea. 

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the methods utilized for collecting raw data in this study likely involved the use of digital maps and GIS programs. However, it does not provide information on the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
