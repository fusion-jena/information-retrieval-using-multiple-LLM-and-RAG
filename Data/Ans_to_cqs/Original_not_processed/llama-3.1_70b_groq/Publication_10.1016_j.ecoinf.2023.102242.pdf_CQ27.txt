Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It only discusses the challenges of processing high-resolution remote sensing data, the importance of representative and sufficient training samples, and the use of feature optimization tools to refine the classification process. It does not provide information on model deployment.
