Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to remote sensing and land use/land cover (LULC) classification, and it discusses topics such as spectral indices, dataset collection, and sampling strategies. However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline.
