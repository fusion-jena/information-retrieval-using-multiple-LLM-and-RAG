Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context appears to focus on the application of deep learning to wildfire response of forest species from multispectral LiDAR data, and discusses the methodology, results, and discussion of the study. It does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline.
