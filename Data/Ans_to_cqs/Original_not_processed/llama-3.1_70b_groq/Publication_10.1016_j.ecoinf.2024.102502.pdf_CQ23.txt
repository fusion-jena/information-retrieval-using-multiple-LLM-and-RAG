Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context appears to be focused on data processing and scaling for environmental time series data, and does not discuss the development or evaluation of a deep learning model. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
