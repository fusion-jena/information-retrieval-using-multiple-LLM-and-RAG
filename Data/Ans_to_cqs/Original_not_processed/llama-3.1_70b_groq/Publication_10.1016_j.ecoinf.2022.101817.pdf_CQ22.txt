Answer:

The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics, including:

1. Precision: calculated as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives, expressed as a percentage.
2. Recall: calculated as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives, expressed as a percentage.
3. F1 score: the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of both metrics.
4. Accuracy: not explicitly defined in the provided context, but commonly refers to the proportion of correctly classified instances out of all instances.
5. Sensitivity: also known as true positive rate, measures the proportion of true positives among all actual positive instances.
6. Specificity: measures the proportion of true negatives among all actual negative instances.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the five CNN models, with the results shown in Table 4. The best-performing model, Model 4, is selected based on its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
