Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the primary data format used is images. This is evident from the mention of tasks such as image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection, which are typical applications of deep learning in computer vision. The context also mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are commonly used for image processing tasks. 

There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats in the provided context. Therefore, it is not possible to confirm whether these formats are used in the deep learning pipeline.
