Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the use of deep learning for wildfire event predictions in Australia, the development of an algorithm to collect data automatically, and the analysis of different optimizer models. However, it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
