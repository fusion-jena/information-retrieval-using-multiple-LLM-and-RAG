Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It mentions the use of machine learning algorithms such as support vector machines (SVMs), random forests (RFs), decision trees (DTs), and artificial neural networks (ANNs) in land use and land cover (LULC) mapping, but it does not provide information about the specific architecture of the neural network used. Therefore, I cannot determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
