Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of deep learning models such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. The context appears to be discussing the use of machine learning algorithms such as k-nearest neighbors (knn), k-means, and lasso regularization, as well as mixture modeling and semi-supervised learning. However, it does not provide information on the use of deep learning models.
