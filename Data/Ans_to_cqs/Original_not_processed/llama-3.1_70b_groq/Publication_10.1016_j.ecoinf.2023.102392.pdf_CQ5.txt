Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to focus on the application of deep learning models, particularly XGBoost, to object recognition, forest-type categorization, and land use/land cover classification using remote sensing data.

The context mentions the use of images collected by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and SPOT satellite equipment, but it does not provide information on specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
