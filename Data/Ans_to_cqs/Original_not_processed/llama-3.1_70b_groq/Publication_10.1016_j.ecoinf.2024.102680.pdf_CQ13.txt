Answer:

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning models mentioned in the context are detailed in Table 2. According to the table, the hyperparameters used for different object detection algorithms are as follows:

* Optimizer: SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) and AdamW (Adaptive Moment Estimation Weight Decay)
* Learning rate: Not specified in the provided context, but it is mentioned that the hyperparameter settings of different object detection algorithms are detailed in Table 2.

Additionally, the context mentions that the networks were trained using the default parameters preset in the MMDetection framework until the algorithms fully converged. This suggests that the hyperparameters were not manually tuned, but rather used the default values provided by the framework.

It is worth noting that the context does not provide a comprehensive list of hyperparameters used in the deep learning models, and the learning rate is not specified. Therefore, the answer is based on the limited information provided in the context.
