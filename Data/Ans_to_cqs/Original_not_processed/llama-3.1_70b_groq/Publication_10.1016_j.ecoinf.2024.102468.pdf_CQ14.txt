Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the initialization of the B parameters using a sequential combination of the k-means clustering algorithm and the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search.
