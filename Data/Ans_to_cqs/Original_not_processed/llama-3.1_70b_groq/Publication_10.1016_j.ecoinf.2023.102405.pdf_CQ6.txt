Answer:::

According to the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include data cleansing, where incomplete or inaccurate records are identified and removed to ensure the dataset's accuracy. This is mentioned in the section on data pre-processing, which states that "a significant aspect of our pre-processing involved data cleansing, where we diligently identified and removed any incomplete or inaccurate records to ensure the dataset's accuracy."

However, the context does not provide information on other preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or feature engineering. It only mentions data cleansing as a crucial step in ensuring the reliability and integrity of the data.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the answer to the query is that data cleansing is a preprocessing step involved before training a deep learning model, but other steps such as normalization and scaling are not mentioned.
