Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention "Model Validation" and "Model prediction & deployment" as part of the overall process, but it does not provide details on the specific postprocessing steps.

It mentions the use of metrics such as "Mae" (Mean Absolute Error) in Table 2, which suggests that some form of metrics calculation is involved in the model validation process. However, it does not provide information on other postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps or Confusion matrix.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I can only confirm that metrics calculation is involved in the model validation process, but I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer on the postprocessing steps involved after the model training.
