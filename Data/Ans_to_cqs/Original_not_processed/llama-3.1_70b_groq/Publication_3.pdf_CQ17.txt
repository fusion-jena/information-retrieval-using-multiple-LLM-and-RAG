Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the use of TensorFlow, a deep learning platform, for image classification tasks and pattern recognition, particularly in the context of species identification. It discusses the architecture of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the use of Transfer Learning, but it does not provide information on regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization.
