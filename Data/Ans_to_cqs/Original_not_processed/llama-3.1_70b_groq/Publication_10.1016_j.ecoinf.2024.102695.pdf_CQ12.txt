Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Transformer-based architecture. This is mentioned in the context as "a Transformer-based architecture is used in this study to mitigate the risk of gradient issues during training." Additionally, the context provides details about the Transformer model's architecture, including the encoder and decoder layers, multi-head self-attention mechanism, and positional encoding scheme.
