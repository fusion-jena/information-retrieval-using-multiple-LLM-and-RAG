Answer: The optimization technique applied in the deep learning pipeline is the Adam optimizer, as mentioned in the text: "Our training setup includes the Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2015) with a concatenating cosine-annealing linear scheduler with an initial learning rate of 0.0001, decaying by a factor of 0.001â‹…learning rate, and a batch size of 32." There is no mention of SGD being used in the pipeline.
