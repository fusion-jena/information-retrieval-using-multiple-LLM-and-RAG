Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that "Training persisted for 120 epochs" and that the learning rate was adjusted using the StepLR strategy, halving the original rate every 10 epochs of iteration. This suggests that the training process was set to run for a fixed number of epochs, rather than being stopped based on a specific criterion such as validation loss plateau.
