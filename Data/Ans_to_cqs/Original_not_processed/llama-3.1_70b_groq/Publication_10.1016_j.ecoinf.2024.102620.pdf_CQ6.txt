Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a land use model called PLUS, which uses a random forest algorithm and cellular automata to simulate land use changes. It does not discuss deep learning models or their preprocessing steps.

However, I can tell you that the context does mention the use of land use data and meteorological data, but it does not provide information on how these data are preprocessed before being used in the model.

If you're looking for information on preprocessing steps for deep learning models, I'd be happy to provide general information on common preprocessing techniques such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning. But based on the provided context, I don't have specific information on the preprocessing steps used in this particular model.
