Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on species distribution modeling, bioclimatic variables, and dimensionality reduction methods, particularly UMAP. It mentions a study by Deneu et al. (2022) that used a convolutional neural network to model species distribution, but it does not provide information on the specific datasets used in that study.
