Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on object detection algorithms, such as Faster R-CNN and EfficientDet, and discusses various fusion approaches for combining feature maps. It also touches on the importance of feature engineering in machine learning and deep learning.

However, it does mention that the feature maps produced by the CNN are "cropped upon the object proposal" and that an RoI pooling layer is applied to extract a fixed-length vector. This suggests that some form of preprocessing or feature extraction is taking place, but the specific steps involved are not detailed.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query about preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model.
