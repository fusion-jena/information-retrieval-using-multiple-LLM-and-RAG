Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and components of the model, including the Transformer, self-attention mechanism, and multiscale attention. It also discusses the application of the model to predicting multivariate marine chemical data and mentions related studies. However, it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
