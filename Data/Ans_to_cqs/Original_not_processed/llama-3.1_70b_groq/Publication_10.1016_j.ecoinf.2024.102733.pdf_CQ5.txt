Answer: 
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be discussing the architecture and training of a deep learning model, specifically an Autoencoder and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), for a classification task involving fish events. However, it does not provide information about the dataset used for training and testing the model. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
