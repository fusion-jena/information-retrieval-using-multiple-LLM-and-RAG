Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context appears to focus on the development and validation of a FIS-based model for mapping suitable areas for beekeeping, using expert data from literature and field surveys. It discusses the rules for the Apis-FIS subsystem, the use of the fuzzy logic toolbox in Matlab, and the validation of the model. However, it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
