Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that the model performance is evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation, and the metrics used for evaluation are RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and R2. This suggests that the model is trained and evaluated multiple times, with the performance metrics being monitored, but the specific criteria for determining when training is complete are not specified.
