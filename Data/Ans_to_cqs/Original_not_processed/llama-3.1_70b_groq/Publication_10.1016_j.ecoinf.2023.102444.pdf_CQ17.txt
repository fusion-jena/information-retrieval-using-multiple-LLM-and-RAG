Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. The context primarily discusses dimensionality reduction methods, species distribution modeling, and the application of UMAP to estimate species distribution based on bioclimatic variables. It does mention the use of convolutional neural networks in another study, but it does not provide information on the regularization methods used in that study.
