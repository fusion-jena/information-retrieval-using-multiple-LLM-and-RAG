Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly state the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does provide information on the number of images used for training, validation, and out-of-sample testing, as well as the number of new images selected for model retraining.

From Table 1, we can see that the data is split into training, validation, and out-of-sample test sets, but the specific criteria used to split the data is not mentioned. It is also mentioned that the researcher can decide whether model performance is satisfactory or if the model performance should be improved by selecting new training images and retraining the model, but the criteria for selecting new images is not specified.

Therefore, I do not know the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training.
