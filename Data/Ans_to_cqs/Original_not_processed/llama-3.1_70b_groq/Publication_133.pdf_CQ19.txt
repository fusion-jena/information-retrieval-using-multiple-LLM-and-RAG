Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. However, it does provide a link to the GitHub repository of YOLOv5 (https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/tree/v4.0), which is a deep learning model for object detection. YOLOv5 is typically implemented using PyTorch.
