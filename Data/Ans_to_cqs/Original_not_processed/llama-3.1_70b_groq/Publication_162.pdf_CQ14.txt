Answer: 
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It mentions the use of active learning to involve the user in the optimization of the system and minimize the labeling effort, but it does not provide details on the specific methods used for hyperparameter optimization, such as grid search or random search.
