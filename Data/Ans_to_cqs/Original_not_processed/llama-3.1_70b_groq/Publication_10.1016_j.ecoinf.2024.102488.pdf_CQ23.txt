Answer:::

To ensure the generalizability of the model, several measures were taken. Firstly, a diverse dataset was used, which included a large number of training samples (4973) and validation samples (7108) from different classes (Table 2). This diverse dataset helps to prevent overfitting and improves the model's ability to generalize to new data.

Secondly, cross-validation was used to evaluate the model's performance. Specifically, a five-fold cross-validation was used in the Recursive Feature Elimination and Cross-Validation (RFECV) process to select the optimal features (Section 3.3). Additionally, a five-fold cross-validation was used to generate the prediction results (α1, α2, α3, α4, α5) of the training data T by the meta-model (Section 4.1).

Lastly, stratified splitting was not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, the use of a large number of training and validation samples from different classes suggests that the data was split in a way that maintains the class balance.

Overall, the use of a diverse dataset and cross-validation techniques helps to ensure the generalizability of the model. However, it is unclear whether stratified splitting was used explicitly.
