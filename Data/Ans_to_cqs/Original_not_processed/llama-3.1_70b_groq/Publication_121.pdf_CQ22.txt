Answer: 
The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are accuracy and loss. According to the provided context, the performances of the models were evaluated by calculating accuracies and losses of training samples in each epoch. The accuracy of the models is reported as a percentage, with the MobileNetV2-based model achieving a training accuracy of up to 97% and validation accuracy of up to 84%, and the MobileNetV3-Large-based model achieving a training accuracy of 94% and validation accuracy of up to 87%. The loss is reported as a value, but the specific type of loss (e.g., mean squared error, cross-entropy) is not specified, except that sparse categorical cross-entropy loss is used for model validation. There is no mention of precision or recall as evaluation metrics in the provided context.
