Answer: 
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It only mentions that the authors "structed the deep learning models in R using H2O" but does not provide further details about the specific architecture of the model. Therefore, I do not know the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
