Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The text only discusses the architecture of the BirdNET model, including the number of layers and parameters, as well as the data pre-processing and augmentation techniques used during training. It also mentions that the model was trained using a mixup technique, but it does not provide further details on the hyperparameters. Therefore, I do not know the specific hyperparameters used in the model.
