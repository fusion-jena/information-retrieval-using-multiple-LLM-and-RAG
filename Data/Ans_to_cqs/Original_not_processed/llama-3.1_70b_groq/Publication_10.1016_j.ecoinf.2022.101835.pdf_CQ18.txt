Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the performance of the algorithms was evaluated by comparing the loss function (mean squared error (MSE)) of the optimized models. Additionally, the mean absolute error (MAE) and the coefficient of determination (R2) were calculated for reference. This suggests that the model performance was monitored using these metrics during the optimization process, but the specific strategy or method used to monitor performance during training is not provided.
