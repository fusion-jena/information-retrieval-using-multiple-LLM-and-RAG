Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context appears to be focused on ecological informatics, species distribution modeling, and statistical machine learning, but it does not provide information on deep learning or randomness handling in deep learning pipelines.

However, I can suggest that common strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines include:

* Setting a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results
* Using techniques such as data augmentation to reduce overfitting and improve model generalization
* Employing regularization techniques, such as dropout or L1/L2 regularization, to reduce model complexity and prevent overfitting
* Using ensemble methods, such as bagging or boosting, to combine the predictions of multiple models trained on different subsets of the data

Please note that these strategies are not mentioned in the provided context, and I'm providing general information on handling randomness in deep learning pipelines.
