Answer:::

To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, a large dataset was prepared to train the model. However, annotating a large dataset is a time-consuming process. To overcome this, the model was partially trained to learn the data first, and then it was used to annotate new data before training it further. This approach allowed for the preparation of a large dataset within a day.

Additionally, the dataset was diverse, containing images from different locations, including Greenland, Sweden, and Kenya. The model was also fine-tuned for the Kenya data separately, as the image quality from the portable microscope in Kenya was lower compared to the other two locations.

Furthermore, the model was evaluated using benchmarks such as average precision and average recall, which were reported to be high (90-96%) for the different locations. This suggests that the model was able to generalize well across different datasets.

However, it is not mentioned in the provided context whether cross-validation or stratified splitting were used to ensure the generalizability of the model. Therefore, we cannot confirm whether these specific measures were taken.
