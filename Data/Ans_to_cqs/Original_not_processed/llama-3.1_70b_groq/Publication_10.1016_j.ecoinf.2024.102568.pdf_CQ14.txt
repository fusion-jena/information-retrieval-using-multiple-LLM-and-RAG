Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context appears to be focused on discussing various papers and methods related to spatial interpolation, machine learning, and optimization, but it does not provide specific information on hyperparameter optimization techniques used in the model.

However, one of the references mentioned is the Adam optimization algorithm (Kingma, D.P., Ba, J., 2015), which is a stochastic optimization method. This suggests that the model may be using Adam or a similar optimization algorithm, but it does not provide information on how the hyperparameters are optimized.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
