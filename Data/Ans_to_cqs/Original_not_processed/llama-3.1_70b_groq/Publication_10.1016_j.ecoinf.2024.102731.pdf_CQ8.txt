The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or its code repository. The context appears to be related to environmental and ecological topics, such as green infrastructure, land cover, and habitat suitability models. There is no mention of a code repository or a deep learning pipeline, so I couldn't find any relevant information to answer the question.
