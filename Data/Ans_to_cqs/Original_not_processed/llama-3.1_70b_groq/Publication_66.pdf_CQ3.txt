Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on the application of deep learning models to animal tracking data and behavioral studies, but it does not provide details on the data annotation process. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
