Answer:::

The provided context does not specifically mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for insect ecoinformatics. However, it does mention that the available data vary in format and reliability as they originate from multiple sources. 

Some of the sources mentioned include:

1. Long-term ecological monitoring
2. Citizen science projects
3. Museum catalogs

Additionally, the context mentions the GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) Home Page as a source of large databases collected over long time periods across multiple locations. 

It can be inferred that these sources may provide raw data for the deep learning pipeline, but the specific methods of data collection are not mentioned.
