Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the development of high-resolution canopy height models (CHMs) using Sentinel-2 optical images and deep learning approaches, as well as the fusion of GEDI data with passive optical images for vegetation structure characterization.

However, it does mention the use of machine learning algorithms and deep learning approaches for various applications, such as forest fuels classification, biomass density estimation, and surface elevation modeling. But it does not provide specific information on the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query. If you have any further context or clarification, I would be happy to try and assist you further.
