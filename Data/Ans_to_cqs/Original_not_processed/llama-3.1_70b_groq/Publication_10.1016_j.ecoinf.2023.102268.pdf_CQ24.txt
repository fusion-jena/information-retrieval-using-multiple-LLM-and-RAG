Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The text primarily focuses on the use of a pre-trained ResNet-50 convolutional neural network (CNN) for feature extraction and a support vector machine (SVM) classifier for classification tasks. It discusses the workflow, feature extraction, and classification processes, but does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness.

However, it is worth noting that the text mentions the use of 10-fold cross-validation for defining the score-to-posterior-probability transformation function, which is a technique used to evaluate the performance of a model and reduce the impact of randomness in the training data. Additionally, the text mentions the use of a validation set (50% of the training data) for model selection and parameter optimization, which can help to reduce overfitting and improve the robustness of the model.

Overall, while the provided context does not explicitly address strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does mention some techniques that can help to mitigate the impact of randomness in the training data.
