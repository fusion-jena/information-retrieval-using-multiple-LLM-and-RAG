Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of mel-spectrograms, which suggests that some form of feature extraction or transformation has taken place.

It is mentioned that the XC mel-spectrograms were used to adjust the weights of the CNN models during pre-training, and that the ROI training and validation mel-spectrograms were used for fine-tuning. This implies that the mel-spectrograms were likely used as input features for the model.

Additionally, one of the references cited (Knight et al., 2020 May 3) mentions that "pre-processing spectrogram parameters improve the accuracy of bioacoustic classification using convolutional neural networks." This suggests that some form of preprocessing was performed on the spectrogram data, but the specific steps involved are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I can only speculate that some form of normalization, scaling, or cleaning may have been performed on the data, but I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer.
