Answer:::
The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, as mentioned in the provided context, include:

1. Horizontal flipping: All images were horizontally flipped to obtain the final training dataset (T0).
2. Contrast adjustment: Each "natural" image yielded 4 more images with adjusted contrast:
   - 2 images with increased contrast (120% and 140%)
   - 2 images with decreased contrast (80% and 60%)

There is no mention of other data augmentation techniques such as rotation or scaling in the provided context.
