Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context only provides information about the training time, prediction time, optimization time, and hardware used for the CNN and XGB models, as well as the input variables used in the models. It does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
