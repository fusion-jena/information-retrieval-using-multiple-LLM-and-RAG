Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily discusses the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms, but it does not delve into the details of the training process or the stopping criteria. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
