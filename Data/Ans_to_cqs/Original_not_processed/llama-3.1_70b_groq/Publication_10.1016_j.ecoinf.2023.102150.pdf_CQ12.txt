Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a ResNet50 architecture, which is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is mentioned in the context as follows: "We used the ResNet50 architecture (for details about the model architecture see He et al., 2016) with an adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014)."
