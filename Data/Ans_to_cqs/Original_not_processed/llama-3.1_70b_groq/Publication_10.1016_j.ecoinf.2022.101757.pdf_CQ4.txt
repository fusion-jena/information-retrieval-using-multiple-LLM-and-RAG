Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses semantic segmentation, deep learning-based methods, and the use of pre-trained models such as DeeplabV3+ with the COCO dataset. It does not provide information on data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, or scaling.

Therefore, I don't know the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
