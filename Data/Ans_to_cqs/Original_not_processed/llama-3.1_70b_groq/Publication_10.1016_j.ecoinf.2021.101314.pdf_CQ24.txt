Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning, randomness, or random seed values. It appears to be discussing a method for generating redescriptions, which involves setting parameters and controlling the complexity of queries. The context mentions using the Jaccard coefficient to measure accuracy, but it does not discuss deep learning or strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline.
