Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context appears to be related to landscape design and restorative potential assessment, and it does not discuss machine learning or model training.

The context mentions steps such as modifying the landscape design, assessing restorative potential, and iterating on the design process, but it does not provide information on postprocessing steps related to model training. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
