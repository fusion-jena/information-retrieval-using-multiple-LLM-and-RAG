Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, bioclimate variables, and a classification model, but it does not discuss data preprocessing techniques for deep learning pipelines.

However, I can provide general information on common techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. These techniques include:

* Stratified splitting: dividing the data into subsets based on the class labels to ensure that each subset has a similar class distribution.
* Oversampling: creating additional instances of the minority class to balance the class distribution.
* Undersampling: reducing the number of instances of the majority class to balance the class distribution.
* Diverse data collection: collecting data from diverse sources to reduce bias and increase representation of underrepresented groups.

These techniques can help address data bias, but the specific technique used depends on the nature of the data and the problem being addressed. Unfortunately, without more context, I cannot provide a more specific answer.
