Answer: 

The provided context does not specifically mention the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of remote sensing products, such as NAIP (National Agriculture Imagery Program) imagery, and online spectral libraries. It also mentions the use of historical imagery, but notes that its variable characteristics (e.g. blurriness, distortion) may limit the effectiveness of machine learning methods.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of ground truthing data, which suggests that some form of field data collection or surveying may be used to validate the results of the analysis. However, the specific methods used for collecting this data are not mentioned.

Overall, the context suggests that the data used in the analysis may come from a combination of remote sensing sources and field-based data collection, but the specific methods used are not clearly stated.
