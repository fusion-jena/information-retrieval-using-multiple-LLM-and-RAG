Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. However, it does mention that the parameter selection was performed by minimizing the mean squared error, and the parameter settings of the MLP model are listed in Table 2, which is not provided in the given context. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
