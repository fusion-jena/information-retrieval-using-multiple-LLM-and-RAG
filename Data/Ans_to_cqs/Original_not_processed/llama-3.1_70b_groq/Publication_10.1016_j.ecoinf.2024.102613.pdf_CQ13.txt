Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. The context mentions the use of deep learning techniques in smart farming systems, but it does not provide details about the hyperparameters used in the models. The references provided also do not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning models. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide an answer to this question.
