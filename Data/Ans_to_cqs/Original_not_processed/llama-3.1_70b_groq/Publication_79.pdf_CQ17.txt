Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and U-net architecture, for image classification and semantic segmentation tasks. However, it does not provide information on the specific regularization methods employed to prevent overfitting.

The text does mention the use of a sigmoid function in the last network layer, which allows the model to predict independent probabilities per class and per pixel. It also mentions the use of a Python environment with Keras and TensorFlow as the backend, but it does not provide details on the regularization methods used.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
