Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that the network training was stopped after 70 epochs to prevent overfitting. This suggests that the training was stopped based on a fixed number of epochs rather than a specific performance metric or validation loss plateau.
