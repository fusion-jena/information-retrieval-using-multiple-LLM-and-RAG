Answer: I don't know. The provided context does not mention any measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. In fact, the context mentions the use of a random forest algorithm in the PLUS model, but not a deep learning model. It also mentions the use of two periods of land use data, but it does not provide information on how the data was split or whether cross-validation was used.
