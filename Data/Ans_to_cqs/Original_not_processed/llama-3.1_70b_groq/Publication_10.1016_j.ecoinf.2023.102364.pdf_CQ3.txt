Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on a research study involving the use of geographic information systems (GIS), machine learning ensemble predictions, and socio-economic data to analyze the distribution of Short-billed Gulls (Larus canus). The context mentions the use of various data sources, including the US Census 2000, Fairbanks Burrough GIS, and other spatial data, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
