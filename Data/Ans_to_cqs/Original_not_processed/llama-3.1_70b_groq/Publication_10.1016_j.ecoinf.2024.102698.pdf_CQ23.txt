Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the methods used to demonstrate the utility of the data models were chosen for their "applicability to a range of data types (allowing comparison across different input datasets)".

Additionally, the context mentions the use of various deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks (GAN), which are known for their ability to learn sophisticated patterns in data. However, it does not provide information on whether techniques such as cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the use of diverse datasets were employed to ensure the generalizability of the model.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
