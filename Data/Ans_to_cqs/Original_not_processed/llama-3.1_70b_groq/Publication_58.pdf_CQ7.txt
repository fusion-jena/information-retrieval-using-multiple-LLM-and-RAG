Answer:::
The data for the deep learning model training was split into three mutually exclusive parts: a learning set, a validation set, and a test set. Four of the five areas were used for learning and validation, while the last, isolated scene was used as the test set. This isolated scene contained all the classes for the two nomenclatures, the five land cover (LC) classes, and the 12 land use (LU) classes, as well as all the environments representing the New Caledonian landscape.
