Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the accuracy of the redescriptions is measured using the Jaccard coefficient, and that a candidate query can be extended by adding the next variable only if the accuracy increases by at least 0.1. This suggests that the model performance is being monitored and evaluated based on its accuracy, but the specific strategy or metrics used to monitor performance during training are not provided.
