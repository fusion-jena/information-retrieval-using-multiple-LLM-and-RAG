Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention deep learning or strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a study on forest ecology and remote sensing, and it discusses methods for assessing classification accuracy, using generalized additive models (GAMs), and aggregating data at different spatial scales.

However, I can mention that the context does use a random point generating utility in ArcGIS to select 100 random points for accuracy assessment, and it also uses a proportionally stratified sampling strategy to ensure that at least 10 points of classified herbaceous cover are assessed for accuracy at each site. But this is not related to deep learning or handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not relevant to the provided context.
