Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that the dataset was partitioned into ten equal sections, known as folds, for conducting rigorous folded cross-validation. This suggests that the data was split into training and testing sets using a k-fold cross-validation approach, where one fold serves as the test set and the remaining nine folds are used for training. The context does not provide information on the specific criteria used to split the data into these folds, such as random sampling or stratified sampling.
