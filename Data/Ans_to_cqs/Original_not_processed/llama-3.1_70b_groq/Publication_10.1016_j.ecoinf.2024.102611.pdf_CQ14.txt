Answer: The text does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, it does mention that "both validation and test sets are considered separately to fine-tune the model's hyperparameters" (Section 5.1). This suggests that some form of hyperparameter tuning is performed, but the specific method (e.g., grid search, random search) is not specified.
