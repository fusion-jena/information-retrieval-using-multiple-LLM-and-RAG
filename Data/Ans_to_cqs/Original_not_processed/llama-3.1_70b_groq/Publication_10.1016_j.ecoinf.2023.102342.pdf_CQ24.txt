Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically address the query about strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a collection of academic papers and snippets related to various topics such as probability, random processes, crop yield modeling, artificial neural networks, and data mining.

However, I can provide a general answer based on common practices in deep learning. To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, several strategies can be employed:

1. **Fixing the random seed**: Setting a fixed random seed value can ensure reproducibility of results. This is a common practice in many deep learning frameworks, including TensorFlow and PyTorch.
2. **Using deterministic algorithms**: Some algorithms, such as those used in neural network initialization, can be designed to be deterministic, eliminating the need for random number generation.
3. **Batch normalization**: Batch normalization can help reduce the effect of randomness in the training process by normalizing the input data.
4. **Ensemble methods**: Using ensemble methods, such as bagging or boosting, can help reduce the effect of randomness by combining the predictions of multiple models.
5. **Data augmentation**: Data augmentation techniques, such as random cropping or flipping, can help increase the robustness of the model to randomness.

Please note that these strategies are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, and this answer is based on general knowledge of deep learning practices.
