Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the EfficientNetV2 network uses an improved progressive learning approach that dynamically adjusts the regularization method based on the training image size. 

Additionally, the context mentions that the MBConv block, used in EfficientNetV2, includes a dropout layer. This suggests that dropout is one of the regularization methods used in the EfficientNetV2 network. However, it does not provide information on other regularization methods that may be used, such as L2 regularization.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the only regularization method that can be confirmed is dropout. Other regularization methods, such as L2 regularization, are not mentioned.
