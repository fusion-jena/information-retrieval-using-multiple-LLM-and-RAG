Answer: To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the dataset was divided into five equal folds, and policies were used to augment each fold without repetition. This data augmentation technique helped to increase and diversify the training data, which can improve the generalization ability of the network.

Additionally, the proposed approach used a Bayesian optimizer to control the output of each CNN model, and weak policies were removed while strong ones were selected. This process continued to find the optimal policies for data augmentation, which can help to improve the model's performance on unseen data.

Furthermore, the remaining 20% of the data was used to test the model and improve its generalization performance. This suggests that the model was evaluated on a separate test set, which is a common practice to ensure the model's ability to generalize to new data.

It is also mentioned that the model was trained using a stratified splitting approach, as the data was divided into five equal folds. However, it is not explicitly mentioned whether cross-validation was used. Nevertheless, the use of data augmentation, stratified splitting, and a separate test set suggests that the researchers took measures to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
