Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does discuss various data augmentation techniques used to improve the accuracy and generalizability of deep learning models for bird species classification.

The context mentions the use of randomization in some data augmentation techniques, such as "randomized partial time and frequency stretching" and "randomly added weighted noise samples". These techniques introduce randomness into the training data, which can help improve the model's robustness and ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

However, it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline, such as whether a fixed random seed value is used to ensure reproducibility of the results.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know what specific strategies are employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
