Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the references and the text, we can infer that the pipeline likely involves image data. 

The text mentions "camera-trap images" and the use of deep neural networks for image recognition, which suggests that image data is being used. Additionally, references such as "Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database" (Deng et al., 2009) and "Very deep convolutional networks for large-scale image recognition" (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2014) also support this inference.

There is no explicit mention of audio or video data formats being used in the pipeline. However, references such as "Speech recognition with deep recurrent neural networks" (Graves et al., 2013) and "Deep neural networks for acoustic modeling in speech recognition" (Hinton et al., 2012) suggest that audio data may be used in other related contexts.

There is no mention of CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
