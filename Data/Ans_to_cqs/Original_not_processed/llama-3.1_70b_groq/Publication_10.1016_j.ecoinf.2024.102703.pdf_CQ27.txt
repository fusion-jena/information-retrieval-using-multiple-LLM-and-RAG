Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It only discusses the creation of a three-layer back propagation (BP) artificial neural network using MATLAB R2014b, the training and validation of the model, and the calculation of the coefficient of determination (R2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) between the measured and predicted TSI. There is no information about model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related processes.
