Answer: I don't know. The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, segmentation, and classification strategies in eCognition, and does not discuss deep learning or regularization methods.
