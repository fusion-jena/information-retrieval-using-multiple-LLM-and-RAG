Answer: 
The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model. However, it does describe the evaluation metrics used for the Generalised Linear Model (GLM) and the Random Forest model. 

For the GLM, the performance is evaluated using the following metrics: 
- Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC)
- Percent Correctly Classified (PCC)
- Sensitivity
- Specificity
- True Skill Statistic (TSS)

These metrics are calculated using the PresenceAbsence package in R. 

For the Random Forest model, the context does not explicitly mention the evaluation metrics used. However, it does discuss the use of bootstrapping to increase the model's precision and reduce stochastic errors in estimation.
