Answer:

According to the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, specifically the Wav2vec model, include:

1. Normalization: The waveform is normalized before passing through the convolutional layer of the feature encoder.
2. Layer normalization: This is applied after the convolutional layer.
3. GELU activation function: This is used as the activation function after layer normalization.

These preprocessing steps are applied to the raw waveform data to convert it into a sequence of feature vectors, which are then used as input to the model. The feature encoder, which consists of seven layers of a 1D convolutional neural network, reduces the dimensionality of the audio data and extracts latent feature vectors that represent the sequential information in the vocalization audio.

It is worth noting that the context does not mention any specific cleaning steps, such as handling missing values or outliers, as part of the preprocessing pipeline. Additionally, scaling is not explicitly mentioned as a preprocessing step, but normalization is, which may serve a similar purpose.
