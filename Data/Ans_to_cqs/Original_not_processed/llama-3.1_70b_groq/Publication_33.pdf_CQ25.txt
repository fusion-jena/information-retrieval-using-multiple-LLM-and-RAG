Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. Specifically, it is used for species identification. The model is trained on a database of images, and its goal is to accurately classify the species in the images. The model uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, which is well-suited for image classification tasks. The model is trained in two phases: the first phase involves training the CNN on a given database, and the second phase involves tuning a risk threshold specific to each class (i.e., each species) using a second and independent database. The model outputs a classification score for each image, which is then used to determine the confidence in the classification.
