Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context appears to focus on the application of deep learning techniques to audio-based bird species identification, spectrogram generation, and the use of mixed audio clips to minimize the dilution effect. It also references various research papers and studies related to environmental and passive acoustic monitoring.

However, it does mention a "two-step process" and the use of expert-reviewed sounds to collect training data for rare species, but it does not provide any information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
