Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is through monitoring the model's validation performance using a holdout data partition (Bv). The model's performance is evaluated at each epoch, and the 'optimal' number of training epochs is determined as the one that provides the best validation performance, measured using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Additionally, the training process is stopped if no increase in validation performance is observed after 25 epochs. This approach helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the model is trained for an optimal number of epochs.
