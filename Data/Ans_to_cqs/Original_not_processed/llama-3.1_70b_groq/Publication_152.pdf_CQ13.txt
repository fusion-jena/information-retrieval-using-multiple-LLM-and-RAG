Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. However, it does mention the use of the Adam optimizer in one of the references ([27] D.P. Kingma and J. Ba, "Adam: A method for stochastic optimization," arXiv preprint arXiv:1412.6980, 2014). This suggests that the Adam optimizer might be used in the model, but it is not explicitly stated. The learning rate is not mentioned at all.
