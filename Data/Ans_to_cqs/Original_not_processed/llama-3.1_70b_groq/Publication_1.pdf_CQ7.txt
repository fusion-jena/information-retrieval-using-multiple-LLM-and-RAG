Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context discusses the application of deep learning (DL) in biodiversity monitoring, the importance of large amounts of labeled data, and the use of stochastic gradient descent as a learning algorithm. However, it does not provide information on how the data is split for training, testing, and validation.

Typically, in deep learning, data is split into training, validation, and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance and prevent overfitting. However, the specific criteria for splitting the data, such as the proportion of data allocated to each set, are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question based on the provided context.
