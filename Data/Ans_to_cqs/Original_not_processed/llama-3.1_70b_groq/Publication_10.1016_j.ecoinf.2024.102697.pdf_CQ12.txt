Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. The context mentions the use of random forest models, which are a type of machine learning method, but not deep learning specifically. It does mention a "Deep learning based data-driven model" in the title of the first reference, but it does not provide further details on the type of deep learning model used. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
