Answer:::
The text does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that images are used as input data for the semantic segmentation task. The text mentions "manually classified photos" and "nadir photographs" which suggests that the algorithm is trained and tested on image data. There is no mention of audio or video data being used in the pipeline. Additionally, the text mentions the use of field measurement data, but it is not clear what format this data is in (e.g., CSV, etc.).
