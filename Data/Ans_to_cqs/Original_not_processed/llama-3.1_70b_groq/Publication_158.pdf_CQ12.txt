Answer:::
Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, the study uses an ensemble of CNNs with varying input image sizes, and each CNN follows a simple ResNet configuration, except for the 1 Ã— 1 size which uses dense layers instead of convolution layers.
