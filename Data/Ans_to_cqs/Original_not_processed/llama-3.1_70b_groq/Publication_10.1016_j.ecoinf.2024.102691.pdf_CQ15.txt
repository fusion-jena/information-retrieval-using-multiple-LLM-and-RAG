Answer: According to the provided context, the optimization technique applied in the deep learning pipeline is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). Specifically, it is mentioned that "The models were trained using a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer with an initial learning rate of 0.01 and a cycle learning rate of 0.2". There is no mention of Adam or any other optimization techniques being used in the pipeline.
