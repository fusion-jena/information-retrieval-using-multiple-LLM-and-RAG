Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context only mentions the use of a deep learning algorithm, specifically a multilayer perceptron (MLP), for modeling the relationship between soil organic carbon stock (SOCS) and environmental covariates. It discusses the architecture of the MLP, including the input layer, hidden layers, and output layer, but does not provide information on the optimization techniques used for training the model.
