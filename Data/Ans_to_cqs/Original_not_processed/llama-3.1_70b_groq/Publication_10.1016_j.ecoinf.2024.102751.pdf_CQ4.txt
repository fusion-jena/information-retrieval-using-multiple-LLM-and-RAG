Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to soil moisture estimation, remote sensing, and spatial modeling, but it does not discuss deep learning or data augmentation techniques.

However, I can provide some general information on common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. These techniques are used to artificially increase the size of a training dataset by applying random transformations to the existing data. Some common techniques include:

* Flipping: horizontally or vertically flipping an image
* Rotating: rotating an image by a certain angle
* Scaling: resizing an image to a different scale
* Color jittering: randomly changing the brightness, contrast, or saturation of an image
* Cropping: randomly cropping a portion of an image

These techniques can help improve the robustness and generalization of a deep learning model by exposing it to a wider range of possible inputs. However, without more specific information, I cannot determine which specific techniques are being applied in this context.
