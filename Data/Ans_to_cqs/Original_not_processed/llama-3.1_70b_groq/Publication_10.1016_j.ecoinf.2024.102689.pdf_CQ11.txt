Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a collection of research papers and articles related to animal individual recognition, fish recognition, and underwater object detection using deep learning techniques. However, it does not provide any information about a specific data repository or a link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other data repository.

Therefore, I must answer that I don't know the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline.
