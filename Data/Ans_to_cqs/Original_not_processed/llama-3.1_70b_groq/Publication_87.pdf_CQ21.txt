Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. It only discusses the model training process using a resnet18 architecture and saving the model after each epoch. 

However, it does mention the calculation of metrics such as accuracy and error rate during the model training process. The code snippet `metrics = list(accuracy, error_rate)` suggests that these metrics are being tracked during training.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a `kable` function to display the sample size of the training and validation datasets, which could be a part of the postprocessing steps. But it does not provide any information about saliency maps or confusion matrices.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we can only confirm that metrics calculation is involved during the model training process, but we do not have information about other postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrices.
