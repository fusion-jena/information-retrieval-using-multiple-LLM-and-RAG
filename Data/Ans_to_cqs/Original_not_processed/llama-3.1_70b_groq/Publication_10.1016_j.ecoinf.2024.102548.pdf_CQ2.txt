Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The text primarily focuses on describing various deep learning architectures, such as InceptionResNetV2, ResNet-50, InceptionV3, and VGG-19, and their characteristics. It also mentions that these models have been pre-trained on large-scale datasets, including ImageNet, but it does not provide information on the data formats used.

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the pipeline likely involves image data, as the text mentions image classification tasks and the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are commonly used for image processing. Nevertheless, without explicit information, it is impossible to confirm the specific data formats used in the pipeline.
