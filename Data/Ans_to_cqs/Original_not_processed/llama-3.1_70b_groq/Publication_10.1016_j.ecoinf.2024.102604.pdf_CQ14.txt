Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context appears to be a collection of references and snippets from research papers related to species distribution models, environmental bias, and spatial prediction. However, it does not provide information on the specific optimization methods used for hyperparameter tuning, such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
