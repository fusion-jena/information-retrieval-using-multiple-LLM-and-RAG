Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, it does mention that the methodology aims to "expand the applicability of EAI to emerging fields like machine learning and deep learning, which require consistent feature spaces regardless of the recording device used." This suggests that the focus is on reducing device bias and ensuring consistency in the feature spaces, which could be a step towards generalizability.

The context also mentions that the study used a comprehensive processing pipeline to mitigate device biases in site comparisons using ecoacoustic indices (EAI). However, it does not provide specific details on the measures taken to ensure generalizability, such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
