Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention deep learning or strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines. The context appears to be focused on ecological informatics, mapping, and scientific communication, with references to papers on topics such as colour vision deficiency, information theory, and visualization best practices.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query about strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines.
