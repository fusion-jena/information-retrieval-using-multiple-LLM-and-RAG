Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the methodology for fuel model retrieval, the use of a deep learning (DL) model trained with synthetic data, and the validation of the model using real MS point clouds. It does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps taken after the model training.

However, it does mention that the classifications of the real point clouds are made using the MS-trained model, and the final fuel model classifications are summarized in Table 3. But it does not provide details on how the performance of the model is evaluated or what metrics are used to calculate its accuracy.

Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training, as this information is not provided in the given context.
