Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily discusses various machine learning and signal processing techniques, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Hidden Markov Models (HMM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Wavelet Transform (WT), but does not delve into the specifics of optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
