Answer:

Based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include the calculation of metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This is evident from Fig. 4, which shows the accuracy comparison of different pixels and the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of the final selected 21 pixels.

Additionally, the context mentions the creation of a confusion matrix, as shown in Fig. 4(b). The confusion matrix is a common postprocessing step used to evaluate the performance of a classification model.

There is no mention of saliency maps in the provided context. Saliency maps are a technique used to visualize the importance of input features in a model's predictions, but they are not mentioned in the text.

Therefore, the postprocessing steps mentioned in the context include metrics calculation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score) and the creation of a confusion matrix.
