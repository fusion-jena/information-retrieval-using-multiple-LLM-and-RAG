Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is 10-fold cross-validation with three repetitions. In this approach, the training dataset is randomly split into 10 folds, where 9 folds are used for model training and 1 fold is used for testing. This procedure is repeated until all folds have been used as testing data. The whole sequence is then repeated two more times using new random splits. This type of accuracy assessment helps to find the best models with the largest overall accuracy (OA) and also reflects the resulting distribution of 30 OAs, including minimums, maximums, quartiles, and medians.
