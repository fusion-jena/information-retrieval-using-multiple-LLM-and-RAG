Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The text primarily focuses on the workflow, model selection, and data preparation for training deep learning models, but it does not discuss how randomness is handled. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
