Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the YWnet network, is underwater target detection. The model is designed to recognize and detect underwater organisms from images collected from the underwater environment. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled underwater images, and its performance is evaluated on a separate test set. The addition of attention mechanisms, such as the CBAM module, is intended to improve the model's feature extraction and detection capabilities.
