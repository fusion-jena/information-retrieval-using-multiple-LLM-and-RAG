Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the references and the context, it can be inferred that the data might be related to time series classification, possibly from sensor recordings or activity level assessments.

The context mentions "flight activity recordings" and "behavioural activity level in sheep", which suggests that the data might be in the form of time series data, possibly in a CSV or similar format. Additionally, the reference to "X-ray images" in one of the cited papers suggests that image data might also be used in some related research, but it is not clear if this is the case in the specific deep learning pipeline being described.

Therefore, while the exact data formats used in the pipeline are not specified, it is possible that time series data in CSV or similar formats might be used, and potentially image data in some related research.
