Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the CA-Hybrid network, which is the proposed classification network, was able to focus more on critical features by introducing the Class Activation Map (CAM) in the CNN, which boosted the generalization ability of the model.

Additionally, the context mentions that the classification network was evaluated on both small and medium objects to assess the influence of image size on classification performance. This suggests that the authors may have taken steps to evaluate the model's performance on different subsets of the data, but it does not provide explicit information on the use of techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to the query.
