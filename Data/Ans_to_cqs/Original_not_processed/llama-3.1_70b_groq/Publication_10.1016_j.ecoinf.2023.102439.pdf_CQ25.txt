Answer: 

The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is not explicitly stated as classification, segmentation, or detection. However, based on the provided information, it appears that the model is used for prediction and regression tasks. 

The model is described as a hybrid model that combines wavelet analysis and the NARX ANN algorithm to enhance the performance of the NARX ANN model. The model is used to define vegetation biomass density for 2030, and the results show that the model has improved learning success and predictive capabilities. 

The input layer of the model consists of three processing elements (neurons) corresponding to the LST, temperature, and precipitation parameters, and the output layer uses EVI data. This suggests that the model is using these input parameters to predict or estimate the EVI data, which is a measure of vegetation health and biomass density. 

Therefore, the purpose of the deep learning model in this context is likely regression or prediction, specifically to predict vegetation biomass density based on input parameters such as LST, temperature, and precipitation.
