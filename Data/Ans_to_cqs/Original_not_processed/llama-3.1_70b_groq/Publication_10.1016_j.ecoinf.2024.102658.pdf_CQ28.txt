Answer: I don't know. The provided text does not mention the deployment of a deep learning model or the use of any specific cloud platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. It appears to be a research paper discussing the development of species distribution models (SDMs) using machine learning and process-based models, but it does not provide information on the deployment platform.
