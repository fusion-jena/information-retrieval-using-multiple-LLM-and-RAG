Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of ResNet-50, a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN), to extract features from spectrogram images, and the application of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to classify the candidate detections. However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling.
