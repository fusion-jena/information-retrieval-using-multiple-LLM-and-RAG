Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context primarily focuses on the performance metrics used to evaluate the deep learning models, such as accuracy, precision, and recall, as well as the different deep learning architectures used for plant disease classification. It does not provide information on data splitting or the training process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
