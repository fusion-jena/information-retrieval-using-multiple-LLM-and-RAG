Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to image acquisition and processing, and does not provide information on techniques such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
