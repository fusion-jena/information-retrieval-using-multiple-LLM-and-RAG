Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention anything about hyperparameter optimization or the model itself. It appears to be discussing a study on soil degradation, with various mathematical notations and variables described, but there is no mention of how these variables are used in a model or how hyperparameters are optimized.

Therefore, I must answer that I don't know how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, as this information is not provided in the given context.
