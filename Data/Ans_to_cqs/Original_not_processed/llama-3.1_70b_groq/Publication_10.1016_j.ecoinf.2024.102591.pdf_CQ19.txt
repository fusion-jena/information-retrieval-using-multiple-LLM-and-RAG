Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The context mentions the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE), which has a cloud-based platform that supports high-performance computing, and mentions the use of JavaScript, Python, or R application programming interface (API) and the associated interactive development environment (IDE) in GEE. However, it does not provide information on the specific frameworks used for building deep learning models such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
