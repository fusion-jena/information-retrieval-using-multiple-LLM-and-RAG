Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly state the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that the model training and prediction procedures were executed on Microsoft Azure, and the algorithm scripts are available in Supporting Information B.

It does mention that the most suitable architecture was chosen based on the best validation accuracy (proportion of all correct predictions) and precision (number of true positives divided by true positives and false positives) obtained during training. This suggests that the data was split into training and validation sets, but the exact criteria for splitting the data is not specified.

Additionally, it mentions that the testing dataset was created by using the same sliding window approach as the training dataset, and multiple segments were created across the entire testing file by moving the window by one second. This suggests that the testing dataset was created separately from the training and validation datasets, but again, the exact criteria for splitting the data is not specified.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the exact criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training is not specified in the provided context.
