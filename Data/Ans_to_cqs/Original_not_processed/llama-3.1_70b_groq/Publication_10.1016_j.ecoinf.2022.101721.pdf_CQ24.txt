Answer:::

The provided context does not specifically discuss deep learning pipelines or strategies for handling randomness in such pipelines. However, it does mention the use of the `set.seed` function in R to ensure reproducibility of the simulated data set, referred to as the "rnorm sample". This suggests that the researchers used a fixed random seed value to generate the simulated data, allowing for reproducibility of the results.

It can be inferred that setting a fixed random seed value is one strategy for handling randomness in statistical modeling and simulation, as it allows for reproducibility of the results. However, this may not be directly applicable to deep learning pipelines, and other strategies may be employed in such contexts.

Without more specific information, it is difficult to provide a more detailed answer to the query. Therefore, I must conclude that I don't know the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines, beyond the use of fixed random seed values in statistical modeling and simulation.
