Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the machine learning models. It only discusses the performance of different models, such as Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Random Forest (RF), and Classification and Regression Tree (CART), in terms of their Area Under the Curve (AUC) values. There is no information about the computational resources or hardware used for training these models.
