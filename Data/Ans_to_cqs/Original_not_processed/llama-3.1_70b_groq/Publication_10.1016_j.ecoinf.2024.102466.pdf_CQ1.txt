Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the dataset used in the study comprises 9717 images of 15 wild bird species acquired by camera traps in China's Northeast Tiger and Leopard National Park. This suggests that camera traps are one method used for collecting raw data, specifically images, for the deep learning pipeline.

Additionally, the context mentions other datasets, such as the NACTI dataset, SNAPSHOT USA 2019, and the Europe Birds dataset, but it does not provide information on the methods used to collect data for these datasets. It also mentions a study that used camera trap images from Serengeti National Park, which further supports the use of camera traps as a method for collecting raw data.

Overall, based on the provided context, it appears that camera traps are one method used for collecting raw data in the form of images for the deep learning pipeline. However, it is unclear if other methods, such as surveys or sensors, are also used.
