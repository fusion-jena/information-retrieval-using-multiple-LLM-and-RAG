Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. However, it does mention that "result metrics were calculated using Padilla et al. (2021) for each DL model" after selecting the best model based on the validation loss curve metrics.

It appears that the metrics calculated include Precision, Recall, F-score, and Confidence Intervals (CI) for Precision and Recall, as these are listed in the provided tables. However, the exact steps involved in calculating these metrics are not specified.

Additionally, the context mentions that a positive detection is identified when the Intersection over Union (IoU) is greater than 0.5, which suggests that some form of evaluation or validation is being performed. However, it does not provide further details on the postprocessing steps involved.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive answer to the query. However, it can be inferred that some form of metrics calculation and evaluation is being performed after model training.
