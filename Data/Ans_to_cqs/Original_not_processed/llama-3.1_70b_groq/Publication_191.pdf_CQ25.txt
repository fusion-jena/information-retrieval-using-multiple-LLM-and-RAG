Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model in the provided context is classification, specifically for plant species identification. The model uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn features from leaf images and classify them into different species. The text mentions that the model is used to discover which leaf features are most effective for plant species identification and to achieve the best optimization ability in modeling plant data. The classification results are presented in a table, showing the accuracy of different models and feature extraction techniques.
