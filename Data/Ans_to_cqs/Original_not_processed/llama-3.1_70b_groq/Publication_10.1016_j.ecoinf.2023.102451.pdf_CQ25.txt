Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically EMViT-Net, is classification. It is designed for the end-to-end classification of environmental microorganisms (EMs) using microscopic images. The model is trained on a publicly available dataset called EMDS-6, which contains 21 categories of microorganisms. The goal of the model is to efficiently classify different environmental microbes, and it achieves this by combining the capabilities of CNN and MLP modules, along with a separable convolutional parameter-sharing attention block.
