Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or any measures taken to ensure its generalizability. The context appears to be related to a monitoring program using a mobile app to collect data on marine taxa from recreational SCUBA divers. The methods described include the use of a standardized data collection process, a pre-established list of taxa curated by experts, and the collection of effort-related metadata. However, there is no mention of a deep learning model or any techniques used to ensure its generalizability, such as cross-validation or stratified splitting.
