Answer:::

To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the study employed a few measures. One of the measures taken was the use of validation data, which were set aside while training the model. The validation data helped to limit the training duration, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting. The study used 30 epochs per training task, based on the validation runs.

Another measure taken was the use of a large dataset, although the exact diversity of the dataset is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the data points describe the performance attained by a model that accepts all identifications, which suggests that the dataset may be diverse.

There is no explicit mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting in the provided context. However, the study does mention that the model's annotation accuracy increases as the number of parameters of the model is large, and the use of validation data helps to limit the risk of overfitting.

It is also worth noting that the study used a deep learning model, specifically YOLOv5, which is a state-of-the-art object detection model. The use of such a model can also contribute to the generalizability of the results.

Overall, while the study took some measures to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the exact details of the dataset and the methods used are not fully clear from the provided context.
