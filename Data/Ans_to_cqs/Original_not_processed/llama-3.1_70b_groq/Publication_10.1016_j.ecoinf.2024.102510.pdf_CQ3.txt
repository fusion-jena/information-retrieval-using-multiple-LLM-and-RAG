Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that some studies used "bounding boxes and part annotations" for fine-grained image classification of birds. This suggests that bounding box annotation and possibly part annotation (which could be a form of instance segmentation) were used in some of the studies mentioned.

Additionally, the context mentions that attention-guided data augmentation was used in one of the studies (Wang et al., 2023), but it does not provide further details on the annotation techniques used.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that bounding box annotation and possibly part annotation or instance segmentation were used in some of the studies, but the exact annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly stated.
