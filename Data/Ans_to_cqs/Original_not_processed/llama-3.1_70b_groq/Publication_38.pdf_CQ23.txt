Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does describe the CNNFAST network architecture and mentions that deep learning networks consistently outperformed other baselines, but it does not provide information on how the dataset was handled to ensure generalizability.

The context does mention the use of a fully connected layer that is evaluated as a convolution, which might help with generalizability, but it does not provide information on cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the diversity of the dataset.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of citizen science data from wildlife images, which might imply that the dataset is diverse and representative of real-world scenarios. However, without explicit information on the measures taken to ensure generalizability, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this question.
