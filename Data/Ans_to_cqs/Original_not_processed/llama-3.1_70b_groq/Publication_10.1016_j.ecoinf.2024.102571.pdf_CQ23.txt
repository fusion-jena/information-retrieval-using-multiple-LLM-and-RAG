Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that "70% of the data were used for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for model testing." This suggests that the model was trained and tested on separate datasets, which is a common practice to ensure the generalizability of a model.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model was a three-layer feedforward back-propagation neural network with a specific architecture and activation functions. However, it does not provide information on whether techniques such as cross-validation, stratified splitting, or data augmentation were used to further ensure the model's generalizability.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the model was trained and tested on separate datasets, but it is unclear whether other measures such as cross-validation or stratified splitting were taken to ensure the model's generalizability.
