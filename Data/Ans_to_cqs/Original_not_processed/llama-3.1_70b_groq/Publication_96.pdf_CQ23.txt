Answer: 
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the study employed a few measures. Firstly, the dataset was split into training and testing sets, with 70% of the samples used for training and 30% for testing. This splitting of the dataset helps to evaluate the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. However, it is mentioned that this approach has a bias as it uses the same sample sets to test the model. 

Additionally, an accuracy assessment using validation points was conducted to further evaluate the model's performance. This suggests that some form of validation or cross-validation was employed to assess the model's generalizability. However, the specific details of the cross-validation approach used are not provided in the given context.

There is no mention of using a diverse dataset or stratified splitting in the provided context. Therefore, it is unclear if these measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.
