Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. However, it does mention that a "cosine learning rate decay" was used, which suggests that the learning rate was adjusted during training using a cosine schedule. The initial learning rate was set to 0.008. No other optimization techniques are mentioned in the provided context.
