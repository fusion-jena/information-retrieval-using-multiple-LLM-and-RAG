Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the hyperparameters used for training different models (Table 1), the performance of these models on the IP102 dataset (Table 2), and a brief overview of transformer-like and MLP-like models.

However, it can be inferred that the input size for the models is 224 Ã— 224 (Table 1), which suggests that the images might have been resized to a uniform size before training. Additionally, the context mentions that the models were trained using a deep transfer-learning strategy based on fine-tuning, which implies that the models were initialized with pre-trained weights and then fine-tuned on the target dataset.

Other than these inferences, the context does not provide explicit information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query based on the provided context.
