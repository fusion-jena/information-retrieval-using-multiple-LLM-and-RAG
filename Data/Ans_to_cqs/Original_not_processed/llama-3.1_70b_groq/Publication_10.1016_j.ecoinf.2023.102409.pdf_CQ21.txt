Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the model architectures, such as Unet and Pspnet, and their configurations, including the learning rates, batch sizes, optimizers, and loss functions. It also discusses the limitations of these models in segmenting vegetation areas.

However, it does mention that the final decoder tensor undergoes convolution and then traverses through a softmax layer, normalizing the output probabilities for two classes at each pixel. This suggests that the model outputs a probability map, but it does not provide information on how these outputs are further processed or evaluated.

Therefore, I do not know the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as the calculation of metrics, creation of saliency maps, or generation of confusion matrices.
