Answer:::
The text does not explicitly mention the use of any specific deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. However, it does mention that the models were implemented using the scikit-learn library, which is a machine learning library for Python. It also mentions the use of the Adam solver, which is a stochastic gradient descent algorithm, but it does not specify the framework used to implement it. Therefore, the answer to the query is that the text does not provide information on the specific deep learning framework used to build the model.
