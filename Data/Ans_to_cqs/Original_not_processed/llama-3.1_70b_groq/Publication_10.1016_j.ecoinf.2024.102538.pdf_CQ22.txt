Answer: The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the following metrics:

1. Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR): This metric is used to assess processes that generate a list of potential responses to a sample of queries, which are ranked by their likelihood of correctness.
2. Accuracy (ACC): This metric is used to determine the proportion of correctly classified items.
3. Hierarchical Distance of a Mistake (HDM): This metric is used to quantify the degree of misclassification when only a single class can be predicted. It takes into account the hierarchical structure of the classification problem.

Additionally, the model's performance is also evaluated using average accuracy across all class hierarchies (avg_ACC). These metrics are used to assess the model's performance on the BirdCLEF2018 competition dataset.
