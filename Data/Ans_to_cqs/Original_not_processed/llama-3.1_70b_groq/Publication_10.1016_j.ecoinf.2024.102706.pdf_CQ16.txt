Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context discusses the models used, their performance metrics, and hyperparameter tuning, but it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
