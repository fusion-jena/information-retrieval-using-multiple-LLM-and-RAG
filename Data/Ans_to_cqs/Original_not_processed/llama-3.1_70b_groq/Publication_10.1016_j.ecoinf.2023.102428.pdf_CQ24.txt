Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the application of a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network for land use and land cover (LULC) simulation and its integration with the InVEST carbon model for forest carbon sequestration mapping and economic quantification.

However, it does mention the use of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as a supervised learning algorithm to train the neural networks. SGD is a popular optimization algorithm that can handle randomness in the training process, but it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
