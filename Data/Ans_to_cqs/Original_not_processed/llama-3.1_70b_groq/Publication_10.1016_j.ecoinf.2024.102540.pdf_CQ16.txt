Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. It only mentions that the optimal hyperparameters for training were determined through initial computational experiments with different combinations of epochs and batch sizes. The context does mention that the training process involves a certain number of epochs (400) and batch sizes (8), but it does not provide information on how the completion of training is determined. Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete.
