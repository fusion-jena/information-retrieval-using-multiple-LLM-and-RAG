Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model are AUC (Area Under the Curve), Denv, and Dgeo. These metrics are used to quantify the relative impact of the bias correction methods on model performances. 

Specifically, three indexes are computed: ΔAUC, ΔDenv, and ΔDgeo. These indexes measure the difference in performance between the biased model and the corrected model, with a positive value indicating that the corrected model outperformed the biased one, and a negative value indicating that the biased model outperformed the corrected one. 

Note that the text does not mention traditional metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall, which are commonly used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models. The metrics used in this context appear to be specific to the task of species distribution modeling.
