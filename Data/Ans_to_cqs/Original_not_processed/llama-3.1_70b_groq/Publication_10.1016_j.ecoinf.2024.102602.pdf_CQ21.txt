Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, it does mention the calculation of performance metrics and the creation of confusion matrices.

According to the context, the performance of the models was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and f1-score (Section 2.5.4). Additionally, confusion matrices were created to visualize the model's performance, including the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives (Tables A.6 and A.7, Figures A.1c and A.1d).

There is no mention of saliency maps or other postprocessing steps in the provided context. Therefore, I can only confirm that metrics calculation and confusion matrix creation are mentioned as postprocessing steps, but I do not know if any other steps were involved.
