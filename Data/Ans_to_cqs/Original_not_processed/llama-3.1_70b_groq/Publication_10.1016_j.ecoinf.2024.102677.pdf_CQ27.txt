Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only discusses the evaluation of different network models, the selection of the most effective model, and the use of deep learning techniques for landscape type classification. It does not provide information on model deployment, serialization, or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
