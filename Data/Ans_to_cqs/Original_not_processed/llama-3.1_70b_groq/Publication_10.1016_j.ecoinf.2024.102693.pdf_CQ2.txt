Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the discussion of various models such as ViT, Volo, and ResNet-50, it can be inferred that the primary data format used is images. The context mentions "input image" and "image patches" in the descriptions of the models, indicating that the pipeline is designed to process visual data. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats in the provided context.
