Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on image feature extraction using a ResNet-50 model and its application in classification tasks. It does not provide information on the data annotation process. Therefore, I don't know the specific data annotation techniques used in this pipeline.
