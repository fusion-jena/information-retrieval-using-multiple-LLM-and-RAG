Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a list of academic papers and their references, with no mention of a specific dataset or repository. Therefore, I am unable to provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
