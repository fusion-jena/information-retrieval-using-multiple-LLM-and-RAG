Answer:::

To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. 

Firstly, the dataset was filtered to remove regions lacking training data, particularly in areas where the conditions were not met (Gutzwiller and Serno, 2023; Muckley et al., 2023). This was done by creating a mask to delineate the "area of applicability" for the trained model (Meyer and Pebesma, 2021).

Secondly, spatial cross-validation was performed to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. This is mentioned in the context as "Spatial cross-validation, model training, and spatial mapping" (Section 2.3.2).

Lastly, feature elimination was performed using the Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Variable Selection using Random Forests (VSURF) methods. This resulted in four retained databases: RFE2021, RFE2011-2021, VSURF2021, and VSURF2011-2021. These analyses were performed using the Caret (Khun, 2022) and VSURF (Genuer et al., 2022) packages in R programming.

There is no mention of stratified splitting or the use of a diverse dataset in the provided context.
