Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the CNN classifier was trained on annotated training data, and the parameters were learnt from this data. 

Additionally, the context mentions that the input to the network consisted of a 32 × 21 × 4 tensor, which suggests that the data was pre-processed and possibly normalized. It also mentions that different normalisation strategies were applied, which gave considerable improvements to network accuracy above any single normalisation scheme in isolation. 

However, without further information, it is unclear whether the dataset was diverse, or if cross-validation or stratified splitting were used to evaluate the model's performance.
