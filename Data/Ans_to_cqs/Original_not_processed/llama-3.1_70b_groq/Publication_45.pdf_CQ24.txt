Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The text primarily focuses on introducing deep learning for predictive ecology, highlighting the potential of deep neural networks, and comparing their performance with other classification algorithms. It does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this query.
