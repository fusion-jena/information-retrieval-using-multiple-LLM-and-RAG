Answer:

The provided context does not specifically mention the evaluation metrics for a deep learning model. However, it does mention the evaluation metrics used for the machine learning models in the context of species distribution modeling.

According to the context, the following metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the machine learning models:

1. Area Under the Curve (AUC)
2. True Skill Statistics (TSS)
3. Cohen's KAPPA
4. Point-biserial correlation (COR)
5. Receiver Operator Characteristics (ROC)

These metrics are used to assess the accuracy and performance of the final models, and to verify the model's validity. However, it is not clear if these metrics are used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model specifically, as deep learning is not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the context does not provide information on the evaluation metrics for a deep learning model, but it does mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models in the context of species distribution modeling.
