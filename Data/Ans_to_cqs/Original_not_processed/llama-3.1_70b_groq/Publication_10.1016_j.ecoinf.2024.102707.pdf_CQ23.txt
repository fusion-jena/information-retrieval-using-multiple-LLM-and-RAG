Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model was tested on various datasets, including "test-over_time" and "test-over_location", which suggests that some form of cross-validation or testing on unseen data was performed.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model achieved high F1 scores on both training and validation data, as well as on testing data, including locations it had never seen before. This suggests that the model was able to generalize well to new, unseen data.

However, without more explicit information on the measures taken to ensure generalizability, such as the use of a diverse dataset, stratified splitting, or other techniques, it is difficult to provide a more detailed answer.
