Answer: To improve the generalizability of the deep learning models, the researchers employed several measures. Firstly, they used a large dataset of 397 different bird species, which suggests that the dataset was diverse. However, the text does not provide information on whether cross-validation or stratified splitting were used.

The researchers also incorporated up to 19 well-established data augmentation techniques commonly used in audio classification. This included the integration of various noise samples and non-bird audio elements, which significantly improved the model's performance. The use of data augmentation techniques can help improve the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

Additionally, the researchers used a pretraining approach, where they fine-tuned their ViT models using ImageNet-based weights. This can help the model learn general features that can be applied to a wide range of tasks, including the classification of birdsong.

Overall, while the text does not provide information on cross-validation or stratified splitting, the use of a diverse dataset, data augmentation techniques, and pretraining approach suggest that the researchers took measures to improve the generalizability of their deep learning models.
