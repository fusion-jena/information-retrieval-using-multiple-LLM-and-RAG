Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate and optimizer. The context only mentions that the number of trees in the Random Forest (RF) model was set to 500 as an additional parameter, but it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used in the other models, including any deep learning models. In fact, the context does not even mention the use of a deep learning model. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
