Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It only mentions the use of deep learning strategies, such as neural networks, in a few studies (e.g., Cazau et al., 2023), but does not provide information on the hardware resources used for training these models.
