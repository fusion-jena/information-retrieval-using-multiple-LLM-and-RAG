Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The text primarily focuses on the application of deep-learning methods for classification in entomology, specifically for insect classification, and discusses the challenges and limitations of working with unbalanced datasets. It also presents the results of training and validating different models on the TLm dataset. However, it does not provide information on how the raw data was collected. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
