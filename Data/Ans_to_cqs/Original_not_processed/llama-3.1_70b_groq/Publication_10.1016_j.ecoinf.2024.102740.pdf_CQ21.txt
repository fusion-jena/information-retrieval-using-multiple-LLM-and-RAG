Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the training process of a Random Forest (RF) model using QGIS software and SAGA software, and the tuning of hyperparameters for the RF model. It also mentions the use of out-of-bag (OOB) samples for validation, but it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps after model training. Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved in this case.
