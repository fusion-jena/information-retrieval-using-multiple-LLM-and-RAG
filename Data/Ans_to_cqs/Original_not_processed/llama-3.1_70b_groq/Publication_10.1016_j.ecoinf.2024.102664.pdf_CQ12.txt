Answer: 

The study utilizes three types of deep learning models: CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), and a hybrid CNN-LSTM model. The CNN model is used for image input, while the LSTM model is used for sequence input. The hybrid CNN-LSTM model combines the strengths of both CNN and LSTM networks.
