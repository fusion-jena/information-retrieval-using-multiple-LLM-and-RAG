I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about model training, postprocessing steps, saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context appears to be related to bivalve ecology, aquaculture, and bioenergetic modeling, and does not seem to be relevant to machine learning or model training. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
