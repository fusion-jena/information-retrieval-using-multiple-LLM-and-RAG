Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly state the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that the model score reached its maximum after approximately 5000 iterations, and the loss function reached its minimum value. This suggests that the training process was stopped when the model's performance, as measured by the loss function and model score, converged or reached a satisfactory level.
