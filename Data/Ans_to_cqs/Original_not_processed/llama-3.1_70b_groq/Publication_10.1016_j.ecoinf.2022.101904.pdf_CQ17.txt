Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the proposed 3D UNet Generative Adversarial Network Swin Transformer (3DUNetGSFormer) for wetland mapping, the use of transformers in computer vision and remote sensing, and the results of the proposed deep model.

However, it does mention the use of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to synthesize wetland training data, which can help alleviate the problem of imbalanced data. But it does not provide information on regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization.

Therefore, I do not know the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, as this information is not provided in the context.
