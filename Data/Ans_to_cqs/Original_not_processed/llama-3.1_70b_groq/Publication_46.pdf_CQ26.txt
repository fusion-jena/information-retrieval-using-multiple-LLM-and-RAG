Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on explaining the concepts of pooling layers, convolution operations, and their applications in deep learning. It also includes references to various research papers and articles, but none of them seem to address the issue of data bias.

However, I can provide some general information on the techniques you mentioned. Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection are indeed techniques used to address data bias in machine learning pipelines. Stratified splitting involves splitting the data into subsets based on the class labels to ensure that each subset has a similar proportion of samples from each class. Oversampling involves creating additional copies of the minority class samples to balance the dataset, while undersampling involves reducing the number of majority class samples. Diverse data collection involves collecting data from diverse sources to ensure that the dataset is representative of the population.

Unfortunately, I couldn't find any specific information on these techniques in the provided context. If you have any further questions or need more information on these techniques, I'd be happy to help.
