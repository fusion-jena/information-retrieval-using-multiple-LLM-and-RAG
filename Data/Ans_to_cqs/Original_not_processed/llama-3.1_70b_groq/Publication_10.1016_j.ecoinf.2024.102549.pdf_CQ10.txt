Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention a code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper or academic text that discusses the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for water quality classification and algal bloom prediction, but it does not provide a link to a code repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
