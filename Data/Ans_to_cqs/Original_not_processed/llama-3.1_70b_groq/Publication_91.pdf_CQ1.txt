Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of multispectral imaging flow cytometry for collecting images of pollen grains. This suggests that the raw data may have been collected using a combination of imaging and flow cytometry techniques. 

Additionally, the context mentions the use of fluorescence microscopy of pollen and spores as a tool for investigating environmental change, which may also be a method used for collecting raw data. However, it is not clear if this method was used in the specific study mentioned in the context.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions a dataset of 426,876 images, but it does not provide information on how these images were collected. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query based on the provided context.
