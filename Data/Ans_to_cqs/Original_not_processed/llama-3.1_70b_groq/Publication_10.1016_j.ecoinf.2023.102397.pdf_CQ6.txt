Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on the application of deep learning models to species distribution modeling and bird acoustic data analysis, but it does not provide information on the specific preprocessing steps used.

However, it does mention that the authors "optimized a recognizer via automated and manual processes" and that they "created eight different subsets of recordings" for training and testing. This suggests that some form of data preprocessing may have been involved, but the specific steps are not specified.

Therefore, I must say that I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model in this context.
