Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on species distribution models (SDMs) and the use of a multi-species neural network model for ecological informatics. The dataset mentioned in Section 3.4 is not specified by name, and the context does not provide information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
