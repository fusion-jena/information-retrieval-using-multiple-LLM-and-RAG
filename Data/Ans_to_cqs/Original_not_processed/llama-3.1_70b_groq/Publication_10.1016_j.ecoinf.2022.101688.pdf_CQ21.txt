Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the post-processing steps involved after model training. The context primarily discusses the pre-processing hyper-parameters for each dataset, the concept of transfer learning, and the challenges of creating and utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in bioacoustics research. It does not provide information on the specific post-processing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
