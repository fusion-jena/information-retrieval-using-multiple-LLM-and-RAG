Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention anything about model training, postprocessing steps, saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices. The context appears to be related to ecological corridors, species migration, and habitat maintenance, with discussions on scenario planning, ecological barriers, and disturbance points.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it seems unrelated to the provided context.
