Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context appears to be related to the evaluation of different machine learning methods for species distribution modeling, including the impact of sample size and bias correction on model performance. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance is monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
