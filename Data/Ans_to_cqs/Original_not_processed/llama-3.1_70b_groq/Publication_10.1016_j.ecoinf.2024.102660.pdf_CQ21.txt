Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The text primarily focuses on the data acquisition and processing, network structure, parameter setting, and evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance.

However, it does mention the evaluation metrics used to assess the model's effectiveness, which include Accuracy (A), Precision (P), Recall (R), F1-score (F1), and Intersection over Union (IOU). These metrics are likely calculated after the model training to evaluate its performance on the test dataset.

Additionally, the text mentions the use of a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) mechanism during the decoding stage, which is part of the model architecture. However, this is not a postprocessing step, but rather a component of the model itself.

Regarding saliency maps and confusion matrices, there is no mention of these in the provided context. Therefore, I do not know if these were used as part of the postprocessing steps or not.
