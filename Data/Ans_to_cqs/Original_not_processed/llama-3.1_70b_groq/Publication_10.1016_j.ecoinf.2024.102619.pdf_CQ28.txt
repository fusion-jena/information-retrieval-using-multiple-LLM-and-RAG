Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It mentions the use of PyTorch, scikit-learn, and skorch libraries for building and training the model, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. The context only mentions that documentation for the entire machine learning pipeline can be found at the PyTorch, scikit-learn, and skorch websites, but it does not provide information about the deployment environment.
