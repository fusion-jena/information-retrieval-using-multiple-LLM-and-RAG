Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention anything about deep learning pipelines or strategies for handling randomness in such pipelines. The context appears to be related to landscape ecology, spatial analysis, and conservation, with discussions on patch distribution, landscape metrics, and clustering. There is no mention of deep learning or randomness in the context.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not related to the provided context.
