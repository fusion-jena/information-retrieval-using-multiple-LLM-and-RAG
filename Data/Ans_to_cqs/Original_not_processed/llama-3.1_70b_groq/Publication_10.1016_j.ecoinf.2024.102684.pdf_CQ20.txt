Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. The text only discusses the hyperparameter search, model architecture, and evaluation methods, but does not provide information about the computational resources used for training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
