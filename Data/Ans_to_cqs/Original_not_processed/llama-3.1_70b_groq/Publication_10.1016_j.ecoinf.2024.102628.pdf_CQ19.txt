Answer:::
The framework used to build the deep learning model is fast.ai. According to the text, "We utilized the pretrained ResNet-34 ... inside the fast.ai framework (Howard and Gugger, 2020) to leverage existing knowledge, this is particularly useful in our dataset since its small size." This indicates that the fast.ai framework is used to build and train the deep learning model, specifically a variant of the ResNet architecture. There is no mention of TensorFlow or PyTorch being used in the provided context.
