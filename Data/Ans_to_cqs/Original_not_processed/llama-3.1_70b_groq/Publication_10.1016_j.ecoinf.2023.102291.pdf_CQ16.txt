Answer:::

The text does not explicitly state the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions that the most suitable architecture was chosen based on the best validation accuracy (proportion of all correct predictions) and precision (number of true positives divided by true positives and false positives) obtained during training. This suggests that the model's performance on the validation set is being monitored during training, and the training process may be stopped when the model's performance on the validation set stops improving. However, the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau, are not specified in the text.
