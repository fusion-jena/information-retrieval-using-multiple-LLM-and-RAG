Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on environmental mapping, machine learning, and geostatistics, with references to various research papers and data sources. However, it does not provide information on the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline.

The context does mention the use of spatially exhaustive Earth observation imagery, climatic data, and terrain variables derived from digital elevation models as predictors in machine learning approaches. This suggests that the data formats used may include raster or satellite imagery, as well as CSV or other tabular formats for the climatic and terrain data. However, this is only a speculative inference and not a definitive answer.

Therefore, I must conclude that I don't know the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
