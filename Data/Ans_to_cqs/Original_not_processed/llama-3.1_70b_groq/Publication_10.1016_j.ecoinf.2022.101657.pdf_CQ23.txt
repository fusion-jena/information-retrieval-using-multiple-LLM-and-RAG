Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model was trained using the WCS dataset and its recommended data split, which suggests that some form of data splitting was used. Additionally, the model was pre-trained on the MS-COCO dataset, which is a large and diverse dataset, suggesting that the model was exposed to a wide range of images and scenarios. However, it is not clear if cross-validation or stratified splitting were used specifically to ensure generalizability.
