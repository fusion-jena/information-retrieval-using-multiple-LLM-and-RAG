Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the workflow, challenges, and data availability related to the deep learning models for semantic segmentation and object detection, but it does not delve into the details of optimization techniques used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
