Answer: GPUs. According to the provided context, "In deep learning, long audio files are usually divided into shorter chunks (with fixed durations of e.g. 3 or 10 s), so that a whole batch can fit inside the limited memory of GPUs." This indicates that GPUs are used for training the deep learning model. There is no mention of TPUs or other hardware resources in the provided context.
