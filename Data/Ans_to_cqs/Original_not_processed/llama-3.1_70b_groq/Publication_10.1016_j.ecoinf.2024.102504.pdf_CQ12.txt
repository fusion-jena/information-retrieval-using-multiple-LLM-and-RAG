Answer: 
Based on the provided context, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory). This is mentioned in the context as "LSTM deep learning model" in the following sentence: "Gokul et al. (2023) studied PM2.5 prediction for Hyderabad city using various machine learning models and found that the LSTM deep learning model outperformed others with an R2 value of 0.89 and a MAE". Additionally, another context mentions "Predicting air quality with deep learning LSTM: Towards comprehensive models" which also suggests the use of LSTM in the pipeline.
