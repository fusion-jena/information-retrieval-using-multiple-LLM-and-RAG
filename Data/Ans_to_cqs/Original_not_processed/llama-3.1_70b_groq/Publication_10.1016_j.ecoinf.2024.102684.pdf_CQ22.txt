Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are the root mean squared error (RMSE) and the coefficient of determination (R2). RMSE measures the difference between the actual and predicted values, with values closer to 0 indicating better model predictions. R2 measures the percentage of variation in the response variable explained by the model. These metrics are used to evaluate the model's performance on the training, validation, and test datasets.
