Answer:::

The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the provided context is primarily for object detection and classification, specifically for wildlife surveys and monitoring in remote and Antarctic regions.

Several papers mention the use of deep learning models for detecting and counting animals, such as penguins, seabirds, and kiangs, from aerial imagery and drone footage. For example, Peng et al. (2020) propose a modified Faster R-CNN model for kiang detection in Tibetan plateau, while Xu et al. (2024) review the application of deep learning models for wildlife detection and monitoring.

Other papers focus on the use of deep learning models for image analysis and object detection, such as Witharana and Lynch (2016), who propose an object-based image analysis approach for detecting penguin guano in high-resolution satellite images.

Moreni et al. (2023) discuss the use of mean Average Precision (mAP) to select architectures of pre-trained neural networks for automated aerial animal detection, indicating that the purpose of the deep learning model is to detect and classify animals in aerial imagery.

Overall, the primary purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the context is to automate the process of wildlife detection and monitoring, enabling more efficient and accurate surveys and counts of animal populations in remote and hard-to-reach areas.
