Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a study on mangrove forests, remote sensing, and land use/cover change analysis. It mentions the use of random forest algorithm for land use type classification, but it does not provide information on the specific regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline.

However, one of the references mentioned in the context, Lassalle et al. (2022), is a study on deep learning-based individual tree crown delineation in mangrove forests. While the context does not provide information on the regularization methods used in this study, it is possible that the study itself may discuss the use of regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Unfortunately, without access to the full study, it is not possible to provide a more specific answer.
