Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily uses image data formats. The text mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification and the extraction of underlying abstract features. It also mentions the use of multispectral and panchromatic commercial satellite imagery, which suggests that the pipeline is working with image data.

There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the pipeline. Additionally, while CSV (Comma Separated Values) is a common data format, it is not explicitly mentioned in the context as being used in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it appears that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data.
