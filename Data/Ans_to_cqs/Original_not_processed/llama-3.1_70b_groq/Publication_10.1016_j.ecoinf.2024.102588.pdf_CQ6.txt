Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of batch normalization layers to perform feature generalization of the input mini-batch by calculating the mean and standard deviation. This suggests that some form of normalization is involved in the preprocessing steps.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of an autoencoder, which is an unsupervised learning algorithm that learns an efficient representation of input data. This may involve some form of dimensionality reduction or feature extraction, but it does not provide specific details on preprocessing steps such as scaling or cleaning.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of a dropout layer to reduce overfitting, but this is a regularization technique rather than a preprocessing step.

Overall, the provided context does not provide a comprehensive answer to the query, and it is not possible to determine the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model based on the information provided.
