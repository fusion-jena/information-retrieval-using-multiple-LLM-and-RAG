Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It mentions that Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a cloud-based platform that hosts a vast remote sensing data catalog and provides high-performance computing capabilities, but it does not specify the type of hardware resources used for training the model. It only mentions that the platform uses automatic parallel processing, which can take advantage of advanced image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms, but it does not provide information on the specific hardware resources used.
