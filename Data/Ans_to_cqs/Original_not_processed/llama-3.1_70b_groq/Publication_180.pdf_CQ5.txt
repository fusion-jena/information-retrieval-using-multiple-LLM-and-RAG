Answer: 
The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, the context mentions that the system was trained on digital images of triatomine species. Specifically, it was trained on 405 images for Mexican triatomine species and 1,584 images for Brazilian triatomine species. These datasets are used for the task of automated species identification, particularly for the vectors of Chagas disease.
