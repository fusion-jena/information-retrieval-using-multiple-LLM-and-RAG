Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on species distribution modeling (SDM) and the integration of different modeling approaches, including machine learning and Bayesian models. It discusses the challenges of working with biodiversity datasets and the importance of accounting for biases, but it does not delve into the specifics of data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
