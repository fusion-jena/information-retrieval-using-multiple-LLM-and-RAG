Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention that the data used in the research is publicly available via Cornell University's Laboratory of Ornithology and Macaulay Library of Natural Sounds. The context also mentions that the researchers generated 20 spectrograms per species for a new dataset, resulting in a total of 440 spectrograms, to be subjected to identification using the CNN developed in Challenge 1. This suggests that the dataset used is a custom dataset of spectrograms of animal sounds, but the exact name of the dataset is not specified.
