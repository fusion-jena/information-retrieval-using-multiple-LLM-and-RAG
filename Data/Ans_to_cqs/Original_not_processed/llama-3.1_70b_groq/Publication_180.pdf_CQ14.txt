Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the authors considered two factors to find the optimum for training TensorFlow: correct identification rate and processing time. They also mention that they calibrated their models for Mexican and Brazilian species using different numbers of training steps, and found that 2,000 emerged as an optimum number of training steps for the Mexican dataset. However, it does not provide information on whether they used grid search, random search, or any other method to optimize the hyperparameters.
