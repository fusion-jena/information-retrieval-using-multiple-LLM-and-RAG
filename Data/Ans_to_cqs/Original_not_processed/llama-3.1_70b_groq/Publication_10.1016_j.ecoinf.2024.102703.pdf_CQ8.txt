Answer: I don't know.

The provided context appears to be a collection of academic papers and research articles related to environmental science, ecology, and water quality. There is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. The context seems to be focused on the study of dissolved organic matter, phytoplankton, and water quality in various lakes and rivers in China. Therefore, I couldn't find any information about a code repository or a deep learning pipeline.
