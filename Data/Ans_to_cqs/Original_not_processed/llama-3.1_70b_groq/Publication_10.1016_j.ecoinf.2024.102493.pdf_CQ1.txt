Answer:::
The provided context does not specifically mention the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of remote sensing products, specifically the MOD13A2 dataset from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, to acquire NDVI data. This suggests that satellite imagery is one of the data sources used in the study. Additionally, the context mentions the use of a digital elevation model (DEM) data, which is likely obtained from a public dataset or a geographic information system (GIS) database. It also mentions the use of nighttime light data, population density data, and road distance data, but the specific methods used to collect these data are not mentioned.
