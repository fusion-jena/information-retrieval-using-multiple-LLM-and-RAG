Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention the process of creating training data for the PCF, which includes extracting grid cells with a resolution of 2560 m, randomly extracting cells as masks for training and validation data, and preparing input data for model training by extracting PSI from these cells.

Additionally, the context mentions that the U-Net model was trained using both training and validation data, and classification was performed based on these data. However, it does not provide information on any preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning that may have been performed on the data before training the model.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model.
