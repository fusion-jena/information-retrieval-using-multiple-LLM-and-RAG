The text does not mention the deployment platform of the deep learning model. It only describes the experimental environment used for conducting the experiments, which includes a laptop with an AMD Ryzen 7 5800H processor, an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 Ti laptop GPU, and the Windows 10 Enterprise operating system. It does not provide information on whether the model was deployed on a cloud platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.
