Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning methodologies to underwater fish video processing, the use of gradient boosting and XGBoost, and the development of novel deep learning networks for semi-supervised contrastive learning and weakly-supervised learning. It does not discuss randomness or strategies for handling it in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
