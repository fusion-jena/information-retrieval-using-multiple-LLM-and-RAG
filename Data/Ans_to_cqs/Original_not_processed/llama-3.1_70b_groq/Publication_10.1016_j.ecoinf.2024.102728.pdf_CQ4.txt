Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be focused on object retrieval with deep convolutional networks, ecology, and land cover classification, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions the use of deep convolutional networks, which often employ data augmentation techniques to improve model performance. But without explicit information, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.

If you're looking for information on data augmentation techniques, I can suggest that common techniques used in deep learning pipelines include random cropping, flipping, rotation, scaling, color jittering, and normalization. However, this information is not derived from the provided context.
