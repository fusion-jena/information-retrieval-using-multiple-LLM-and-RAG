Answer: I don't know.

The provided context mentions that employing various modeling techniques such as artificial neural networks, deep learning, and logistic regression can further contribute to refining fire risk maps. However, it does not specify the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It only mentions that Nguyen et al. (2018) employed a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network, which is a type of neural network, but it does not provide information about the specific type of deep learning model used.
