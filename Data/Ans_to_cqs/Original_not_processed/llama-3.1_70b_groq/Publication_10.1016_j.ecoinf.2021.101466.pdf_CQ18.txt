Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the authors used a validation set, which is a common practice in machine learning to monitor the model's performance during training. Specifically, it is stated that "We used 80% of the 4000 images for training and the remaining 20% for validation." This suggests that the authors used the validation set to evaluate the model's performance during training, but the exact strategy or metrics used to monitor the performance are not specified.
