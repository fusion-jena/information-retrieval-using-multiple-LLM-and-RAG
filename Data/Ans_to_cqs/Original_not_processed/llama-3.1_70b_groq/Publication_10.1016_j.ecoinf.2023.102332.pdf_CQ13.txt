Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context primarily focuses on the use of word embeddings, latent semantic analysis, and other natural language processing techniques, but it does not delve into the details of the deep learning model's architecture or hyperparameters.

However, it does mention the use of the BERT model, which is a pre-trained language model developed by Devlin et al. (2018). The BERT model uses a multi-layer bidirectional transformer encoder, but the specific hyperparameters used in the model are not mentioned in the provided context.

If you are looking for information on the hyperparameters used in the BERT model, you may need to refer to the original paper by Devlin et al. (2018) or other resources that provide more detailed information on the model's architecture and training parameters.
