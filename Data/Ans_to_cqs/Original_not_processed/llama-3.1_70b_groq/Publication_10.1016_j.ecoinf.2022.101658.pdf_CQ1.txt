Answer:

The methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Field measurements: Field measurements were collected at three field sites: Pelican Mountain (PM), Calling Lake (CL), and Conklin (CK).
2. Ground photographs: Nadir photographs were taken using smartphones, and exposure settings could potentially be used to standardize images.
3. Manual classification of fuel types: Manual classification of fuel types was used for training and testing the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) semantic segmentation algorithm.
4. Public datasets: The study mentions the potential use of public datasets, such as those from citizen science programs like iNaturalist, NoiseTube, and Secchi.

Additionally, the study suggests that crowd-sourcing can be used to collect ground cover observations in large quantities, exceeding those of research programs that rely solely on trained professionals.
