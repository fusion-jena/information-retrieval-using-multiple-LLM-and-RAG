Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a study on land use and land cover classification using machine learning, but it does not specifically discuss the deep learning pipeline or regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
