Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a model (not specifically a deep learning model) include:

1. Radiometric calibration
2. Atmospheric correction
3. Geometric correction
4. Image cropping

These steps are mentioned in the context as part of the preprocessing of GF-6 remote sensing data. However, it is not explicitly stated that these steps are specific to deep learning models. Additionally, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models such as normalization and scaling are not mentioned in the provided context.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of CART and RFR models, but not deep learning models specifically. Therefore, the answer to the query is based on the general preprocessing steps mentioned in the context, but may not be directly applicable to deep learning models.
