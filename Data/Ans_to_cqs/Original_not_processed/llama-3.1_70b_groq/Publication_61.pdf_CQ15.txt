Answer:::
The optimization technique applied in the deep learning pipeline is the Adam optimizer, which is a variant of the stochastic gradient optimization. This optimizer is used to adjust the learning rate automatically, helping to mitigate the issue of manually setting the learning rate. The Adam optimizer is specifically mentioned as being used in conjunction with a learning rate of 0.01, number of epochs 150, and batch size 2500.
