Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the proposed framework, the hardware specifications, and the evaluation of the scalability performance of the REVIS system. It also discusses the use of machine-learning methods for evaluating and calibrating a low-cost particle sensor, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
