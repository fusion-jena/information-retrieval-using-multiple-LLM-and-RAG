Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only mentions that a deep learning approach (convolutional neural networks) was used to derive the high-resolution CHM of the Earth (Lang10m) at 10 m resolution using Sentinel-2 optical images. It also mentions that Lang10m was derived fusing the GEDI and Sentinel-2 images through a deep convolutional neural network (Lang et al., 2022), but it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
