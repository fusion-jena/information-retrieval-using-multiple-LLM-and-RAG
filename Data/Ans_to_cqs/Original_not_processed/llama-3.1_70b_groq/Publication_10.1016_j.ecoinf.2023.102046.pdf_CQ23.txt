Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that dataset imbalance was dealt with by including class weights in the cross-entropy loss function, which suggests that the authors were aware of the importance of handling class imbalance in the dataset.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model with the smallest validation loss was used for evaluation on the test set, which implies that some form of validation was performed during the training process. However, it does not provide further details on the validation strategy used.

Therefore, while we can infer that some measures were taken to address dataset imbalance, we do not have enough information to determine the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
