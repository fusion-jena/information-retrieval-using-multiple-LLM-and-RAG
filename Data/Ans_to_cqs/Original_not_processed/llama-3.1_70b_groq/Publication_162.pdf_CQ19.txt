Answer: 
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. It mentions the use of a feature fusion module, convolutional layers, and the Microsoft COCO dataset, but it does not provide information about the frameworks used to implement these components. Therefore, I do not know which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model.
