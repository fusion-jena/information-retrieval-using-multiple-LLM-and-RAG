Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention a few techniques that can contribute to improving the model's generalization capability.

The context mentions the use of Local Response Normalization (LRN) after the pooling layer, which can help improve the generalization of the model by enhancing the larger response values and reducing the smaller ones.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a dropout layer (Tenth layer) which is used to improve the generalization capability of the model. Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly drops out neurons during training, which can help prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.

Overall, while the context does not provide a comprehensive list of measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model, it does mention a few techniques that can contribute to improving the model's generalization capability.
