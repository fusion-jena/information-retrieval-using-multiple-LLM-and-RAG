Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be focused on the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm, a type of unsupervised neural network, and its application to clustering and regional zoning. It also mentions Support Vector Machines (SVM) and their limitations in handling large sample datasets. However, it does not provide information on optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
