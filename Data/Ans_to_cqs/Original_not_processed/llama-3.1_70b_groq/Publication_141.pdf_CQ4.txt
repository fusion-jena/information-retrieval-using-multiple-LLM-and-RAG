Answer:::
The data augmentation technique applied in the deep learning pipeline, as mentioned in the provided context, is randomly deforming input images in each training cycle. This is done due to the small sample size of the dataset. However, the specific techniques used for deforming the images, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling, are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
