Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for image classification and object detection tasks in the field of entomology.

However, it can be inferred that the raw data used in the deep learning pipeline consists of images, as the context mentions the use of imagery data and the training of CNN models on large image datasets. The context also mentions the use of images with specific resolutions (640 × 640 pixels and 1280 × 1280 pixels) for training, validation, and testing sets.

But, the methods used for collecting these images, such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets, are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
