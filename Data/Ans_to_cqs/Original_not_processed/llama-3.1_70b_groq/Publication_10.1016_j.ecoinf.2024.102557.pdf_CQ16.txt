Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that model hyperparameters were tuned using Bayesian optimization focused on reducing the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the predictions based on environmental cross-validation with ten folds. This suggests that the training process may be evaluated based on the model's predictive accuracy, but the specific criteria for determining when training is complete are not specified.
