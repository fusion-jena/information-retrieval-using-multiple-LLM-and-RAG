Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on cross-validation techniques, model evaluation, and performance metrics in various domains, including environmental modeling and waste management.

However, it does mention that overfitting and underfitting are concerns when dealing with limited datasets, and cross-validation is a valuable technique for addressing these issues. But it does not provide information on specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to this query based on the provided context.
