Answer:

According to the provided context, the bird song dataset was split into training, validation, and testing datasets using the following criteria:

* 70% of the downloaded recordings were randomly selected for the training dataset.
* The remaining 30% of the recordings were kept for testing.
* Data augmentation was applied only to the training dataset.
* The segments obtained from data augmentation were randomly distributed between the training and validation sets with a ratio of 0.8/0.2.

This means that 80% of the augmented training data was used for training and 20% was used for validation. The testing dataset was not augmented and consisted of the remaining 30% of the original recordings.

It's worth noting that the context does not provide information on the specific criteria used to split the data, such as stratification or random sampling. However, it does mention that the split was done randomly, which suggests that random sampling was used.
