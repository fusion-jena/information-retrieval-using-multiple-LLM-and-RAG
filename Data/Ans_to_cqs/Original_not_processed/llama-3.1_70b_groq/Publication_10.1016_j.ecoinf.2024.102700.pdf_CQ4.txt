Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The text only mentions that deep learning strategies, including neural networks, were used in some studies (e.g., Cazau et al., 2023), but it does not provide details on the specific techniques used for data augmentation.
