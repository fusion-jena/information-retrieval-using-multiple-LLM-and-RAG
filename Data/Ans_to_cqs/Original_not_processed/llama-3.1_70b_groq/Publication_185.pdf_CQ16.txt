Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that "training was stopped after 6900 iterations." This suggests that the training process was stopped based on a fixed number of iterations, rather than a specific performance metric or convergence criterion.
