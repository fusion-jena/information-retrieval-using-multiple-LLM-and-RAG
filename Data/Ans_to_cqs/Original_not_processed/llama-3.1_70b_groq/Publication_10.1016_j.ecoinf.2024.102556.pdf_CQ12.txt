Answer:::
The text mentions the use of a residual network structured with Res2Net modules and group convolution, which is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, it mentions the use of convolutional layers, such as 1 × 1 convolutional kernels and 3 × 3 convolutional kernels, which are typical components of CNNs. Additionally, it mentions the use of other CNN-based components, such as the Conv+BatchNorm+SiLU integration module (CBS), Efficient Layer Aggregation Networks (ELAN), and Hybrid Convolutional (MPConv) layers. There is no mention of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers in the provided text.
