Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention anything about hyperparameter optimization or model training. The context appears to be related to biodiversity analysis, specifically discussing the evaluation of biodiversity macropatterns using different grid sizes (R1, R5, R10) and the classification of cells into different categories (NR, IR, L, M, H) based on species richness. There is no mention of machine learning models or hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.
