Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on Automated Machine Learning (AutoML), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and traditional machine learning models like Random Forest and XGBoost.

However, it does mention the use of bootstrap aggregating or bagging in Random Forest models, which involves generating multiple individual decision tree models by utilizing different subsets of the training dataset. This technique can help reduce the impact of randomness in the model, but it is not directly related to setting a random seed value.

In general, setting a random seed value is a common strategy to ensure reproducibility in machine learning experiments. By setting a fixed seed value, the randomness in the model can be controlled, and the results can be replicated. However, this specific strategy is not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
