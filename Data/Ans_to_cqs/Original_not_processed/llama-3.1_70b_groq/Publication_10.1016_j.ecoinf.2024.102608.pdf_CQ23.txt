Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the study used a randomized grid search method to explore the parameter space, which can help reduce the risk of overfitting. Additionally, the study's main research objectives include demonstrating the effectiveness of the machine learning models, which may imply that the study aimed to ensure the generalizability of the models.

However, the context does not provide information on whether the study used a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question based on the provided context.
