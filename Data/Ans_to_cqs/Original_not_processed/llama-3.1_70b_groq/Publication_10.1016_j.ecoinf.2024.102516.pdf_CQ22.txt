Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are Mean Scaled Absolute Error (MSAE), Intersection over Union (IoU) for plants, and DCA-Procrustes-Correlation (DPC). These metrics are used to compare the different model setups and evaluate their performance on the datasets.
