Answer:::

The purpose of the deep learning model in the provided context is primarily semantic segmentation. The HRNet model is employed for this task, which effectively performs semantic segmentation by simultaneously merging high-resolution and low-resolution convolution computations. This model is used to process social media image data and derive various indicators such as greenness, blueness, and sky openness index.

Additionally, the LSTM-CNN model is used for sentiment analysis, which is a classification task. This model is employed to determine the sentiment index of text data.

There is no mention of object detection in the provided context. The focus is on image segmentation and text classification.
