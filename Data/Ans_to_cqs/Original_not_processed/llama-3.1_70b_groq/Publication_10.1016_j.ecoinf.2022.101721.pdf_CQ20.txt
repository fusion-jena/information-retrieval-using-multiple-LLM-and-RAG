Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses the use of machine learning for species identification, particularly for bats, and mentions the importance of including all observations in statistical modeling and implementing Bayesian algorithms. However, it does not provide information on the hardware resources used for training the model.
