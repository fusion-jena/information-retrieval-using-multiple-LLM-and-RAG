Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily discusses the model evaluation process, including the sensitivity study, within-site and cross-site experiments, and transfer learning. It also presents some results, including evaluation plots, but does not delve into the specifics of postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
