Answer:

To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the datasets were randomly divided into three parts for training, validation, and testing. Specifically, 60% of the data was used to train the deep learning models, 20% was kept to validate the models, and the remaining 20% was used to evaluate the performance of the models. This splitting of the dataset helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the model is not biased towards the training data.

Additionally, the use of a weighted majority voting technique to predict the class label of an image from the predicted labels of its patches can also help to improve the generalizability of the model. This technique allows the model to consider the predictions of multiple patches and make a more informed decision, which can help to reduce the impact of any biases in the individual patches.

However, it is not clear from the provided context whether the dataset is diverse or whether cross-validation or stratified splitting were used. Therefore, I do not know if these specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
