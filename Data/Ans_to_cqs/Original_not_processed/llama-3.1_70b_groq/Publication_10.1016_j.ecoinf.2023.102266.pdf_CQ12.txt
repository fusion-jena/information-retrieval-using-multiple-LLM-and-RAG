Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. It mentions the use of machine learning tools to improve the model by modifying the update criterion and making it differentiable, but it does not specify the type of deep learning model used. The context appears to be focused on a cellular automaton model, and the machine learning aspect is mentioned as a future direction for improvement, but the details of the specific model used are not provided.
